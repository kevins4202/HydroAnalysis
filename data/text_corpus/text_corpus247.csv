1235,the remediation of dnapl contaminated soil with lower density fluids is ineffective due to the over riding of displacing fluid the densification of biopolymers is experimentally studied to develop a solution with the same density as a pollutant polymer solutions and contaminants are characterized through rheometer a 1d column filled with monodisperse glass beads was used to measure their apparent viscosity in porous media the displacement of pollutants by biopolymers such as xanthan gum guar gum and carboxymethyl cellulose and densified solutions based on barite are investigated in the 1d porous column in addition the polymer solution flow is studied using an upscaling method based on the shear viscosity measured with rheometer the upscaling results are compared with the 1d column experimental outcomes we found that carboxymethyl cellulose is the best for densifying polymer and showed the highest remediation yield for dnapl remediation the polymers rheology was represented well through the carreau rheological model the discrepancy of apparent viscosity in porous media from polymers shear viscosity measured with rheometer is explained by the adsorption of polymers on pore surfaces and deposition of barite particles in a porous medium which led to a decrease in permeability the upscaling results are in good agreement with experimental outcomes at low pressure gradients the impact of porous media geometry on polymer flow in porous media is described keywords soil remediation porous media polymer barite densification upscaling data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction contamination of soils and aquifers by non aqueous phase liquids napls is one of the common problems of industrial wastes which are slightly water soluble mixtures of chemicals napls can be spilled during industrial accidents and seep by gravity into the soil and reach the groundwater it then dissipates in the aquifer thereby causing a danger to a source of drinking water and harming living organisms in soil and water therefore remediation of napl contaminated soils is critical to avoid possible consequences for public health and environmental concerns napls lighter than water e g many petroleum chemicals such as benzene toluene xylene etc are called light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls and those heavier than water e g chlorinated solvents coal tar are named dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls huntley and beckett 2002 mercer and cohen 1990 pankow and cherry 1996 the most widely used technology for the recovery of dnapl is the pump treatment pt method which is generally not very efficient rarely exceeding 60 recovery expensive and time consuming colombano et al 2021 colombano et al 2020a 2020b itrc 2002 stroo et al 2012 one of the recent advancing in situ soil flushing technologies is based on non newtonian fluids injection such as aqueous foams hirasaki et al 1997 mulligan and eftekhari 2003 omirbekov et al 2022 omirbekov et al 2020a and polymers forey et al 2020 martel et al 2004 either bio based e g xanthan and guar gums or synthetic polymers e g hydrolyzed polyacrylamide inspired by a well known experience in enhanced oil recovery eor technologies that increase the overall sweep efficiency lake 1989 however it must be adapted to the very restrictive context of polluted soils the surrounding areas are unconsolidated soils and do not allow for very high superimposed injection pressures heterogeneities in soils and aquifers reduce the sweep efficiency of flushing solutions by producing preferential flow paths by leaving major non swept areas in low permeability zones specifically the front stability considering horizontal propagation in porous media depends on at least two issues the first factor concerns the inclination angle of the front that relies on gravity override between displacing and resident fluids this causes premature breakthroughs of the displacing fluid resulting in poor sweep efficiency the second issue is the instability caused by the fingering induced by the viscous contrast between the bulk of the displacing and resident fluids grubb and sitar 1999 these instabilities occur when water is commonly used to displace a more viscous fluid the viscosity ratio mr is the crucial parameter for analyzing the sweep efficiency of low permeability zones which is the ratio of the resident fluid effective viscosity μr to the displacing fluid effective viscosity μd when the μr is more viscous than the displacing fluid μd the displacement is considered unstable and when mr 1 the displacement is considered to be stable fanchi 2010 therefore the use of water soluble polymer increases the viscosity of the displacing fluids thereby eliminating the fingering issue giese and powers 2002 martel et al 1998 2004 robert et al 2006 aqueous polymer solutions e g hydrolyzed polyacrylamides xanthan guar carboxymethyl cellulose are used for their viscous and shear thinning properties to improve porous media s sweeping thomas 2008 when non newtonian rheology effects are incorporated into the flow field calculation it is anticipated that the flow field will vary and the correlations between flow and shear rate will also change the shear thinning fluid is expected to have higher viscosity at low shear rate regions i e lower flow velocities and expected to have low viscosity in areas with high shear rates i e higher flow velocities this expected behavior shear thinning is likely to occur below a certain flow rate which expressed in terms of the reynolds number re depends on the porous medium and the polymer concentration but can be much lower than 1 above this threshold non linear relationships between flow and pressure gradient are often observed due to a non negligible extension thickening behavior azad and trivedi 2020 groisman and steinberg 2000 ibezim et al 2021 marshall and metzner 1967 mokhtari et al 2022 martel et al 1998 studied the sweeping efficiency of polymer solution in a sandbox by reproducing a simple heterogeneous porous media with layers of sand that have different permeabilities xanthan gum was used as a polymer solution without any additives they established that the xanthan gum solution increases the sweeping efficiency and eliminates the viscous fingering at the polymer solution front kostarelos et al 1998 used a mixed solution sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate sodium chloride isopropanol and xanthan to effectively remediate sand polluted with trichloroethylene gauthier and kueper 2006 used a mixture of n propanol xanthan ethanol to treat soils polluted by polychloropiphenyls the remediation yield was 95 gauthier and kueper 2006 robert et al 2006 conducted experiments through a 2d aquifer model where xanthan gum polymer with surfactant was used for flushing the trichloroethylene tce a mixture of xanthan and a surfactant solution allowed them to recover 95 they observed the efficiency of polymer floods in heterogeneous systems moreover a better contact between surfactant polymer solution and tce ganglia was reported several studies also showed that the polymer solutions based on xanthan could improve the sweeping efficiency of heterogeneous porous media up to 90 in laboratory experiments silva et al 2013 silva et al 2012 in field cases authors compared the injection of a passive tracer transported either in water or in xanthan solution into a heterogenous soil truex et al 2015 they found that the tracer carried by xanthan occupied 69 of the control area compared with only 49 with water at the end of the injection thus the polymer solution accesses more areas and ensures a more homogeneous spatial distribution of the transported solute most laboratory studies were carried out in closed systems e g micromodels sandboxes where the boundaries were limited by the walls of the installations thereby eliminating the influence of gravity in real cases it should be noted that gravity influences the inclination angle of the displacement front which is noticeable in highly permeable porous media such as aquifers cochennec et al 2022 several studies have assumed the impact of density under several landfill sites macfarlane et al 1983 zhong et al 2008 several petroleum engineering studies showed displacement inefficiency in gravity over ride and under ride cases e g craig jr et al 1957 crane et al 1963 in soil remediation density over riding and under riding were observed in several studies for instance the density over riding phenomenon was noticed when water was displaced with a less dense solvent jawitz et al 1998 when ethanol surfactant solutions were injected to remediate perchloroethylene pce taylor et al 2004 and trichloroethene tce grubb and sitar 1999 contaminated soil these gravity effects can be minimized or neglected when the displacing and resident fluids have similar densities as indicated by many researchers gatlin and slobod 1960 morrow et al 1988 offeringa and van der poel 1954 sievert et al 1958 taber and meyer 1964 consequently the density and viscosity of the displacing fluid play a crucial role in displacing the resident fluid however the polymer solution flow in a rheometer significantly differs from the flow through a porous medium afolabi et al 2019 omirbekov et al 2020b shende et al 2021 two main reasons may affect i adsorption and mechanical retention of the polymer changes the porous media geometry i e permeability satken 2021 ii extension thickening behavior is non negligible leading to elastic turbulence that may be due to a positive feedback between stretching of the polymer molecules and the flow azad and trivedi 2020 groisman and steinberg 2000 or because of the impact of the high polymeric stress zone birefringent strands on the flow pattern mokhtari et al 2022 apparent polymer viscosity in porous media is commonly described through darcy s law in the literature berg and van wunnik 2017 chevalier et al 2013 rodríguez de castro et al 2020 rodríguez de castro et al 2019 sorbie 2013 which is usually measured by conducting core flood experiments the apparent viscosity of polymer solution in porous media depends on the rheology of fluid polymer degradation due to chemical and mechanical forces inaccessible pores and adsorption of polymers on pore surfaces therefore darcy viscosity shows a shift in viscosity profile compared to shear viscosity measured using a rheometer and α shift factor is used for correlating the shear rate with the darcy viscosity zamani et al 2017 most authors presented α shift factor as a function of fluid rheology and porous medium properties berg and van wunnik 2017 rodríguez de castro and radilla 2016 rodríguez de castro et al 2019 tosco et al 2013 apart from experiments modeling can also help to describe better the flow of a non newtonian fluid such as a shear thinning polymer solution at the darcy scale for example as with newtonian fluid flows upscaling methods can be applied to derive the darcy scale flow equations mathematically upscaling through volume averaging multiscale asymptotics or other methods relies on the scale separation between the scale of the process at hand and the target scale however the nonlinearity induced by the velocity dependent viscosity complicates the process provided that a larger scale model can be derived the final step in the methods is usually to solve a set of boundary value problems on a representative elementary cell to compute the effective parameters of the large scale model few upscaled models have been proposed for non newtonian fluid flows among them khuzhayorov et al 2000 used the multiscale asymptotics method and de haro et al 1996 used the volume averaging method applied to maxwell fluid flows mokhtari et al 2022 recently derived a darcy scale model for olroyd b fluid flows in porous media the authors upscaled model is obtained by the multiscale asymptotics method and is able to reproduce the shear thinning and shear thickening behavior due to the impact of birefringent strands on the flow as discussed previously the darcy scale model derived by orgéas et al 2007 is used in this work as the chosen constitutive relation for viscosity carreau rheological model is the same and the authors have a successful experience in its application omirbekov et al 2020b 2 problem statement and contributions of this work we emphasize that polymer rheology is important for soil remediation in the same way as it is for eor i e better removal efficiency in areas of high contrast permeability and control of viscous fingering however due to the high permeability encountered in soil remediation the effect of gravity can impact the removal efficiency through an undesirable buoyancy effect between the fluids unless the density of the invading fluid and the displaced fluid match this is the main problem addressed in this work this study has two main objectives firstly we aim to study a polymer solution injection with the same density as a resident fluid to our knowledge the soil remediation literature has reported no manipulation of displacing fluid density and viscosity to reduce front instability in order to obtain a stable viscous and dense solution we study several environmentally friendly biopolymers xanthan gum guar gum and carboxymethyl cellulose and micro particles of barite baso4 as a weighting agent barite is considered nontoxic and low soluble in water alamooti et al 2022 schulz et al 2017 since it was commonly used as a weighting agent for all types of drilling fluid in the petroleum industry as a second objective we focus on the characterization of polymer solutions through upscaling methods by solving boundary value problems using different 2d and 3d simple geometries specifically the impact of polymer solution rheology with a weighting agent on porous media property at the darcy scale since the direct upscaling of polymer flow from pore to laboratory scale is complex we used upscaling technique to scale up polymer flow by using the rheological data of bulk polymer as an input the goal is to study whether the polymer flow in porous media can be predicted from its bulk behavior this study focused only on upscaling from pore to laboratory scale investigations we used the upscaling model formed by omirbekov et al 2020b which is detailed in the next section to study the macroscopic behavior of polymer flows it was first necessary to establish the geometry of the representative elementary volume rev corresponding to the permeability of porous media obtained from laboratory experiments therefore we solved the closure problem for the creeping flow of newtonian fluids in steady state developed through the volume averaging method quintard and whitaker 1994 whitaker 1999 to define the permeability of the unit cells the porosity in each unit cell was adjusted to get the same permeability as in the 1d column experiment then we solved the boundary value problem developed using the homogenization method amanbek et al 2019 singh et al 2017 to study macroscopic polymer flow behavior the purpose of the upscaling was to study the effect of different unit cell geometries on polymer flow the one dimensional experiments with a d 0 5 mm monodisperse solid glass beads gbs pack were used to correlate and validate the upscaling results 3 theoretical background 3 1 fluid transport in porous media fluid flow in porous media is commonly characterized through darcy velocity u m s which can be presented as follows darcy 1856 1 u q a k p μl where q m3 s is flow rate a m2 is the cross section surface area of porous media k m2 and p pa are the intrinsic porous media permeability and pressure drop in the direction parallel to length l m μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid which can be expressed by the following simple relation for newtonian liquids 2 μ τ γ in which τ pa and γ 1 s are the shear stress and shear rate respectively if we consider darcy s law applicable to the flow of a non newtonian fluid in a porous medium the influence of the fluid s non linear rheology can be incorporated into the definition of apparent viscosity μ app this apparent viscosity is not an intrinsic fluid property and varies with the flow rate it is a non linear function of the equivalent shear rate given in next eq 3 which can differ depending on the flow rate fluid flow in porous media can be represented as a bundle of capillary tubes according to the first conceptual model kozeny 1927 hence an equivalent wall shear rate γ eq in the porous media can be expressed as darby et al 2001 3 γ eq 4 αu r eq where α is an empirical shift parameter connected with the bulk rheology of the fluid and the tortuosity of porous media the tortuosity of the bead pack is assumed to be 25 12 derived from the blake kozeny equation through a capillary model kozeny 1927 hirasaki and pope 1974 proposed to use α 0 69 for newtonian fluids using the following expression α 1 l l eff in which l and l eff are lengths of equivalent straight capillary tubes and length of the tortuous capillaries respectively hirasaki and pope 1974 rodríguez de castro et al 2019 experimentally found α equal to 0 68 in glass bead packings is the porosity and r eq m is the mean pore throat radius that can be expressed as 4 r eq 8 k fluid flow in porous media is governed by the interaction of viscous gravitational and capillary forces these forces can be characterized using bond number n bo capillary number n ca and viscosity ratios m r that can be defined respectively herring et al 2015 5 n bo ρg d 2 σ 6 n ca μu σ 7 m r μ r μ d in the preceding equations ρ kg m3 is the density difference between two fluids g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration d m is the mean particle diameter σ n m is the interfacial tension between two fluids μ d and μ r are the dynamic viscosities of the displacing and resident fluids respectively 3 2 description of fluid flow at the pore scale fig 1 presents the vision of the fluid flow through a periodic rev where ω is the total volume of rev the total volume ω consists of fractions ω σ and ω β which are the σ rigid solid phase domain and the β fluid i e polymer volume respectively thus the porous medium porosity can be found through ω β ω a βσ notation is the solid fluid interface where a no slip boundary condition is applied we considered that fluid is incompressible purely viscous and isotropic in this study assuming that the polymer flows in a creeping regime inertia effects are neglected at a steady state the generalized newtonian fluid s mass and momentum balance equations are written as follows 8 0 p i μ γ v v t in ω β 9 v 0 in ω β 10 v 0 on a βσ where p is the pressure and v is the fluid velocity field μ is the dynamic fluid viscosity as a function of shear rate which can be defined by the carreau fluid model carreau 1972 the carreau fluid model can be expressed as 11 μ γ μ inf μ 0 μ inf 1 λ γ 2 n 1 2 where λ s is the relaxation time n is the power index μ 0 pa s and μ inf pa s are the viscosity at zero and infinite shear rate the preceding set of equations is the pore scale description of the polymer flow problem in porous media 3 3 upscaling 3 3 1 separation of scales one of the homogenization method s basic principles is the scale separation condition auriault 1991 idris et al 2004 orgéas et al 2007 papanicolau et al 1978 quintard and whitaker 1994 sanchez palencia 1980 the characteristic rev length l presented in fig 1 is assumed to be much smaller than the characteristic macroscopic length l expressed as follows 12 ε l l 1 where ε is the scale separation parameter 3 3 2 boundary value problem we follow the same procedures as omirbekov et al 2020b by using the homogenization procedure proposed by orgéas et al 2007 a boundary value problem concerning the first order velocity v 0 and the second order pressure p 1 is presented in the following way 13 εp 1 i μ inf μ 0 μ inf 1 λ γ 2 n 1 2 v 0 v 0 t p x 0 in ω β 14 v 0 0 in ω β 15 v 0 0 on a βσ where εp 1 and v 0 are periodic and the macroscopic pressure gradient p x 0 is given on the entire rev as a source term the polymer solutions were examined as a generalized newtonian fluid following the carreau rheological model where the fluid viscosity is supposed to be a function of the magnitude of the shear rate γ given by 16 γ 2 s s where s is the strain rate defined as a function of v the velocity field at the pore scale 17 s 1 2 v 0 v 0 t as omirbekov et al 2020b we solved the boundary value problem in all unit cells presented in fig 4 where the macroscopic pressure gradient p x 0 was imposed in the direction of the x axis the boundary value problem eqs 13 15 was solved using comsol multiphysics finite element with a mixed pressure velocity p1 p2 formulation the creeping flow module designed to solve stokes flow problems was used in which the dynamic viscosity of the module was user defined via the equation view section the finite triangular elements were used to mesh the geometries where we selected the physics controlled mesh with the element size extremely fine an example of mesh and boundary conditions used is in fig 2 to verify the numerical procedure we used results reported in the literature for the same geometries idris et al 2004 orgéas et al 2007 orgéas et al 2006 in the case of generalized newtonian fluids we obtained the evolution of the dimensionless permeability with the solid fraction in a square array of cylinders the results were highly accurate compared to the outcomes reported in the literature 4 fluid characterization 4 1 dnapl the dnapl was a mixture of chlorinated solvents used in the experiments was sampled from a large chloralkali chemical plant in the tavaux site and filtrated using a 0 45 μm filter emd millipore the dnapl characteristics used in the experiments are presented in table 1 which was adopted from colombano and coworkers as we used the same dnapl see colombano et al 2020a 2020b for more details 4 2 polymer solutions three types of polymer were selected for the study xanthan gum xg guar gum gg and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc with an average molecular weight of 700 000 g mol the polymer solutions were chosen based on several factors including environmental friendliness and market availability the sigma aldrich company provided the polymer powders according to research by lenormand et al 1988 we selected the polymer concentrations so that the viscosity was 0 1 pa s to avoid viscous and capillary fingerings at the displacement velocity of 1 m day based on the porous medium of 0 5 mm glass beads packing the shear rate in porous media was calculated using eq 3 hence each polymer s concentration is listed in table 2 with the corresponding references from which the concentration was selected from their rheological curves in order to increase the density of the solutions we used barite baristar 9015 the barite was supplied by the mineralia company and consisted of 97 68 of baso4 the barite density is 4 4 kg l and the median particle diameter is 3 5 μm we used a barite concentration of 51 w w to obtain the same slurry density as dnapl 1 66 kg l 4 3 preparation of polymer solution all polymer solutions were prepared using demineralized deaerated water by stirring through an overhead stirrer ika rw14 with 200 500 rpm for 1 4 h two solutions were prepared 1 polymer solutions 2 densified polymer solutions with barite 1 the polymer solutions were prepared by hydrating the polymer powder gently in the water while stirring at 500 rpm 2 to prepare densified barite based polymer solutions we first hydrated barite in the water by stirring at 200 rpm for 15 min as mentioned in section 4 1 the concentration of barite solution was 51 w w to obtain the same solution density as dnapl the polymer powders were then added according to table 2 by stirring at 500 rpm for 2 h however hydration of gg powder was more complicated and required up to 4 h every prepared solution was tested for stability using a graduated cylinder all solution preparation and further experiments were conducted at 20 c in a temperature controlled room 4 4 rheological study all polymer solutions were examined using a stress controlled rheometer haake mars 60 thermofisher min torque rotation 0 02 μn m torque resolution 0 1 nn m equipped with cone plate geometry c60 1 ti and tmp60 solutions were characterized using the rheometer with the cone and plate geometry at the abovementioned concentrations and with 20 variation to observe a diverse range of polymer viscosities upon concentration change 1 2 ml of the solution was loaded to the geometry to fill the 0 054 mm shear gap of the geometry the shear rate was recorded versus time corresponding to the given stress each value was obtained when the shear stress variation was less than a prescribed tolerance the maximum measurement time for each shear rate was 60 s the imposed shear stress was established in the range of 0 01 to 100 1 s and the experiments were triplicated for each concentration 4 5 interfacial tension and contact angle study we investigated the interfacial tension ift between polymer solutions and dnapl and their contact angle with glass through a drop shape analyzer dsa 100 kruss to determine the interfacial tension between polymer solutions and dnapl a sealed glass cell cuvette was filled with a polymer solution sample a syringe with the dnapl was then placed in the cuvette and 2 ml of dnapl was loaded into the polymer solution to make a drop interfacial tension was measured by the pendant drop method stauffer 1965 we also measured the contact angle by placing the droplet on the bottom of the cuvette and the young laplace fit estimated the contact angle using kruss s advance software rotenberg et al 1983 5 experimental study in porous media this section presents the materials used experimental setup and procedures 5 1 porous media the porous media experiments are conducted using a glass bead pack provided by sigma aldrich company the columns were filled with calibrated 0 5 mm monodisperse solid glass beads to study the behavior of polymer solution and dnapl displacement in porous media the gbs size was chosen according to the permeability of the contaminated site moreover the gbs prevent any biochemical influence on the study 5 2 experimental setup the prepared polymer solution was injected into the 1d column the experimental setup is presented in fig 3 the polymer solution was pumped using reglo icc digital peristaltic pump ismatec with 0 01 rpm resolution the solution was injected into the 30 cm long 1d column with an internal diameter of 4 cm filled with 0 5 mm glass beads the column is made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe material two metal grids with a cell size of 150 μm retained the gbs on both sides of the column the mass balance mse6202s 000 d0 sartorius is placed after the column to record an effluent mass the differential pressure transmitter rosemount 3051s emerson was used to measure pressure difference along the bead pack 5 3 experimental procedure the columns were thoroughly packed vertically with monodispersed 0 5 mm gbs the gbs packs were used to characterize the polymer solutions behavior in porous media and investigate the dnapl displacement by different polymer solutions after filling the column with the gbs it was checked for leaks by putting it under 1 bar of gas pressure the column was then flushed with co2 gas for 45 min at a 10 ml min flow rate to facilitate water saturation as co2 gas is highly soluble in water demineralized deaerated water was introduced vertically upwards into the column at a 1 ml min flow rate to saturate the bead pack by entirely dissolving co2 gas the column was weighed before and after the water saturation step to determine the pore volume pv 130 ml i e the porosity 0 37 after complete water saturation the permeability was measured by measuring the pressure drop along the column for different imposed flow rates using darcy s law eq 1 the measured properties of the bead pack are tabulated in table 3 a specific polymer solution was pumped horizontally into a bead pack to study the behavior of polymer solutions in the porous medium by measuring a pressure drop along the column then the apparent viscosity is derived from darcy s law eq 1 the polymer flow was studied at various flow rates gradually increasing from the minimum q 0 2 ml min u 2 65 10 06 m s to the maximum q 5 0 ml min u 6 63 10 05 m s technically possible values the experiments were duplicated at least by progressively reducing the flow rates and each flow rate was tested for at least 3 pvs injected the irreducible water saturation s irw was established by injecting 2 pv of dnapl from the bottom to the top of the water saturated column with 1 ml min flow rate and the mean s irw is presented in table 3 then the polymer solution was introduced horizontally into the bead pack all polymer solutions were stirred during the injection with 100 rpm the fluid flow in the column was investigated by measuring the pressure drop with pressure transmitters to assess dnapl recovery we collected the effluent in graduated cylinders we used several graduated cylinders for each column the first was used to collect the pre breakthrough dnapl production and the others to get the effluent after the breakthrough consequently the dnapl recovery was determined using the mass and volume of the effluent 6 upscaling geometry characteristics of the microstructure the study was conducted in two periodic 3d and four different 2d unit cells as omirbekov et al 2020b which theoretical background is presented in section 3 2 and 3 3 the types of unit cells with their porosity values are presented in fig 4 with a square packed cylinders with a circular cross section spc b square packed cylinders with a square cross section sps c dense packed cylinders with a circular cross section dpc d dense packed cylinders with a square cross section dps e simple cubic packing of cubes scp f cubic body centered packing of spheres bcp the edge size of all unit cells was 0 5 mm to be close to the grain size of 0 5 mm gbs the permeability was prearranged to be 2 27 10 10 m2 by solving the closure problems for newtonian fluids quintard and whitaker 1994 whitaker 1999 one should note that the selected unit cells should have the same porosity and permeability as the experimental sample in addition the geometric structures should be the same in terms of disorder here we considered ordered geometries where the porosity values for spc sps scp and bcp cells were roughly close to the porosity of gbs packing the porosity of the dpc and dps geometries was high for the same permeability value 7 results and discussion 7 1 development of densified polymer solutions the stability of prepared polymer solutions was tested using graduated cylinders the study aimed to develop a dense barite suspended polymer solution to decrease residual dnapl saturation in polluted soil as mentioned in the section 4 3 we studied first polymer solutions and then polymer solutions with barite 7 1 1 polymer solutions fig 5 shows polymer solutions stability a 10 min after the preparation and b after 1 day we observed that the cmc solution is more transparent than the xg and gg solutions after one day there was no change in the cmc and xg solutions however we noticed the gg solution s inhomogeneity in which we observed the accumulation of turbid solution on the graduated cylinder bottom this phenomenon can result from the weak dissolution of guar gum in water at low temperatures casas et al 2000 found that only 88 of guar gum fraction can be solved at low temperatures 25 c which can be increased to 91 at 80 c 7 1 2 densification of polymer solutions with barite the same procedure was carried out to determine the polymer stability sedimentation test with barite the barite concentration was 51 w w fig 6 shows the stability test of polymer solutions with barite where we plotted the suspension s sedimentation volume water separation from the suspension as a time function we noticed obvious barite precipitation in the xg solution according to the result the most stabilized case was observed for the cmc solution where the suspension volume was decreased only for 5 ml 2 in 2 days the solution with the gg polymer showed an intermediate result moreover the barite precipitation was insignificant compared to the barite based xg solution in which the precipitation rate was very significant appendix fig 19 also presents photos of the stability test taken 10 min and one day after the solution s preparation 7 2 characterization of polymer solution in section 4 all the polymer solutions were described by investigating rheology interfacial tensions and contact angle on the glass polymer solutions were studied instantly after preparation also the polymer solutions with and without barite particles flow results in the water saturated bead pack are presented to investigate the apparent polymer viscosity in the porous medium 7 2 1 polymer solutions the viscosity of different polymer solutions as a function of shear rate is presented in fig 7 the carreau model well fits the results and the fitting parameters with 95 confidence intervals are tabulated in table 4 the fitting parameters with 95 confidence intervals were found by nonlinear regression using the matlab curve fitting toolbox from the result we can observe the different rheological characteristics of the polymers the xg solution behaves as a non newtonian fluid demonstrating assertive shear thinning behavior over a wide range of shear rates from the fitting parameter of viscosity μ 0 at zero shear rate is a positive value including the 95 confidence interval moreover the carreau model is the best fit model for xg solution among seven different rheological models according to the studies of cao et al 2016 the cmc solutions behaved as a shear thickening fluid at lower shear rates 0 01 0 10 1 s as a newtonian fluid at intermediate shear rates 0 10 10 1 s a shear thinning behavior was noticed at higher shear rates 10 100 1 s benchabane and bekkour 2008 observed different flow behavior depending on the cmc concentration from 0 2 to 5 0 and noticed no yield stress for all concentrations at the concentration of 0 4 as in our case they noticed two shear thinning behaviors over two ranges of shear rates separated by a plateau zone at medium shear rates 1 15 1 s above the concentration of 1 they initially observed shear thickening behavior followed by a shear thinning behavior at a given shear rate describing the resulting change in the behavior of the flow curves they presented two critical shear rates 1 up to when newtonian fluid behavior exhibits 2 after the newtonian plateau value at medium shear rate following this they fitted their results well using the cross model cross 1965 above the first critical shear rate however our outcome is close to the description of cmc concentration above 1 which behaves as a shear thickening fluid at low shear rates 0 01 0 10 1 s exhibited a newtonian fluid behavior at medium shear rates 0 1 10 1 s and shear thinning behavior is observed when the shear rate is further increased 10 100 1 s this type of difference in results might be because the properties of cmc differ depending on molecular weight and among manufacturers as escudier et al 2001 reported following the benchabane and bekkour 2008 study we fitted the cmc results using the carreau model even though it does not represent well at low shear rates 0 01 0 10 1 s hence we can observe that the cmc data was not fitted well at low shear rates due to the complex rheological behavior of the cmc therefore we can state that the obtained parameter of μ 0 is not accurate including the confidence interval the gg solution flowed as a shear thinning fluid the discrepancy bar on the experimental results at lower shear rates was high based on the triplicated results which is related to the low solubility of the gg powder in water at 20 c as shown in fig 5 7 2 2 effect of barite on the polymer viscosity in fig 8 the viscosity is plotted as a function of the shear rate for the dense barite based polymer solutions one may observe an impact of the barite on the solutions viscosity barite increased viscosities of gg and cmc solutions compared to barite free ones because the barite concentration is significant where the solid volume fraction is 19 4 of total suspension volume suspension viscosity can vary depending on the solid fraction eilers 1941 vand 1948 the particle size senapati et al 2010 and the liquid viscosity konijn et al 2014 from the classical study by eilers 1941 and vand 1948 in a newtonian fluid a suspension with a solid fraction of 20 increases the suspension viscosity by about a factor of two although suspension properties such as particle diameter and liquid viscosity were different for instance eilers 1941 studied suspension viscosity on various solid fractions where the liquid viscosity was 1000 mpa s and a particle diameter of 2 7 μm while vand 1948 investigated suspensions with a particle diameter of 50 80 μm in a liquid with a viscosity of 80 mpa s in our study the viscosity of cmc increased five times from 0 15 to 0 76 pa s at a shear rate of 0 10 1 s the barite cmc solution behaves as a shear thinning fluid and the viscosity is more significant at low shear rates than the barite free cmc solution also the same behavior was observed for the barite gg solution s viscosity which is also roughly higher five times compared to the barite free solution at the 0 10 1 s shear rate specifically this is very noticeable at lower shear rates up to γ 1 00 1 s we noticed that cmc and gg solutions also increases the suspension viscosity comparably with a suspension based on newtonian fluids nevertheless the similar behavior was not observed for the barite xg solution at the low shear rates up to 0 02 1 s the barite xg solution viscosity was higher than the barite free xg solution only 20 above the shear rate of 0 04 1 s we observed an inverse phenomenon the barite free xg solution s viscosity was higher than the xg solution with barite from 19 to 81 in the range of shear rates 0 04 2 00 1 s the instability due to the quick decantation of barite particles in the xg polymer solution can explain this phenomenon as was noticed in the stability tests presented in fig 6 hence the barite based xg and gg solutions were not investigated in further 1d column experiments in fig 9 we plotted only the barite cmc solution with the fit curve by the carreau model the carreau model fitted the experimental data very well compared to the barite free cmc solution rheology shown in fig 7 as the newtonian viscosity plateau was observed up to a shear rate of 0 10 1 s the fitting of cmc rheology data with the carreau model was mostly studied in the literature amirnia et al 2013 escudier et al 2001 strnadel et al 2011 consequently this fitting data with the 95 confidence intervals presented in table 4 will be used as input parameters to study the behavior of the barite cmc solution over different 2d and 3d geometry inclusions in order to better characterize the fluid behavior in porous media we also investigated the interfacial tension and contact angle of fluids on glass material 7 2 3 interfacial tension and contact angle between dnapl and polymer solutions table 5 presents the results of dnapl interfacial tensions in various polymer solutions and cas on the glass surface according to colombano et al 2021 the dnapl water interfacial tension is 10 96 0 05 mn m and the contact angle with water on a glass surface is 119 33 4 16 our results found that the ift and contact angle of both cmc and gg solutions are higher than that obtained with distilled water however adding barite reduced the ift insignificantly i e for 6 8 we also noticed a decrease in the dnapl contact angle in the barite cmc solution on glass where the contact angle was reduced by 13 41 the contact angle of dnapl in the barite gg solution was not determined accurately because the solution was not stable for a certain time consequently these results are used to estimate the dnapl displacement in porous media 7 3 dnapl displacement model in porous media the multiphase flow of immiscible liquids such as napl in a porous medium is in fact a multiscale transport process the relative influence of capillary viscous and gravitational forces acting on many microscopic interfaces determines the overall flow characteristics during the dnapl displacement in porous media in order to characterize the dnapl displacement in the bead pack using the polymer solutions mentioned above the n bo is calculated to assess the effect of gravity forces bond numbers are respectively equal to 1 31 10 1 and 1 19 10 1 for the cmc and gg solutions in the dnapl zone where ρ 0 then n bo 0 thus the n bo is less than the critical value i e 10 3 according to gioia et al 2003 where the gravitation forces are insufficient to sweep the dnapl positioned on the bedrock having obtained the same density by adding the barite we discharged the impact of gravity forces to deal only with capillary forces in this case viscous forces play a crucial role to illustrate the dnapl displacement by polymer solutions we consider a typical phase diagram of lenormand et al 1988 it is believed that the simple case describes the flow s main characteristics without considering heat and mass transfer compressibility and rheological effects the pore scale flow is governed by the interaction of capillary and viscous forces and can be characterized using the capillary number n ca and the viscosity ratio m r fig 10 presents the calculated n ca and m r for all polymer solutions with and without barite particles the logarithms of the viscosity ratios are positive and the calculated capillary numbers are above the capillary fingering i e at the intermediate zone it is possible to enhance the displacing fluid viscosity by increasing the polymer concentration however this may negatively impact the environment by raising the injection pressure that tends to erode the aquifer or uplift the soil thus the fluids presented in fig 10 are experimentally studied in a 1d porous column to investigate dnapl displacement and verify our expectations 7 4 polymer solutions apparent viscosity in porous media before investigating the dnapl displacement by polymer solutions we first examined them in 1d porous column as a single phase flow experiment to study their behavior in a porous medium fig 11 plotted polymer solutions apparent viscosity outcomes in porous media p m and shear viscosity within the rheometer bulk exp as a function of shear rate the shear rate in porous media was calculated using eq 3 as shown in the rheogram cmc and xg solutions apparent viscosity values were lower than those of the shear viscosity measured using rheometer at the lower shear rates below 0 5 1 s the apparent viscosity of cmc in the porous medium is on the trendline of the shear viscosity however at shear rates above 0 5 1 s the apparent viscosity of cmc decreased slightly compared to the shear viscosity of the cmc as the shear rate increased thus dropping by roughly 30 at a shear rate of 8 0 1 s the xg shear viscosity was less i e 0 5 pa s in p m vs 0 8 pa s in bulk at 0 4 1 s than the apparent viscosity until the shear rate of 6 1 1 s but became lower for 0 02 pa s when the shear rate exceeded 8 0 1 s polymer retention in porous media includes three main mechanisms polymer adsorption mechanical entrapment and hydrodynamic retention dominguez and willhite 1977 mechanical entrapment and hydrodynamic retention occur only when flowing through a porous medium and cannot be observed in bulk solution experiments in a rheometer therefore the apparent viscosity of polymers in porous media differs from the shear viscosity in rheometer the α shift parameter is commonly used to relate the viscosity of polymers in and out of porous media the gg solution s viscosity results were very different than xg and cmc and were significantly higher in porous media i e 0 09 pa s vs 0 90 pa s at the shear rate of 0 80 1 s because of the gg solution s poor solubility in water presented in section 7 1 1 it tends to clog pores increasing inaccessible pore volume ipv sheng 2011 in fig 12 we plotted the apparent and shear viscosity of barite cmc solution as a function of shear rate the results were in good agreement with the carreau model the fitting parameters tabulated in table 4 the apparent viscosity of the barite cmc solution was higher than the shear viscosity which was not the case only for the cmc solution where shear viscosity showed higher values than apparent viscosity see fig 11 moreover from the fitting parameter we observed that the viscosity at zero shear rate μ 0 is more important in porous media and this is the consequence of the permeability reduction due to an increase in ipv in order to verify permeability reduction after each experiment the 1d columns were flushed with water for two days consequently a reduction in the permeability of the porous medium was observed as presented in table 6 one may notice a significant diminution of permeability by polymer solutions from the outcomes in particular the gg solution reduced the permeability by 22 times while the xg and cmc solutions only decreased it by three in addition the decrease in permeability was noticeable by a factor of 48 for the barite cmc solution as a result we noticed that the deposition of barite particles tends to reduce the permeability of porous media and it is much more significant than the cmc alone 7 5 dnapl recovery in porous media this section shows the 1d column experiments that were carried out to investigate the polymer solutions flow in porous media the cmc gg xg polymers and barite cmc solutions were injected into the dnapl saturated bead packs the dnapl production and calculated capillary number are presented as a function of the pore volume 7 5 1 dnapl recovery by polymer solutions the polymer solutions were injected horizontally after saturation with dnapl as mentioned in section 5 3 the irreducible water saturation was 16 00 0 50 fig 13 shows the cumulative dnapl production as a function of the polymer volume injected in pv units the breakthrough of xg and gg polymer solutions without barite occurred around 0 72 pv of polymer injection while the breakthrough of the cmc alone and cmc with barite solution was 0 01 pv later at 0 73 pv the outcomes show a difference in the production rates after the breakthrough the dnapl production rate for the cmc and the barite cmc solution was 5 7 higher than the xg and gg solutions for 0 1 pv after the breakthrough 1 pv more polymer solutions were pumped after the breakthrough to maximize the dnapl recovery as a result the dnapl recovery factor reached up to 86 1 0 8 85 4 2 and 84 8 0 7 for cmc gg and xg polymers respectively before starting the experiments with the polymer solutions we tried to mobilize dnapl only using water the results show that just up to 40 2 of dnapl was removed from the system this is all the lower as the recovery yield reaches up to 60 in the pump and treat method colombano et al 2020a 2020b itrc 2002 stroo et al 2012 the polymers improved the dnapl mobilization up to 85 which is twice as higher than flushing by water since the polymer increased the viscosity of displacing fluid moreover the recovery factor for cmc barite suspension was 93 18 1 2 consequently adding barite to the cmc polymer reduced the dnapl residual saturation in 1d columns twice from 13 9 to 6 8 in fig 14 we plotted the residual dnapl percentage saturation results obtained by different fluids as a function of capillary number presented on a logarithmic scale as shown the injection of polymer solutions improved the dnapl recovery thereby decreasing the residual saturation the residual saturation commonly decreases with an increase in capillary number observed in this figure following the power law function presented by the dashed blue line however the capillary number of xg polymer was high due to the highest viscosity value at the shear rate of 1 92 1 s presented in fig 7 7 5 2 assessment of dnapl recovery in fig 10 in section 7 3 we plotted the capillary numbers based on shear viscosity at a single shear rate 1 92 1 s we assumed a steady state flow at a velocity of 1 m day and calculated an equivalent shear rate to assess the dnapl recovery from the 1d column by the presented polymer solutions we plotted capillary numbers in logarithmic scale as a function of the injected pore volume in fig 15 the light blue area represents the capillary fingering area demonstrated based on the phase diagram of lenormand et al 1988 see fig 10 in this plot the capillary number in porous media was calculated using the following equation 18 n cpm k p σ which is an alternative definition of eq 6 by substituting velocity with darcy s law eq 1 this allows us to define the capillary number change in porous media without representing the shear rate based on the measured pressure drop across the 1d column fig 15 shows the change in capillary number during polymer injection at a constant injection flow rate of 1 ml min note that the permeability parameter k is chosen as an absolute value measured by water see table 3 because the polymer solutions were pumped at a constant rate changes in fluid mobility relative permeabilities viscosities affect the pressure drop measured across the column the measured pressure differences hence the capillary numbers constantly increased to the breakthrough since the injected fluid s viscosity is much higher than dnapl specifically the barite cmc capillary number i e the pressure gradient in fig 20 crossed the critical capillary number line 1 0 10 04 immediately after injection of 0 1 pv the capillary numbers were constant for the barite cmc cmc and xg solutions after some time behind the breakthrough however we observed an increase in the pressure gradient curve for the gg polymer even after the breakthrough point this is related to gg s poor solubility in the stability test discussed in section 7 1 1 moreover the pressure gradient after the breakthrough increased further revealing a decrease in the bead pack permeability due to pore clogging by increasing ipv 7 6 upscaling results to link lab scale experiments with pore scale data numerical upscaling using the homogenization method can be useful in evaluating effective parameters such as velocity as mentioned in section 6 we have tested different geometrical settings in the numerical homogenization framework to investigate the upscaling technique of polymer flooding fig 16 shows a plot of the superficial velocity of xg solution as a function of the pressure gradient in various 2d and 3d unit cells the experimental results have a good agreement for small px up to 11 000 pa m with 2d spc and sps geometric models in contrast the resolution on 3d scp represents well the intermediate pressure gradient i e between 11 000 and 17 000 pa m the 2d dpc and dps outcomes describe well the highest applied pressure gradient at 5 ml min i e u 6 63 10 05 m s on the cross sectional area of the 1d column a 1 26 10 03 m2 fig 17 presents the cmc solution s superficial velocity vs pressure gradient outcomes the upscaling results are in good agreement at low pressure gradients while the deviation of the results increases with increasing pressure gradient this can be explained by the rheological behavior of the cmc solution which behaves as a newtonian fluid at the intermediate shear rates 0 10 10 1 s and becomes a shear thinning fluid with increasing shear rate i e velocity see fig 11 from fig 11 we noticed that the apparent viscosity of cmc is lower than the shear viscosity at a given shear rate it even lowers as the shear rate i e velocity increases since the upscaling input is a shear viscosity the experimental velocity is greater than the predicted velocity by the upscaling the rise in velocity deviation by increasing pressure gradients follows the same trend but reverses as viscosity decreases even the reduction in permeability due to adsorption see table 6 did not affect to decrease in velocity consequently the effective velocity with specific geometry can be used to describe the flow in the homogenization theory the periodic boundary condition for the unit cell problem cannot be realistic in macro scale observation the upscaling results with 1d column experimental data of the barite cmc solution are plotted in fig 18 we observed similar behavior at lower pressure gradients as cmc solution flow from the results contrary to the cmc solution the upscaling results represented significantly higher velocities at certain pressure gradients than experimental outcomes as in the cmc solution results the deviation in upscaling results increases with increasing velocity evidently showing geometry s impact on the solution flow indeed this is due to the deposition of barite particles in porous media that resulted in permeability reduction of the porous media according to the water flushing after the experiments the permeability is reduced by a factor of 48 after the barite cmc solution injection compared to the absolute permeability which is 15 times lower than the permeability obtained after only the cmc injection in general the difference in apparent and shear viscosity of polymer depends on polymer degradation due to chemical and mechanical forces inaccessible pores and adsorption of polymers on pore surfaces since our porous media is made of monodispersed glass beads we may exclude the effect of inaccessibility of pores but the deposition of barite particles reduced the permeability of porous media moreover the extension thickening behavior of polymers resulting in elastic turbulence cannot be neglected therefore the polymer retention and adsorption barite deposition in porous media and extension thickening behavior of polymers cannot be represented using only shear viscosity data especially in more complex flow fields as in realistic cases without any assumptions this study attempted to upscale suspended non newtonian fluid using shear viscosity results as input parameters 8 summary and conclusion this work presents a study of biopolymers and densification of polymer solutions for soil remediation the stability of biopolymers with and without barite particles was investigated to select the most stable polymer the rheology of polymer solutions with and without barite was examined through a rheometer to study displacing fluid behavior the solutions were also injected into a porous medium to compare and investigate polymer behavior on porous media the experimental data of shear and apparent viscosity were fitted by the carreau rheological model and analyzed biopolymers and densified polymer solutions were studied numerically in different 2d and 3d unit cells the results were analyzed by comparison with experimental data from the 1d porous column hence we draw the following conclusions the xg and cmc polymers dissolve well at low temperatures compared to the gg polymer that showed lower solubility during the stability test the cmc solution showed the best stability with barite micro particles and the barite increases the polymer viscosity the rheological behavior of polymers fits well with the carreau model except for the cmc without barite the shear viscosity measured through rheometer differs from the apparent viscosity due to polymer adsorption on pore surfaces and barite deposition in porous media the permeability was reduced by a factor of three for the cmc and xg solutions and the barite cmc reduced the permeability by 48 times the barite cmc solution improved the remediation yield of dnapl and adding barite to the cmc polymer decreased the residual saturation by a factor of two upscaling results are in good agreement with experimental outcomes of the xg cmc and barite cmc at low pressure gradients the geometry affects polymer flow in porous media especially at high pressure gradients in this respect the use of the latest developments in darcy scale models is very promising especially with new models able to take into account the complex

1235,the remediation of dnapl contaminated soil with lower density fluids is ineffective due to the over riding of displacing fluid the densification of biopolymers is experimentally studied to develop a solution with the same density as a pollutant polymer solutions and contaminants are characterized through rheometer a 1d column filled with monodisperse glass beads was used to measure their apparent viscosity in porous media the displacement of pollutants by biopolymers such as xanthan gum guar gum and carboxymethyl cellulose and densified solutions based on barite are investigated in the 1d porous column in addition the polymer solution flow is studied using an upscaling method based on the shear viscosity measured with rheometer the upscaling results are compared with the 1d column experimental outcomes we found that carboxymethyl cellulose is the best for densifying polymer and showed the highest remediation yield for dnapl remediation the polymers rheology was represented well through the carreau rheological model the discrepancy of apparent viscosity in porous media from polymers shear viscosity measured with rheometer is explained by the adsorption of polymers on pore surfaces and deposition of barite particles in a porous medium which led to a decrease in permeability the upscaling results are in good agreement with experimental outcomes at low pressure gradients the impact of porous media geometry on polymer flow in porous media is described keywords soil remediation porous media polymer barite densification upscaling data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction contamination of soils and aquifers by non aqueous phase liquids napls is one of the common problems of industrial wastes which are slightly water soluble mixtures of chemicals napls can be spilled during industrial accidents and seep by gravity into the soil and reach the groundwater it then dissipates in the aquifer thereby causing a danger to a source of drinking water and harming living organisms in soil and water therefore remediation of napl contaminated soils is critical to avoid possible consequences for public health and environmental concerns napls lighter than water e g many petroleum chemicals such as benzene toluene xylene etc are called light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls and those heavier than water e g chlorinated solvents coal tar are named dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls huntley and beckett 2002 mercer and cohen 1990 pankow and cherry 1996 the most widely used technology for the recovery of dnapl is the pump treatment pt method which is generally not very efficient rarely exceeding 60 recovery expensive and time consuming colombano et al 2021 colombano et al 2020a 2020b itrc 2002 stroo et al 2012 one of the recent advancing in situ soil flushing technologies is based on non newtonian fluids injection such as aqueous foams hirasaki et al 1997 mulligan and eftekhari 2003 omirbekov et al 2022 omirbekov et al 2020a and polymers forey et al 2020 martel et al 2004 either bio based e g xanthan and guar gums or synthetic polymers e g hydrolyzed polyacrylamide inspired by a well known experience in enhanced oil recovery eor technologies that increase the overall sweep efficiency lake 1989 however it must be adapted to the very restrictive context of polluted soils the surrounding areas are unconsolidated soils and do not allow for very high superimposed injection pressures heterogeneities in soils and aquifers reduce the sweep efficiency of flushing solutions by producing preferential flow paths by leaving major non swept areas in low permeability zones specifically the front stability considering horizontal propagation in porous media depends on at least two issues the first factor concerns the inclination angle of the front that relies on gravity override between displacing and resident fluids this causes premature breakthroughs of the displacing fluid resulting in poor sweep efficiency the second issue is the instability caused by the fingering induced by the viscous contrast between the bulk of the displacing and resident fluids grubb and sitar 1999 these instabilities occur when water is commonly used to displace a more viscous fluid the viscosity ratio mr is the crucial parameter for analyzing the sweep efficiency of low permeability zones which is the ratio of the resident fluid effective viscosity μr to the displacing fluid effective viscosity μd when the μr is more viscous than the displacing fluid μd the displacement is considered unstable and when mr 1 the displacement is considered to be stable fanchi 2010 therefore the use of water soluble polymer increases the viscosity of the displacing fluids thereby eliminating the fingering issue giese and powers 2002 martel et al 1998 2004 robert et al 2006 aqueous polymer solutions e g hydrolyzed polyacrylamides xanthan guar carboxymethyl cellulose are used for their viscous and shear thinning properties to improve porous media s sweeping thomas 2008 when non newtonian rheology effects are incorporated into the flow field calculation it is anticipated that the flow field will vary and the correlations between flow and shear rate will also change the shear thinning fluid is expected to have higher viscosity at low shear rate regions i e lower flow velocities and expected to have low viscosity in areas with high shear rates i e higher flow velocities this expected behavior shear thinning is likely to occur below a certain flow rate which expressed in terms of the reynolds number re depends on the porous medium and the polymer concentration but can be much lower than 1 above this threshold non linear relationships between flow and pressure gradient are often observed due to a non negligible extension thickening behavior azad and trivedi 2020 groisman and steinberg 2000 ibezim et al 2021 marshall and metzner 1967 mokhtari et al 2022 martel et al 1998 studied the sweeping efficiency of polymer solution in a sandbox by reproducing a simple heterogeneous porous media with layers of sand that have different permeabilities xanthan gum was used as a polymer solution without any additives they established that the xanthan gum solution increases the sweeping efficiency and eliminates the viscous fingering at the polymer solution front kostarelos et al 1998 used a mixed solution sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate sodium chloride isopropanol and xanthan to effectively remediate sand polluted with trichloroethylene gauthier and kueper 2006 used a mixture of n propanol xanthan ethanol to treat soils polluted by polychloropiphenyls the remediation yield was 95 gauthier and kueper 2006 robert et al 2006 conducted experiments through a 2d aquifer model where xanthan gum polymer with surfactant was used for flushing the trichloroethylene tce a mixture of xanthan and a surfactant solution allowed them to recover 95 they observed the efficiency of polymer floods in heterogeneous systems moreover a better contact between surfactant polymer solution and tce ganglia was reported several studies also showed that the polymer solutions based on xanthan could improve the sweeping efficiency of heterogeneous porous media up to 90 in laboratory experiments silva et al 2013 silva et al 2012 in field cases authors compared the injection of a passive tracer transported either in water or in xanthan solution into a heterogenous soil truex et al 2015 they found that the tracer carried by xanthan occupied 69 of the control area compared with only 49 with water at the end of the injection thus the polymer solution accesses more areas and ensures a more homogeneous spatial distribution of the transported solute most laboratory studies were carried out in closed systems e g micromodels sandboxes where the boundaries were limited by the walls of the installations thereby eliminating the influence of gravity in real cases it should be noted that gravity influences the inclination angle of the displacement front which is noticeable in highly permeable porous media such as aquifers cochennec et al 2022 several studies have assumed the impact of density under several landfill sites macfarlane et al 1983 zhong et al 2008 several petroleum engineering studies showed displacement inefficiency in gravity over ride and under ride cases e g craig jr et al 1957 crane et al 1963 in soil remediation density over riding and under riding were observed in several studies for instance the density over riding phenomenon was noticed when water was displaced with a less dense solvent jawitz et al 1998 when ethanol surfactant solutions were injected to remediate perchloroethylene pce taylor et al 2004 and trichloroethene tce grubb and sitar 1999 contaminated soil these gravity effects can be minimized or neglected when the displacing and resident fluids have similar densities as indicated by many researchers gatlin and slobod 1960 morrow et al 1988 offeringa and van der poel 1954 sievert et al 1958 taber and meyer 1964 consequently the density and viscosity of the displacing fluid play a crucial role in displacing the resident fluid however the polymer solution flow in a rheometer significantly differs from the flow through a porous medium afolabi et al 2019 omirbekov et al 2020b shende et al 2021 two main reasons may affect i adsorption and mechanical retention of the polymer changes the porous media geometry i e permeability satken 2021 ii extension thickening behavior is non negligible leading to elastic turbulence that may be due to a positive feedback between stretching of the polymer molecules and the flow azad and trivedi 2020 groisman and steinberg 2000 or because of the impact of the high polymeric stress zone birefringent strands on the flow pattern mokhtari et al 2022 apparent polymer viscosity in porous media is commonly described through darcy s law in the literature berg and van wunnik 2017 chevalier et al 2013 rodríguez de castro et al 2020 rodríguez de castro et al 2019 sorbie 2013 which is usually measured by conducting core flood experiments the apparent viscosity of polymer solution in porous media depends on the rheology of fluid polymer degradation due to chemical and mechanical forces inaccessible pores and adsorption of polymers on pore surfaces therefore darcy viscosity shows a shift in viscosity profile compared to shear viscosity measured using a rheometer and α shift factor is used for correlating the shear rate with the darcy viscosity zamani et al 2017 most authors presented α shift factor as a function of fluid rheology and porous medium properties berg and van wunnik 2017 rodríguez de castro and radilla 2016 rodríguez de castro et al 2019 tosco et al 2013 apart from experiments modeling can also help to describe better the flow of a non newtonian fluid such as a shear thinning polymer solution at the darcy scale for example as with newtonian fluid flows upscaling methods can be applied to derive the darcy scale flow equations mathematically upscaling through volume averaging multiscale asymptotics or other methods relies on the scale separation between the scale of the process at hand and the target scale however the nonlinearity induced by the velocity dependent viscosity complicates the process provided that a larger scale model can be derived the final step in the methods is usually to solve a set of boundary value problems on a representative elementary cell to compute the effective parameters of the large scale model few upscaled models have been proposed for non newtonian fluid flows among them khuzhayorov et al 2000 used the multiscale asymptotics method and de haro et al 1996 used the volume averaging method applied to maxwell fluid flows mokhtari et al 2022 recently derived a darcy scale model for olroyd b fluid flows in porous media the authors upscaled model is obtained by the multiscale asymptotics method and is able to reproduce the shear thinning and shear thickening behavior due to the impact of birefringent strands on the flow as discussed previously the darcy scale model derived by orgéas et al 2007 is used in this work as the chosen constitutive relation for viscosity carreau rheological model is the same and the authors have a successful experience in its application omirbekov et al 2020b 2 problem statement and contributions of this work we emphasize that polymer rheology is important for soil remediation in the same way as it is for eor i e better removal efficiency in areas of high contrast permeability and control of viscous fingering however due to the high permeability encountered in soil remediation the effect of gravity can impact the removal efficiency through an undesirable buoyancy effect between the fluids unless the density of the invading fluid and the displaced fluid match this is the main problem addressed in this work this study has two main objectives firstly we aim to study a polymer solution injection with the same density as a resident fluid to our knowledge the soil remediation literature has reported no manipulation of displacing fluid density and viscosity to reduce front instability in order to obtain a stable viscous and dense solution we study several environmentally friendly biopolymers xanthan gum guar gum and carboxymethyl cellulose and micro particles of barite baso4 as a weighting agent barite is considered nontoxic and low soluble in water alamooti et al 2022 schulz et al 2017 since it was commonly used as a weighting agent for all types of drilling fluid in the petroleum industry as a second objective we focus on the characterization of polymer solutions through upscaling methods by solving boundary value problems using different 2d and 3d simple geometries specifically the impact of polymer solution rheology with a weighting agent on porous media property at the darcy scale since the direct upscaling of polymer flow from pore to laboratory scale is complex we used upscaling technique to scale up polymer flow by using the rheological data of bulk polymer as an input the goal is to study whether the polymer flow in porous media can be predicted from its bulk behavior this study focused only on upscaling from pore to laboratory scale investigations we used the upscaling model formed by omirbekov et al 2020b which is detailed in the next section to study the macroscopic behavior of polymer flows it was first necessary to establish the geometry of the representative elementary volume rev corresponding to the permeability of porous media obtained from laboratory experiments therefore we solved the closure problem for the creeping flow of newtonian fluids in steady state developed through the volume averaging method quintard and whitaker 1994 whitaker 1999 to define the permeability of the unit cells the porosity in each unit cell was adjusted to get the same permeability as in the 1d column experiment then we solved the boundary value problem developed using the homogenization method amanbek et al 2019 singh et al 2017 to study macroscopic polymer flow behavior the purpose of the upscaling was to study the effect of different unit cell geometries on polymer flow the one dimensional experiments with a d 0 5 mm monodisperse solid glass beads gbs pack were used to correlate and validate the upscaling results 3 theoretical background 3 1 fluid transport in porous media fluid flow in porous media is commonly characterized through darcy velocity u m s which can be presented as

shear stress and shear rate respectively if we consider darcy s law applicable to the flow of a non newtonian fluid in a porous medium the influence of the fluid s non linear rheology can be incorporated into the definition of apparent viscosity μ app this apparent viscosity is not an intrinsic fluid property and varies with the flow rate it is a non linear function of the equivalent shear rate given in next eq 3 which can differ depending on the flow rate fluid flow in porous media can be represented as a bundle of capillary tubes according to the first conceptual model kozeny

consists of fractions ω σ and ω β which are the σ rigid solid phase domain and the β fluid i e polymer volume respectively thus the porous medium porosity can be found through ω β ω a βσ notation is the solid fluid interface where a no slip boundary condition is applied we considered that fluid is incompressible purely viscous and isotropic in this study assuming that the polymer flows in a creeping regime inertia effects are neglected at a steady state the generalized newtonian fluid s mass and momentum balance equations are written as follows 8 0 p i μ γ v v t in ω β 9 v 0 in ω β 10 v

rate the preceding set of equations is the pore scale description of the polymer flow problem in porous media 3 3 upscaling 3 3 1 separation of scales one of the homogenization method s basic principles is the scale separation condition auriault 1991 idris et al 2004 orgéas et al 2007 papanicolau et al 1978 quintard and whitaker 1994 sanchez palencia 1980 the characteristic rev length l presented in fig 1 is assumed to be much smaller than the characteristic macroscopic length l expressed as follows 12 ε l l 1 where ε is the scale separation parameter 3 3 2 boundary value problem we follow the same procedures as omirbekov et al 2020b by using the homogenization procedure proposed by orgéas et al 2007 a boundary value problem concerning the first order velocity v 0 and the second order pressure p 1 is presented in the following way 13 εp 1 i μ inf μ 0 μ inf 1 λ γ 2 n 1 2 v 0 v 0 t p x 0 in ω β 14 v 0 0 in ω β 15 v 0 0 on a βσ where εp 1 and v 0 are periodic and the macroscopic pressure gradient p x 0 is given on the entire rev as a source term the polymer solutions were examined as a generalized newtonian fluid following the carreau rheological model where the fluid viscosity is supposed to be a function of the magnitude of the shear rate γ given by 16 γ 2 s s where s is the strain rate defined as a function of v the velocity field at the pore scale 17 s 1 2 v 0 v 0 t as omirbekov et al 2020b we solved the boundary value problem in all unit cells presented in fig 4 where the macroscopic pressure gradient p x 0 was imposed in the direction of the x axis the boundary value problem eqs 13 15 was solved using comsol multiphysics finite element with a mixed pressure velocity p1 p2 formulation the creeping flow module designed to solve stokes flow problems was used in which the dynamic viscosity of the module was user defined via the equation view section the finite triangular elements were used to mesh the geometries where we selected the physics controlled mesh with the element size extremely fine an example of mesh and boundary conditions used is in fig 2 to verify the numerical procedure we used results reported in the literature for the same geometries idris et al 2004 orgéas et al 2007 orgéas et al 2006 in the case of generalized newtonian fluids we obtained the evolution of the dimensionless permeability with the solid fraction in a square array of cylinders the results were highly accurate compared to the outcomes reported in the literature 4 fluid characterization 4 1 dnapl the dnapl was a mixture of chlorinated solvents used in the experiments was sampled from a large chloralkali chemical plant in the tavaux site and filtrated using a 0 45 μm filter emd millipore the dnapl characteristics used in the experiments are presented in table 1 which was adopted from colombano and coworkers as we used the same dnapl see colombano et al 2020a 2020b for more details 4 2 polymer solutions three types of polymer were selected for the study xanthan gum xg guar gum gg and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc with an average molecular weight of 700 000 g mol the polymer solutions were chosen based on several factors including environmental friendliness and market availability the sigma aldrich company provided the polymer powders according to research by lenormand et al 1988 we selected the polymer concentrations so that the viscosity was 0 1 pa s to avoid viscous and capillary fingerings at the displacement velocity of 1 m day based on the porous medium of 0 5 mm glass beads packing the shear rate in porous media was calculated using eq 3 hence each polymer s concentration is listed in table 2 with the corresponding references from which the concentration was selected from their rheological curves in order to increase the density of the solutions we used barite baristar 9015 the barite was supplied by the mineralia company and consisted of 97 68 of baso4 the barite density is 4 4 kg l and the median particle diameter is 3 5 μm we used a barite concentration of 51 w w to obtain the same slurry density as dnapl 1 66 kg l 4 3 preparation of polymer solution all polymer solutions were prepared using demineralized deaerated water by stirring through an overhead stirrer ika rw14 with 200 500 rpm for 1 4 h two solutions were prepared 1 polymer solutions 2 densified polymer solutions with barite 1 the polymer solutions were prepared by hydrating the polymer powder gently in the water while stirring at 500 rpm 2 to prepare densified barite based polymer solutions we first hydrated barite in the water by stirring at 200 rpm for 15 min as mentioned in section 4 1 the concentration of barite solution was 51 w w to obtain the same solution density as dnapl the polymer powders were then added according to table 2 by stirring at 500 rpm for 2 h however hydration of gg powder was more complicated and required up to 4 h every prepared solution was tested for stability using a graduated cylinder all solution preparation and further experiments were conducted at 20 c in a temperature controlled room 4 4 rheological study all polymer solutions were examined using a stress controlled rheometer haake mars 60 thermofisher min torque rotation 0 02 μn m torque resolution 0 1 nn m equipped with cone plate geometry c60 1 ti and tmp60 solutions were characterized using the rheometer with the cone and plate geometry at the abovementioned concentrations and with 20 variation to observe a diverse range of polymer viscosities upon concentration change 1 2 ml of the solution was loaded to the geometry to fill the 0 054 mm shear gap of the geometry the shear rate was recorded versus time corresponding to the given stress each value was obtained when the shear stress variation was less than a prescribed tolerance the maximum measurement time for each shear rate was 60 s the imposed shear stress was established in the range of 0 01 to 100 1 s and the experiments were triplicated for each concentration 4 5 interfacial tension and contact angle study we investigated the interfacial tension ift between polymer solutions and dnapl and their contact angle with glass through a drop shape analyzer dsa 100 kruss to determine the interfacial tension between polymer solutions and dnapl a sealed glass cell cuvette was filled with a polymer solution sample a syringe with the dnapl was then placed in the cuvette and 2 ml of dnapl was loaded into the polymer solution to make a drop interfacial tension was measured by the pendant drop method stauffer 1965 we also measured the contact angle by placing the droplet on the bottom of the cuvette and the young laplace fit estimated the contact angle using kruss s advance software rotenberg et al 1983 5 experimental study in porous media this section presents the materials used experimental setup and procedures 5 1 porous media the porous media experiments are conducted using a glass bead pack provided by sigma aldrich company the columns were filled with calibrated 0 5 mm monodisperse solid glass beads to study the behavior of polymer solution and dnapl displacement in porous media the gbs size was chosen according to the permeability of the contaminated site moreover the gbs prevent any biochemical influence on the study 5 2 experimental setup the prepared polymer solution was injected into the 1d column the experimental setup is presented in fig 3 the polymer solution was pumped using reglo icc digital peristaltic pump ismatec with 0 01 rpm resolution the solution was injected into the 30 cm long 1d column with an internal diameter of 4 cm filled with 0 5 mm glass beads the column is made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe material two metal grids with a cell size of 150 μm retained the gbs on both sides of the column the mass balance mse6202s 000 d0 sartorius is placed after the column to record an effluent mass the differential pressure transmitter rosemount 3051s emerson was used to measure pressure difference along the bead pack 5 3 experimental procedure the columns were thoroughly packed vertically with monodispersed 0 5 mm gbs the gbs packs were used to characterize the polymer solutions behavior in porous media and investigate the dnapl displacement by different polymer solutions after filling the column with the gbs it was checked for leaks by putting it under 1 bar of gas pressure the column was then flushed with co2 gas for 45 min at a 10 ml min flow rate to facilitate water saturation as co2 gas is highly soluble in water demineralized deaerated water was introduced vertically upwards into the column at a 1 ml min flow rate to saturate the bead pack by entirely dissolving co2 gas the column was weighed before and after the water saturation step to determine the pore volume pv 130 ml i e the porosity 0 37 after complete water saturation the permeability was measured by measuring the pressure drop along the column for different imposed flow rates using darcy s law eq 1 the measured properties of the bead pack are tabulated in table 3 a specific polymer solution was pumped horizontally into a bead pack to study the behavior of polymer solutions in the porous medium by measuring a pressure drop along the column then the apparent viscosity is derived from darcy s law eq 1 the polymer flow was studied at various flow rates gradually increasing from the minimum q 0 2 ml min u 2 65 10 06 m s to the maximum q 5 0 ml min u 6 63 10 05 m s technically possible values the experiments were duplicated at least by progressively reducing the flow rates and each flow rate was tested for at least 3 pvs injected the irreducible water saturation s irw was established by injecting 2 pv of dnapl from the bottom to the top of the water saturated column with 1 ml min flow rate and the mean s irw is presented in table 3 then the polymer solution was introduced horizontally into the bead pack all polymer solutions were stirred during the injection with 100 rpm the fluid flow in the column was investigated by measuring the pressure drop with pressure transmitters to assess dnapl recovery we collected the effluent in graduated cylinders we used several graduated cylinders for each column the first was used to collect the pre breakthrough dnapl production and the others to get the effluent after the breakthrough consequently the dnapl recovery was determined using the mass and volume of the effluent 6 upscaling geometry characteristics of the microstructure the study was conducted in two periodic 3d and four different 2d unit cells as omirbekov et al 2020b which theoretical background is presented in section 3 2 and 3 3 the types of unit cells with their porosity values are presented in fig 4 with a square packed cylinders with a circular cross section spc b square packed cylinders with a square cross section sps c dense packed cylinders with a circular cross section dpc d dense packed cylinders with a square cross section dps e simple cubic packing of cubes scp f cubic body centered packing of spheres bcp the edge size of all unit cells was 0 5 mm to be close to the grain size of 0 5 mm gbs the permeability was prearranged to be 2 27 10 10 m2 by solving the closure problems for newtonian fluids quintard and whitaker 1994 whitaker 1999 one should note that the selected unit cells should have the same porosity and permeability as the experimental sample in addition the geometric structures should be the same in terms of disorder here we considered ordered geometries where the porosity values for spc sps scp and bcp cells were roughly close to the porosity of gbs packing the porosity of the dpc and dps geometries was high for the same permeability value 7 results and discussion 7 1 development of densified polymer solutions the stability of prepared polymer solutions was tested using graduated cylinders the study aimed to develop a dense barite suspended polymer solution to decrease residual dnapl saturation in polluted soil as mentioned in the section 4 3 we studied first polymer solutions and then polymer solutions with barite 7 1 1 polymer solutions fig 5 shows polymer solutions stability a 10 min after the preparation and b after 1 day we observed that the cmc solution is more transparent than the xg and gg solutions after one day there was no change in the cmc and xg solutions however we noticed the gg solution s inhomogeneity in which we observed the accumulation of turbid solution on the graduated cylinder bottom this phenomenon can result from the weak dissolution of guar gum in water at low temperatures casas et al 2000 found that only 88 of guar gum fraction can be solved at low temperatures 25 c which can be increased to 91 at 80 c 7 1 2 densification of polymer solutions with barite the same procedure was carried out to determine the polymer stability sedimentation test with barite the barite concentration was 51 w w fig 6 shows the stability test of polymer solutions with barite where we plotted the suspension s sedimentation volume water separation from the suspension as a time function we noticed obvious barite precipitation in the xg solution according to the result the most stabilized case was observed for the cmc solution where the suspension volume was decreased only for 5 ml 2 in 2 days the solution with the gg polymer showed an intermediate result moreover the barite precipitation was insignificant compared to the barite based xg solution in which the precipitation rate was very significant appendix fig 19 also presents photos of the stability test taken 10 min and one day after the solution s preparation 7 2 characterization of polymer solution in section 4 all the polymer solutions were described by investigating rheology interfacial tensions and contact angle on the glass polymer solutions were studied instantly after preparation also the polymer solutions with and without barite particles flow results in the water saturated bead pack are presented to investigate the apparent polymer viscosity in the porous medium 7 2 1 polymer solutions the viscosity of different polymer solutions as a function of shear rate is presented in fig 7 the carreau model well fits the results and the fitting parameters with 95 confidence intervals are tabulated in table 4 the fitting parameters with 95 confidence intervals were found by nonlinear regression using the matlab curve fitting toolbox from the result we can observe the different rheological characteristics of the polymers the xg solution behaves as a non newtonian fluid demonstrating assertive shear thinning behavior over a wide range of shear rates from the fitting parameter of viscosity μ 0 at zero shear rate is a positive value including the 95 confidence interval moreover the carreau model is the best fit model for xg solution among seven different rheological models according to the studies of cao et al 2016 the cmc solutions behaved as a shear thickening fluid at lower shear rates 0 01 0 10 1 s as a newtonian fluid at intermediate shear rates 0 10 10 1 s a shear thinning behavior was noticed at higher shear rates 10 100 1 s benchabane and bekkour 2008 observed different flow behavior depending on the cmc concentration from 0 2 to 5 0 and noticed no yield stress for all concentrations at the concentration of 0 4 as in our case they noticed two shear thinning behaviors over two ranges of shear rates separated by a plateau zone at medium shear rates 1 15 1 s above the concentration of 1 they initially observed shear thickening behavior followed by a shear thinning behavior at a given shear rate describing the resulting change in the behavior of the flow curves they presented two critical shear rates 1 up to when newtonian fluid behavior exhibits 2 after the newtonian plateau value at medium shear rate following this they fitted their results well using the cross model cross 1965 above the first critical shear rate however our outcome is close to the description of cmc concentration above 1 which behaves as a shear thickening fluid at low shear rates 0 01 0 10 1 s exhibited a newtonian fluid behavior at medium shear rates 0 1 10 1 s and shear thinning behavior is observed when the shear rate is further increased 10 100 1 s this type of difference in results might be because the properties of cmc differ depending on molecular weight and among manufacturers as escudier et al 2001 reported following the benchabane and bekkour 2008 study we fitted the cmc results using the carreau model even though it does not represent well at low shear rates 0 01 0 10 1 s hence we can observe that the cmc data was not fitted well at low shear rates due to the complex rheological behavior of the cmc therefore we can state that the obtained parameter of μ 0 is not accurate including the confidence interval the gg solution flowed as a shear thinning fluid the discrepancy bar on the experimental results at lower shear rates was high based on the triplicated results which is related to the low solubility of the gg powder in water at 20 c as shown in fig 5 7 2 2 effect of barite on the polymer viscosity in fig 8 the viscosity is plotted as a function of the shear rate for the dense barite based polymer solutions one may observe an impact of the barite on the solutions viscosity barite increased viscosities of gg and cmc solutions compared to barite free ones because the barite concentration is significant where the solid volume fraction is 19 4 of total suspension volume suspension viscosity can vary depending on the solid fraction eilers 1941 vand 1948 the particle size senapati et al 2010 and the liquid viscosity konijn et al 2014 from the classical study by eilers 1941 and vand 1948 in a newtonian fluid a suspension with a solid fraction of 20 increases the suspension viscosity by about a factor of two although suspension properties such as particle diameter and liquid viscosity were different for instance eilers 1941 studied suspension viscosity on various solid fractions where the liquid viscosity was 1000 mpa s and a particle diameter of 2 7 μm while vand 1948 investigated suspensions with a particle diameter of 50 80 μm in a liquid with a viscosity of 80 mpa s in our study the viscosity of cmc increased five times from 0 15 to 0 76 pa s at a shear rate of 0 10 1 s the barite cmc solution behaves as a shear thinning fluid and the viscosity is more significant at low shear rates than the barite free cmc solution also the same behavior was observed for the barite gg solution s viscosity which is also roughly higher five times compared to the barite free solution at the 0 10 1 s shear rate specifically this is very noticeable at lower shear rates up to γ 1 00 1 s we noticed that cmc and gg solutions also increases the suspension viscosity comparably with a suspension based on newtonian fluids nevertheless the similar behavior was not observed for the barite xg solution at the low shear rates up to 0 02 1 s the barite xg solution viscosity was higher than the barite free xg solution only 20 above the shear rate of 0 04 1 s we observed an inverse phenomenon the barite free xg solution s viscosity was higher than the xg solution with barite from 19 to 81 in the range of shear rates 0 04 2 00 1 s the instability due to the quick decantation of barite particles in the xg polymer solution can explain this phenomenon as was noticed in the stability tests presented in fig 6 hence the barite based xg and gg solutions were not investigated in further 1d column experiments in fig 9 we plotted only the barite cmc solution with the fit curve by the carreau model the carreau model fitted the experimental data very well compared to the barite free cmc solution rheology shown in fig 7 as the newtonian viscosity plateau was observed up to a shear rate of 0 10 1 s the fitting of cmc rheology data with the carreau model was mostly studied in the literature amirnia et al 2013 escudier et al 2001 strnadel et al 2011 consequently this fitting data with the 95 confidence intervals presented in table 4 will be used as input parameters to study the behavior of the barite cmc solution over different 2d and 3d geometry inclusions in order to better characterize the fluid behavior in porous media we also investigated the interfacial tension and contact angle of fluids on glass material 7 2 3 interfacial tension and contact angle between dnapl and polymer solutions table 5 presents the results of dnapl interfacial tensions in various polymer solutions and cas on the glass surface according to colombano et al 2021 the dnapl water interfacial tension is 10 96 0 05 mn m and the contact angle with water on a glass surface is 119 33 4 16 our results found that the ift and contact angle of both cmc and gg solutions are higher than that obtained with distilled water however adding barite reduced the ift insignificantly i e for 6 8 we also noticed a decrease in the dnapl contact angle in the barite cmc solution on glass where the contact angle was reduced by 13 41 the contact angle of dnapl in the barite gg solution was not determined accurately because the solution was not stable for a certain time consequently these results are used to estimate the dnapl displacement in porous media 7 3 dnapl displacement model in porous media the multiphase flow of immiscible liquids such as napl in a porous medium is in fact a multiscale transport process the relative influence of capillary viscous and gravitational forces acting on many microscopic interfaces determines the overall flow characteristics during the dnapl displacement in porous media in order to characterize the dnapl displacement in the bead pack using the polymer solutions mentioned above the n bo is calculated to assess the effect of gravity forces bond numbers are respectively equal to 1 31 10 1 and 1 19 10 1 for the cmc and gg solutions in the dnapl zone where ρ 0 then n bo 0 thus the n bo is less than the critical value i e 10 3 according to gioia et al 2003 where the gravitation forces are insufficient to sweep the dnapl positioned on the bedrock having obtained the same density by adding the barite we discharged the impact of gravity forces to deal only with capillary forces in this case viscous forces play a crucial role to illustrate the dnapl displacement by polymer solutions we consider a typical phase diagram of lenormand et al 1988 it is believed that the simple case describes the flow s main characteristics without considering heat and mass transfer compressibility and rheological effects the pore scale flow is governed by the interaction of capillary and viscous forces and can be characterized using the capillary number n ca and the viscosity ratio m r fig 10 presents the calculated n ca and m r for all polymer solutions with and without barite particles the logarithms of the viscosity ratios are positive and the calculated capillary numbers are above the capillary fingering i e at the intermediate zone it is possible to enhance the displacing fluid viscosity by increasing the polymer concentration however this may negatively impact the environment by raising the injection pressure that tends to erode the aquifer or uplift the soil thus the fluids presented in fig 10 are experimentally studied in a 1d porous column to investigate dnapl displacement and verify our expectations 7 4 polymer solutions apparent viscosity in porous media before investigating the dnapl displacement by polymer solutions we first examined them in 1d porous column as a single phase flow experiment to study their behavior in a porous medium fig 11 plotted polymer solutions apparent viscosity outcomes in porous media p m and shear viscosity within the rheometer bulk exp as a function of shear rate the shear rate in porous media was calculated using eq 3 as shown in the rheogram cmc and xg solutions apparent viscosity values were lower than those of the shear viscosity measured using rheometer at the lower shear rates below 0 5 1 s the apparent viscosity of cmc in the porous medium is on the trendline of the shear viscosity however at shear rates above 0 5 1 s the apparent viscosity of cmc decreased slightly compared to the shear viscosity of the cmc as the shear rate increased thus dropping by roughly 30 at a shear rate of 8 0 1 s the xg shear viscosity was less i e 0 5 pa s in p m vs 0 8 pa s in bulk at 0 4 1 s than the apparent viscosity until the shear rate of 6 1 1 s but became lower for 0 02 pa s when the shear rate exceeded 8 0 1 s polymer retention in porous media includes three main mechanisms polymer adsorption mechanical entrapment and hydrodynamic retention dominguez and willhite 1977 mechanical entrapment and hydrodynamic retention occur only when flowing through a porous medium and cannot be observed in bulk solution experiments in a rheometer therefore the apparent viscosity of polymers in porous media differs from the shear viscosity in rheometer the α shift parameter is commonly used to relate the viscosity of polymers in and out of porous media the gg solution s viscosity results were very different than xg and cmc and were significantly higher in porous media i e 0 09 pa s vs 0 90 pa s at the shear rate of 0 80 1 s because of the gg solution s poor solubility in water presented in section 7 1 1 it tends to clog pores increasing inaccessible pore volume ipv sheng 2011 in fig 12 we plotted the apparent and shear viscosity of barite cmc solution as a function of shear rate the results were in good agreement with the carreau model the fitting parameters tabulated in table 4 the apparent viscosity of the barite cmc solution was higher than the shear viscosity which was not the case only for the cmc solution where shear viscosity showed higher values than apparent viscosity see fig 11 moreover from the fitting parameter we observed that the viscosity at zero shear rate μ 0 is more important in porous media and this is the consequence of the permeability reduction due to an increase in ipv in order to verify permeability reduction after each experiment the 1d columns were flushed with water for two days consequently a reduction in the permeability of the porous medium was observed as presented in table 6 one may notice a significant diminution of permeability by polymer solutions from the outcomes in particular the gg solution reduced the permeability by 22 times while the xg and cmc solutions only decreased it by three in addition the decrease in permeability was noticeable by a factor of 48 for the barite cmc solution as a result we noticed that the deposition of barite particles tends to reduce the permeability of porous media and it is much more significant than the cmc alone 7 5 dnapl recovery in porous media this section shows the 1d column experiments that were carried out to investigate the polymer solutions flow in porous media the cmc gg xg polymers and barite cmc solutions were injected into the dnapl saturated bead packs the dnapl production and calculated capillary number are presented as a function of the pore volume 7 5 1 dnapl recovery by polymer solutions the polymer solutions were injected horizontally after saturation with dnapl as mentioned in section 5 3 the irreducible water saturation was 16 00 0 50 fig 13 shows the cumulative dnapl production as a function of the polymer volume injected in pv units the breakthrough of xg and gg polymer solutions without barite occurred around 0 72 pv of polymer injection while the breakthrough of the cmc alone and cmc with barite solution was 0 01 pv later at 0 73 pv the outcomes show a difference in the production rates after the breakthrough the dnapl production rate for the cmc and the barite cmc solution was 5 7 higher than the xg and gg solutions for 0 1 pv after the breakthrough 1 pv more polymer solutions were pumped after the breakthrough to maximize the dnapl recovery as a result the dnapl recovery factor reached up to 86 1 0 8 85 4 2 and 84 8 0 7 for cmc gg and xg polymers respectively before starting the experiments with the polymer solutions we tried to mobilize dnapl only using water the results show that just up to 40 2 of dnapl was removed from the system this is all the lower as the recovery yield reaches up to 60 in the pump and treat method colombano et al 2020a 2020b itrc 2002 stroo et al 2012 the polymers improved the dnapl mobilization up to 85 which is twice as higher than flushing by water since the polymer increased the viscosity of displacing fluid moreover the recovery factor for cmc barite suspension was 93 18 1 2 consequently adding barite to the cmc polymer reduced the dnapl residual saturation in 1d columns twice from 13 9 to 6 8 in fig 14 we plotted the residual dnapl percentage saturation results obtained by different fluids as a function of capillary number presented on a logarithmic scale as shown the injection of polymer solutions improved the dnapl recovery thereby decreasing the residual saturation the residual saturation commonly decreases with an increase in capillary number observed in this figure following the power law function presented by the dashed blue line however the capillary number of xg polymer was high due to the highest viscosity value at the shear rate of 1 92 1 s presented in fig 7 7 5 2 assessment of dnapl recovery in fig 10 in section 7 3 we plotted the capillary numbers based on shear viscosity at a single shear rate 1 92 1 s we assumed a steady state flow at a velocity of 1 m day and calculated an equivalent shear rate to assess the dnapl recovery from the 1d column by the presented polymer solutions we plotted capillary numbers in logarithmic scale as a function of the injected pore volume in fig 15 the light blue area represents the capillary fingering area demonstrated based on the phase diagram of lenormand et al 1988 see fig 10 in this plot the capillary number in porous media was calculated using the following equation 18 n cpm k p σ which is an alternative definition of eq 6 by substituting velocity with darcy s law eq 1 this allows us to define the capillary number change in porous media without representing the shear rate based on the measured pressure drop across the 1d column fig 15 shows the change in capillary number during polymer injection at a constant injection flow rate of 1 ml min note that the permeability parameter k is chosen as an absolute value measured by water see table 3 because the polymer solutions were pumped at a constant rate changes in fluid mobility relative permeabilities viscosities affect the pressure drop measured across the column the measured pressure differences hence the capillary numbers constantly increased to the breakthrough since the injected fluid s viscosity is much higher than dnapl specifically the barite cmc capillary number i e the pressure gradient in fig 20 crossed the critical capillary number line 1 0 10 04 immediately after injection of 0 1 pv the capillary numbers were constant for the barite cmc cmc and xg solutions after some time behind the breakthrough however we observed an increase in the pressure gradient curve for the gg polymer even after the breakthrough point this is related to gg s poor solubility in the stability test discussed in section 7 1 1 moreover the pressure gradient after the breakthrough increased further revealing a decrease in the bead pack permeability due to pore clogging by increasing ipv 7 6 upscaling results to link lab scale experiments with pore scale data numerical upscaling using the homogenization method can be useful in evaluating effective parameters such as velocity as mentioned in section 6 we have tested different geometrical settings in the numerical homogenization framework to investigate the upscaling technique of polymer flooding fig 16 shows a plot of the superficial velocity of xg solution as a function of the pressure gradient in various 2d and 3d unit cells the experimental results have a good agreement for small px up to 11 000 pa m with 2d spc and sps geometric models in contrast the resolution on 3d scp represents well the intermediate pressure gradient i e between 11 000 and 17 000 pa m the 2d dpc and dps outcomes describe well the highest applied pressure gradient at 5 ml min i e u 6 63 10 05 m s on the cross sectional area of the 1d column a 1 26 10 03 m2 fig 17 presents the cmc solution s superficial velocity vs pressure gradient outcomes the upscaling results are in good agreement at low pressure gradients while the deviation of the results increases with increasing pressure gradient this can be explained by the rheological behavior of the cmc solution which behaves as a newtonian fluid at the intermediate shear rates 0 10 10 1 s and becomes a shear thinning fluid with increasing shear rate i e velocity see fig 11 from fig 11 we noticed that the apparent viscosity of cmc is lower than the shear viscosity at a given shear rate it even lowers as the shear rate i e velocity increases since the upscaling input is a shear viscosity the experimental velocity is greater than the predicted velocity by the upscaling the rise in velocity deviation by increasing pressure gradients follows the same trend but reverses as viscosity decreases even the reduction in permeability due to adsorption see table 6 did not affect to decrease in velocity consequently the effective velocity with specific geometry can be used to describe the flow in the homogenization theory the periodic boundary condition for the unit cell problem cannot be realistic in macro scale observation the upscaling results with 1d column experimental data of the barite cmc solution are plotted in fig 18 we observed similar behavior at lower pressure gradients as cmc solution flow from the results contrary to the cmc solution the upscaling results represented significantly higher velocities at certain pressure gradients than experimental outcomes as in the cmc solution results the deviation in upscaling results increases with increasing velocity evidently showing geometry s impact on the solution flow indeed this is due to the deposition of barite particles in porous media that resulted in permeability reduction of the porous media according to the water flushing after the experiments the permeability is reduced by a factor of 48 after the barite cmc solution injection compared to the absolute permeability which is 15 times lower than the permeability obtained after only the cmc injection in general the difference in apparent and shear viscosity of polymer depends on polymer degradation due to chemical and mechanical forces inaccessible pores and adsorption of polymers on pore surfaces since our porous media is made of monodispersed glass beads we may exclude the effect of inaccessibility of pores but the deposition of barite particles reduced the permeability of porous media moreover the extension thickening behavior of polymers resulting in elastic turbulence cannot be neglected therefore the polymer retention and adsorption barite deposition in porous media and extension thickening behavior of polymers cannot be represented using only shear viscosity data especially in more complex flow fields as in realistic cases without any assumptions this study attempted to upscale suspended non newtonian fluid using shear viscosity results as input parameters 8 summary and conclusion this work presents a study of biopolymers and densification of polymer solutions for soil remediation the stability of biopolymers with and without barite particles was investigated to select the most stable polymer the rheology of polymer solutions with and without barite was examined through a rheometer to study displacing fluid behavior the solutions were also injected into a porous medium to compare and investigate polymer behavior on porous media the experimental data of shear and apparent viscosity were fitted by the carreau rheological model and analyzed biopolymers and densified polymer solutions were studied numerically in different 2d and 3d unit cells the results were analyzed by comparison with experimental data from the 1d porous column hence we draw the following conclusions the xg and cmc polymers dissolve well at low temperatures compared to the gg polymer that showed lower solubility during the stability test the cmc solution showed the best stability with barite micro particles and the barite increases the polymer viscosity the rheological behavior of polymers fits well with the carreau model except for the cmc without barite the shear viscosity measured through rheometer differs from the apparent viscosity due to polymer adsorption on pore surfaces and barite deposition in porous media the permeability was reduced by a factor of three for the cmc and xg solutions and the barite cmc reduced the permeability by 48 times the barite cmc solution improved the remediation yield of dnapl and adding barite to the cmc polymer decreased the residual saturation by a factor of two upscaling results are in good agreement with experimental outcomes of the xg cmc and barite cmc at low pressure gradients the geometry affects polymer flow in porous media especially at high pressure gradients in this respect the use of the latest developments in darcy scale models is very promising especially with new models able to take into account the complex

1236,interest in using contaminant mass discharge cmd for risk assessment of contaminated sites has increased over the years as it accounts for the contaminant mass that is moving and posing a risk to water resources and receptors the most common investigation of cmd involves a transect of multilevel wells however this is an expensive undertaking and it is difficult to place it in the right position in a plume additionally infrastructure at the site needs to be considered to derive an initial cmd estimate at a contaminated site and to allow for the prioritization of further investigations and remedial actions the profileflux method has been developed it is targeted at former industrial sites with a source zone in a low conductivity layer with primarily vertical flow overlying an aquifer with primarily horizontal groundwater flow the profileflux method was developed for mature chlorinated solvent plumes typically originating from more than 30 to 50 year old spills as the usage of chlorinated solvents is mainly historical thus it is assumed that the contaminant had time to distribute in the low conductivity layer by mainly diffusive processes today the contamination is continuously released to the underlying aquifer where advection and dispersive other than diffusive processes are of higher importance the approach combines high resolution depth discrete vertical concentration profiles and a simple 2d flow and transport model to estimate cmd by comparing measured and simulated concentration profiles in the aquifer the study presented herein includes a global sensitivity analysis in order to identify crucial field parameters and of particular importance in this regard are source length groundwater flux and infiltration the profileflux method was tested at a well examined industrial site primarily contaminated with trichloroethylene thereby allowing a comparison between cmd from the profileflux method and the traditional transect method cmd was estimated at 117 170 g year when using the profileflux method against 143 g year with the transect method thus validating profileflux method s ability to estimate cmd in addition applying the method identified weak points in the conceptual site model the method will be incorporated into a user friendly online tool directed at environmental consultants and decision makers working on the risk assessment and prioritization of contaminated sites with the specific hydrogeological conditions of an aquifer with an overlying low permeability layer keywords contaminant flux depth discrete concentration profiles contaminant plume risk assessment groundwater solute transport model data availability the data used for this study is presented in the paper alongside the equations needed to set up the model 1 introduction due to modern society s previous usage of chemicals such as chlorinated solvents petroleum hydrocarbons per polyfluoroalkyl substances and pesticides contaminated sites abound worldwide often contamination is located in low permeability layers overlying aquifers falta 2005 chambon et al 2010 2011 filippini et al 2020 where contaminants can be stored and released over a long period of time the migration of dissolved contaminants from these sites into underlying aquifers poses a risk to groundwater systems and drinking water resources and ultimately human and environmental receptors when risk assessing contaminated sites contaminant mass discharge cmd can be used to evaluate the risk to receptors downgradient of a source and to prioritize the need to remediate different contaminated sites einarson and mackay 2001 troldborg et al 2008 newell et al 2011 einarson 2017 rønde et al 2017 furthermore it is used to evaluate source zone remediation and natural plume attenuation kao and wang 2001 national research council 2005 brooks et al 2008 fraser et al 2008 fjordbøge et al 2012 horneman et al 2017 although cmd provides an integrated flow and contaminant concentration response which enables a risk based assessment of the impact on water resources most practitioners and decision makers still adhere to generic concentration based water quality standards at a given point downgradient of a source horst et al 2021 listed three main factors explaining why the cmd approach is not fully incorporated into contaminated site risk assessments 1 a lack of technical adeptness by practitioners 2 the need to develop robust cmd assessments and 3 a lack of alignment regarding compliance metrics when using cmd cmd describes the mass of a contaminant transported through a control plane per unit of time cmd is most commonly evaluated in a vertical control plane perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction in an aquifer downgradient of a source zone e g newell et al 2011 verreydt et al 2012 in the control plane point measurements covering the width and depth of the plume are often collected by using multiple sampling points over depth traditional wells or multilevel samplers e g kao and wang 2001 freitas et al 2011 troldborg et al 2012 albeit passive flux meters pfms have also been developed and applied in this regard e g annable et al 2005 verreydt et al 2011 ottosen et al 2020 both methods require many measurement points to ensure adequate sample density and to minimize uncertainty in the cmd estimate li and abriola 2009 troldborg et al 2010 2012 brooks et al 2015 balbarini et al 2018 furthermore the placement of a transect is difficult as it should be neither too close nor too far away from the source zone and so it often takes several attempts to achieve a proper transect for cmd determination hence it can be an expensive metric to evaluate and we therefore need faster and cheaper methods for an initial estimate of the cmd in order to evaluate and prioritize further investigation or remediation of contaminated sites at an early stage field investigations and risk assessments in heterogeneous glacial sediments such as clay till have proven particularly difficult due to the existence of fractures fissures and sand lenses which can potentially create preferential transport paths kessler et al 2012 furthermore the matrix can store contaminants and act as a secondary source through back diffusion falta 2005 chambon et al 2010 chambon et al 2011 and locatelli et al 2019 have developed risk assessment models describing the vertical transport of dissolved contaminants through clay till coupled with horizontal transport in the underlying aquifer the focus of both models is on dissolved contaminant concentration in the aquifer and they do not focus on cmd for these heterogeneous geological settings and or complex contaminant plumes the high resolution depth discrete characterization of both hydraulic properties and contaminant concentrations is important in order to improve our understanding of the key processes driving the cmd and to refine conceptual site models e g suthersan et al 2016 steelman et al 2020 coupling field site investigations with transport models is a valuable practice as it helps to understand contaminant transport better essouayed et al 2021 presented a method for an iterative source localization strategy at a chlorinated solvent site that merged field site measurements and 2d modeling as well as used the results to improve the conceptual site model however this was done in a sandy aquifer with a focus on locating the source zone at a contaminated site and did not include depth discrete sampling or the estimation of cmd thus we see a need as requested by horst et al 2021 for new and robust methods for assessing cmd emanating from clay till sites which can be adapted by practitioners using existing field techniques the transect method is already used to evaluate cmd and is applied at many sites however as discussed it is an expensive method and it is often difficult to get the placement of the wells correct and can take several field campaigns to fully delineate the plume and estimate the cmd with this in mind we present a novel concept herein namely the profileflux method to estimate the cmd of dissolved contaminants from a point source located in a low permeability layer into an underlying aquifer without utilizing a traditional control plane of multiple expensive and permanently installed sampling points over depth the estimate is done using knowledge of the source zone the flow field and high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles in the aquifer along the plume center line this is coupled with a 2d solute transport model developed specifically for sources located in clay till settings comparing field site measurements with contamination simulations allows for a better understanding of contaminant migration and the conceptual site model a cmd estimate is achievable with less intensive data collection than the traditional transect method and can indicate whether a traditional transect method estimation needs to be done this paper aims to 1 present the approach and prerequisites of the cmd estimation method 2 identify governing parameters via a global sensitivity analysis using a 2d solute transport model and 3 apply the approach at a field site including a discussion of the water balance and inferred updates of the conceptual site model the work is developed and tested on a typical danish industrial site contaminated with trichloroethylene tce located in clay till settings overlying a sandy aquifer in order to create a risk assessment tool that can be used for contaminated sites located in similar settings 2 conceptual model and the profileflux method the profileflux method has been developed for geological settings where chlorinated solvents emanate from a low permeability clay till unit into a high permeability aquifer e g sand or gravel located below the main idea is that high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles are the footprints of site specific parameters such as flow system contaminant source strength and length and the actual cmd from the source zone mcnab et al 2000 the profileflux method comprises the following three steps 1 initial site investigations to characterize the contaminated site in terms of the approximate extent of the source zone contaminant concentration in clay till flow direction and hydraulic properties of the system fig 1a 2 an investigation into contaminants in the aquifer where high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles are gathered along the center line of the plume both from within the source zone and at different distances downgradient thereof fig 1b 3 a comparison between measured and simulated concentration profiles in order to estimate cmd a 2d solute transport model is used to simulate these concentration profiles by adjusting site specific parameters within a given range until a good agreement between the simulated and measured profiles is achieved fig 1c the infiltration through and downgradient the source zone will determine how the plume distributes vertically often the infiltration rate is a difficult parameter to determine in clay till as vertical hydraulic conductivity defining the actual infiltration is difficult to measure combining groundwater flow in the aquifer and the vertical concentration profile leads to a fair estimate of infiltration through clay till as the former is often known with a relatively high degree of certainty thus through a combination of measured and simulated concentration profiles we can estimate cmd update our conceptual site model and refine key parameters in the following sections assumptions field parameters and model descriptions are addressed 2 1 assumptions for the profileflux method the profileflux method was developed with simplicity in mind to produce a tool that can be used within the existing field site investigation framework and provide the end user with an estimate of cmd out of the source zone and within the aquifer at a given distance from the source as an alternative a complement to the more expensive and tedious transect method the profileflux method is directed toward legacy sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents which in many parts of the world originate from the 1940s to the 1980s mcguire et al 2004 sale et al 2008 thus they are more than 40 years old and represent mature secondary sources where non aqueous phase solvents have been depleted by dissolution and the chlorinated compounds already distributed by diffusive processes and stored in the clay till matrix parker et al 2008 such source zones in clay till overlying aquifers are relevant for many sites in northern europe and north america e g hønning et al 2007 damgaard et al 2013a 2013b mcguire et al 2004 examined 191 chlorinated solvent sites and found that most 90 of the plumes were stable sale et al 2008 suggested using a 14 compartment model to evaluate the contaminant distribution of chlorinated solvents in four different phases in both the source zone and the plume the four phases are dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl vapour aqueous and sorbed the importance of each phase varies with the geological setting and time since the spill for sources located in low permeability layers and in the middle to late stage of their life span the stored mass in the matrix is the predominant source of contamination to the transmissive zone estcp 2011 as little to no dnapl is present chapman and parker 2005 during the development of the profileflux method the aim was to get an initial robust estimate of cmd from the source and within the plume which resulted in focusing on the saturated zone to keep the method simple the profileflux method therefore only takes dissolved and sorbed contaminants into consideration furthermore degradation is disregarded in the model however if reductive dechlorination products are observed at a site the sum of chlorinated compounds on a molar basis can be used as an input for step 3 chambon et al 2013 as reported by kessler et al 2012 fractures in clay till can act as a preferential transport pathway causing a faster breakthrough of contaminants to an underlying aquifer however a study of clay till at eight sites in denmark and one in canada showed that the fracture aperture often decreases with depth with a clear change at a depth of 3 m below the ground surface m bgs klint et al 2013 aamand et al 2022 the same study found that for 32 different locations fracture spacing increased with depth from around 3 m bgs smaller fracture apertures and fewer fractures will result in a smaller impact on contaminant transport through clay till falta 2005 when reaching clay till deeper than approximately 3 m bgs the importance of these fractures on water flow decreases and so they are not considered in the profileflux method and both clay till and the aquifer are assumed to act like a porous medium therefore not accounting for fractures in clay till 2 2 required site characterization site specific parameters are essential for the reliable simulation of the vertical concentration profile and ultimately a credible estimate of cmd with the profileflux method this section addresses the required field site parameters which can be determined within the framework of a typical site investigation relevant input and output parameters for the profileflux method are shown in fig 2 and listed in table 1 parameters that are field site specific and typically determined in investigations at contaminated sites are assigned a yes in the field column in table 1 other parameters are considered less site specific and or need elaborate field methods like tracer experiments to be determined these are assigned a no in the field column in the following typically measured field parameters are described site investigation methods are diverse and most of the input parameters can be determined using different field equipment techniques for initial site investigations step 1 traditional screened wells will most likely be available borehole logs from these wells are useful in determining geology at the site and the thickness of clay till furthermore properly constructed and screened wells can provide information on the flow field in the system by allowing measurements of the hydraulic head in both clay till and the aquifer devlin and schillig 2017 presented an excel spreadsheet for estimating groundwater flow direction and the head gradient both of which are relevant for site investigations slug tests or other hydraulic test methods can be performed to determine hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer also if hydraulic properties from prior investigations or models in the area are known beforehand they can be considered soil concentrations should be measured to determine the amount of contaminant at the site and to delineate the source zone the soil concentration can be converted into solute concentration using the sorption coefficient k d for unconsolidated settings such as clay till and sandy aquifers direct push methods are valuable as they provide different depth discrete information mccall et al 2014 for instance using a membrane interface probe hydraulic profiling tool mihpt is beneficial for investigating contaminated clay till and the transition zone into the aquifer it provides a depth discrete qualitative signal of contaminant distribution for source zone delineation along with an estimate of the permeability of the subsurface for a more detailed determination of clay till thickness than offered by initial borehole logs an mihpt is also useful for examining the vertical hydraulic gradient at the site as described in rosenberg et al 2022 the profileflux method relies on the use of high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles screen length of around 10 cm with a vertical spacing of 0 5 1 m in the aquifer step 2 several multilevel sampling methods are available tuxen et al 2006 anneser et al 2008 and broholm et al 2016 reviewed a range of commercially available devices a new device not mentioned in broholm et al 2016 is the groundwater profiler system gwp from geoprobe namely a direct push method that samples groundwater from high permeability settings through the use of a syringe pump or bladder pump 20 sample ports are distributed on four sides of the probe resulting in a screen length of around 10 cm dutta et al 2021 all devices benefit from prior knowledge of contaminant levels at depth in order to select appropriate target depths for groundwater sampling and the mihpt is very useful in this regard as well as evaluating sampling depths with suitable permeability when undertaking depth discrete groundwater sampling it is important to define concentrations that delineate the entire thickness of the plume and locate maximum concentrations furthermore to make the most reliable estimate of cmd one should target the expected center line of the contaminant plume based on overall groundwater flow direction mihpt can support the decision on the placement of the depth discrete groundwater samples and sampling across the expected centerline is advised in order to make sure that the center line has been found missing or deviating from the center line in particular for narrow sources will result in an underestimation of the cmd see section 4 2 2 3 flow and solute transport model modeling of the transport of chlorinated solvents through clay till and further downgradient in the aquifer is performed by a classic transient 2d flow and solute transport model with a simplified setup mosthaf et al 2021 the 2d model domain comprises a clay till layer and an aquifer see fig 2 mainly vertical flow and transport through the source area and the clay till are combined with the groundwater flow and transport in the aquifer thereby flow and solute transport are simulated in a vertical cross section in the main groundwater flow direction ideally through the center line of the plume the model domain is extended beyond the source zone and the interval of interest covering the area of interest of the plume in order to reduce the influence of the constant head boundary which would otherwise impede vertical flows in the vicinity on the local flow field a steady state flow is assumed and described by darcy s law and the mass balance as k h 0 with the hydraulic conductivity tensor k and the hydraulic head h as the primary variable constant infiltration is applied at the top boundary and no flow is assumed through the bottom boundary the hydraulic heads on the left and right boundaries are fixed thus creating the overall horizontal hydraulic gradient in the aquifer in the clay till overlying the aquifer advective transport is mainly vertical and driven by infiltrating water whereas in the underlying sandy aquifer the advective transport is predominately horizontal contaminant transport is described by the time dependent advection dispersion equation which can account for sorption ϕr c t ϕcv ϕ d eff c q with porosity ϕ concentration c primary variable retardation factor r seepage velocity v effective hydrodynamic dispersion tensor d eff mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion and sources sinks q all boundaries in the transport domain are set to no flow conditions the contaminant source is implemented as a rectangular area with an initially uniform concentration of dissolved and sorbed chlorinated compounds covering the saturated clay till assuming the chlorinated compounds in the mature contaminant source have been distributed in the matrix by diffusive processes with the length of the determined source zone all other areas are initially set to a concentration of 0 i e the simulation starts when contamination reaches the aquifer the model was implemented in comsol multiphysics v6 0 which has been benchmarked with more complex setups against analytical solutions experimental data and other modeling tools e g chambon et al 2010 jørgensen et al 2019 the model simulates both vertical and horizontal transport and creates vertical concentration profiles downgradient of the source zone which can then be compared to measured concentration profiles input parameters can be adjusted until good accordance between measured and simulated profiles is obtained thus yielding cmd per meter width in the model cmd is multiplied by the approximate width of the source zone in order to make a final estimate of cmd at the investigated field site as the transport model is transient the approximate time when the spill happened should be known part of the modeling result is a breakthrough curve at the distance of the respective concentration profile thereby allowing for evaluating whether contaminant leaching at the field site is in a stable situation pseudo steady state plateau part of breakthrough curve in fig 2 the development of the 2d model approach was based on a comprehensive study at a field site where a detailed 3d model was set up to simulate chlorinated solvent contamination emanating from clay till into a sandy aquifer this was simplified to the 2d model described above comparisons of the 2d model s results with the 3d model s results showed a good agreement with the main difference caused by transverse dispersion which is not resolved in the vertical 2d model setup 2 4 global sensitivity analysis when comparing simulated and measured concentration profiles it is important to identify parameters with a strong impact on the simulated concentration profiles and resulting cmd for a successful application of the profileflux method it is crucial that the most influential parameters on cmd and the depth of the concentration maximum can be easily determined to identify the most relevant parameters a global sensitivity analysis gsa was conducted moreover the results from the gsa would provide guidance on which field parameter would be further investigated if simulated and measured concentration profiles did not match the gsa method employed for this study was the elementary effects method proposed by morris 1991 and refined as suggested by campolongo et al 2007 it evaluates how a change in each input parameter affects output through the use of μ and σ in this case μ is the mean absolute sensitivity of the evaluated output parameter while the standard deviation σ of the sensitivity of a parameter describes uncertainty in these changes campolongo et al 2011 the input parameters examined in the gsa are marked with an x in the gsa column in table 1 along with the investigated parameter range the examined output parameters are cmd plume thickness t plume maximum concentration c max and depth of the maximum concentration d cmax the output parameters were evaluated at 50 m downgradient from the source 50 years after the spill had happened for a thorough description of the gsa see supporting information 1 si1 fig 3 presents the results of the gsa analysis for each output parameter the gray dashed lines mark the first and third quartiles of the resulting values of μ and σ and only parameters above the third quartile are shown with a label the μ and σ values for all parameters can be found in si1 when analyzing the results the most important value is μ as it describes the normalized mean impact of each parameter on the output whereas a high σ value indicates non linear effects or possible interactions with other parameters for all four output parameters the infiltration rate i as well as the source length l s with the exemption of t plume has a significant influence the depth of the maximum concentration d cmax is also sensitive to groundwater flow characterized by i h and k h the gsa of cmd shows that the low sensitivity parameters are the porosities n clay and n aq the distribution coefficient in the aquifer k d aq and vertical dispersivity in the aquifer transverse to the flow direction αv aq parameters with a small influence on the vertical concentration profile t plume c max and d cmax are c 0 n clay n aq k d clay k d aq and α l aq albeit the latter five of these are normally not determined during site investigations the results of the gsa are discussed further in section 4 1 3 application of the profileflux method at a chlorinated solvent site to test the profileflux method it was applied to a tce contaminated site located in denmark in 1962 a factory was established to cut and laminate styrofoam tce was used in the production and consequently released to the subsurface a historical examination has shown that the tce spill likely happened at some point between 1970 and 1996 the geology at the site consists of clay till with a varying thickness of 10 12 m overlying a sandy aquifer the site is described in rosenberg et al 2022 in which a detailed conceptual geological model is provided in fig 4a a plan view of the site is shown and in fig 4b a simplified longitudinal transect of the saturated part of the site is shown the source was determined to be 20 m long and 16 m wide the saturated depth of clay till 5 m infiltration 140 mm year and groundwater flow velocity 14 m year at the site the average vertical hydraulic head gradient was 0 4 m m resulting in vertical hydraulic conductivity in the clay till of 1 11 10 8 m s which is in the lower range found at other danish clay till sites nilsson et al 2001 jørgensen et al 2002 2004 mosthaf et al 2021 this indicates that the simulated infiltration rate was in accordance with the field measurement relating to the vertical hydraulic head gradient sorption coefficients which were measured for research purposes and are normally not expected in a typical site investigation were k d clay 0 87 l kg and k d aq 0 22 l kg the maximum measured solute concentration in the source was 4900 μg l tce therefore no free phase dnapl was expected to be present in total gwps were performed at seven locations after investigating the vertical extent of groundwater contamination using mihpt logs the mihpt logs identified the approximate center line of the plume using the overall flow field as a starting point for the survey one of the gwps was placed at the source area gwp1 on fig 4b three were placed at different distances along the expected center line of the plume gwp2 3 and gwp5 on fig 4b and the other three were placed transversal to the groundwater flow direction at the same distance as gwp5 downgradient of the source there was no indication of any particularly significant reductive dechlorination at the site however cis 1 2 dichloroethylene cis dce was detected in some of the groundwater samples therefore the concentrations used in this example are noted as the sum of chlorinated ethenes tce equivalents tce eq fig 5 presents a comparison between the measured and simulated concentration profiles simulated concentration profiles with three different initial concentrations 1500 μg l 2600 μg l and 3800 μg l are depicted resulting in an estimated cmd of 67 g year 117 g year and 170 g year respectively the simulated concentration profiles are compared to two of the gwps along the expected flow center line gwp3 and gwp5 and gwp6 5 m to the east of gwp5 for both gwp3 and gwp6 the simulated concentration profiles captured the thickness of the measured concentration profile gwp6 shows a close to gaussian shaped concentration profile with the initial source concentration of 3800 μg l comparing well with the maximum measured concentration in terms of both depth and value the simulation of the initial source concentration of 2600 μg l compares well with measurements at around 3 5 m below the clay till layer indicating that cmd at the site is between 117 g year and 170 g year gwp3 showed a more asymmetrical concentration profile with the maximum concentration not captured by the simulation however the simulation did reveal a large proportion of the measured values and the general shape of the concentration profile furthermore the mihpt at this point showed some heterogeneities in the aquifer when evaluating the mihpt pressure log for gwp5 the simulated profile with an initial concentration of 1500 μg l 67 g year compared well with the measured concentration profile relating to the depth and value of the maximum concentration and the thickness of the plume the resulting cmd based on the two gwps in the center line and simulations was between 117 and 170 g year which is in the same range as previously estimated at the site a consulting company niras 2019 estimated the cmd to be 143 g tce year by using the traditional transverse transect method at 50 m downgradient from the source zone the plume was delineated and the cmd estimate was based on 26 well screens with individual concentration and hydraulic conductivity measurements whilst planning the field campaign it was expected that gwp5 would be in the center line of the plume but this was not the case as gwp6 had higher concentrations and yielded higher cmd from the profileflux method furthermore gwp4 and gwp7 showed significantly lower concentrations which confirms that the centerline is around the placement of gwp6 according to historical data relating to the site and knowledge of the thickness of the unsaturated and saturated zones the contaminant started leaching from the saturated zone around 27 40 years ago this is indicated as the gray box on the breakthrough curve in fig 5 highlighting that contamination at the site is in a steady state for both the earliest and latest estimates of time this is also evident from the simulated concentration profiles for gwp3 and gwp6 which reveal the same level of cmd at both 37 and 48 m downgradient of the source equivalent to approximately 1 5 years worth of transport in the aquifer 4 discussion 4 1 robustness and uncertainty of the profileflux method parameters with a strong effect on the results of cmd and the vertical concentration profiles t plume c max and d cmax were identified in the gsa fig 3 most influential parameters are often determined as a part of an initial field investigation at a contaminated site critical parameters which are difficult to estimate according to measurements but which are nevertheless important are infiltration rate i through the clay till and vertical dispersivity α v aq in the aquifer however the unique combination between the infiltration rate in clay till i and the horizontal groundwater flux determines the shape of the vertical concentration profile and the depth of the maximum concentration d cmax hence a good approximation of the groundwater flux allows for determining infiltration through clay till by adjusting the infiltration rate until a good agreement between the simulated and measured d cmax is reached establishing i based on the groundwater flux will furthermore lead to a better and more reliable determination of cmd as i is the second most sensitive parameter when estimating cmd regarding dispersivities in the aquifer the vertical dispersivity α v aq only affects t plume significantly which means that the other two parameters describing the vertical concentration profile c max and d cmax can still be determined with reasonable certainty furthermore α v aq does not influence cmd estimates and should be kept at a certain low value in the millimeter scale based on literature bjerg et al 2011 a high α v aq value will lead to a poor comparison the longitudinal dispersivity α l aq is of minor importance and fairly good values exist from tracer experiments and field observations jensen et al 1993 bjerg et al 2011 and the literature review by schulze makuch 2005 in general the least influential parameters are fortunately those requiring laboratory measurements n clay n aq k d clay k d aq which suits the objectives of the profileflux method the method is developed for initial investigations of cmd at a contaminated site where comprehensive lab work has not been carried out from the gsa the source length l s is shown to have a significant impact on the results of both the vertical concentration profiles t plume c max and d cmax and the estimated cmd and it is therefore important to obtain a good estimate of this parameter in the case of the application at the danish field site described in section 3 l s was determined by using a combination of soil concentrations above 1 mg tce kg soil solute concentrations from clay till above 1000 μg tce l and mihpt logs when using profileflux the source zone should be viewed as the place at which the contaminant enters the aquifer sand lenses and other heterogeneities in clay till can cause a shift in the placement of the contaminant source at depth kessler 2012 for this type of investigation a field method such as mihpt is useful for establishing the location of chlorinated ethenes an important quantity for the profileflux method is the depth from the bottom of the clay till to the groundwater sampling points at some sites the transition from clay till to the underlying aquifer is very sharp i e a narrow depth interval while at other sites the change is gradual over a greater depth interval resulting in a transition zone between the two geological units the choice of the location of the bottom of the clay till will have an effect on the comparison between the measured and simulated vertical concentration profiles when the transition zone has a significant thickness it is suggested to treat half of it as clay till and the other half as the sandy aquifer when applying field site parameters to the 2d transport model step 3 with an mihpt the transition zone can easily be observed using the pressure log rosenberg et al 2022 4 2 data requirements and field methods the use of depth discrete concentration profiles is essential for the profileflux method and should ideally be sampled along the expected center line of the contaminant plume in total four or five vertical concentration profiles with a high resolution e g 50 100 cm intervals with short screens of around 10 cm should be made both along and across the center line of the contaminant plume in order to increase the probability of hitting the center line this is a critical point as deviations from the center line will reduce the cmd estimates in particular for narrow sources it is recommended to optimize the position of the concentration profiles by mihpt measurements across the center line it should also be noted that the cmd is proportional to the source width and sensitive to the source length as discussed above thus focus on the initial delineation and geometry of the source is recommended in the application of the profileflux method the vertical concentration profiles should be performed at a distance away from the source that is in perspective to groundwater flow velocity this is done by considering the same aspects as for the transect method time from the spill clay till thickness and the likelihood of the contaminant plume having reached passed the point of interest multiple profiles along the center line of the plume at different distances away from the source zone will allow for evaluating whether the contaminant plume is growing stable or depleting from the application at the site presented in section 3 gwp3 and gwp6 taken along the observed center line of the contaminant plume at distances from the source of 37 and 48 m showed that the estimated cmd was the same thereby indicating a stable plume between the two gwps the differences between the estimated cmds based on gwp5 and gwp6 same downgradient distance were 67 and 170 g year respectively which is a factor of 2 5 between two points that are 5 m apart this is based on measured maximum concentrations of 915 and 2049 μg l respectively and shows the importance of more than one sampling point across the center line of the contaminant plume site specific parameters can be found by using various field methods as described previously with parameters that most likely will show spatial variations e g k h at different locations it is possible to consider several simulated concentration profiles and to evaluate which value results in the best accordance for all of the measured vertical concentration profiles using the comparison between the simulated and measured vertical concentration profiles can add knowledge of the contaminated site as poor accordance indicates knowledge gaps regarding geology hydrogeology the contaminant source or plume different combinations of infiltration rate and groundwater flux can lead to similar profiles however constraining the groundwater flux based on measurements of the hydraulic conductivity and the gradient allows constraining the solutions as mentioned previously comparing the simulated and measured vertical concentration profiles using the site specific groundwater flux allows for evaluating the infiltration rate i this acquired value can be compared to the assumed expected value of i as well as checked using measurements of i v and k v if the resulting values of k v i and i v are within the expected ranges the estimate of i is reasonable furthermore if the simulated and measured vertical concentration profiles only compare well by extensively changing the field site parameters this can be an indication that further field site investigations are required this is also the case if these changes result in unrealistic input parameter values e g overly high infiltration rates this means that applying the profileflux method can contribute to a much better conceptual site model which is a very strong additional benefit of the approach 4 3 can the profileflux method be applied in other geological settings and for other contaminants applying the profileflux method to other geological settings is possible however it is important to keep in mind that the model is made for a source zone located in a low permeability layer with a primarily vertical flow and the aquifer has considerably higher hydraulic conductivity with a primarily horizontal and stable flow this combination of a low permeability layer overlying a high permeability aquifer should be present when applying the profileflux method to other geological settings as a strong difference in hydraulic conductivity is important with regards to the soil type and our understanding of the stable source and plume both the low permeability layer and the aquifer should be only moderately heterogeneous which for the low permeability layer means no significant fractures and groundwater flow conditions need to be stable the method is also applicable to geological settings with fractures in the clay till for such settings the model has to be adjusted to account for fracture matrix interactions e g with a discrete fracture matrix model chambon et al 2010 2011 locatelli et al 2019 in order to include the effects of preferential flow and matrix diffusion on the contaminant leaching out of the source zone when the profileflux method is used at chlorinated solvent sites initial investigations using mihpt are beneficial as e g the halogen specific xsd detector can detect these other volatile contaminants e g btex petroleum hydrocarbons can also be detected using mihpt equipped with a suitable detector using mihpt for initial screening of the contaminant distribution is not possible for non volatile contaminants such as pesticides however the hpt is still valuable for a hydrogeological description of the site the profileflux method is still applicable for such contaminants as the source zone and hydrogeological setting have the same effect on the contaminant spreading and the resulting vertical concentration profiles as in the case of chlorinated ethenes it should however be noted that degradation of the contaminants will affect the vertical concentration profiles as discussed in studies for pesticides tuxen et al 2006 and for btex anneser et al 2008 4 4 contaminant mass discharge for risk assessment risk assessment of contaminated sites has been performed over several decades based on point concentrations and comparisons to maximum contaminant levels mcls point measurements are highly dependent on the media in which they are taken as well as where they are placed in the plume center or edges in this regard several concentration measurements can be taken across the width of the plume without knowing which one to compare with the mcl einarson 2017 several researchers verreydt et al 2012 einarson 2017 horst et al 2021 have called over the past decade for the use of flow weighted spatially averaged concentrations to perform risk assessments at contaminated sites which cmd allows for the development of methods for evaluating cmd has come a long way but there are still some uncertainties regarding how to perform a risk assessment based on a cmd estimate einarson and mackay 2001 suggested using cmd in the aquifer and the flow rate of a supply well to evaluate resulting maximum concentration the flow rate of the supply well could be replaced by the flow rate of a relevant receptor einarson 2017 e g a stream rønde et al 2017 another suggestion from the literature is a contaminant plume classification system that divides cmd into ten separate magnitude categories relevant for instance to prioritizing between several contaminated sites newell et al 2011 recently the capital region of denmark has started to implement cmd as a metric for performing risk assessments through the use of an existing or a potential future groundwater well thereby allowing for a comparison between a concentration derived from cmd and the mcl horst et al 2021 furthermore the capital region of denmark uses cmd and level of conceptual understanding of the site to evaluate the potential risk caused by contamination at a site as previously stated in the introduction one of the missing links mentioned by horst et al 2021 in terms of including cmd at contaminated sites is the lack of robust cmd estimates the profileflux method addresses this missing link by guiding the end user to focus on high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles and then couple this information with a standard flow and transport model within the project for which the profileflux method was developed a 2d transport model will be set up as a user friendly tool publicly available in order to include cmd estimates in a better way at contaminated sites located in clay till settings moving forward the subject relating to how cmd can be used as a metric for risk assessment should be addressed by regulators so that the community truly adopts it as a key metric for risk assessing contaminated sites 5 conclusion the profileflux method for estimating the cmd at a contaminated site located in a clay till setting is presented herein compared to the traditional transect method the profileflux method is useful in the early stages of field investigations of mature plumes and does not require the installation of permanent multilevel wells the combination of high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles and a 2d flow and transport model is essential as it engenders a better understanding of how the contaminant spreads because the method exploits information extracted from concentration profiles i e maximum concentration depth of maximum concentration plume thickness downgradient of a contaminant source a gsa highlighted the most important field characteristics for the profileflux method in terms of both the shape of the vertical concentration profiles and the estimated cmd it revealed that parameters determining water fluxes both vertical and horizontal and source length are crucial for ensuring a good cmd estimate when comparing the measured concentration profiles to their simulated counterparts using these combined with the horizontal groundwater flux can yield a good infiltration estimate and subsequently a good cmd estimate the method was applied at a thoroughly investigated contaminated site resulting in an estimated cmd of 117 170 g year which compared well with the 143 g year found using the more expensive and tedious transect method furthermore the high resolution depth discrete measurements taken in the plume perpendicular to the flow direction showed that the center of the plume was actually further east than expected therefore improving the conceptual understanding of the contaminant spread at the site this paper exemplified that the cmd can be found using the profileflux method the next step besides testing at other contaminated sites is to implement the method in a tool for end users to use in the risk assessment of contaminated sites funding funding for the project was provided by the capital

1236,interest in using contaminant mass discharge cmd for risk assessment of contaminated sites has increased over the years as it accounts for the contaminant mass that is moving and posing a risk to water resources and receptors the most common investigation of cmd involves a transect of multilevel wells however this is an expensive undertaking and it is difficult to place it in the right position in a plume additionally infrastructure at the site needs to be considered to derive an initial cmd estimate at a contaminated site and to allow for the prioritization of further investigations and remedial actions the profileflux method has been developed it is targeted at former industrial sites with a source zone in a low conductivity layer with primarily vertical flow overlying an aquifer with primarily horizontal groundwater flow the profileflux method was developed for mature chlorinated solvent plumes typically originating from more than 30 to 50 year old spills as the usage of chlorinated solvents is mainly historical thus it is assumed that the contaminant had time to distribute in the low conductivity layer by mainly diffusive processes today the contamination is continuously released to the underlying aquifer where advection and dispersive other than diffusive processes are of higher importance the approach combines high resolution depth discrete vertical concentration profiles and a simple 2d flow and transport model to estimate cmd by comparing measured and simulated concentration profiles in the aquifer the study presented herein includes a global sensitivity analysis in order to identify crucial field parameters and of particular importance in this regard are source length groundwater flux and infiltration the profileflux method was tested at a well examined industrial site primarily contaminated with trichloroethylene thereby allowing a comparison between cmd from the profileflux method and the traditional transect method cmd was estimated at 117 170 g year when using the profileflux method against 143 g year with the transect method thus validating profileflux method s ability to estimate cmd in addition applying the method identified weak points in the conceptual site model the method will be incorporated into a user friendly online tool directed at environmental consultants and decision makers working on the risk assessment and prioritization of contaminated sites with the specific hydrogeological conditions of an aquifer with an overlying low permeability layer keywords contaminant flux depth discrete concentration profiles contaminant plume risk assessment groundwater solute transport model data availability the data used for this study is presented in the paper alongside the equations needed to set up the model 1 introduction due to modern society s previous usage of chemicals such as chlorinated solvents petroleum hydrocarbons per polyfluoroalkyl substances and pesticides contaminated sites abound worldwide often contamination is located in low permeability layers overlying aquifers falta 2005 chambon et al 2010 2011 filippini et al 2020 where contaminants can be stored and released over a long period of time the migration of dissolved contaminants from these sites into underlying aquifers poses a risk to groundwater systems and drinking water resources and ultimately human and environmental receptors when risk assessing contaminated sites contaminant mass discharge cmd can be used to evaluate the risk to receptors downgradient of a source and to prioritize the need to remediate different contaminated sites einarson and mackay 2001 troldborg et al 2008 newell et al 2011 einarson 2017 rønde et al 2017 furthermore it is used to evaluate source zone remediation and natural plume attenuation kao and wang 2001 national research council 2005 brooks et al 2008 fraser et al 2008 fjordbøge et al 2012 horneman et al 2017 although cmd provides an integrated flow and contaminant concentration response which enables a risk based assessment of the impact on water resources most practitioners and decision makers still adhere to generic concentration based water quality standards at a given point downgradient of a source horst et al 2021 listed three main factors explaining why the cmd approach is not fully incorporated into contaminated site risk assessments 1 a lack of technical adeptness by practitioners 2 the need to develop robust cmd assessments and 3 a lack of alignment regarding compliance metrics when using cmd cmd describes the mass of a contaminant transported through a control plane per unit of time cmd is most commonly evaluated in a vertical control plane perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction in an aquifer downgradient of a source zone e g newell et al 2011 verreydt et al 2012 in the control plane point measurements covering the width and depth of the plume are often collected by using multiple sampling points over depth traditional wells or multilevel samplers e g kao and wang 2001 freitas et al 2011 troldborg et al 2012 albeit passive flux meters pfms have also been developed and applied in this regard e g annable et al 2005 verreydt et al 2011 ottosen et al 2020 both methods require many measurement points to ensure adequate sample density and to minimize uncertainty in the cmd estimate li and abriola 2009 troldborg et al 2010 2012 brooks et al 2015 balbarini et al 2018 furthermore the placement of a transect is difficult as it should be neither too close nor too far away from the source zone and so it often takes several attempts to achieve a proper transect for cmd determination hence it can be an expensive metric to evaluate and we therefore need faster and cheaper methods for an initial estimate of the cmd in order to evaluate and prioritize further investigation or remediation of contaminated sites at an early stage field investigations and risk assessments in heterogeneous glacial sediments such as clay till have proven particularly difficult due to the existence of fractures fissures and sand lenses which can potentially create preferential transport paths kessler et al 2012 furthermore the matrix can store contaminants and act as a secondary source through back diffusion falta 2005 chambon et al 2010 chambon et al 2011 and locatelli et al 2019 have developed risk assessment models describing the vertical transport of dissolved contaminants through clay till coupled with horizontal transport in the underlying aquifer the focus of both models is on dissolved contaminant concentration in the aquifer and they do not focus on cmd for these heterogeneous geological settings and or complex contaminant plumes the high resolution depth discrete characterization of both hydraulic properties and contaminant concentrations is important in order to improve our understanding of the key processes driving the cmd and to refine conceptual site models e g suthersan et al 2016 steelman et al 2020 coupling field site investigations with transport models is a valuable practice as it helps to understand contaminant transport better essouayed et al 2021 presented a method for an iterative source localization strategy at a chlorinated solvent site that merged field site measurements and 2d modeling as well as used the results to improve the conceptual site model however this was done in a sandy aquifer with a focus on locating the source zone at a contaminated site and did not include depth discrete sampling or the estimation of cmd thus we see a need as requested by horst et al 2021 for new and robust methods for assessing cmd emanating from clay till sites which can be adapted by practitioners using existing field techniques the transect method is already used to evaluate cmd and is applied at many sites however as discussed it is an expensive method and it is often difficult to get the placement of the wells correct and can take several field campaigns to fully delineate the plume and estimate the cmd with this in mind we present a novel concept herein namely the profileflux method to estimate the cmd of dissolved contaminants from a point source located in a low permeability layer into an underlying aquifer without utilizing a traditional control plane of multiple expensive and permanently installed sampling points over depth the estimate is done using knowledge of the source zone the flow field and high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles in the aquifer along the plume center line this is coupled with a 2d solute transport model developed specifically for sources located in clay till settings comparing field site measurements with contamination simulations allows for a better understanding of contaminant migration and the conceptual site model a cmd estimate is achievable with less intensive data collection than the traditional transect method and can indicate whether a traditional transect method estimation needs to be done this paper aims to 1 present the approach and prerequisites of the cmd estimation method 2 identify governing parameters via a global sensitivity analysis using a 2d solute transport model and 3 apply the approach at a field site including a discussion of the water balance and inferred updates of the conceptual site model the work is developed and tested on a typical danish industrial site contaminated with trichloroethylene tce located in clay till settings overlying a sandy aquifer in order to create a risk assessment tool that can be used for contaminated sites located in similar settings 2 conceptual model and the profileflux method the profileflux method has been developed for geological settings where chlorinated solvents emanate from a low permeability clay till unit into a high permeability aquifer e g sand or gravel located below the main idea is that high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles are the footprints of site specific parameters such as flow system contaminant source strength and length and the actual cmd from the source zone mcnab et al 2000 the profileflux method comprises the following three steps 1 initial site investigations to characterize the contaminated site in terms of the approximate extent of the source zone contaminant concentration in clay till flow direction and hydraulic properties of the system fig 1a 2 an investigation into contaminants in the aquifer where high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles are gathered along the center line of the plume both from within the source zone and at different distances downgradient thereof fig 1b 3 a comparison between measured and simulated concentration profiles in order to estimate cmd a 2d solute transport model is used to simulate these concentration profiles by adjusting site specific parameters within a given range until a good agreement between the simulated and measured profiles is achieved fig 1c the infiltration through and downgradient the source zone will determine how the plume distributes vertically often the infiltration rate is a difficult parameter to determine in clay till as vertical hydraulic conductivity defining the actual infiltration is difficult to measure combining groundwater flow in the aquifer and the vertical concentration profile leads to a fair estimate of infiltration through clay till as the former is often known with a relatively high degree of certainty thus through a combination of measured and simulated concentration profiles we can estimate cmd update our conceptual site model and refine key parameters in the following sections assumptions field parameters and model descriptions are addressed 2 1 assumptions for the profileflux method the profileflux method was developed with simplicity in mind to produce a tool that can be used within the existing field site investigation framework and provide the end user with an estimate of cmd out of the source zone and within the aquifer at a given distance from the source as an alternative a complement to the more expensive and tedious transect method the profileflux method is directed toward legacy sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents which in many parts of the world originate from the 1940s to the 1980s mcguire et al 2004 sale et al 2008 thus they are more than 40 years old and represent mature secondary sources where non aqueous phase solvents have been depleted by dissolution and the chlorinated compounds already distributed by diffusive processes and stored in the clay till matrix parker et al 2008 such source zones in clay till overlying aquifers are relevant for many sites in northern europe and north america e g hønning et al 2007 damgaard et al 2013a 2013b mcguire et al 2004 examined 191 chlorinated solvent sites and found that most 90 of the plumes were stable sale et al 2008 suggested using a 14 compartment model to evaluate the contaminant distribution of chlorinated solvents in four different phases in both the source zone and the plume the four phases are dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl vapour aqueous and sorbed the importance of each phase varies with the geological setting and time since the spill for sources located in low permeability layers and in the middle to late stage of their life span the stored mass in the matrix is the predominant source of contamination to the transmissive zone estcp 2011 as little to no dnapl is present chapman and parker 2005 during the development of the profileflux method the aim was to get an initial robust estimate of cmd from the source and within the plume which resulted in focusing on the saturated zone to keep the method simple the profileflux method therefore only takes dissolved and sorbed contaminants into consideration furthermore degradation is disregarded in the model however if reductive dechlorination products are observed at a site the sum of chlorinated compounds on a molar basis can be used as an input for step 3 chambon et al 2013 as reported by kessler et al 2012 fractures in clay till can act as a preferential transport pathway causing a faster breakthrough of contaminants to an underlying aquifer however a study of clay till at eight sites in denmark and one in canada showed that the fracture aperture often decreases with depth with a clear change at a depth of 3 m below the ground surface m bgs klint et al 2013 aamand et al 2022 the same study found that for 32 different locations fracture spacing increased with depth from around 3 m bgs smaller fracture apertures and fewer fractures will result in a smaller impact on contaminant transport through clay till falta 2005 when reaching clay till deeper than approximately 3 m bgs the importance of these fractures on water flow decreases and so they are not considered in the profileflux method and both clay till and the aquifer are assumed to act like a porous medium therefore not accounting for fractures in clay till 2 2 required site characterization site specific parameters are essential for the reliable simulation of the vertical concentration profile and ultimately a credible estimate of cmd with the profileflux method this section addresses the required field site parameters which can be determined within the framework of a typical site investigation relevant input and output parameters for the profileflux method are shown in fig 2 and listed in table 1 parameters that are field site specific and typically determined in investigations at contaminated sites are assigned a yes in the field column in table 1 other parameters are considered less site specific and or need elaborate field methods like tracer experiments to be determined these are assigned a no in the field column in the following typically measured field parameters are described site investigation methods are diverse and most of the input parameters can be determined using different field equipment techniques for initial site investigations step 1 traditional screened wells will most likely be available borehole logs from these wells are useful in determining geology at the site and the thickness of clay till furthermore properly constructed and screened wells can provide information on the flow field in the system by allowing measurements of the hydraulic head in both clay till and the aquifer devlin and schillig 2017 presented an excel spreadsheet for estimating groundwater flow direction and the head gradient both of which are relevant for site investigations slug tests or other hydraulic test methods can be performed to determine hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer also if hydraulic properties from prior investigations or models in the area are known beforehand they can be considered soil concentrations should be measured to determine the amount of contaminant at the site and to delineate the source zone the soil concentration can be converted into solute concentration using the sorption coefficient k d for unconsolidated settings such as clay till and sandy aquifers direct push methods are valuable as they provide different depth discrete information mccall et al 2014 for instance using a membrane interface probe hydraulic profiling tool mihpt is beneficial for investigating contaminated clay till and the transition zone into the aquifer it provides a depth discrete qualitative signal of contaminant distribution for source zone delineation along with an estimate of the permeability of the subsurface for a more detailed determination of clay till thickness than offered by initial borehole logs an mihpt is also useful for examining the vertical hydraulic gradient at the site as described in rosenberg et al 2022 the profileflux method relies on the use of high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles screen length of around 10 cm with a vertical spacing of 0 5 1 m in the aquifer step 2 several multilevel sampling methods are available tuxen et al 2006 anneser et al 2008 and broholm et al 2016 reviewed a range of commercially available devices a new device not mentioned in broholm et al 2016 is the groundwater profiler system gwp from geoprobe namely a direct push method that samples groundwater from high permeability settings through the use of a syringe pump or bladder pump 20 sample ports are distributed on four sides of the probe resulting in a screen length of around 10 cm dutta et al 2021 all devices benefit from prior knowledge of contaminant levels at depth in order to select appropriate target depths for groundwater sampling and the mihpt is very useful in this regard as well as evaluating sampling depths with suitable permeability when undertaking depth discrete groundwater sampling it is important to define concentrations that delineate the entire thickness of the plume and locate maximum concentrations furthermore to make the most reliable estimate of cmd one should target the expected center line of the contaminant plume based on overall groundwater flow direction mihpt can support the decision on the placement of the depth discrete groundwater samples and sampling across the expected centerline is advised in order to make sure that the center line has been found missing or deviating from the center line in particular for narrow sources will result in an underestimation of the cmd see section 4 2 2 3 flow and solute transport model modeling of the transport of chlorinated solvents through clay till and further downgradient in the aquifer is performed by a classic transient 2d flow and solute transport model with a simplified setup mosthaf et al 2021 the 2d model domain comprises a clay till layer and an aquifer see fig 2 mainly vertical flow and transport through the source area and the clay till are combined with the groundwater flow and transport in the aquifer thereby flow and solute transport are simulated in a vertical cross section in the main groundwater flow direction ideally through the center line of the plume the model domain is extended beyond the source zone and the interval of interest covering the area of interest of the plume in order to reduce the influence of the constant head boundary which would otherwise impede vertical flows in the vicinity on the local flow field a steady state flow is assumed and described by darcy s law and the mass balance as k h 0 with the hydraulic conductivity tensor k and the hydraulic head h as the primary variable constant infiltration is applied at the top boundary and no flow is assumed through the bottom boundary the hydraulic heads on the left and right boundaries are fixed thus creating the overall horizontal hydraulic gradient in the aquifer in the clay till overlying the aquifer advective transport is mainly vertical and driven by infiltrating water whereas in the underlying sandy aquifer the advective transport is predominately horizontal contaminant transport is described by the time dependent advection dispersion equation which can account for sorption ϕr c t ϕcv ϕ d eff c q with porosity ϕ concentration c primary variable retardation factor r seepage velocity v effective hydrodynamic dispersion tensor d eff mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion and sources sinks q all boundaries in the transport domain are set to no flow conditions the contaminant source is implemented as a rectangular area with an initially uniform concentration of dissolved and sorbed chlorinated compounds covering the saturated clay till assuming the chlorinated compounds in the mature contaminant source have been distributed in the matrix by diffusive processes with the length of the determined source zone all other areas are initially set to a concentration of 0 i e the simulation starts when contamination reaches the aquifer the model was implemented in comsol multiphysics v6 0 which has been benchmarked with more complex setups against analytical solutions experimental data and other modeling tools e g chambon et al 2010 jørgensen et al 2019 the model simulates both vertical and horizontal transport and creates vertical concentration profiles downgradient of the source zone which can then be compared to measured concentration profiles input parameters can be adjusted until good accordance between measured and simulated profiles is obtained thus yielding cmd per meter width in the model cmd is multiplied by the approximate width of the source zone in order to make a final estimate of cmd at the investigated field site as the transport model is transient the approximate time when the spill happened should be known part of the modeling result is a breakthrough curve at the distance of the respective concentration profile thereby allowing for evaluating whether contaminant leaching at the field site is in a stable situation pseudo steady state plateau part of breakthrough curve in fig 2 the development of the 2d model approach was based on a comprehensive study at a field site where a detailed 3d model was set up to simulate chlorinated solvent contamination emanating from clay till into a sandy aquifer this was simplified to the 2d model described above comparisons of the 2d model s results with the 3d model s results showed a good agreement with the main difference caused by transverse dispersion which is not resolved in the vertical 2d model setup 2 4 global sensitivity analysis when comparing simulated and measured concentration profiles it is important to identify parameters with a strong impact on the simulated concentration profiles and resulting cmd for a successful application of the profileflux method it is crucial that the most influential parameters on cmd and the depth of the concentration maximum can be easily determined to identify the most relevant parameters a global sensitivity analysis gsa was conducted moreover the results from the gsa would provide guidance on which field parameter would be further investigated if simulated and measured concentration profiles did not match the gsa method employed for this study was the elementary effects method proposed by morris 1991 and refined as suggested by campolongo et al 2007 it evaluates how a change in each input parameter affects output through the use of μ and σ in this case μ is the mean absolute sensitivity of the evaluated output parameter while the standard deviation σ of the sensitivity of a parameter describes uncertainty in these changes campolongo et al 2011 the input parameters examined in the gsa are marked with an x in the gsa column in table 1 along with the investigated parameter range the examined output parameters are cmd plume thickness t plume maximum concentration c max and depth of the maximum concentration d cmax the output parameters were evaluated at 50 m downgradient from the source 50 years after the spill had happened for a thorough description of the gsa see supporting information 1 si1 fig 3 presents the results of the gsa analysis for each output parameter the gray dashed lines mark the first and third quartiles of the resulting values of μ and σ and only parameters above the third quartile are shown with a label the μ and σ values for all parameters can be found in si1 when analyzing the results the most important value is μ as it describes the normalized mean impact of each parameter on the output whereas a high σ value indicates non linear effects or possible interactions with other parameters for all four output parameters the infiltration rate i as well as the source length l s with the exemption of t plume has a significant influence the depth of the maximum concentration d cmax is also sensitive to groundwater flow characterized by i h and k h the gsa of cmd shows that the low sensitivity parameters are the porosities n clay and n aq the distribution coefficient in the aquifer k d aq and vertical dispersivity in the aquifer transverse to the flow direction αv aq parameters with a small influence on the vertical concentration profile t plume c max and d cmax are c 0 n clay n aq k d clay k d aq and α l aq albeit the latter five of these are normally not determined during site investigations the results of the gsa are discussed further in section 4 1 3 application of the profileflux method at a chlorinated solvent site to test the profileflux method it was applied to a tce contaminated site located in denmark in 1962 a factory was established to cut and laminate styrofoam tce was used in the production and consequently released to the subsurface a historical examination has shown that the tce spill likely happened at some point between 1970 and 1996 the geology at the site consists of clay till with a varying thickness of 10 12 m overlying a sandy aquifer the site is described in rosenberg et al 2022 in which a detailed conceptual geological model is provided in fig 4a a plan view of the site is shown and in fig 4b a simplified longitudinal transect of the saturated part of the site is shown the source was determined to be 20 m long and 16 m wide the saturated depth of clay till 5 m infiltration 140 mm year and groundwater flow velocity 14 m year at the site the average vertical hydraulic head gradient was 0 4 m m resulting in vertical hydraulic conductivity in the clay till of 1 11 10 8 m s which is in the lower range found at other danish clay till sites nilsson et al 2001 jørgensen et al 2002 2004 mosthaf et al 2021 this indicates that the simulated infiltration rate was in accordance with the field measurement relating to the vertical hydraulic head gradient sorption coefficients which were measured for research purposes and are normally not expected in a typical site investigation were k d clay 0 87 l kg and k d aq 0 22 l kg the maximum measured solute concentration in the source was 4900 μg l tce therefore no free phase dnapl was expected to be present in total gwps were performed at seven locations after investigating the vertical extent of groundwater contamination using mihpt logs the mihpt logs identified the approximate center line of the plume using the overall flow field as a starting point for the survey one of the gwps was placed at the source area gwp1 on fig 4b three were placed at different distances along the expected center line of the plume gwp2 3 and gwp5 on fig 4b and the other three were placed transversal to the groundwater flow direction at the same distance as gwp5 downgradient of the source there was no indication of any particularly significant reductive dechlorination at the site however cis 1 2 dichloroethylene cis dce was detected in some of the groundwater samples therefore the concentrations used in this example are noted as the sum of chlorinated ethenes tce equivalents tce eq fig 5 presents a comparison between the measured and simulated concentration profiles simulated concentration profiles with three different initial concentrations 1500 μg l 2600 μg l and 3800 μg l are depicted resulting in an estimated cmd of 67 g year 117 g year and 170 g year respectively the simulated concentration profiles are compared to two of the gwps along the expected flow center line gwp3 and gwp5 and gwp6 5 m to the east of gwp5 for both gwp3 and gwp6 the simulated concentration profiles captured the thickness of the measured concentration profile gwp6 shows a close to gaussian shaped concentration profile with the initial source concentration of 3800 μg l comparing well with the maximum measured concentration in terms of both depth and value the simulation of the initial source concentration of 2600 μg l compares well with measurements at around 3 5 m below the clay till layer indicating that cmd at the site is between 117 g year and 170 g year gwp3 showed a more asymmetrical concentration profile with the maximum concentration not captured by the simulation however the simulation did reveal a large proportion of the measured values and the general shape of the concentration profile furthermore the mihpt at this point showed some heterogeneities in the aquifer when evaluating the mihpt pressure log for gwp5 the simulated profile with an initial concentration of 1500 μg l 67 g year compared well with the measured concentration profile relating to the depth and value of the maximum concentration and the thickness of the plume the resulting cmd based on the two gwps in the center line and simulations was between 117 and 170 g year which is in the same range as previously estimated at the site a consulting company niras 2019 estimated the cmd to be 143 g tce year by using the traditional transverse transect method at 50 m downgradient from the source zone the plume was delineated and the cmd estimate was based on 26 well screens with individual concentration and hydraulic conductivity measurements whilst planning the field campaign it was expected that gwp5 would be in the center line of the plume but this was not the case as gwp6 had higher concentrations and yielded higher cmd from the profileflux method furthermore gwp4 and gwp7 showed significantly lower concentrations which confirms that the centerline is around the placement of gwp6 according to historical data relating to the site and knowledge of the thickness of the unsaturated and saturated zones the contaminant started leaching from the saturated zone around 27 40 years ago this is indicated as the gray box on the breakthrough curve in fig 5 highlighting that contamination at the site is in a steady state for both the earliest and latest estimates of time this is also evident from the simulated concentration profiles for gwp3 and gwp6 which reveal the same level of cmd at both 37 and 48 m downgradient of the source equivalent to approximately 1 5 years worth of transport in the aquifer 4 discussion 4 1 robustness and uncertainty of the profileflux method parameters with a strong effect on the results of cmd and the vertical concentration profiles t plume c max and d cmax were identified in the gsa fig 3 most influential parameters are often determined as a part of an initial field investigation at a contaminated site critical parameters which are difficult to estimate according to measurements but which are nevertheless important are infiltration rate i through the clay till and vertical dispersivity α v aq in the aquifer however the unique combination between the infiltration rate in clay till i and the horizontal groundwater flux determines the shape of the vertical concentration profile and the depth of the maximum concentration d cmax hence a good approximation of the groundwater flux allows for determining infiltration through clay till by adjusting the infiltration rate until a good agreement between the simulated and measured d cmax is reached establishing i based on the groundwater flux will furthermore lead to a better and more reliable determination of cmd as i is the second most sensitive parameter when estimating cmd regarding dispersivities in the aquifer the vertical dispersivity α v aq only affects t plume significantly which means that the other two parameters describing the vertical concentration profile c max and d cmax can still be determined with reasonable certainty furthermore α v aq does not influence cmd estimates and should be kept at a certain low value in the millimeter scale based on literature bjerg et al 2011 a high α v aq value will lead to a poor comparison the longitudinal dispersivity α l aq is of minor importance and fairly good values exist from tracer experiments and field observations jensen et al 1993 bjerg et al 2011 and the literature review by schulze makuch 2005 in general the least influential parameters are fortunately those requiring laboratory measurements n clay n aq k d clay k d aq which suits the objectives of the profileflux method the method is developed for initial investigations of cmd at a contaminated site where comprehensive lab work has not been carried out from the gsa the source length l s is shown to have a significant impact on the results of both the vertical concentration profiles t plume c max and d cmax and the estimated cmd and it is therefore important to obtain a good estimate of this parameter in the case of the application at the danish field site described in section 3 l s was determined by using a combination of soil concentrations above 1 mg tce kg soil solute concentrations from clay till above 1000 μg tce l and mihpt logs when using profileflux the source zone should be viewed as the place at which the contaminant enters the aquifer sand lenses and other heterogeneities in clay till can cause a shift in the placement of the contaminant source at depth kessler 2012 for this type of investigation a field method such as mihpt is useful for establishing the location of chlorinated ethenes an important quantity for the profileflux method is the depth from the bottom of the clay till to the groundwater sampling points at some sites the transition from clay till to the underlying aquifer is very sharp i e a narrow depth interval while at other sites the change is gradual over a greater depth interval resulting in a transition zone between the two geological units the choice of the location of the bottom of the clay till will have an effect on the comparison between the measured and simulated vertical concentration profiles when the transition zone has a significant thickness it is suggested to treat half of it as clay till and the other half as the sandy aquifer when applying field site parameters to the 2d transport model step 3 with an mihpt the transition zone can easily be observed using the pressure log rosenberg et al 2022 4 2 data requirements and field methods the use of depth discrete concentration profiles is essential for the profileflux method and should ideally be sampled along the expected center line of the contaminant plume in total four or five vertical concentration profiles with a high resolution e g 50 100 cm intervals with short screens of around 10 cm should be made both along and across the center line of the contaminant plume in order to increase the probability of hitting the center line this is a critical point as deviations from the center line will reduce the cmd estimates in particular for narrow sources it is recommended to optimize the position of the concentration profiles by mihpt measurements across the center line it should also be noted that the cmd is proportional to the source width and sensitive to the source length as discussed above thus focus on the initial delineation and geometry of the source is recommended in the application of the profileflux method the vertical concentration profiles should be performed at a distance away from the source that is in perspective to groundwater flow velocity this is done by considering the same aspects as for the transect method time from the spill clay till thickness and the likelihood of the contaminant plume having reached passed the point of interest multiple profiles along the center line of the plume at different distances away from the source zone will allow for evaluating whether the contaminant plume is growing stable or depleting from the application at the site presented in section 3 gwp3 and gwp6 taken along the observed center line of the contaminant plume at distances from the source of 37 and 48 m showed that the estimated cmd was the same thereby indicating a stable plume between the two gwps the differences between the estimated cmds based on gwp5 and gwp6 same downgradient distance were 67 and 170 g year respectively which is a factor of 2 5 between two points that are 5 m apart this is based on measured maximum concentrations of 915 and 2049 μg l respectively and shows the importance of more than one sampling point across the center line of the contaminant plume site specific parameters can be found by using various field methods as described previously with parameters that most likely will show spatial variations e g k h at different locations it is possible to consider several simulated concentration profiles and to evaluate which value results in the best accordance for all of the measured vertical concentration profiles using the comparison between the simulated and measured vertical concentration profiles can add knowledge of the contaminated site as poor accordance indicates knowledge gaps regarding geology hydrogeology the contaminant source or plume different combinations of infiltration rate and groundwater flux can lead to similar profiles however constraining the groundwater flux based on measurements of the hydraulic conductivity and the gradient allows constraining the solutions as mentioned previously comparing the simulated and measured vertical concentration profiles using the site specific groundwater flux allows for evaluating the infiltration rate i this acquired value can be compared to the assumed expected value of i as well as checked using measurements of i v and k v if the resulting values of k v i and i v are within the expected ranges the estimate of i is reasonable furthermore if the simulated and measured vertical concentration profiles only compare well by extensively changing the field site parameters this can be an indication that further field site investigations are required this is also the case if these changes result in unrealistic input parameter values e g overly high infiltration rates this means that applying the profileflux method can contribute to a much better conceptual site model which is a very strong additional benefit of the approach 4 3 can the profileflux method be applied in other geological settings and for other contaminants applying the profileflux method to other geological settings is possible however it is important to keep in mind that the model is made for a source zone located in a low permeability layer with a primarily vertical flow and the aquifer has considerably higher hydraulic conductivity with a primarily horizontal and stable flow this combination of a low permeability layer overlying a high permeability aquifer should be present when applying the profileflux method to other geological settings as a strong difference in hydraulic conductivity is important with regards to the soil type and our understanding of the stable source and plume both the low permeability layer and the aquifer should be only moderately heterogeneous which for the low permeability layer means no significant fractures and groundwater flow conditions need to be stable the method is also applicable to geological settings with fractures in the clay till for such settings the model has to be adjusted to account for fracture matrix interactions e g with a discrete fracture matrix model chambon et al 2010 2011 locatelli et al 2019 in order to include the effects of preferential flow and matrix diffusion on the contaminant leaching out of the source zone when the profileflux method is used at chlorinated solvent sites initial investigations using mihpt are beneficial as e g the halogen specific xsd detector can detect these other volatile contaminants e g btex petroleum hydrocarbons can also be detected using mihpt equipped with a suitable detector using mihpt for initial screening of the contaminant distribution is not possible for non volatile contaminants such as pesticides however the hpt is still valuable for a hydrogeological description of the site the profileflux method is still applicable for such contaminants as the source zone and hydrogeological setting have the same effect on the contaminant spreading and the resulting vertical concentration profiles as in the case of chlorinated ethenes it should however be noted that degradation of the contaminants will affect the vertical concentration profiles as discussed in studies for pesticides tuxen et al 2006 and for btex anneser et al 2008 4 4 contaminant mass discharge for risk assessment risk assessment of contaminated sites has been performed over several decades based on point concentrations and comparisons to maximum contaminant levels mcls point measurements are highly dependent on the media in which they are taken as well as where they are placed in the plume center or edges in this regard several concentration measurements can be taken across the width of the plume without knowing which one to compare with the mcl einarson 2017 several researchers verreydt et al 2012 einarson 2017 horst et al 2021 have called over the past decade for the use of flow weighted spatially averaged concentrations to perform risk assessments at contaminated sites which cmd allows for the development of methods for evaluating cmd has come a long way but there are still some uncertainties regarding how to perform a risk assessment based on a cmd estimate einarson and mackay 2001 suggested using cmd in the aquifer and the flow rate of a supply well to evaluate resulting maximum concentration the flow rate of the supply well could be replaced by the flow rate of a relevant receptor einarson 2017 e g a stream rønde et al 2017 another suggestion from the literature is a contaminant plume classification system that divides cmd into ten separate magnitude categories relevant for instance to prioritizing between several contaminated sites newell et al 2011 recently the capital region of denmark has started to implement cmd as a metric for performing risk assessments through the use of an existing or a potential future groundwater well thereby allowing for a comparison between a concentration derived from cmd and the mcl horst et al 2021 furthermore the capital region of denmark uses cmd and level of conceptual understanding of the site to evaluate the potential risk caused by contamination at a site as previously stated in the introduction one of the missing links mentioned by horst et al 2021 in terms of including cmd at contaminated sites is the lack of robust cmd estimates the profileflux method addresses this missing link by guiding the end user to focus on high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles and then couple this information with a standard flow and transport model within the project for which the profileflux method was developed a 2d transport model will be set up as a user friendly tool publicly available in order to include cmd estimates in a better way at contaminated sites located in clay till settings moving forward the subject relating to how cmd can be used as a metric for risk assessment should be addressed by regulators so that the community truly adopts it as a key metric for risk assessing contaminated sites 5 conclusion the profileflux method for estimating the cmd at a contaminated site located in a clay till setting is presented herein compared to the traditional transect method the profileflux method is useful in the early stages of field investigations of mature plumes and does not require the installation of permanent multilevel wells the combination of high resolution depth discrete concentration profiles and a 2d flow and transport model is essential as it engenders a better understanding of how the contaminant spreads because the method exploits information extracted from concentration profiles i e maximum concentration depth of maximum concentration plume thickness downgradient of a contaminant source a gsa highlighted the most important field characteristics for the profileflux method in terms of both the shape of the vertical concentration profiles and the estimated cmd it revealed that parameters determining water fluxes both vertical and horizontal and source length are crucial for ensuring a good cmd estimate when comparing the measured concentration profiles to their simulated counterparts using these combined with the horizontal groundwater flux can yield a good infiltration estimate and subsequently a good cmd estimate the method was applied at a thoroughly investigated contaminated site resulting in an estimated cmd of 117 170 g year which compared well with the 143 g year found using the more expensive and tedious transect method furthermore the high resolution depth discrete measurements taken in the plume perpendicular to the flow direction showed that the center of the plume was actually further east than expected therefore improving the conceptual understanding of the contaminant spread at the site this paper exemplified that the cmd can be found using the profileflux method the next step besides testing at other contaminated sites is to implement the method in a tool for end users to use in the risk assessment of contaminated sites funding funding for the project was provided by the capital

1237,microplastic pollution in different environments has increasingly been documented in detail in recent times but it is still poorly studied in caves and karst aquifers to deepen the knowledge of microplastic pollution for karst environment protection and conservation purposes we collected and investigated different water samples from a karst area of italy considering connected surface and cave waters microplastics were extracted from water samples by filtration and subjected to organic matter removal with 15 hydrogen peroxide solution microplastics on filters were counted and characterised size colour shape via visual identification under a microscope with and without uv light exploiting fluorescence given by fluorescent whitening additives contained in plastic materials finally spectroscopic analyses were carried out on 10 of the microplastics observed on each filter the concentration of microplastics in cave waters varied from 12 to 54 items l with a mean value of 28 items l in the surface water of a tributary it was of 23 items l and in the downstream it was 29 items l fibres represented the most abundant shape 95 1 in the karst system waters and most microplastics 82 9 were smaller than 1 mm the majority of the microplastics were fluorescent under uv light 84 8 and most fluorescent particles were transparent 46 however black microplastics 68 were more common among the non fluorescent ones polyethylene 51 7 was the main type of microplastics found in the karst system waters our results show the presence of microplastics in karst systems and provide useful information for future research karst aquifers are open systems subjected to possible contamination by surface pollutants microplastics in karst systems can be consumed by animals damage ecosystems and contaminate water resources surface karst areas and underground environments should therefore be monitored and protected especially regarding the management of water resources to

selvam et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 assessing mp presence and distribution in natural environments using accurate methods for quantification understanding their transport pathways and evaluating their impacts on organisms and habitats are necessary steps to be addressed for conservation purposes however research on mps is generally focused on the marine environment and surface ecosystems and only few studies have examined mp pollution in caves and underground systems e g balestra and bellopede 2022b christman 2019 vardar and vidal rodriguez 2021 regarding freshwater resources research is in its early stages the potential contamination of groundwater is often only mentioned and a limited number of studies focused on groundwater mp pollution e g khant and kim 2022 mintenig et al 2019 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 selvam et al 2021 viaroli et al 2022 moreover mp studies suffer from methodological discrepancies providing heterogeneous analysis results and the invisibility of the subterranean karst system structure makes impedes the study of such systems even if they preserve a precious asset such as groundwater sources of mps to groundwater include wastewater litter atmospheric deposition and soil and surface waters pollution atmospheric transport favours the distribution of mps over long distances in relation to wind direction and intensity rain snow precipitation intensity and duration allen et al 2019 in the hydrogeological cycle atmospheric water contribution is the main aquifer recharge the presence of mps in precipitation was detected in cities and remote areas allen et al 2019 liu et al 2019 highlighting the omnipresence of this contaminant therefore mp contamination in soil is strongly related to precipitation facilitating mp infiltration zhou et al 2021 when mps are deposited on the ground some can be transported vertically into the subsoil travelling over long distances throughout the rock fractures and accumulating in the groundwater system chia et al 2021 wanner 2021 previous studies highlighted the downward movement of microparticles through soil pores and cracks for smaller mps fahrenfeld et al 2019 mcgechan

an important accumulation zone for mps of small dimensions frei et al 2019 the hydrogeological setting of the basin and seasonal trends must be taken into account as well as the flow regime of streams and riverbeds therefore hydrogeological information and aquifer types are decisive in choosing the sampling approach and detection method karst aquifers are groundwater environments usually made up of carbonate rock constituting about 25 of the global drinking water sources panno et al 2019 the hydrodynamic regime of these aquifers is affected by the geology and the rock cluster fracturing the karstification degree and the local meteorological conditions braun 1984 chauve et al 1990 hottelet et al 1993 moindrot et al 1988 considering the drainage system three basic conceptual aquifer models

karst caves have an exceptional scientific value and are a precious archive that must be protected from damage allowing paleo environmental and paleo climatic reconstructions and preserving palaeontological and archaeological finds balestra et al 2021 cigna and forti 2013 the open nature of karst aquifers makes them vulnerable to contamination by surface pollutants which can be transported through the rock fractures white 1988 or can directly access the karst systems through some caves especially tourist ones increasing the pollution risk balestra and bellopede 2022b balestra et al 2021 fractured and karst aquifers are subjected to greater pollution risk as mps are prone to circulate throughout the discontinuities even if mechanical dispersion may attenuate the contaminant concentration in some zones viaroli et al 2022 currently to the authors knowledge there is only one study on mp pollution in waters of karst areas monitoring springs and wells under low flow conditions panno et al 2019 studies on cave waters as well as mp pollution in surface and underground waters of the same karst area are lacking the vulnerability of groundwater resources to pollution anthropogenic pressure and climate change as well as their important role in natural ecosystems and as a fundamental drinking water reserve require actions targeted at underground environment protection and sustainable resources management balestra et al 2021 re 2019 therefore investigations are required for understanding the system dynamics and monitoring the state of the environmental health detecting the possible pollution and its sources the aims of this study which is the first of its kind are therefore i to preliminarily investigate mp pollution in karst systems from surface watercourses to cave waters to provide a reference for further research and ii to discuss the abundance morphological characteristic and types of mps in the karst system 2 materials method 2 1 study area the bossea karst system feeding area piedmont nw italy fig 1 is characterised by a belt of carbonate rocks laterally confined by poorly permeable rocks quartzites and meta volcanics fig 2 bossea cave frabosa soprana cn piedmont italy represents the final part of the karst system developing in the maudagna corsaglia watershed between the prato nevoso basin and the corsaglia river fig 2 the land cover is mostly composed of broadleaf forests of larches alternated with mountain meadows and pastures although in a part of it there are several ski slopes which attract many tourists in winter fig 2a the recharge of this aquifer fig 2b is mainly linked to primary and or secondary inputs the primary inputs or authigenic are by rain or snow melt directly recharging the aquifer whereas the secondary inputs or allogenic of concern are the surface runoff waters continuously recharging the aquifer trough sinkholes in the sub riverbed vigna 2020 rio roccia bianca is the main secondary supply contributing to the bossea karst system recharge fig 2 a series of tests were previously carried out in the two main absorbent valleys rio roccia bianca and rio bertino vigna 2020 using two different dyes tinopal and fluorescein to examine their arrivals in bossea cave this aquifer has a water circulation along karst conduits and fractures with an extensive and well developed saturated zone and can therefore be described as a system with interconnected drainage with a medium high permeability banzato et al 2011 bossea cave is the first show cave of italy open to the public since 1874 the cavity has a single entrance at 836 m a s l and an ascending structure fig 3 with a 2800 m development in the tectonic contact between the middle triassic dolomie di san pietro dei monti formation dolostone and carbonate rocks and permotriassic metavolcanics antonellini et al 2019 different underground karst laboratories to study and monitor hydrogeology subterranean meteorology radon activity and subterranean biology are located in the cave touristic and non touristic areas managed by struttura operativa bossea c a i biologia sotterranea piemonte gruppo di ricerca and the department of environment land and infrastructure engineering diati of the politecnico di torino working together with arpa piemonte and inrim automatic detectors were installed in different parts of the cave to continuously hourly monitor water quantitative and qualitative data such as flow rate q electrical conductivity ec and temperature t the flow rate is calculated through overflow vents or calibrated flow sections depending on the water levels bossea cave offers an ideal situation to study the groundwater circulation in a carbonate rock mass a main water collector called mora river and several water supplies with different flow rates related to rock fractures are present fig 3b continuous monitoring data carried out in bossea cave by the diati revealed that the collector has a flow rate ranging from 50 to 1200 l s developing for about 1 5 km in the cave and directly flowing in the corsaglia river with a set of springs banzato et al 2011 fiorucci et al 2015 fiorucci and vigna 2015 peano et al 2011 vigna et al 2017 the discontinuities are poorly or not karstified characterised by low flow circulation ranging from 0 01 to 2 5 l s pools of water or drips such as polla delle anatre one of the most important monitoring points in the bossea cave tracked for over 40 years with a highly constant flow rate 0 5 to 2 5 l s balestra et al 2022a vigna et al 2017 moreover secondary inputs continuously recharging the aquifer were previously monitored proving their arrivals in bossea cave and highlighting the surface and underground environment connections finally as the hydrodynamic response to rainfall events is characterised by a rather rapid increase in flow banzato et al 2011 the movement of pollutants from the surface to the underground environments could be rapid making this type of karst systems more subject to mp pollution 2 2 field sampling for data collected in flowing water it is essential to take into account the water flow rate to evaluate the correct mp percentage which clearly depends on the water flow moreover the season could affect the concentration of mps in the water hence sampling at different times could be performed to understand the impact of the season however these first samples taken punctually in the karst system are important to verify the presence of mps in surface and subterranean waters these data are scarce in karst areas and absent in caves if mps occur in each part of the system subsequent analyses will be carried out to verify the impact of the seasons sampling points were chosen to check pollution starting from the surface water streams that recharge the karst system examined up to the springs passing through the underground structures that accumulate in the water reserve and therefore can retain and or transport pollutants one surface water sample was taken from rio roccia bianca upstream the bossea cave fig 2 four groundwater samples were collected from different areas of the bossea cave figs 2 3 table 1 and one surface water sample was taken from the corsaglia river where the water of the collector emerges fig 2 in the bossea cave two samples were collected nearer to the tourist path uovo and sala frane and two in different non tourist areas sifone and polla delle anatre fig 3 table 1 as reference samples of unpolluted waters because these areas are not frequented by tourists or in close contact with human activities fig 3 table 1 in the tourist section the collector water flows from the innermost areas towards the entrance of the cave where the sala frane sampling area is located in this zone the collector water flows quickly before leaving the cave in certain areas of the cave landslides and speleothems convey a small amount of this water along secondary paths feeding dams of various sizes and slowing the flow such as in the uovo sampling area fig 3 table 1 here water flows between different gours a particular type of speleothem cave formation in the form of a stone dam hill and forti 1997 adjacent to the tourist route where an egg shaped statue is placed fig 3 table 1 in sifone the water comes out from the rock

pool of water entering in the inner collector located in a non touristic cave zone visited only by researchers and speleologists fig 3 table 1 this water flows out of a fracture in the rock and is collected in a small tank with a weir for flow monitoring polla delle anatre flow has the typical characteristics of an interconnected drainage system with a flow rate ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 l s balestra et al 2022a groundwater and surface water samples were collected in september 2021 under low flow conditions being a preliminary investigation water samples were collected into 1 l glass vessels and capped immediately to prevent atmospheric contamination all sampling materials were pre cleaned with ethanol and distilled water to avoid contamination all samples were transported to the

of natural artificial and synthetic fibres under the microscope taken in previous works e g houck 2009 khan et al 2017 zhang 2014 were made the uv flashlight was positioned on a pedestal with an inclination of 45 visual identification was performed to identify mps in agreement with the strict selection criteria reported in previous works crawford and quinn 2016 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 noren 2007 fibres must have the same diameter along their entire length particles must have unvarying colours no cellular or organic structures must be present and red transparent or white particles must be examined under a high magnification or fluorescence microscope particles smaller than 0 1 mm were cut off as suggested by the european commission 2013 for visual identification under a microscope particles that could not be identified as mps were not take into consideration filters were observed by the same laboratory operator to ensure mp quantification and identification and reduce human errors the mps were categorised in relation to shape size and colour according to the standardised size and colour sorting system scs proposed by crawford and quinn 2016 usually an average from 1 to 10 of the sample is analysed to determine the chemical composition of the mps international organization for standardization and european committee for standardization 2020 randomly 10 of mps of each filter were analysed using a micro fourier transform infrared spectroscope micro ftir shimadzu aim 9000 microscope equipped with a shimadzu irtracer 100 spectrophotometer spectra were compared with the shimadzu standard library 3 results and discussion microplastics were found in all water samples highlighting mp pollution in the bossea karst system from surface watercourses to underground waters although for data collected in flowing water it is essential to take into consideration the water flow rate and the season to evaluate the correct mp abundance over time this first investigation in the karst area is important because it highlights the presence of mps in the surface and underground waters even in areas not directly affected by human activities taking into account the continuous monitoring data carried out in the bossea cave by the diati it is possible to associate the number of mps to the bossea collector 70 l s and polla delle anatre 0 5 l s flow rate in september 2021 3 1 microplastic abundance microplastics were found in all water samples including the two samples collected in the non touristic areas of the bossea cave microplastic abundance shape dimension and fluorescence are shown in table 2 the concentration of mps in cave water varied from 12 to 54 items l with a mean of 28 items l the mp abundance in the surface water of rio roccia bianca was 23 items l whereas in the corsaglia river it was 29 items l table 2 because there is no standardised method for assessing mps in water bodies comparisons are challenging since measurement methods and treatments can affect the results however some assumptions on the amounts of mps in karst environments can be made comparisons with other show cave water mp abundances are not possible at the moment as this study is the first one dealing with cave waters however a comparison with other groundwater and surface water samples from different areas of the world is possible table 3 to the authors knowledge the only work on a karst area monitoring springs and wells from two karst aquifers in illinois usa documented the presence of a maximum mp concentration of 15 2 items l mean of 7 9 items l in springs and a maximum concentration of 4 4 items l mean of 2 8 items l in wells under low flow conditions panno et al 2019 selvam et al 2021 analysed 24 groundwater samples from wells and bore wells collected in the post monsoon season in coastal south india pointing out a median concentration of 4 2 items l with a maximum concentration of 10 1 items l other values are reported in mintenig et al 2019 for nw germany groundwater with 5 6 items l much higher values were found in an alluvial unconfined groundwater aquifer in victoria australia with an average concentration of 38 8 items l samandra et al 2022 very low values 1 items l were found in chalk and sandstone aquifers of the uk johnson et al 2020 surface water samples in the same studied aquifers were analysed by selvam et al 2021 showing 7 8 items l with a maximum of 19 9 items l whereas mintenig et al 2019 reported 2 9 items l and samandra et al 2022 0 4 items l the microplastic abundances found in our study are high compared to those found in subterranean and surface waters of northwest germany mintenig et al 2019 illinois usa panno et al 2019 or south india selvam et al 2021 whereas they are lower than those detected in groundwaters examined in victoria australia samandra et al 2022 however it should be considered that the size of mps taken into account the sampling point the flow rate the season and the sources of mps in the catchment may impact the concentrations of mps in waters in non tourist areas of the cave the mp abundance in waters was similar to that in tourist areas and a high number of mps in the karst system water was found in the inner area of the cave where the water comes out of a siphoning area instead the bossea cave sediments collected in tourist areas contained more than twice as many mps as those collected in non tourist areas suggesting that pollution is related to the passage of tourists the microplastic presence in cave water including water coming out of the rock in the non tourist sections sifone and polla delle anatre suggests pollution linked to hydrogeologic connections from the surface to the underground aquifers the high presence of fractures in the rocks of this karst area could favour pollutant transport in the underground environment as suggested in panno et al 2019 it is reasonable to assume that the high degree of karstification in different zones the presence of a well organised outflow network and the plenty water flows play a fundamental role in the transport of mps in this karst system the contact between water and sediments could increase the mp concentrations in the bossea karst system water microplastic pollution in the soil of this karst area could be related to the intense winter and summer activities in the zones above the karst system and the area is rich in ski resorts prato nevoso country the presence of waste in these areas is not unusual possible sources include plastic litter from anthropogenic activities and synthetic fibres from clothes in these areas surface waters that feed rio roccia bianca and rio bertino streams were collected the main secondary supplies contributing to the bossea karst system recharge vigna 2020 a series of tests with dyes previously carried out in the two main absorbent valleys indicated that the waters coming from rio roccia bianca and rio bertino arrive in bossea cave in a relatively short time during lean periods the rio roccia bianca waters arrive in the bossea cave collector after 4 days speed of about 644 m day whereas in flood periods they arrive after only 1 day speed of about 2460 m day moreover rio roccia bianca provides a much higher quantity of water to the bossea systems than rio bertino although currently there are no studies on the atmospheric transport of pollutants in this area soil pollution could be related to or aggravated by the atmospheric transport of particles depositing on the ground thanks to precipitation and wind as well as any other contamination between adjacent environments linked to human activities from the near countries of fontane and prato nevoso in underground environments tourists are carriers of alien particles such as lint organic matter dust and pollutants addesso et al 2022 balestra and bellopede 2022b jablonsky et al 1993 liu et al 2021 puławska et al 2021 and therefore waters in the tourist parts of the cave uovo and sala frane could be enriched with pollutants such as mps in cave sediments balestra and bellopede 2022b which could be transported into different parts of the cave and outside in the corsaglia river our data do not show a definitive link to the suggested sources of pollution but offer information about the hydrogeologic connections showing opportunities for future research on mp dynamics in subterranean waters in karst environments 3 2 microplastic shape and size microplastics were categorised according to the standardised size and colour sorting system scs described in crawford and quinn 2016 table 2 fibres represented the majority of the mps present in cave and surface waters 17 1 between 1 and 5 mm and 78 between 0 1 and 0 99 mm of length figs 4 5 and table 2 followed by fragments 4 3 micro fragments fig 5 and table 2 some microbeads 0 6 were also observed whereas no foam and films were found in this karst system fig 5 and table 2 as in previous research fibres and fragments are the main shapes present in the groundwaters albeit at different concentrations such as 94 fragments samandra et al 2022 or 100 fibres panno et al 2019 as more than 60 of the world textiles are produced from synthetic fibres henry and klepp 2018 synthetic clothes could be the main source of mp pollution in this karst system the fragment source could be linked to human activity on the surface or the presence of degraded waste in soil or could have been produced during the electric system works in the cave according to crawford and quinn 2016 mps are categorised into microplastics 1 5 mm and mini microplastics 1 mm 1 μm using visual identification under a microscope allowed the analysis of mp particles from 5 to 0 1 mm in this investigation mini mps accounted for 82 9 of the total mps found in the water karst system and for 84 of the mps found in cave water only fig 5 and table 2 the microplastic shape and size percentages found in bossea cave waters were similar to those described for cave sediments balestra and bellopede 2022a balestra and bellopede 2022b however the means of transport and the source could be different microplastic found in the bossea cave sediments could be mainly related to the passage of tourists along the cave path and the speleologists crossing the non tourist passage to reach the internal laboratory balestra and bellopede 2022b in contrast the sources of mps in the cave waters can be linked to cave tourism and pollution of the land above the sources and transport of mps in the cave should be studied in more detail to better understand mp pollution in karst areas as suggested in panno et al 2019 the relative size of mp particles offers some insight into their movement the mps found in underground waters in this study were similar to those collected in the surface waters in this karst area water migrates from the surface to the underground environments via sinkholes and rapidly enters the fractures and crevices of the underlying aquifers reaching the cave and finally discharging into the corsaglia river through the soil pores and along irregular fractures and crevices the larger mps would be impeded and only the smaller mp fractions would reach and migrate through the karst aquifers 3 3 microplastic fluorescence and colour the highest mp abundance was fluorescent under uv light 84 8 fig 4 table 2 with a percentage similar to that found for mps in cave sediments 87 7 balestra and bellopede 2022a balestra and bellopede 2022b exploiting fluorescent whitening agents fwas in plastics mps can be easily found using an inexpensive uv flashlight fig 4 however there are also several limitations qiu et al 2015 not all plastics contain fwas fig 4a b orange arrow and different naturally fluorescent organic and inorganic matter compounds could be misunderstood as mps organic fluorescent particles may account for more than half of the total fluorescent particles in the samples analysed in cave environment balestra and bellopede 2022b and therefore organic matter removal is a fundamental step in mp determination figs 6 shows the different colours of the collected mps of the fluorescent particles fig 6a 46 were transparent followed by red 16 5 blue 10 8 beige 7 2 and amber 4 3 ones the mps with other colours accounted for less than 4 of the total fluorescent ones non fluorescent mps fig 6b were mainly black 68 or blue 20 followed by green transparent and violet ones 4 the major part of the fluorescent particles in water are transparent as reported in balestra and bellopede 2022b for bossea cave sediments the other main colours are similar with the exception of red particles which are more abundant in water the non fluorescent mp particles were mainly black and blue confirming the data found for bossea cave sediments balestra and bellopede 2022b however the percentages were different as well as the colour of the less abundant mps these facts could be related to the presence of particles with different densities more easily transportable in water with a different degree of biodeterioration or a diverse pollution source transparent mps were also prevalent in groundwaters analysed in selvam et al 2021 followed by white and blue ones whereas in panno et al 2019 65 of the analysed mps were blue and or clear whereas the other common colours were red 15 and grey 13 the mp colour could provide an indication of the chemical pollutants for example yellow and black mps could indicate high levels of pollutants frias et al 2010 karapanagioti et al 2011 in the bossea karst system about 68 of non fluorescent mps were black and future investigations should be carried out to monitor possible environmental contaminations moreover the colour of mps can be correlated with the consumption by organisms carpenter et al 1972 romeo et al 2015 shaw and day 1994 being confused with trophic resources in natural subterranean systems there is no light and therefore the colour of mps does not play a particular role in hypogeal animal ingestion however the colour and fluorescence of mp particles may be relevant for less cave adapted and epigeal organisms in watercourses and adjacent habitats 3 4 microplastic characterisation visual identification is one of the most inexpensive and commonly used methods for mp detection e g alomar et al 2016 cannas et al 2017 guerranti et al 2017 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 however it does not allow the determination of small particles european commission 2013 is susceptible to operator experience and errors crawford and quinn 2016 prata et al 2019 and does not allow conclusions about polymer composition in depth analyses can be done with high magnification microscopes staining techniques and via spectroscopy however over or underestimation of mps can occur for different techniques hidalgo ruz et al 2012 song et al 2015 and dyes have different limitations related to mp particle shape typology hydrophobicity and superficial alteration erni cassola et al 2017 prata et al 2019 shim et al 2016 tamminga et al 2017 reasonably a set of several methodologies is the optimal choice and therefore in this work spectroscopy was selected to confirm the results obtained via visual counting under the microscope the identification of mps by spectroscopy is time consuming and generally only an average from 1 to 10 of the sample is analysed international organization for standardization and european committee for standardization 2020 moreover the spectra of samples are difficult to match with the library ones obtaining high percentages because of the contaminated surface of plastics found in natural environments song et al 2015 in this study 10 of mps in each filter was analysed by micro ftir taking random mp particles fig 7 polyethylene 51 4 and polyvinyl alcohol 31 4 were the main types of mps found in the karst system waters followed by polyester 8 6 ethylene vinyl alcohol 2 9 polyvinyl chloride 2 9 and acrylic adhesive 2 9 considering cave groundwaters only polyethylene 56 5 and polyvinyl alcohol 30 4 were the main types of mps polyethylene polyester and polyvinyl chloride were also found in other analysed groundwaters mintenig et al 2019 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 selvam et al 2021 other different mps were identified in previous works such as polyamide nylon mintenig et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 selvam et al 2021 epoxy resin mintenig et al 2019 polypropylene polystyrene polycarbonate polyethylene terephthalate and polymethylmethacrylate samandra et al 2022 the mp composition is useful to understand the likely sources of pollution many of the plastics found are used in the production of textiles corroborating earlier assumptions on the origin of microplastics found in the waters of the karst system anyway natural artificial synthetic fibres and different types of mps contain chemical additives such as dyes whitening agents and other pollutants barker 1975 lee et al 2020 luo et al 2019 which can be discharged into the environment and ingested by aquatic organisms mcneish et al 2018 therefore further studies on the different pollutants associated with mps and textile fibres are necessary to quantify them and verify the possible environmental impacts 4 conclusions this preliminary investigation documents the presence of microplastics in the examined karst system from surface watercourses to cave waters the concentration of mps in the karst system water varied from 12 to 54 items l based on the analysis of karst waters microplastics less than 1 mm dominated the samples 82 9 and fibre was the main shape present 95 1 the detection of mp contamination is essential to define the issues related to pollution and establish strategies for karst areas and water conservation this work suggests that karst morphology and associated aquifers could allow the movement of microplastics into underground water flow systems providing useful references for further research future studies are needed to understand microplastic dynamics and transport in the karst system to determine pollution sources and to understand the potential effects on organisms and ecosystems as karst aquifers are open systems susceptible to contamination by surface pollutants the superficial areas should also be monitored greater efforts should be made to protect karst areas and underground resources implementing new strategies to monitor and valuate mp pollution and providing education to all stakeholders to find adequate solutions following the environmental sustainability principles especially for the management of water resources funding this work was realised within the research project showcave a

1237,microplastic pollution in different environments has increasingly been documented in detail in recent times but it is still poorly studied in caves and karst aquifers to deepen the knowledge of microplastic pollution for karst environment protection and conservation purposes we collected and investigated different water samples from a karst area of italy considering connected surface and cave waters microplastics were extracted from water samples by filtration and subjected to organic matter removal with 15 hydrogen peroxide solution microplastics on filters were counted and characterised size colour shape via visual identification under a microscope with and without uv light exploiting fluorescence given by fluorescent whitening additives contained in plastic materials finally spectroscopic analyses were carried out on 10 of the microplastics observed on each filter the concentration of microplastics in cave waters varied from 12 to 54 items l with a mean value of 28 items l in the surface water of a tributary it was of 23 items l and in the downstream it was 29 items l fibres represented the most abundant shape 95 1 in the karst system waters and most microplastics 82 9 were smaller than 1 mm the majority of the microplastics were fluorescent under uv light 84 8 and most fluorescent particles were transparent 46 however black microplastics 68 were more common among the non fluorescent ones polyethylene 51 7 was the main type of microplastics found in the karst system waters our results show the presence of microplastics in karst systems and provide useful information for future research karst aquifers are open systems subjected to possible contamination by surface pollutants microplastics in karst systems can be consumed by animals damage ecosystems and contaminate water resources surface karst areas and underground environments should therefore be monitored and protected especially regarding the management of water resources to further understand the sources and transport of microplastics within a karst system analyses on a greater range of surface and subterranean waters throughout the world are required graphical abstract

standardised size and colour sorting system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps are defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm and can be produced intentionally primary mps mainly for cosmetics or body care products or via the degradation and or fragmentation of plastic products due to physical chemical and biological processes corami

physical harm and can be sources and vectors for other contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants pops heavy metals pesticides and antibiotics li et al 2018 li et al 2019 rochman et al 2013 selvam et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 assessing mp presence and distribution in natural environments using accurate methods for quantification understanding their transport pathways and evaluating their impacts on organisms and habitats are necessary steps to be addressed for conservation purposes however research on mps is generally focused on the marine environment and surface ecosystems and only few studies have examined mp pollution in caves and underground systems e g balestra and bellopede 2022b christman 2019 vardar and vidal rodriguez 2021 regarding freshwater resources research is in its early stages the potential contamination of groundwater is often only mentioned and a limited number of studies focused on groundwater mp pollution e g khant and kim 2022 mintenig et al 2019 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 selvam et al 2021 viaroli et al 2022 moreover mp studies suffer from methodological discrepancies providing heterogeneous analysis results and the invisibility of the subterranean karst system structure makes impedes the study of such systems even if they preserve a precious asset such as groundwater sources of mps to groundwater include wastewater litter atmospheric deposition and soil and surface waters pollution atmospheric transport favours the distribution of mps over long distances in relation to wind direction and intensity rain snow precipitation intensity and duration allen et al 2019 in the hydrogeological cycle atmospheric water contribution is the main aquifer recharge the presence of mps in precipitation was detected in cities and remote areas allen et al 2019 liu et al 2019 highlighting the omnipresence of this contaminant therefore mp contamination in soil is strongly related to precipitation facilitating mp infiltration zhou et al 2021 when mps are deposited on the ground some can be transported vertically into the subsoil travelling over long distances throughout the rock fractures and accumulating in the groundwater system chia et al 2021 wanner 2021 previous studies highlighted the downward movement of microparticles through soil pores and cracks for smaller mps fahrenfeld et al 2019 mcgechan 2002 viaroli et al 2022 and vertical and horizontal migration in soil matrices could be also be related to bioturbation lwanga et al 2017 the hyporheic zone the zone between surface and groundwater is an important accumulation zone for mps of small dimensions frei et al 2019 the hydrogeological setting of the basin and seasonal trends must be taken into account as well as the flow regime of streams and riverbeds therefore hydrogeological information and aquifer types are decisive in choosing the sampling approach and detection method karst aquifers are groundwater environments usually made up of carbonate rock constituting about 25 of the global drinking water sources panno et al 2019 the hydrodynamic regime of these aquifers is affected by the geology and the rock cluster fracturing the karstification degree and the local meteorological conditions braun 1984 chauve et al 1990 hottelet et al 1993 moindrot et al 1988 considering the drainage system three basic conceptual aquifer models have been described systems with dominant drainage absent or reduced phreatic zone high permeability systems with interconnected drainage extensive phreatic zone high permeability and systems with dispersive circulation highly extensive phreatic zone middle low permeability balestra et al 2022a ford and williams 2013 ford and williams 1989 vigna 2007 vigna and banzato 2015 white 1969 various intermediate situations exist which can be described using these models considering hydro chemical data and spring hydrography banzato et al 2011 besides being important drinking water resources karst ecosystems and waters are particular habitats for troglobitic and endemic species e g balestra et al 2022b barzaghi et al 2021 which may be vulnerable to pollution manenti et al 2018 sket 1999 and karst caves have an exceptional scientific value and are a precious archive that must be protected from damage allowing paleo environmental and paleo climatic reconstructions and preserving palaeontological and archaeological finds balestra et al 2021 cigna and forti 2013 the open nature of karst aquifers makes them vulnerable to contamination by surface pollutants which can be transported through the rock fractures white 1988 or can directly access the karst systems through some caves especially tourist ones increasing the pollution risk balestra and bellopede 2022b balestra et al 2021 fractured and karst aquifers are subjected to greater pollution risk as mps are prone to circulate throughout the discontinuities even if mechanical dispersion may attenuate the contaminant concentration in some zones viaroli et al 2022 currently to the authors knowledge there is only one study on mp pollution in waters of karst areas monitoring springs and wells under low flow conditions panno et al 2019 studies on cave waters as well as mp pollution in surface and underground waters of the same karst area are lacking the vulnerability of groundwater resources to pollution anthropogenic pressure and climate change as well as their important role in natural ecosystems and as a fundamental drinking water reserve require actions targeted at underground environment protection and sustainable resources management balestra et al 2021 re 2019 therefore investigations are required for understanding the system dynamics and monitoring the state of the environmental health detecting the possible pollution and its sources the aims of this study which is the first of its kind are therefore i to preliminarily investigate mp pollution in karst systems from surface watercourses to cave waters to provide a reference for further research and ii to discuss the abundance morphological characteristic and types of mps in the karst system 2 materials method 2 1 study area the bossea karst system feeding area piedmont nw italy fig 1 is characterised by a belt of carbonate rocks laterally confined by poorly permeable rocks quartzites and meta volcanics fig 2 bossea cave frabosa soprana cn piedmont italy represents the final part of the karst system developing in the maudagna corsaglia watershed between the prato nevoso basin and the corsaglia river fig 2 the land cover is mostly composed of broadleaf forests of larches alternated with mountain meadows and pastures although in a part of it there are several ski slopes which attract many tourists in winter fig 2a the recharge of this aquifer fig 2b is mainly linked to primary and or secondary inputs the primary inputs or authigenic are by rain or snow melt directly recharging the aquifer whereas the secondary inputs or allogenic of concern are the surface runoff waters continuously recharging the aquifer trough sinkholes in the sub riverbed vigna 2020 rio roccia bianca is the main secondary supply contributing to the bossea karst system recharge fig 2 a series of tests were previously carried out in the two main absorbent valleys rio roccia bianca and rio bertino vigna 2020 using two different dyes tinopal and fluorescein to examine their arrivals in bossea cave this aquifer has a water circulation along karst conduits and fractures with an extensive and well developed saturated zone and can therefore be described as a system with interconnected drainage with a medium high permeability banzato et al 2011 bossea cave is the first show cave of italy open to the public since 1874 the cavity has a single entrance at 836 m a s l and an ascending structure fig 3 with a 2800 m development in the tectonic contact between the middle triassic dolomie di san pietro dei monti formation dolostone and carbonate rocks and permotriassic metavolcanics antonellini et al 2019 different underground karst laboratories to study and monitor hydrogeology subterranean meteorology radon activity and subterranean biology are located in the cave touristic and non touristic areas managed by struttura operativa bossea c a i biologia sotterranea piemonte gruppo di ricerca and the department of environment land and infrastructure engineering diati of the politecnico di torino working together with arpa piemonte and inrim automatic detectors were installed in different parts of the cave to continuously hourly monitor water quantitative and qualitative data such as flow rate q electrical conductivity ec and temperature t the flow rate is calculated through overflow vents or calibrated flow sections depending on the water levels bossea cave offers an ideal situation to study the groundwater circulation in a carbonate rock mass a main water collector called mora river and several water supplies with different flow rates related to rock fractures are present fig 3b continuous monitoring data carried out in bossea cave by the diati revealed that the collector has a flow rate ranging from 50 to 1200 l s developing for about 1 5 km in the cave and directly flowing in the corsaglia river with a set of springs banzato et al 2011 fiorucci et al 2015 fiorucci and vigna 2015 peano et al 2011 vigna et al 2017 the discontinuities are poorly or not karstified characterised by low flow circulation ranging from 0 01 to 2 5 l s pools of water or drips such as polla delle anatre one of the most important monitoring points in the bossea cave tracked for over 40 years with a highly constant flow rate 0 5 to 2 5 l s balestra et al 2022a vigna et al 2017 moreover secondary inputs continuously recharging the aquifer were previously monitored proving their arrivals in bossea cave and highlighting the surface and underground environment connections finally as the hydrodynamic response to rainfall events is characterised by a rather rapid increase in flow banzato et al 2011 the movement of pollutants from the surface to the underground environments could be rapid making this type of karst systems more subject to mp pollution 2 2 field sampling for data collected in flowing water it is essential to take into account the water flow rate to evaluate the correct mp percentage which clearly depends on the water flow moreover the season could affect the concentration of mps in the water hence sampling at different times could be performed to understand the impact of the season however these first samples taken punctually in the karst system are important to verify the presence of mps in surface and subterranean waters these data are scarce in karst areas and absent in caves if mps occur in each part of the system subsequent analyses will be carried out to verify the impact of the seasons sampling points were chosen to check pollution starting from the surface water streams that recharge the karst system examined up to the springs passing through the underground structures that accumulate in the water reserve and therefore can retain and or transport pollutants one surface water sample was taken from rio roccia bianca upstream the bossea cave fig 2 four groundwater samples were collected from different areas of the bossea cave figs 2 3 table 1 and one surface water sample was taken from the corsaglia river where the water of the collector emerges fig 2 in the bossea cave two samples were collected nearer to the tourist path uovo and sala frane and two in different non tourist areas sifone and polla delle anatre fig 3 table 1 as reference samples of unpolluted waters because these areas are not frequented by tourists or in close contact with human activities fig 3 table 1 in the tourist section the collector water flows from the innermost areas towards the entrance of the cave where the sala frane sampling area is located in this zone the collector water flows quickly before leaving the cave in certain areas of the cave landslides and speleothems convey a small amount of this water along secondary paths feeding dams of various sizes and slowing the flow such as in the uovo sampling area fig 3 table 1 here water flows between different gours a particular type of speleothem cave formation in the form of a stone dam hill and forti 1997 adjacent to the tourist route where an egg shaped statue is placed fig 3 table 1 in sifone the water comes out from the rock from below in a siphoning section and accumulates in a lake fig 3 table 1 it is possible to access the lake only by a rubber dinghy in a speleological section of the cave polla delle anatre is a small pool of water entering in the inner collector located in a non touristic cave zone visited only by researchers and speleologists fig 3 table 1 this water flows out of a fracture in the rock and is collected in a small tank with a weir for flow monitoring polla delle anatre flow has the typical characteristics of an interconnected drainage system with a flow rate ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 l s balestra et al 2022a groundwater and surface water samples were collected in september 2021 under low flow conditions being a preliminary investigation water samples were collected into 1 l glass vessels and capped immediately to prevent atmospheric contamination all sampling materials were pre cleaned with ethanol and distilled water to avoid contamination all samples were transported to the analytical laboratories of the politecnico di torino in ice filled coolers and kept refrigerated at 6 c until analysis 2 3 laboratory analysis microplastic samples were processed according to the previously published method for cave sediments balestra and bellopede 2022b adapted for the liquid matrix and improved to determine the particles using the infrared ir spectroscopy all researchers used nitrile gloves and cotton coats in all steps and all surfaces and materials used during sampling and laboratory analysis were cleaned with ethanol and distilled water to avoid mp contamination plastic equipment was replaced with glass or metal utensils each water sample was filtered through an 0 8 μm pore size silver filter gvs life sciences membrane disk 47 mm to allow a better analysis by ir spectroscopy filters were placed on glass petri dishes covered with aluminium foil and dried in an oven at 40 c for 2 h as previous studies have shown the importance of organic matter removal e g balestra and bellopede 2022b dried filters were subjected to this fundamental step through the application of 2 ml of 15 hydrogen peroxide solution left to react for 30 min at room temperature and dried again for 2 h at 50 c fluorescent whitening agents fwas are often used in the production of plastic qiu et al 2015 and mps with fwas can be easily detected under ultraviolet uv light ehlers et al 2020 klein and fischer 2019 microplastics on filters were observed alongside with and without an uv flashlight alonefire sv10 365 nm uv flashlight 5 w under a leitz ortholux ii pol mk microscope equipped with a deltapix invenio 12eiii 12 mpx camera with a 2 5 4 10 or higher magnification as some particles are difficult to distinguish from natural ones especially fibres comparisons with images of natural artificial and synthetic fibres under the microscope taken in previous works e g houck 2009 khan et al 2017 zhang 2014 were made the uv flashlight was positioned on a pedestal with an inclination of 45 visual identification was performed to identify mps in agreement with the strict selection criteria reported in previous works crawford and quinn 2016 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 noren 2007 fibres must have the same diameter along their entire length particles must have unvarying colours no cellular or organic structures must be present and red transparent or white particles must be examined under a high magnification or fluorescence microscope particles smaller than 0 1 mm were cut off as suggested by the european commission 2013 for visual identification under a microscope particles that could not be identified as mps were not take into consideration filters were observed by the same laboratory operator to ensure mp quantification and identification and reduce human errors the mps were categorised in relation to shape size and colour according to the standardised size and colour sorting system scs proposed by crawford and quinn 2016 usually an average from 1 to 10 of the sample is analysed to determine the chemical composition of the mps international organization for standardization and european committee for standardization 2020 randomly 10 of mps of each filter were analysed using a micro fourier transform infrared spectroscope micro ftir shimadzu aim 9000 microscope equipped with a shimadzu irtracer 100 spectrophotometer spectra were compared with the shimadzu standard library 3 results and discussion microplastics were found in all water samples highlighting mp pollution in the bossea karst system from surface watercourses to underground waters although for data collected in flowing water it is essential to take into consideration the water flow rate and the season to evaluate the correct mp abundance over time this first investigation in the karst area is important because it highlights the presence of mps in the surface and underground waters even in areas not directly affected by human activities taking into account the continuous monitoring data carried out in the bossea cave by the diati it is possible to associate the number of mps to the bossea collector 70 l s and polla delle anatre 0 5 l s flow rate in september 2021 3 1 microplastic abundance microplastics were found in all water samples including the two samples collected in the non touristic areas of the bossea cave microplastic abundance shape dimension and fluorescence are shown in table 2 the concentration of mps in cave water varied from 12 to 54 items l with a mean of 28 items l the mp abundance in the surface water of rio roccia bianca was 23 items l whereas in the corsaglia river it was 29 items l table 2 because there is no standardised method for assessing mps in water bodies comparisons are challenging since measurement methods and treatments can affect the results however some assumptions on the amounts of mps in karst environments can be made comparisons with other show cave water mp abundances are not possible at the moment as this study is the first one dealing with cave waters however a comparison with other groundwater and surface water samples from different areas of the world is possible table 3 to the authors knowledge the only work on a karst area monitoring springs and wells from two karst aquifers in illinois usa documented the presence of a maximum mp concentration of 15 2 items l mean of 7 9 items l in springs and a maximum concentration of 4 4 items l mean of 2 8 items l in wells under low flow conditions panno et al 2019 selvam et al 2021 analysed 24 groundwater samples from wells and bore wells collected in the post monsoon season in coastal south india pointing out a median concentration of 4 2 items l with a maximum concentration of 10 1 items l other values are reported in mintenig et al 2019 for nw germany groundwater with 5 6 items l much higher values were found in an alluvial unconfined groundwater aquifer in victoria australia with an average concentration of 38 8 items l samandra et al 2022 very low values 1 items l were found in chalk and sandstone aquifers of the uk johnson et al 2020 surface water samples in the same studied aquifers were analysed by selvam et al 2021 showing 7 8 items l with a maximum of 19 9 items l whereas mintenig et al 2019 reported 2 9 items l and samandra et al 2022 0 4 items l the microplastic abundances found in our study are high compared to those found in subterranean and surface waters of northwest germany mintenig et al 2019 illinois usa panno et al 2019 or south india selvam et al 2021 whereas they are lower than those detected in groundwaters examined in victoria australia samandra et al 2022 however it should be considered that the size of mps taken into account the sampling point the flow rate the season and the sources of mps in the catchment may impact the concentrations of mps in waters in non tourist areas of the cave the mp abundance in waters was similar to that in tourist areas and a high number of mps in the karst system water was found in the inner area of the cave where the water comes out of a siphoning area instead the bossea cave sediments collected in tourist areas contained more than twice as many mps as those collected in non tourist areas suggesting that pollution is related to the passage of tourists the microplastic presence in cave water including water coming out of the rock in the non tourist sections sifone and polla delle anatre suggests pollution linked to hydrogeologic connections from the surface to the underground aquifers the high presence of fractures in the rocks of this karst area could favour pollutant transport in the underground environment as suggested in panno et al 2019 it is reasonable to assume that the high degree of karstification in different zones the presence of a well organised outflow network and the plenty water flows play a fundamental role in the transport of mps in this karst system the contact between water and sediments could increase the mp concentrations in the bossea karst system water microplastic pollution in the soil of this karst area could be related to the intense winter and summer activities in the zones above the karst system and the area is rich in ski resorts prato nevoso country the presence of waste in these areas is not unusual possible sources include plastic litter from anthropogenic activities and synthetic fibres from clothes in these areas surface waters that feed rio roccia bianca and rio bertino streams were collected the main secondary supplies contributing to the bossea karst system recharge vigna 2020 a series of tests with dyes previously carried out in the two main absorbent valleys indicated that the waters coming from rio roccia bianca and rio bertino arrive in bossea cave in a relatively short time during lean periods the rio roccia bianca waters arrive in the bossea cave collector after 4 days speed of about 644 m day whereas in flood periods they arrive after only 1 day speed of about 2460 m day moreover rio roccia bianca provides a much higher quantity of water to the bossea systems than rio bertino although currently there are no studies on the atmospheric transport of pollutants in this area soil pollution could be related to or aggravated by the atmospheric transport of particles depositing on the ground thanks to precipitation and wind as well as any other contamination between adjacent environments linked to human activities from the near countries of fontane and prato nevoso in underground environments tourists are carriers of alien particles such as lint organic matter dust and pollutants addesso et al 2022 balestra and bellopede 2022b jablonsky et al 1993 liu et al 2021 puławska et al 2021 and therefore waters in the tourist parts of the cave uovo and sala frane could be enriched with pollutants such as mps in cave sediments balestra and bellopede 2022b which could be transported into different parts of the cave and outside in the corsaglia river our data do not show a definitive link to the suggested sources of pollution but offer information about the hydrogeologic connections showing opportunities for future research on mp dynamics in subterranean waters in karst environments 3 2 microplastic shape and size microplastics were categorised according to the standardised size and colour sorting system scs described in crawford and quinn 2016 table 2 fibres represented the majority of the mps present in cave and surface waters 17 1 between 1 and 5 mm and 78 between 0 1 and 0 99 mm of length figs 4 5 and table 2 followed by fragments 4 3 micro fragments fig 5 and table 2 some microbeads 0 6 were also observed whereas no foam and films were found in this karst system fig 5 and table 2 as in previous research fibres and fragments are the main shapes present in the groundwaters albeit at different concentrations such as 94 fragments samandra et al 2022 or 100 fibres panno et al 2019 as more than 60 of the world textiles are produced from synthetic fibres henry and klepp 2018 synthetic clothes could be the main source of mp pollution in this karst system the fragment source could be linked to human activity on the surface or the presence of degraded waste in soil or could have been produced during the electric system works in the cave according to crawford and quinn 2016 mps are categorised into microplastics 1 5 mm and mini microplastics 1 mm 1 μm using visual identification under a microscope allowed the analysis of mp particles from 5 to 0 1 mm in this investigation mini mps accounted for 82 9 of the total mps found in the water karst system and for 84 of the mps found in cave water only fig 5 and table 2 the microplastic shape and size percentages found in bossea cave waters were similar to those described for cave sediments balestra and bellopede 2022a balestra and bellopede 2022b however the means of transport and the source could be different microplastic found in the bossea cave sediments could be mainly related to the passage of tourists along the cave path and the speleologists crossing the non tourist passage to reach the internal laboratory balestra and bellopede 2022b in contrast the sources of mps in the cave waters can be linked to cave tourism and pollution of the land above the sources and transport of mps in the cave should be studied in more detail to better understand mp pollution in karst areas as suggested in panno et al 2019 the relative size of mp particles offers some insight into their movement the mps found in underground waters in this study were similar to those collected in the surface waters in this karst area water migrates from the surface to the underground environments via sinkholes and rapidly enters the fractures and crevices of the underlying aquifers reaching the cave and finally discharging into the corsaglia river through the soil pores and along irregular fractures and crevices the larger mps would be impeded and only the smaller mp fractions would reach and migrate through the karst aquifers 3 3 microplastic fluorescence and colour the highest mp abundance was fluorescent under uv light 84 8 fig 4 table 2 with a percentage similar to that found for mps in cave sediments 87 7 balestra and bellopede 2022a balestra and bellopede 2022b exploiting fluorescent whitening agents fwas in plastics mps can be easily found using an inexpensive uv flashlight fig 4 however there are also several limitations qiu et al 2015 not all plastics contain fwas fig 4a b orange arrow and different naturally fluorescent organic and inorganic matter compounds could be misunderstood as mps organic fluorescent particles may account for more than half of the total fluorescent particles in the samples analysed in cave environment balestra and bellopede 2022b and therefore organic matter removal is a fundamental step in mp determination figs 6 shows the different colours of the collected mps of the fluorescent particles fig 6a 46 were transparent followed by red 16 5 blue 10 8 beige 7 2 and amber 4 3 ones the mps with other colours accounted for less than 4 of the total fluorescent ones non fluorescent mps fig 6b were mainly black 68 or blue 20 followed by green transparent and violet ones 4 the major part of the fluorescent particles in water are transparent as reported in balestra and bellopede 2022b for bossea cave sediments the other main colours are similar with the exception of red particles which are more abundant in water the non fluorescent mp particles were mainly black and blue confirming the data found for bossea cave sediments balestra and bellopede 2022b however the percentages were different as well as the colour of the less abundant mps these facts could be related to the presence of particles with different densities more easily transportable in water with a different degree of biodeterioration or a diverse pollution source transparent mps were also prevalent in groundwaters analysed in selvam et al 2021 followed by white and blue ones whereas in panno et al 2019 65 of the analysed mps were blue and or clear whereas the other common colours were red 15 and grey 13 the mp colour could provide an indication of the chemical pollutants for example yellow and black mps could indicate high levels of pollutants frias et al 2010 karapanagioti et al 2011 in the bossea karst system about 68 of non fluorescent mps were black and future investigations should be carried out to monitor possible environmental contaminations moreover the colour of mps can be correlated with the consumption by organisms carpenter et al 1972 romeo et al 2015 shaw and day 1994 being confused with trophic resources in natural subterranean systems there is no light and therefore the colour of mps does not play a particular role in hypogeal animal ingestion however the colour and fluorescence of mp particles may be relevant for less cave adapted and epigeal organisms in watercourses and adjacent habitats 3 4 microplastic characterisation visual identification is one of the most inexpensive and commonly used methods for mp detection e g alomar et al 2016 cannas et al 2017 guerranti et al 2017 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 however it does not allow the determination of small particles european commission 2013 is susceptible to operator experience and errors crawford and quinn 2016 prata et al 2019 and does not allow conclusions about polymer composition in depth analyses can be done with high magnification microscopes staining techniques and via spectroscopy however over or underestimation of mps can occur for different techniques hidalgo ruz et al 2012 song et al 2015 and dyes have different limitations related to mp particle shape typology hydrophobicity and superficial alteration erni cassola et al 2017 prata et al 2019 shim et al 2016 tamminga et al 2017 reasonably a set of several methodologies is the optimal choice and therefore in this work spectroscopy was selected to confirm the results obtained via visual counting under the microscope the identification of mps by spectroscopy is time consuming and generally only an average from 1 to 10 of the sample is analysed international organization for standardization and european committee for standardization 2020 moreover the spectra of samples are difficult to match with the library ones obtaining high percentages because of the contaminated surface of plastics found in natural environments song et al 2015 in this study 10 of mps in each filter was analysed by micro ftir taking random mp particles fig 7 polyethylene 51 4 and polyvinyl alcohol 31 4 were the main types of mps found in the karst system waters followed by polyester 8 6 ethylene vinyl alcohol 2 9 polyvinyl chloride 2 9 and acrylic adhesive 2 9 considering cave groundwaters only polyethylene 56 5 and polyvinyl alcohol 30 4 were the main types of mps polyethylene polyester and polyvinyl chloride were also found in other analysed groundwaters mintenig et al 2019 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 selvam et al 2021 other different mps were identified in previous works such as polyamide nylon mintenig et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 selvam et al 2021 epoxy resin mintenig et al 2019 polypropylene polystyrene polycarbonate polyethylene terephthalate and polymethylmethacrylate samandra et al 2022 the mp composition is useful to understand the likely sources of pollution many of the plastics found are used in the production of textiles corroborating earlier assumptions on the origin of microplastics found in the waters of the karst system anyway natural artificial synthetic fibres and different types of mps contain chemical additives such as dyes whitening agents and other pollutants barker 1975 lee et al 2020 luo et al 2019 which can be discharged into the environment and ingested by aquatic organisms mcneish et al 2018 therefore further studies on the different pollutants associated with mps and textile fibres are necessary to quantify them and verify the possible environmental impacts 4 conclusions this preliminary investigation documents the presence of microplastics in the examined karst system from surface watercourses to cave waters the concentration of mps in the karst system water varied from 12 to 54 items l based on the analysis of karst waters microplastics less than 1 mm dominated the samples 82 9 and fibre was the main shape present 95 1 the detection of mp contamination is essential to define the issues related to pollution and establish strategies for karst areas and water conservation this work suggests that karst morphology and associated aquifers could allow the movement of microplastics into underground water flow systems providing useful references for further research future studies are needed to understand microplastic dynamics and transport in the karst system to determine pollution sources and to understand the potential effects on organisms and ecosystems as karst aquifers are open systems susceptible to contamination by surface pollutants the superficial areas should also be monitored greater efforts should be made to protect karst areas and underground resources implementing new strategies to monitor and valuate mp pollution and providing education to all stakeholders to find adequate solutions following the environmental sustainability principles especially for the management of water resources funding this work was realised within the research project showcave a

1238,identifying a contaminant time varying release history is an ill posed problem but crucial for groundwater contamination issues a precise inversed release history offers a promising estimation of contaminant movement and is of great importance for environmental monitoring and further management in this paper a recent emerging data assimilation method the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda is employed to handle this conundrum the study starts with some synthetic cases in which several factors are analyzed such as the observation data frequency covariance inflation schemes iteration numbers used in the es mda for the purpose of identifying a time varying contaminant injection event with different precision the results show that the es mda performs well in recovering the release history when the injection is discretized into 50 or 100 time steps but encounters fluctuation problems in the cases with 300 time steps further comparison reveals that the observation data frequency is a very influential factor while the number of iterations or the kind of covariance inflation used has a lesser effect nevertheless this is a first test in a non synthetic environment in which the es mda has proven its ability to recover the release history in two close to reality sandbox experiments the outcome shows that the es mda with rafiee s inflation scheme has the ability to capture the main pattern of the release history but in order to move one more step to field cases a more detailed description of uncertainties or elaborated parameterization of the time functions is paramount keywords inverse modeling source identification inflation factor data assimilation sandbox data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination has gained extensive attention over the last several decades e g feyen et al 2003b feyen et al 2003a gómez hernández et al 2003 li et al 2011 dai et al 2020 since it is becoming a huge threat to our ecosystem determining the responsible for the pollution is a forensic hydrogeology task needed to ensure the accountability of those responsible this is not an easy task since in general only a few observations downstream from the source are available when the contamination is first detected even with the help of advanced groundwater models and with assumptions such as knowing the release location identifying the release history and therefore the total amount of pollutants injected into the aquifer has proven to be a complicated endeavour a challenge that faces the problem of ill posedness skaggs and kabala 1994 carrera and neuman 1986 woodbury et al 1998 common to all inverse problems franssen and gómez hernández 2002 capilla et al 1998 wen et al 1999 ayvaz 2010 various methods have been devised to address this problem and several reviews have been published in the subject e g atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001 michalak and kitanidis 2004 bagtzoglou and atmadja 2005 sun et al 2006a gómez hernández and xu 2021 among all these methods simulation optimization methods have been used from a very early age gorelick et al 1983 and they aim to minimize the inconsistency between simulated and observed based on an objective function sun et al 2006b mirghani et al 2009 ayvaz 2010 but still need to reformulate the problem from the beginning if new measurements are acquired zhou et al 2014 therefore one branch data assimilation methods comes out ahead because of their ability to deal with huge amounts of observed data simultaneously data assimilation methods are versatile efficient and simple to understand and implement zhou et al 2014 among the data assimilation methods the ensemble kalman filter enkf stands out it was first proposed by evensen 2003 in order to deal with the nonlinear relationship between parameters and state variables in inverse problems and has gained popularity in multidisciplinary fields such as oceanography meteorology and geology e g houtekamer and mitchell 2001 bertino et al 2003 chen and zhang 2006 aanonsen et al 2009 specifically in hydrogeology the enkf method has proven the ability to inverse identify aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity chen and zhang 2006 huang et al 2009 kurtz et al 2014 porosity li et al 2012 recharge rates franssen and kinzelbach 2009 boundary conditions chen and zhang 2006 and also transport related parameters lan et al 2018 more recently researchers have started to employ enkf variants to identify the parameters describing a contaminant source in aquifers zhou et al 2011 butera et al 2013 employ a geostatistical approach with some weak hypotheses to identify the pollutant release history and the source location xu and gómez hernández 2016 use the restart normal score ensemble kalman filter ns enkf for contaminant source identification in a synthetic deterministic aquifer and later extended this method to jointly identify hydraulic conductivity and source information xu and gómez hernández 2018 then chen et al 2018 move one step further to identify contaminant source information plus the position and length of a vertical barrier in a sandbox experiment via the restart ensemble kalman filter chen et al 2021 also discuss the influence of different inflation methods in the application of the restart ns enkf and prove its ability for the joint identification of hydraulic conductivities and contaminant source information in a laboratory sandbox experiment li et al 2019 used kalman filtering combined with a mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model to deduce the accurate location and release history of a contaminant source the aforementioned works are a strong demonstration that the enkf and its variants are valid methods for contaminant source identification however except for the work by butera et al 2013 the release history identified in these works only focuses on a constant pulse the magnitude of which is independent of time as an alternative to the enkf the ensemble smoother es which was first introduced by van leeuwen and evensen 1996 assimilates all available data in one single step instead of updating the state variable sequentially thus it is expected that it should be able to identify time varying parameters better than the enkf and at a cheaper price the enkf and the es produce the same results when they deal with linear state transfer functions since they are based on the same covariance based formulation evensen 2004 however in studying process with strong nonlinearities such as in the case of inverting the groundwater flow and mass transport equations the enkf outperformed the es evensen and van leeuwen 2000 until an iterative variant of the es was proposed the es with multiple data assimilation es mda by emerick and reynolds 2013 evensen 2018 compared the es mda with other iterative ensemble smoothers to solve history matching problems ranazzi and sampaio 2019 investigated the influence of the ensemble size on the use of an adaptive es mda for history matching todaro et al 2019 use the es mda to find a solution to the reverse flow routing problem bao et al 2020 coupled generative adversarial networks and es mda methods then use them to reconstruct the channel structures and reduce the uncertainty of hydraulic head and contaminant concentration predictions xu et al 2021 employed the es mda to identify contaminant source parameters and heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity jointly with the comparison with restart enkf todaro et al 2021 employed es mda for the simultaneous identification of the source location and the release history of a groundwater contamination event these works are all good examples of es mda dealing with time varying input parameters however most of the aforementioned work approximated the time varying parameters by a multiple step function without analyzing the impact that the step size had in the results the objective of this paper is to assess the capacity of the es mda for identifying complex time varying release history and to check the possible obstacles to apply the es mda in closer to reality cases in this work the es mda is employed to identify a time varying release history in both synthetic and real cases the capacity of es mda in identifying a release history function as a function of the discretization used to approximate it is analyzed first then a synthetic case is studied where the influence of observation data frequency and number of es mda iterations are discussed the synthetic also served to analyze two covariance inflation procedures e g le et al 2016 rafiee and reynolds 2017 to prevent smoother collapsing next the es mda is applied to the identification of release history functions in two sandbox experiments it is the first time to testify the capacity of es dmda in identifying time varying release history with a sandbox experiment the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the methodology in section 3 the synthetic and the real sandbox experiment are presented followed by the setup of different scenarios and evaluation criteria finally in section 4 we discuss the results and draw some conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 groundwater flow and solute transport equations in this work the contaminant is injected with a given flow rate into a transient groundwater flow system thus the governing equations includes both the transient groundwater flow equation bear 1972 and the solute transport equation zheng and wang 1999 1 s s h t k h w 2 θ c t θ d c θ vc q s c s where s s represents the specific storage l 1 h is the hydraulic head l t denotes time t is the divergence operator while represents the gradient operator k denotes the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and w represents distributed sources or sinks t 1 θ represents the porosity of the medium c is dissolved concentration ml 3 d represents the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor l 2 t 1 v is the flow velocity vector lt 1 derived from the solution of the flow equation q s represents volumetric flow rate per unit volume of aquifer associated with a fluid source or sink t 1 and c s is the concentration of the source or sink ml 3 2 2 ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda as we mentioned before the es mda is an improvement of the es made by emerick and reynolds 2013 for handling nonlinear models it is an iterative version of the es where the number of iterations is predefined the method is easy to understand and to implement and has been referred many times in the literature emerick and reynolds 2013 evensen 2018 xu et al 2021 a brief recall of the three steps that conform the method are described next 1 initialization step an ensemble of n e realizations of the n parameters to identify is generated in this case the parameters are the mass loadings in time representing the discretized injection curve their initial values are drawn from predefined uniform distributions each ensemble member is a different release history function at this stage we also need to set the number of iterations n a also referred to as assimilation steps and the inflation factors α j the meaning of which are described later 2 assimilation once the number of iterations and the inflation coefficients are determined it is time for the assimilation procedure which consists of two steps a forecast step and an update step these two steps are repeated for each iteration a forecast step in this step the groundwater flow and contaminant transport models modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3ds e g zheng 2010 ma et al 2012 are run for each member of the ensemble in our case for each different release history 3 c i j f ψ c 0 a i j where ψ represents the forward numerical model c 0 stands for the initial concentrations in the domain c i j f are the predicted concentrations in space and time at assimilation iteration j for the last estimate of the release function i of the ensemble a i j the size of a depends on the number of time steps used to discretize it b update step then the model parameters are updated as follows 4 a i j 1 a i j δ a j δ c j f t δ c j f δ c j f t α j r 1 y obs α j ε c o i j f where y obs is a column vector with dimensions n o n t containing all observed concentrations at all locations and all time steps n o is the number of locations and n t the number of observation steps ε stands for the observation error while r is the covariance matrix of the observation error c o i j f is the vector of forecasted concentrations for the ensemble parameter set a i j at the same locations and times where and when observations y obs are made δ a j and δ c j are matrices defined as 5 δ a j 1 n e 1 a 1 j a j a 2 j a j a n e j a j 6 δ c j f 1 n e 1 c 1 j f c f j c 2 j f c f j c n e j f c f j where a j and c f j are the ensemble means of source release history parameters and forecasted concentrations at the j th iteration respectively the products δ c j f δ c j f t and δ a j δ c j f t are the concentration covariance and the concentration release function parameters cross covariance respectively these forecast and update steps will be repeated until the predefined iterations are completed one more thing needs to be pointed out in our study since the number of measurements is larger than the ensemble size it is necessary to employ the truncated singular value decomposition tsvd method to compute a pseudo inverse in eq 4 2 3 the inflation factors α j the iteration number n a and the inflation factor α j are two influential parameters in the performance of the es mda which are related to one another emerick and reynolds 2013 have proven that the es mda could sample the posterior probability distribution function of the parameters precisely only in a linear model and only if the inflation factors α j satisfy the following equation 7 j 1 n a 1 α j 1 there are still many options on how to choose the α j parameters satisfying the previous equation apparently choosing a decreasing series may be the most appropriate but some authors claim that using uniform values gives similar results and that choosing these values arbitrarily may lead to filter collapse le et al 2016 we have decided to explore two methods to select the inflation factors one proposed by rafiee and reynolds 2017 and the other one proposed by evensen 2018 rafiee and reynolds 2017 propose that the inflation factor for the first iteration is computed as 8 α 1 1 n i 1 n λ i 2 where n is the minimum of n e and n o n t and λ i are the singular values of matrix d j given by 9 d j r 1 2 c j f the subsequent inflation factors are chosen in a geometrical decreasing progression 10 α j β j 1 α 1 where β is the ratio that fulfills that the sum of the inverse of the inflation factors equals one eq 4 11 1 1 β n a 1 1 1 β α 1 evensen 2018 define the inflation factors on the basis of two numbers a nonzero value α 1 and a geometrical ratio α geo with these two numbers a sequence is built according to the following procedure 12 α j 1 α j α geo which is then normalized to provide the α j values that satisfy eq 4 13 α j α j j 1 n a 1 α j this scheme has the capacity of defining the inflation factors as uniform in an increasing sequence or in a decreasing one by choosing an α geo equal below or above one respectively here we define α geo and α 1 with the values of 2 and 1 respectively in this work these two different schemes of generating the inflation factors are employed and their impact is discussed all in all the overall description and detailed procedures of the proposed data assimilation framework are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 3 applications a numerical model based on real sandbox experiments is used to demonstrate the proposed method this sandbox equipment was built up by the engineering and architecture department at the university of parma and has been employed in several groundwater contamination studies citarella et al 2015 cupola et al 2015 zanini and woodbury 2016 in this work first we generated synthetic data using this numerical model to test the es mda method for the identification of a time varying release history curve in the synthetic case we also analyze the impact of the choice of the method to choose the inflation factors the number of iterations the size of the observation time intervals and the degree of discretization with which the release curve is represented in the numerical model then we tested the es mda with real observation data and analyzed the impact of the observation error magnitude 3 1 sandbox set up the sandbox has an internal volume of 95 cm by 10 cm by 70 cm and is discretized into 95 columns 1 row and 70 layers glass beads with two different diameters 1 mm and 4 mm are used to fill the sandbox as shown in fig 2 the spatial distribution of the bead is heterogeneous and so is the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the sandbox the hydraulic conductivity and the porosity or each bead size were obtained previously by cupola et al 2015 the reservoirs upstream and downstream are set up as constant piezometric boundaries with a water level of 62 5 cm and 60 6 cm respectively the bottom of the sandbox is regarded as a no flow boundary while the top of the sandbox is a phreatic surface the fluorescein was chosen as the tracer and was released by an injector installed inside the glass beads during the experiment fluorescein is a non toxic compound that can be easily handled after the experiments in the meanwhile it also has the characteristics of strong resistance to sorption and can be regarded as a conservative tracer smart and laidlaw 1977 contaminant concentrations are observed in 25 observation points the details about the acquisition of the concentration data could be found in citarella et al 2015 and cupola et al 2015 the total experiment time is 3000s and the injection starts at time zero the main hydraulic parameters used for the simulation are listed in table 2 3 2 performance assessment the use of an ensemble based method allows to analyze the performance of the method using the root mean square error rmse and the relative rmse 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n a i ref a i 2 15 relative rmse rmse intial rmse where n is the number of points used to discretize the release history curve a i ref is the i th point of the reference release history while a i stands for the ensemble mean of the i th point of the updated release history initial rmse refers to the rmse of the initial ensemble of realizations based on the definition of rmse the smaller the value the better the relative rmse is able to show the reduction of the uncertainty both parameters serve to evaluate quantitatively the outcome of es mda 3 3 synthetic case the first set of analyses is based on the synthetic simulation of a time varying release into the sandbox digital twin the release function adopted is based on a proposal by skaggs and kabala 1994 16 s t 2 6 exp t 10 20 2 50 0 78 exp t 10 50 2 200 1 3 exp t 10 90 2 98 0 t 3000 this function is shown in fig 3 we run three sets of scenarios with different time discretizations while identifying the release history more precisely we chose to identify a release function over the 3000 s experiment duration using 50 100 and 300 time steps for each discretization two sampling frequencies were considered samples were taken every other time step or every ten time steps also the number of assimilation iterations was varied between 4 and 8 based on a comprehensive consideration of computational time cost and outcome accuracy xu et al 2021 and both the rafiee and evensen inflation schemes were tested in total 24 scenarios were analyzed as reported in table 3 and in all scenarios the model error is neglected while we assume the observation errors follow gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0 1 mg l an ensemble of 500 realizations was used the initial release history curve of every realization is generated using a uniform distribution with ranges 0 52 10 3 mg s fig 4 shows the recovered release history for the set of scenarios with the coarsest discretization of the release function 50 time steps in each plot the blue curve corresponds to the actual release history the gray lines are the recovered release history curves for all 500 realizations the red dotted line is the median of the ensemble and the black dashed lines mark the 5 and 95 percentiles the first column uses rafiee s inflation and the second column evensen s inflation the first two rows use samples every ten time steps 5 snapshots and the last two rows samples every other time step 25 snapshots the first and third rows use four iterations and the second and fourth rows use eight iterations it can be observed that the median of the recovered release history curves is a good estimate of the actual release history for all cases while the uncertainty estimate given by the spread of the curves is larger for the scenarios with the smallest sampling frequency scenarios s1 to s4 also it can be noticed that rafiee s inflation method always yields a smaller spread than evensen s one it is hard to argue about an improvement with the largest number of iterations since the results with four and eight iterations are almost the same fig 5 shows the recovered release history of the set of scenarios with intermediate discretization of the release function 100 time steps the organization of the plots in the figure are the same as in the previous one the impact of the inflation scheme the observation data frequency and the number of iterations is more or less the same as for the 50 time step case however the median of the recovered release history curves cannot capture the actual release history as precisely as in the previous set of realizations more notably in the set of scenarios with samples every 10 time steps scenarios s9 to s12 for all scenarios there is clearly an excess of fluctuations in the recovered release curves noticeable in the individual curves and also in the ensemble median and percentile curves this fluctuation is more noticeable when the observation sampling frequency is smaller scenarios s9 to s12 the fluctuations must be due to the inherent ill posedness of the problem since we are trying to estimate a large number of parameters that initially are assumed to be independent this problem could be alleviated by introducing some smoothing factor that forces that all updated curves after updating display a certain smoothness it is also important to notice the poor estimation of the release curve at the end of the experiment with a clear non zero estimation for the final steps this overestimation which is less patent in the previous set of scenarios must be due to the little or no sensitivity that observations have to release at the end of the simulation the deterioration in the estimation of the release curves becomes exacerbated when the number of discretization steps is increased up to 300 fig 6 shows the results for scenarios s17 to s24 and their arrangement follows the same pattern as the previous two figures the original release curves are only hinted at by the final ensemble of realizations or their median values the main three peaks are well identified but several other peaks appear the spread of the realizations is very wide and the fluctuations in time are also quite noticeable as in the previous set of scenarios using a different parameterization of the release curve enforcing some kind of regularization might have helped in removing these artifacts the only positive conclusion from this set of realizations is that as in the previous two sets the best results are always obtained when using rafiee s inflation scheme eight iterations and the highest sampling frequency for a more quantitative evaluation of the performance of the es mda to recover the time varying release history table 4 and fig 7 illustrates the rmse and the relative rmse of all 24 scenarios based on the rmse at the last iteration step we can conclude that the es mda with rafiee s scheme has a better performance in most scenarios for our case especially when the observation data frequency is low it is striking to see how the rmse jumps to up to four times the rmse of the initial ensemble on the first iteration for the fine discretization scenarios last row of fig 7 a distinct mark of ill posedness in the formulation of the problem this phenomenon can be attributed to insufficient observation data but also to correlation of observations error in time evensen and eikrem 2018 one possible solution could be enlarging the ensemble size or subsampling the independent observation data one more thing that needs to be taken into consideration is the computational time cost of the scenarios in our proposed data assimilation framework the main time consuming comes from the forecast procedure a single simulation of groundwater flow and solute transport model in a typical laptop needs 27s 31s and 54s for the 50 100 and 300 time steps model respectively and the total time consumption for these three models with an iteration number of 4 is approximately 54044s 62288s and 108288s once the iteration number becomes 8 the time cost will also be doubled based on these analysis and for the sake of outcome accuracy we decide to apply the es mda to the sandbox experiments using rafiee s inflation scheme discretizing the release history into 50 or 100 time steps and with 8 assimilation iterations 3 4 laboratory case we performed two sandbox experiments with two release history curves the first curve displays a train of four pulses lasting the entire duration of the experiment and the second curve consists of two pulses at the beginning of the experiment fig 8 in this experiment we will not attempt to identify simultaneously the release and the conductivities but rather we will use the identified distribution of conductivities and observation errors from a previous work chen et al 2021 shown in fig 9 the observation errors follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of 1 mg l several scenarios will be analyzed that are described in tables 5 and 6 fig 10 shows the recovered release history curves for the first sandbox experiment the train of pulses the observed performance is quite similar to the one observed for the synthetic experiments the scenario with the smaller number of discretization steps and the highest frequency for that discretization is the one performing best the same phenomenon of excess of fluctuation as that in the synthetic cases is observed at the four peaks of the release curve this phenomenon is more obvious with larger discretization scenarios r3 r4 indicating a growth of the ill posedness of the problem one promising way to reduce this fluctuation could be to increase the observation frequency as the comparison between scenarios r1 r2 and r3 r4 shows but we must argue that this fluctuation is inevitable in real cases because of the adverse impact of observation error fig 11 shows the recovered release curves for the second experiment the two pulses the same behavior as before is appreciated here large fluctuations about the two main peaks of the injection with the best estimation by the median of the scenario with the smallest number of discretization steps and the largest frequency of observation yet there is a major failure in this test case that the method is not able to capture the fact that the injection stops slightly before the middle of the experiment at about 1200 s except for r6 in all scenarios most injection curves for the individual members of the ensemble display positive values for the second half of the experiment and their median is still a relatively large positive value clearly overestimating the total mass injected into the system since the es mda method has the ability to identify similar releasing histories in the synthetic cases we believe the main explanation for this overall behavior is the magnitude of the observation error in the meanwhile like the performance in fig 5 the overestimation of release towards the end of the experiment is also quite noticeable due to the same reason we stated before this phenomenon once again proves the observations at the end of the simulation is insensitive to the final steps of the release table 7 and fig 12 show the evolution of the rmse and relative rmse for the two sandbox scenarios the results prove that the es mda with rafiee s inflation scheme is an effective method in recovering releasing history in both sandbox experiments the rmse for all 8 scenarios is reduced after assimilating the observation data a comparison among the different sandbox scenarios also shows that a high observation data frequency has a lesser impact on the outcome than in the synthetic cases this phenomenon is particularly obvious for scenarios r3 r4 and r7 r8 which are the cases with 100 time steps we believe it is mainly caused by the uncertainty of the observation data for a further evaluation of the results we use the updated release history to generate contaminant plume evolution to visually analyze the capacity of the es dma with rafiee s inflation scheme to reproduce the real plumes figs 13 and 14 show the ensemble means of the contaminant plumes at time steps 600 s 1200 s 1800 s and 2400 s for scenarios r2 r4 r6 and r8 we can observe that the simulated plume always spreads more than the reference a consequence of the overestimation of the non injection period however compared with the reference contaminant plume in the left column the simulated plumes from the updated release history for the 4 scenarios are all acceptable reproductions of the reference 4 discussions the es mda has proven to be an efficient method for the identification of contaminant source parameters e g the source location and release concentration in a synthetic aquifer xu et al 2021 here we employ it to identify complex contaminate release histories in both synthetic and real laboratory cases in the synthetic cases we have analyzed the following impact factors on the identification different inflation schemes the number of iterations the size of the observation time intervals and the degree of discretization our results show that the es mda with rafiee s inflation scheme performs well and that more accurate identification can be achieved with more iteration steps at a higher computational cost the recovered release curve may suffer from an excess of fluctuations especially with larger discretization time steps and one possible way to handle this problem is to increase the frequency of the observation data in real laboratory cases the challenge mainly comes from observation errors especially when the observed luminosity is transformed into concentration data the magnitude of the observation error seems to undermine the identification by the es mda and larger fluctuation problems appear especially in the second experiment however in terms of reproducing the reference plumes by the recovered release history we prove the es mda is a promising method in the identification of contaminant release history in this work we successfully prove the ability of the proposed data assimilation framework to reconstruct the release history in a simple sandbox experiment we are getting closer to a real field application although we are still far from it in the lab experiment there were many parameters that were known which will be uncertain in practice our next steps will be to complexify the identification problem including the uncertainties on those parameters that are not fully known in practice in addition we should remark that although the es mda method is more efficient than alternative bayesian based inversion methods it is still a challenge to address high dimensional problems 5 summary and conclusions in this paper we employ the es mda to identify a time varying release history with different precision in both synthetic and laboratory cases in the synthetic cases we examined the capacity of the es mda to identify the release function for i different levels of time discretizations with a ratio of 1 to 6 between the coarsest and finest discretizations ii the impact of the observation data frequency every other time step versus one step every ten time steps iii the choice of the inflation factors between rafiee s and evensen s proposals and iv the impact of the number of iterations in the es mda formulation between four and eight in total 24 scenarios with combinations of the aforementioned features were generated and compared the results show that the es mda with rafiee s scheme has a better performance in most scenarios in our case also in all scenarios increasing the observation data frequency always improves the identification of the recovered release history curve the number of iterations whether four or eight does not have an important effect on the performance of the es mda in general the es mda performs well in recovering the release history when the discretization is equal to 50 or 100 time steps but displays large fluctuations in the scenarios with 300 time steps we believe this problem could be alleviated by choosing a different parameterization of the release curve rather than using uncorrelated uniform random numbers to generate the initial ensemble of realizations this is a first test in a real environment in which the es mda using rafiee s inflation scheme and eight iterations has been tested in two closer to reality sandbox experiments with two release history curves a train of four pulses and two pulses during the first half of the experiment the results show that the es mda works well for the train of pulses but overestimates the injection concentrations for the second experiment after the two pulses have ended we believe that this poor behavior could be explained again by the parameterization of the injection curves and the magnitude of the concentration observation errors in conclusion the es mda is a method capable to identify a time varying release history in both synthetic and real cases better results than the ones presented here could have been obtained with a more elaborated parameterization of the time functions to be identified credit authorship contribution statement zi chen

1238,identifying a contaminant time varying release history is an ill posed problem but crucial for groundwater contamination issues a precise inversed release history offers a promising estimation of contaminant movement and is of great importance for environmental monitoring and further management in this paper a recent emerging data assimilation method the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda is employed to handle this conundrum the study starts with some synthetic cases in which several factors are analyzed such as the observation data frequency covariance inflation schemes iteration numbers used in the es mda for the purpose of identifying a time varying contaminant injection event with different precision the results show that the es mda performs well in recovering the release history when the injection is discretized into 50 or 100 time steps but encounters fluctuation problems in the cases with 300 time steps further comparison reveals that the observation data frequency is a very influential factor while the number of iterations or the kind of covariance inflation used has a lesser effect nevertheless this is a first test in a non synthetic environment in which the es mda has proven its ability to recover the release history in two close to reality sandbox experiments the outcome shows that the es mda with rafiee s inflation scheme has the ability to capture the main pattern of the release history but in order to move one more step to field cases a more detailed description of uncertainties or elaborated parameterization of the time functions is paramount keywords inverse modeling source identification inflation factor data assimilation sandbox data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination has gained extensive attention over the last several decades e g feyen et al 2003b feyen et al 2003a gómez hernández et al 2003 li et al 2011 dai et al 2020 since it is becoming a huge threat to our ecosystem determining the responsible for the pollution is a forensic hydrogeology task needed to ensure the accountability of those responsible this is not an easy task since in general only a few observations downstream from the source are available when the contamination is first detected even with the help of advanced groundwater models and with assumptions such as knowing the release location identifying the release history and therefore the total amount of pollutants injected into the aquifer has proven to be a complicated endeavour a challenge that faces the problem of ill posedness skaggs and kabala 1994 carrera and neuman 1986 woodbury et al 1998 common to all inverse problems franssen and gómez hernández 2002 capilla et al 1998 wen et al 1999 ayvaz 2010 various methods have been devised to address this problem and several reviews have been published in the subject e g atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001 michalak and kitanidis 2004 bagtzoglou and atmadja 2005 sun et al 2006a gómez hernández and xu 2021 among all these methods simulation optimization methods have been used from a very early age gorelick et al 1983 and they aim to minimize the inconsistency between simulated and observed based on an objective function sun et al 2006b mirghani et al 2009 ayvaz 2010 but still need to reformulate the problem from the beginning if new measurements are acquired zhou et al 2014 therefore one branch data assimilation methods comes out ahead because of their ability to deal with huge amounts of observed data simultaneously data assimilation methods are versatile efficient and simple to understand and implement zhou et al 2014 among the data assimilation methods the ensemble kalman filter enkf stands out it was first proposed by evensen 2003 in order to deal with the nonlinear relationship between parameters and state variables in inverse problems and has gained popularity in multidisciplinary fields such as oceanography meteorology and geology e g houtekamer and mitchell 2001 bertino et al 2003 chen and zhang 2006 aanonsen et al 2009 specifically in hydrogeology the enkf method has proven the ability to inverse identify aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity chen and zhang 2006 huang et al 2009 kurtz et al 2014 porosity li et al 2012 recharge rates franssen and kinzelbach 2009 boundary conditions chen and zhang 2006 and also transport related parameters lan et al 2018 more recently researchers have started to employ enkf variants to identify the parameters describing a contaminant source in aquifers zhou et al 2011 butera et al 2013 employ a geostatistical approach with some weak hypotheses to identify the pollutant release history and the source location xu and gómez hernández 2016 use the restart normal score ensemble kalman filter ns enkf for contaminant source identification in a synthetic deterministic aquifer and later extended this method to jointly identify hydraulic conductivity and source information xu and gómez hernández 2018 then chen et al 2018 move one step further to identify contaminant source information plus the position and length of a vertical barrier in a sandbox experiment via the restart ensemble kalman filter chen et al 2021 also discuss the influence of different inflation methods in the application of the restart ns enkf and prove its ability for the joint identification of hydraulic conductivities and contaminant source information in a laboratory sandbox experiment li et al 2019 used kalman filtering combined with a mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model to deduce the accurate location and release history of a contaminant source the aforementioned works are a strong demonstration that the enkf and its variants are valid methods for contaminant source identification however except for the work by butera et al 2013 the release history identified in these works only focuses on a constant pulse the magnitude of which is independent of time as an alternative to the enkf the ensemble smoother es which was first introduced by van leeuwen and evensen 1996 assimilates all available data in one single step instead of updating the state variable sequentially thus it is expected that it should be able to identify time varying parameters better than the enkf and at a cheaper price the enkf and the es produce the same results when they deal with linear state transfer functions since they are based on the same covariance based formulation evensen 2004 however in studying process with strong nonlinearities such as in the case of inverting the groundwater flow and mass transport equations the enkf outperformed the es evensen and van leeuwen 2000 until an iterative variant of the es was proposed the es with multiple data assimilation es mda by emerick and reynolds 2013 evensen 2018 compared the es mda with other iterative ensemble smoothers to solve history matching problems ranazzi and sampaio 2019 investigated the influence of the ensemble size on the use of an adaptive es mda for history matching todaro et al 2019 use the es mda to find a solution to the reverse flow routing problem bao et al 2020 coupled generative adversarial networks and es mda methods then use them to reconstruct the channel structures and reduce the uncertainty of hydraulic head and contaminant concentration predictions xu et al 2021 employed the es mda to identify contaminant source parameters and heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity jointly with the comparison with restart enkf todaro et al 2021 employed es mda for the simultaneous identification of the source location and the release history of a groundwater contamination event these works are all good examples of es mda dealing with time varying input parameters however most of the aforementioned work approximated the time varying parameters by a multiple step function without analyzing the impact that the step size had in the results the objective of this paper is to assess the capacity of the es mda for identifying complex time varying release history and to check the possible obstacles to apply the es mda in closer to reality cases in this work the es mda is employed to identify a time varying release history in both synthetic and real cases the capacity of es mda in identifying a release history function as a function of the discretization used to approximate it is analyzed first then a synthetic case is studied where the influence of observation data frequency and number of es mda iterations are discussed the synthetic also served to analyze two covariance inflation procedures e g le et al 2016 rafiee and reynolds 2017 to prevent smoother collapsing next the es mda is applied to the identification of release history functions in two sandbox experiments it is the first time to testify the capacity of es dmda in identifying time varying release history with a sandbox experiment the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the methodology in section 3 the synthetic and the real sandbox experiment are presented followed by the setup of different scenarios and evaluation criteria finally in section 4 we discuss the results and draw some conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 groundwater flow and solute transport equations in this work the contaminant is injected with a given flow rate into a transient groundwater flow system thus the governing equations includes both the transient groundwater flow equation bear 1972 and the solute transport equation zheng and wang 1999 1 s s h t k h w 2 θ c t θ d c θ vc q s c

for handling nonlinear models it is an iterative version of the es where the number of iterations is predefined the method is easy to understand and to implement and has been referred many times in the literature emerick and reynolds 2013 evensen 2018 xu et al 2021 a brief recall of the three steps that conform the method are described next 1 initialization step an ensemble of n e realizations of the n parameters to identify is generated in this case the parameters are the mass loadings in time representing the discretized injection curve their initial values are drawn from predefined uniform distributions each ensemble member is a different release history function at this stage we also need to set the number of iterations n a also referred to as assimilation steps and the inflation factors α j the meaning of which are described later 2 assimilation once the number of iterations and the inflation coefficients are determined it is time for the assimilation procedure which consists of two steps a forecast step and an update step these two steps are repeated for each iteration a forecast step in this step the groundwater flow and contaminant transport models modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3ds e g zheng 2010 ma et al 2012 are run for each member of the ensemble in our case for each different release history 3 c i j f ψ c 0 a i j where ψ represents the forward numerical model c 0 stands for the initial concentrations in the domain c i j f are the predicted concentrations in space and time at assimilation iteration j for the last estimate of the release function i of the ensemble a i j the size of a depends on the number of time steps used to discretize it b update step then the model parameters are updated as follows 4 a i j 1 a i j δ a j δ c j f t δ c j f δ c j f t α j r 1 y obs α j ε c o i j f where y obs is a column vector with dimensions n o n t containing all observed concentrations at all locations and all time steps n o is the number of locations and n t the number of observation steps ε stands for the observation error while r is the covariance matrix of the observation error c o i j f is the vector of forecasted concentrations for the ensemble parameter set a i j at the same locations and times where and when observations y obs are made δ a j and δ c j are matrices defined as 5 δ a j 1 n e 1 a 1 j a j a 2 j a j a n e j a j 6 δ c j f 1 n e 1 c 1 j f c f j c 2 j f c f j c n e j f c f j where a j and c f j are the ensemble means of source release history parameters and forecasted concentrations at the j th iteration respectively the products δ c j f δ c j f t and δ a j δ c j f t are the concentration covariance and the concentration release function parameters cross covariance respectively these forecast and update steps will be repeated until the predefined iterations are completed one more thing needs to be pointed out in our study since the number of measurements is larger than the ensemble size it is necessary to employ the truncated singular value decomposition tsvd method to compute a pseudo inverse in eq 4 2 3 the inflation factors α j the iteration number n a and the inflation factor α j are two influential parameters in the performance of the es mda which are related to one another emerick and reynolds 2013 have proven that the es mda could sample the posterior probability distribution function of the parameters precisely only in a linear model and only if the inflation factors α j satisfy the following equation 7 j 1 n a 1 α j 1 there are still many options on how to choose the α j parameters satisfying the previous equation apparently choosing a decreasing series may be the most appropriate but some authors claim that using uniform values gives similar results and that choosing these values arbitrarily may lead to filter collapse le et al 2016 we have decided to explore two methods to select the inflation factors one proposed by rafiee and reynolds 2017 and the other one proposed by evensen 2018 rafiee and reynolds 2017 propose that the inflation factor for the first iteration is computed as 8 α 1 1 n i 1 n λ i 2 where n is the minimum of n e and n o n t and λ i are the singular values of matrix d j given by 9 d j r 1 2 c j f the subsequent inflation factors are chosen in a geometrical decreasing progression 10 α j β j 1 α 1 where β is the ratio that fulfills that the sum of the inverse of the inflation factors equals one eq 4 11 1 1 β n a 1 1 1 β α 1 evensen 2018 define the inflation factors on the basis of two numbers a nonzero value α 1 and a geometrical ratio α geo with these two numbers a sequence is built according to the following procedure 12 α j 1 α j α geo which is then normalized to provide the α j values that satisfy eq 4 13 α j α j j 1 n a 1 α j this scheme has the capacity of defining the inflation factors as uniform in an increasing sequence or in a decreasing one by choosing an α geo equal below or above one respectively here we define α geo and α 1 with the values of 2 and 1 respectively in this work these two different schemes of generating the inflation factors are employed and their impact is discussed all in all the overall description and detailed procedures of the proposed data assimilation framework are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 3 applications a numerical model based on real sandbox experiments is used to demonstrate the proposed method this sandbox equipment was built up by the engineering and architecture department at the university of parma and has been employed in several groundwater contamination studies citarella et al 2015 cupola et al 2015 zanini and woodbury 2016 in this work first we generated synthetic data using this numerical model to test the es mda method for the identification of a time varying release history curve in the synthetic case we also analyze the impact of the choice of the method to choose the inflation factors the number of iterations the size of the observation time intervals and the degree of discretization with which the release curve is represented in the numerical model then we tested the es mda with real observation data and analyzed the impact of the observation error magnitude 3 1 sandbox set up the sandbox has an internal volume of 95 cm by 10 cm by 70 cm and is discretized into 95 columns 1 row and 70 layers glass beads with two different diameters 1 mm and 4 mm are used to fill the sandbox as shown in fig 2 the spatial distribution of the bead is heterogeneous and so is the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the sandbox the hydraulic conductivity and the porosity or each bead size were obtained previously by cupola et al 2015 the reservoirs upstream and downstream are set up as constant piezometric boundaries with a water level of 62 5 cm and 60 6 cm respectively the bottom of the sandbox is regarded as a no flow boundary while the top of the sandbox is a phreatic surface the fluorescein was chosen as the tracer and was released by an injector installed inside the glass beads during the experiment fluorescein is a non toxic compound that can be easily handled after the experiments in the meanwhile it also has the characteristics of strong resistance to sorption and can be regarded as a conservative tracer smart and laidlaw 1977 contaminant concentrations are observed in 25 observation points the details about the acquisition of the concentration data could be found in citarella et al 2015 and cupola et al 2015 the total experiment time is 3000s and the injection starts at time zero the main hydraulic parameters used for the simulation are listed in table 2 3 2 performance assessment the use of an ensemble based method allows to analyze the performance of the method using the root mean square error rmse and the relative rmse 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n a i ref a i 2 15 relative rmse rmse intial rmse where n is the number of points used to discretize the release history curve a i ref is the i th point of the reference release history while a i stands for the ensemble mean of the i th point of the updated release history initial rmse refers to the rmse of the initial ensemble of realizations based on the definition of rmse the smaller the value the better the relative rmse is able to show the reduction of the uncertainty both parameters serve to evaluate quantitatively the outcome of es mda 3 3 synthetic case the first set of analyses is based on the synthetic simulation of a time varying release into the sandbox digital twin the release function adopted is based on a proposal by skaggs and kabala 1994 16 s t 2 6 exp t 10 20 2 50 0 78 exp t 10 50 2 200 1 3 exp t 10 90 2 98 0 t 3000 this function is shown in fig 3 we run three sets of scenarios with different time discretizations while identifying the release history more precisely we chose to identify a release function over the 3000 s experiment duration using 50 100 and 300 time steps for each discretization two sampling frequencies were considered samples were taken every other time step or every ten time steps also the number of assimilation iterations was varied between 4 and 8 based on a comprehensive consideration of computational time cost and outcome accuracy xu et al 2021 and both the rafiee and evensen inflation schemes were tested in total 24 scenarios were analyzed as reported in table 3 and in all scenarios the model error is neglected while we assume the observation errors follow gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0 1 mg l an ensemble of 500 realizations was used the initial release history curve of every realization is generated using a uniform distribution with ranges 0 52 10 3 mg s fig 4 shows the recovered release history for the set of scenarios with the coarsest discretization of the release function 50 time steps in each plot the blue curve corresponds to the actual release history the gray lines are the recovered release history curves for all 500 realizations the red dotted line is the median of the ensemble and the black dashed lines mark the 5 and 95 percentiles the first column uses rafiee s inflation and the second column evensen s inflation the first two rows use samples every ten time steps 5 snapshots and the last two rows samples every other time step 25 snapshots the first and third rows use four iterations and the second and fourth rows use eight iterations it can be observed that the median of the recovered release history curves is a good estimate of the actual release history for all cases while the uncertainty estimate given by the spread of the curves is larger for the scenarios with the smallest sampling frequency scenarios s1 to s4 also it can be noticed that rafiee s inflation method always yields a smaller spread than evensen s one it is hard to argue about an improvement with the largest number of iterations since the results with four and eight iterations are almost the same fig 5 shows the recovered release history of the set of scenarios with intermediate discretization of the release function 100 time steps the organization of the plots in the figure are the same as in the previous one the impact of the inflation scheme the observation data frequency and the number of iterations is more or less the same as for the 50 time step case however the median of the recovered release history curves cannot capture the actual release history as precisely as in the previous set of realizations more notably in the set of scenarios with samples every 10 time steps scenarios s9 to s12 for all scenarios there is clearly an excess of fluctuations in the recovered release curves noticeable in the individual curves and also in the ensemble median and percentile curves this fluctuation is more noticeable when the observation sampling frequency is smaller scenarios s9 to s12 the fluctuations must be due to the inherent ill posedness of the problem since we are trying to estimate a large number of parameters that initially are assumed to be independent this problem could be alleviated by introducing some smoothing factor that forces that all updated curves after updating display a certain smoothness it is also important to notice the poor estimation of the release curve at the end of the experiment with a clear non zero estimation for the final steps this overestimation which is less patent in the previous set of scenarios must be due to the little or no sensitivity that observations have to release at the end of the simulation the deterioration in the estimation of the release curves becomes exacerbated when the number of discretization steps is increased up to 300 fig 6 shows the results for scenarios s17 to s24 and their arrangement follows the same pattern as the previous two figures the original release curves are only hinted at by the final ensemble of realizations or their median values the main three peaks are well identified but several other peaks appear the spread of the realizations is very wide and the fluctuations in time are also quite noticeable as in the previous set of scenarios using a different parameterization of the release curve enforcing some kind of regularization might have helped in removing these artifacts the only positive conclusion from this set of realizations is that as in the previous two sets the best results are always obtained when using rafiee s inflation scheme eight iterations and the highest sampling frequency for a more quantitative evaluation of the performance of the es mda to recover the time varying release history table 4 and fig 7 illustrates the rmse and the relative rmse of all 24 scenarios based on the rmse at the last iteration step we can conclude that the es mda with rafiee s scheme has a better performance in most scenarios for our case especially when the observation data frequency is low it is striking to see how the rmse jumps to up to four times the rmse of the initial ensemble on the first iteration for the fine discretization scenarios last row of fig 7 a distinct mark of ill posedness in the formulation of the problem this phenomenon can be attributed to insufficient observation data but also to correlation of observations error in time evensen and eikrem 2018 one possible solution could be enlarging the ensemble size or subsampling the independent observation data one more thing that needs to be taken into consideration is the computational time cost of the scenarios in our proposed data assimilation framework the main time consuming comes from the forecast procedure a single simulation of groundwater flow and solute transport model in a typical laptop needs 27s 31s and 54s for the 50 100 and 300 time steps model respectively and the total time consumption for these three models with an iteration number of 4 is approximately 54044s 62288s and 108288s once the iteration number becomes 8 the time cost will also be doubled based on these analysis and for the sake of outcome accuracy we decide to apply the es mda to the sandbox experiments using rafiee s inflation scheme discretizing the release history into 50 or 100 time steps and with 8 assimilation iterations 3 4 laboratory case we performed two sandbox experiments with two release history curves the first curve displays a train of four pulses lasting the entire duration of the experiment and the second curve consists of two pulses at the beginning of the experiment fig 8 in this experiment we will not attempt to identify simultaneously the release and the conductivities but rather we will use the identified distribution of conductivities and observation errors from a previous work chen et al 2021 shown in fig 9 the observation errors follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of 1 mg l several scenarios will be analyzed that are described in tables 5 and 6 fig 10 shows the recovered release history curves for the first sandbox experiment the train of pulses the observed performance is quite similar to the one observed for the synthetic experiments the scenario with the smaller number of discretization steps and the highest frequency for that discretization is the one performing best the same phenomenon of excess of fluctuation as that in the synthetic cases is observed at the four peaks of the release curve this phenomenon is more obvious with larger discretization scenarios r3 r4 indicating a growth of the ill posedness of the problem one promising way to reduce this fluctuation could be to increase the observation frequency as the comparison between scenarios r1 r2 and r3 r4 shows but we must argue that this fluctuation is inevitable in real cases because of the adverse impact of observation error fig 11 shows the recovered release curves for the second experiment the two pulses the same behavior as before is appreciated here large fluctuations about the two main peaks of the injection with the best estimation by the median of the scenario with the smallest number of discretization steps and the largest frequency of observation yet there is a major failure in this test case that the method is not able to capture the fact that the injection stops slightly before the middle of the experiment at about 1200 s except for r6 in all scenarios most injection curves for the individual members of the ensemble display positive values for the second half of the experiment and their median is still a relatively large positive value clearly overestimating the total mass injected into the system since the es mda method has the ability to identify similar releasing histories in the synthetic cases we believe the main explanation for this overall behavior is the magnitude of the observation error in the meanwhile like the performance in fig 5 the overestimation of release towards the end of the experiment is also quite noticeable due to the same reason we stated before this phenomenon once again proves the observations at the end of the simulation is insensitive to the final steps of the release table 7 and fig 12 show the evolution of the rmse and relative rmse for the two sandbox scenarios the results prove that the es mda with rafiee s inflation scheme is an effective method in recovering releasing history in both sandbox experiments the rmse for all 8 scenarios is reduced after assimilating the observation data a comparison among the different sandbox scenarios also shows that a high observation data frequency has a lesser impact on the outcome than in the synthetic cases this phenomenon is particularly obvious for scenarios r3 r4 and r7 r8 which are the cases with 100 time steps we believe it is mainly caused by the uncertainty of the observation data for a further evaluation of the results we use the updated release history to generate contaminant plume evolution to visually analyze the capacity of the es dma with rafiee s inflation scheme to reproduce the real plumes figs 13 and 14 show the ensemble means of the contaminant plumes at time steps 600 s 1200 s 1800 s and 2400 s for scenarios r2 r4 r6 and r8 we can observe that the simulated plume always spreads more than the reference a consequence of the overestimation of the non injection period however compared with the reference contaminant plume in the left column the simulated plumes from the updated release history for the 4 scenarios are all acceptable reproductions of the reference 4 discussions the es mda has proven to be an efficient method for the identification of contaminant source parameters e g the source location and release concentration in a synthetic aquifer xu et al 2021 here we employ it to identify complex contaminate release histories in both synthetic and real laboratory cases in the synthetic cases we have analyzed the following impact factors on the identification different inflation schemes the number of iterations the size of the observation time intervals and the degree of discretization our results show that the es mda with rafiee s inflation scheme performs well and that more accurate identification can be achieved with more iteration steps at a higher computational cost the recovered release curve may suffer from an excess of fluctuations especially with larger discretization time steps and one possible way to handle this problem is to increase the frequency of the observation data in real laboratory cases the challenge mainly comes from observation errors especially when the observed luminosity is transformed into concentration data the magnitude of the observation error seems to undermine the identification by the es mda and larger fluctuation problems appear especially in the second experiment however in terms of reproducing the reference plumes by the recovered release history we prove the es mda is a promising method in the identification of contaminant release history in this work we successfully prove the ability of the proposed data assimilation framework to reconstruct the release history in a simple sandbox experiment we are getting closer to a real field application although we are still far from it in the lab experiment there were many parameters that were known which will be uncertain in practice our next steps will be to complexify the identification problem including the uncertainties on those parameters that are not fully known in practice in addition we should remark that although the es mda method is more efficient than alternative bayesian based inversion methods it is still a challenge to address high dimensional problems 5 summary and conclusions in this paper we employ the es mda to identify a time varying release history with different precision in both synthetic and laboratory cases in the synthetic cases we examined the capacity of the es mda to identify the release function for i different levels of time discretizations with a ratio of 1 to 6 between the coarsest and finest discretizations ii the impact of the observation data frequency every other time step versus one step every ten time steps iii the choice of the inflation factors between rafiee s and evensen s proposals and iv the impact of the number of iterations in the es mda formulation between four and eight in total 24 scenarios with combinations of the aforementioned features were generated and compared the results show that the es mda with rafiee s scheme has a better performance in most scenarios in our case also in all scenarios increasing the observation data frequency always improves the identification of the recovered release history curve the number of iterations whether four or eight does not have an important effect on the performance of the es mda in general the es mda performs well in recovering the release history when the discretization is equal to 50 or 100 time steps but displays large fluctuations in the scenarios with 300 time steps we believe this problem could be alleviated by choosing a different parameterization of the release curve rather than using uncorrelated uniform random numbers to generate the initial ensemble of realizations this is a first test in a real environment in which the es mda using rafiee s inflation scheme and eight iterations has been tested in two closer to reality sandbox experiments with two release history curves a train of four pulses and two pulses during the first half of the experiment the results show that the es mda works well for the train of pulses but overestimates the injection concentrations for the second experiment after the two pulses have ended we believe that this poor behavior could be explained again by the parameterization of the injection curves and the magnitude of the concentration observation errors in conclusion the es mda is a method capable to identify a time varying release history in both synthetic and real cases better results than the ones presented here could have been obtained with a more elaborated parameterization of the time functions to be identified credit authorship contribution statement zi chen

1239,the mobility of contaminants in soil is controlled by sorption reactions which can be affected by the presence of other solutes that compete for sorption sites the ability to model such effects is necessary for evaluating the environmental risk of a given contaminant in this study the competitive sorption and transport of nickel ni and zinc zn in olivier and windsor soils was investigated using batch equilibration and miscible displacement experiments during batch experiments the sorption of ni and zn was mutually reduced in multicomponent systems indicating that the metal cations compete for sorption sites when applied concurrently the retardation of both ions decreased and peak effluent concentrations increased relative to single ion experiments demonstrating that competition increased the mobility of both ions during miscible displacement experiments a novel freundlich type multicomponent isotherm cdi and its kinetic analog cdit were developed and compared to the commonly used srs isotherm and srs based kinetic approach srst in describing the experimental data the cdi provided a superior description of the competitive batch data especially at low surface coverage and may therefore be more applicable to multicomponent sorption than the srs the olivier and windsor transport data were best described by the cdit and srst respectively however both models generally described the data well since both approaches gave comparable descriptions of the transport data while the cdi outperformed the srs in describing the batch data the cdi cdit may be more generally applicable to multicomponent systems and warrants further study keywords competitive sorption competitive transport heavy metals multicomponent isotherms multicomponent kinetic models abbreviations btcs breakthrough curves cde convection dispersion equation cdi competitive distribution coefficient isotherm cdit competitive distribution coefficient transport model srst srs kinetic transport model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction understanding of the mobility of contaminants in soil is necessary for determining their environmental risk the composition of the soil solution namely the presence of multiple species that compete for sorption sites can greatly affect the behavior of a contaminant in the subsurface this is an important consideration as heavy metal contamination of soils often involves multiple species dermont et al 2010 liao et al 2016 which can increase contaminant mobility for example the simultaneous presence of ni and zn was shown to decrease the sorption of both cations by soil although ni was more affected than zn antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 competition for sites has also been demonstrated to reduce ni and zn sorption by fe mn and al oxides trivedi et al 2001 guo et al 2018 choi et al 2020 which have been shown to be dominant materials that control metal behavior in soils bradl 2004 covelo et al 2007a increased mobility due to competition has been well demonstrated for a wide range of transition and post transition metals as reviewed by selim 2013b and violante 2013 moreover designer sorbents such as modified biochars are commonly used to remove multiple chemicals from contaminated soils and water lu et al 2022 liu et al 2022 and as such it is important to consider competitive interactions in engineered systems the ability to model the transport of heavy metals in soil is essential for predicting their fate in the environment tsang and lo 2006 demonstrated that a transport model considering sorption kinetics outperformed an approach assuming linear equilibrium sorption in describing competitive cd and cu transport in soil similarly chotpantarat et al 2012 compared a linear equilibrium model to nonlinear langmuir type equilibrium and kinetic models to describe the competitive transport of pb and several other metal cations in binary systems through a lateritic soil elbana et al 2014 used a two site equilibrium kinetic langmuir type model to describe the competitive transport of sn and pb through two soils however in all cases these studies employed models that do not account for competitive interactions between metal ions resulting in separate sets of parameters for each experiment greatly reducing their utility conversely others have attempted to incorporate terms into the convection dispersion equation cde to account for competition hinz and selim 1994 described the competitive transport of zn and cd by assuming that the sorption of both occurs exclusively via cation exchange and incorporated exchange isotherms into the cde selim et al 1992 incorporated ion exchange to account for competition between cd and ca as well as a specific langmuir type kinetic site to describe cd transport in soils a similar approach was presented by voegelin et al 2001 with the addition of ph dependent exchange coefficients and cation exchange capacities and successfully described the transport of a variety of metal cations more recently serrano et al 2013 employed a non electrostatic surface complexation model where competitive sorption on fe oxide and phyllosilicate sites was assumed and provided reasonable descriptions of pb and cd transport however kretzschmar and voegelin 2001 argued that applying surface complexation models to soils is rarely appropriate due to their inherent heterogeneity and that such approaches should be considered as empirical in such cases the extension of simpler empirical approaches with as few parameters as possible is preferable kretzschmar and voegelin 2001 in this regard zhang and selim 2007 extended the competitive srs isotherm sheindorf et al 1981 into a kinetic formulation and successfully described competitive transport of phosphate and as in soils the same model was used to describe the competitive transport of mo and phosphate sun and selim 2017 further demonstrating its utility besides the approach of zhang and selim 2007 multicomponent kinetic transport models are lacking the goals of this study were to 1 investigate the competitive sorption and transport of ni and zn in two contrasting soils as well as to 2 compare the descriptive capability of a novel freundlich type multicomponent model to the proven approach of sheindorf et al 1981 and zhang and selim 2007 2 modeling 2 1 sheindorf rebhun sheintuch isotherm and kinetic model the freundlich isotherm can be derived based on the assumptions of an exponential distribution of binding site energies and that langmuir type adsorption occurs at each energy level sips 1948 sheindorf et al 1981 furthermore if competing solutes exhibit freundlich type sorption individually then their sorption in a multicomponent system at each energy level can be described according to the competitive langmuir isotherm sheindorf et al 1981 based on this sheindorf et al 1981 derived a competitive freundlich type isotherm commonly referred to as the srs isotherm for a two component system comprised of cation i and j the sorption of both species can be described according to the system of eqs 1 and 2 1 s i k i c i c i α i c j n i 1 2 s j k j c j c j α j c i n j 1 where s is the sorbed concentration mmol kg 1 c is the solution concentration mmol l 1 k is a distribution coefficient l kg 1 n is a dimensionless nonlinearity parameter and the subscripts i and j refer to cation i and j respectively the parameters α i and α j are dimensionless competitive coefficients describing the effect of cation j on the sorption of cation i and vice versa respectively zhang and selim 2007 incorporated the srs into a kinetic formulation giving eqs 3 and 4 that describe the change in sorbed concentration with respect to time for cations i and j respectively 3 ρ s i t θ k 1 c i c i α i c j n i 1 ρk 2 s i 4 ρ s j t θ k 3 c j c j α j c i n j 1 ρk 4 s j where ρ is the bulk density g cm 3 θ is the volumetric water content and k 1 k 4 are rate coefficients hr 1 2 2 competitive distribution coefficient isotherm and kinetic model the change in the sorbed concentration of metal cation i with respect to time can be expressed according to selim 2014 5 ρ s i t θ k 1 c i n i ρk 2 s i the sorption rate of a given ion has been shown to decrease in the presence of a competing ion qin et al 2006 zhang and selim 2007 this can be accounted for in eq 5 by either decreasing or increasing the forward or backward rate coefficient respectively with the former the resulting expression would result in longer equilibration times while the latter would result in shorter equilibration times others demonstrated that competition between sorbates tends to reduce equilibration times zhao et al 2001 tinnacher et al 2013 padilla et al 2022 consistent with expectations of increasing the backward rate coefficient in multicomponent systems as such it was assumed that the overall backward rate coefficient for cation i is proportional to the sorbed concentration of cation j furthermore if freundlich type sorption for cation j is assumed sorbed j is proportional to its solution concentration raised to a fractional power applying the same approach to cation j the change in sorbed concentrations of both cations with respect to time can be given as the system of eqs 6 and 7 6 ρ s i t θ k 1 c i n i ρ k 2 k 5 c j n j s i 7 ρ s j t θ k 3 c j n j ρ k 4 k 6 c i n i s j where k 1 k 4 are rate coefficients hr 1 and k 5 and k 6 are empirical constants l hr 1 mmol 1 that scale the effect of cation j on cation i sorption and vice versa at equilibrium the differential terms are equal to zero rearranging competitive sorption isotherms for both species are obtained referred to here as the competitive distribution coefficient isotherm cdi 8 s i 1 a i b i c j n j c i n i 9 s j 1 a j b j c i n i c j n j where a and b parameters are defined as 10 a i ρ k 2 θ k 1 b i ρ k 5 θ k 1 11 a j ρ k 4 θ k 3 b j ρ k 6 θ k 3 it is important to note that eqs 8 and 9 are empirical and do not imply specific surface mechanisms and therefore should be assessed on their ability to describe measured data sposito 1989 2 3 sensitivity analysis to compare the srs and cdi isotherms a sensitivity analysis was conducted with results displayed in supplemental figs s1 and s2 specifically focus was given to the effect of α and b on modeled isotherms given by the srs and cdi respectively values of k and a were taken as unity and the nonlinearity parameters were varied to simulate highly nonlinear to approximately linear sorption of either cation initial concentrations of cation i and j were 1 0 and 0 5 mm respectively final concentrations of either cation were iteratively solved for using newton raphson for srs the value of αj was taken as 1 αi sheindorf et al 1981 while values of b j were taken as zero for the cdi both isotherms appear reasonably flexible to describe a wide range of competitive sorption scenarios the value of n j appears to have little effect on srs modeled s i whereas values of n j closer to unity result in higher concentrations of s i for the cdi however this is a result of final concentrations of c j 1 for c j 1 the opposite would be expected to determine the effect of the competitive coefficient of cation j on the sorption of i values of αj or b j were varied with resulting isotherms for cation i shown in supplemental fig s3 as expected increasing values of αj resulted in higher sorbed concentrations of cation i due to the αi 1 αj relationship for cdi the effect of b j was low when a j 1 or b i 0 5 as such results in supplemental fig s3 were obtained with a j set to 0 1 and b i set to 1 increasing values of b j resulted in reductions of s i due to increased c j leading to greater values of the denominator in eq 8 a major distinction between the isotherms is that the srs estimates reduced sorption at low surface coverage even when the effect of competition is low α i 0 1 whereas the cdi does so to a much lesser extent to illustrate this further estimated values of the partitioning coefficient kd s c for each isotherm are shown in supplemental fig s4 others have shown that competition between species is lower at low surface coverage due to an abundance of sites and or high energy associations between the surface and sorbed species serrano et al 2005 flogeac et al 2007 violante 2013 the cdi consistently estimates higher kd values at low solution concentration than the srs and may therefore have an advantage in describing low sorbed concentrations in multicomponent systems 2 4 transport the one dimensional simultaneous transport of two metal cations can be described by a system of convection dispersion equations given by eqs 12 and 13 12 θ c i t ρ s i t θd 2 c i x 2 q c i x 13 θ c j t ρ s j t θd 2 c j x 2 q c j x where d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient cm2 hr 1 and q is the darcy flux in the x direction cm hr 1 eqs 12 and 13 are subject to the initial and boundary conditions given by zhang and selim 2007 the incorporation of eqs 3 and 4 on the left hand side of eqs 12 and 13 respectively yields the srs kinetic transport model srst while that of eqs 6 and 7 gives the competitive distribution coefficient transport model cdit eqs 12 and 13 were solved simultaneously using crank nicolson and eqs 3 and 4 or eqs 6 and 7 were solved for each depth and time using 4th order runge kutta 3 methods 3 1 soils two soils were used for all experiments surface horizon 0 10 cm olivier silt loam fine silty mixed active thermic aquic fraglossudalf and windsor sandy loam mixed

shi et al 2013 ferreira et al 2015 soil solution mixtures were then vortexed transferred to a platform shaker and shaken at 21 1 c following 24 h of reaction time mixtures were centrifuged at 11 000g for 10 min and a 3 ml aliquot of supernatant was analyzed via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometry icp oes for solution concentrations of ni and zn prior to analyses all samples were acidified using hcl to determine the effect of competition on the sorption of either metal cation batch experiments were repeated with the inclusion of either 0 50 or 1 00 mm ni or zn in the background solution for srs values of k ni and n or k zn and m were obtained by fitting freundlich isotherms to single ion sorption data using the proc nln procedure in sas 9 4 values of αni and αzn were obtained by using excel solver to fit eqs 1 and 2 to all soil specific sorption data simultaneously while holding k ni k zn n and m constant according to the iterative approach of barrow et

was applied to columns followed by the application of background solution for consecutive pulse experiments a 25 pv pulse of 1 0 mm ni was applied to the column followed by 25 pv of 1 0 mm zn after which background solution was applied to the column experiments were then repeated in reverse 25 pv of zn followed by 25 pv of ni effluent concentrations of ni and zn were determined via icp oes as

values of k 1 k 4 constant model descriptions by the srst were obtained using the publicly available chem transport software package http www spess lsu edu chem transport while the simulation and fitting modules of the cdit were written in fortran 95 both the srst and cdit models utilize the levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares procedure to acquire estimates of parameter values goodness of fit was evaluated using r2 and the sum of the squared errors 4 results and discussion 4 1 sorption isotherms for the sorption of ni and zn by olivier and windsor soils are displayed in fig 1 olivier had a higher affinity than windsor for both metal cations with consistently higher sorbed concentrations across the range of solution concentrations the sorption of both ni and zn has been positively correlated with cec and organic matter content shaheen et al 2013 covelo et al 2007b both of which are greater for olivier and likely account for its higher affinity both soils had a greater affinity for zn than for ni consistent with results reported previously for a variety of soils elbana et al 2018 differences in the affinities of cations for soil have been explained according to the hard soft acid principle namely that softer acids tend to preferentially form covalent bonds with surface functional groups and are thus of higher affinity shaheen et al 2012 however the misono softness parameter for ni is greater than that of zn 2 82 vs 2 34 misono et al 1967 and is inconsistent with the current results others have related the relative affinities of cations to their first hydrolysis constant antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 usman 2008 du et al 2011 which can be taken as a measure of the tendency of a cation to form a complex with surface coordinated hydroxyls the hydrolysis constant of zn is greater than that of ni pkh of 9 0 vs 9 9 respectively and is consistent with the sorption results in general the presence of zn reduced the sorption of ni and vice versa in both soils this was expected as reduced sorption of both ni and zn while simultaneously present has been demonstrated previously trivedi et al 2001 antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 choi et al 2020 padilla and selim 2021 to determine the effect of input concentrations of both cations on subsequent sorbed concentrations a tukey pairwise comparison was conducted for each input concentration of ni and zn at the α 0 05 level with results displayed in fig 2 the sorption of ni by olivier was continually decreased for each input concentration of zn when ni was added at 0 10 0 25 and 5 00 mm although only 1 0 mm zn reduced ni sorption when ni was added at 1 0 and 0 5 mm the presence of 0 5 mm ni had no effect on zn sorption relative to single cation experiments for all input zn concentrations however ni added at 1 0 mm did significantly decrease zn sorption in all cases this indicates that ni sorption by olivier was more affected than that of zn in the two component system moreover the sorbed concentration of ni decreased relative to non competitive experiments by an average of 11 and 19 in the presence of 0 50 and 1 00 mm zn respectively while zn sorption decreased only by an average of 4 and 13 in the presence of 0 50 and 1 00 mm ni respectively emphasizing the dominance of zn sorption over ni such dominance was demonstrated previously for zn and ni sorption by soil antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 and fe and mn oxides trivedi et al 2001 choi et al 2020 competition between metal cations has been shown to be minimal at low surface coverage serrano et al 2005 flogeac et al 2007 violante 2013 this appears true for zn where only ni added at 1 0 mm decreased zn sorption when added at its lowest input concentration 0 10 mm however the sorption of ni when added at 0 10 mm was significantly decreased in the presence of both levels of zn indicating that the relationship between competition and surface coverage is ion specific for windsor each increase in initial ni concentration resulted in significant decreases of zn sorption across the range of zn input concentrations this contrasts with what was observed for olivier and was likely due to the lower affinity of windsor fewer total available sites resulted in greater competition initial zn concentrations of 1 00 mm significantly decreased ni sorption in all cases whereas 0 50 mm zn decreased ni sorption in limited cases furthermore the average decrease in ni sorption relative to non competitive experiments was 17 and 24 in the presence of 0 50 and 1 00 mm zn respectively while zn sorption decreased an average of 24 and 34 in the presence of 0 50 and 1 00 mm ni respectively this indicates a dominance of ni sorption over that of zn and contrasts with the trend observed in olivier as well as with previous results trivedi et al 2001 antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 choi et al 2020 as such the preference of a sorbent for a metal cation over another should be considered specific to the sorbent rather than the cation pair in contrast to what has been suggested by others shaheen et al 2013 descriptions of the experimental data using the srs and cdi isotherms are shown as solid and dashed curves in fig 1 respectively with optimized parameter values given in table 2 for the single ion case srs and cdi descriptions are nearly identical this is expected as the isotherms reduce to the same form where a 1 k indeed values of k estimated by the cdi were not significantly different than best fit values for the srs α 0 05 in all cases for olivier the srs correctly captured the highest sorbed concentrations of ni and zn during competitive experiments however descriptions of lower sorbed concentrations were poor for both cations the srs overestimated the effect of competition at low surface coverage resulting in an underestimation of sorbed concentrations of both cations in multicomponent systems on the other hand the cdi provided much better descriptions of lower sorbed concentrations in the multicomponent case while maintaining good descriptions of higher sorbed concentrations srs descriptions of the windsor sorption data were generally poor in multicomponent systems lower sorbed concentrations were underestimated while highest sorbed concentrations were overestimated for both ni and zn considerable discrepancies between measured data and srs descriptions were also reported for bicomponent systems involving ni and zn antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 as well as ni and cd liao and selim 2010 vidal et al 2009 did achieve very good descriptions of competitive sorption using the srs however separate sets of parameters were obtained for each dataset negating any benefit of using a multicomponent isotherm conversely the cdi described zn sorption data well correctly capturing both low and high sorbed concentrations cdi descriptions of the ni data were worse where the highest sorbed concentrations were poorly described however descriptions of lower sorbed concentrations were better than those of the srs for both soils the cdi descriptions were superior the cdi sse was about ⅟4 and ½ of that of the srs for olivier and windsor respectively estimated values of the srs competitive coefficients αni and αzn were 9 21 and 1 40 respectively for olivier while cdi values for bni and bzn were 0 13 and 0 03 respectively smaller values of αzn and bzn are indicative of the dominance of zn sorption over that of ni and were consistent with the measured results for windsor the competitive parameters for ni sorption were less than those for zn for both the srs and cdi indicating that ni was dominant over zn also consistent with the measured data the srs was rigorously derived based on mechanistic assumptions exponential distribution of binding site energies coupled with langmuir type sorption at each energy level sheindorf et al 1981 and may therefore be preferable to the purely empirical cdi however the srs in this case can be considered as a purely empirical description specifically αni 1 αzn by definition yet this was not the case for either soil as such the srs and cdi should be compared based on their ability to describe the observed data sposito 1989 where the cdi was superior furthermore it is very common that the αn 1 αzn relationship is not realized roy et al 1986 zhang and selim 2007 antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 liao and selim 2010 vidal et al 2009 sun and selim 2017 therefore the cdi may provide superior descriptions of competitive sorption for other solutes as well 4 2 transport breakthrough curves of ni and zn from both soils during single ion experiments are displayed in fig 3 as expected from batch data the mobility of ni was greater than zn in both soils specifically ni breakthrough from olivier was retarded by 4 pv the maximum concentration in the effluent reached 80 of that in the influent solution and 96 of the applied ni was recovered in the effluent conversely zn breakthrough was retarded by nearly 11 pv the maximum concentration in the effluent was 49 of the influent solution and only 84 of the mass applied was recovered in the effluent for windsor ni breakthrough was retarded by 8 pv and the maximum effluent concentration was 78 of the influent compared to a retardation of zn breakthrough of about 10 pv and a maximum effluent concentration of 60 of the influent recovered ni and zn in the effluent was 87 and 74 of that applied respectively all four btcs were asymmetric with extensive tailing while some have suggested this is a result of nonequilibrium conditions within the column elbana and selim 2010 elbana et al 2014 tailing can also be a result of nonlinear equilibrium sorption serrano et al 2013 to determine whether nonequilibrium conditions were present in the soil columns flow was interrupted during each single cation experiment as indicated by the arrows in fig 3 perturbations in the effluent concentration were observed in all cases indicating sorption nonequilibrium brusseau et al 1989 sorption nonequilibrium has been reported previously for both ni and zn sorption by olivier and windsor soils zhao and selim 2010 liao and selim 2010 selim et al 2013 such nonequilibrium could be attributable to both physical and or chemical processes however the data presented in fig 3 cannot distinguish between the two effluent concentration perturbations following flow interruption during the transport of a conservative tracer are indicative of physical nonequilibrium reedy et al 1996 jardine et al 1998 zhang 2007 performed flow interruption experiments during the transport of 3h2o through windsor and olivier columns no perturbation was observed in the windsor soil indicating that the nonequilibrium during ni and zn transport experiments was due to chemical nonequilibrium however a significant decrease in 3h2o concentration was observed following flow interruption in the olivier column as such physical nonequilibrium as the cause of effluent concentration perturbations of ni and zn could not be ruled out to investigate this further 3h2o btcs from olivier soil were fit using the cfitim module included in the stanmod software package the cfitim module is a nonreactive physical nonequilibrium model that considers both a mobile and immobile region corresponding to inter and intraparticle space respectively van genuchten et al 2012 comparisons between model fits were made using an f test at the α 0 05 level the two region cfitim provided a superior description of the olivier data in three of the five cases however in no case were all parameters significantly different than zero α 0 05 therefore for practical purposes a single flow domain was assumed for reactive transport modeling discussed below breakthrough curves of ni and zn from each soil during concurrent pulse applications 1 0 mm ni and zn are shown in fig 4 the mobility of both metal cations increased when applied simultaneously specifically the retardation of ni was substantially reduced in both soils with breakthrough from olivier and windsor occurring after about 3 and 4 pv respectively similarly zn breakthrough from olivier and windsor was reduced to about 8 and 4 pv respectively earlier breakthrough of metal cations due to competition has been reported previously for example the simultaneous application of sn and pb substantially reduced pb retardation in windsor and olivier soils while ni mn and zn were demonstrated to result in earlier breakthrough of pb from a lateritic soil elbana et al 2014 chotpantarat et al 2011 2012 earlier breakthrough of solutes during multicomponent transport was also demonstrated by several others tsang and lo 2006 zhang and selim 2007 fonseca et al 2011 selim 2013a maximum effluent concentrations of ni and zn from both soils increased substantially relative to single cation experiments maximum concentrations of ni were 100 and 93 of the influent concentration from olivier and windsor respectively while those of zn were 62 and 91 of the influent this further emphasizes the increased mobility of either cation when applied concurrently and has been demonstrated previously tsang and lo 2006 chotpantarat et al 2011 2012 selim 2013a elbana et al 2014 the fraction of the mass of ni and zn applied recovered in the effluent was very similar between single cation and concurrent pulse application experiments for olivier and for zn may suggest the presence of sites for which ni does not compete sun and selim 2017 for windsor substantially more ni and zn were recovered in the effluent relative to single cation experiments consistent with enhanced mobility due to competition results from consecutive pulse experiments ni followed by zn and vice versa are shown in fig 5 in general the metal cation that was applied first was mostly unaffected relative to single cation experiments evidenced by similar retardation maximum effluent concentrations and mass recovery however the metal cation that was applied second exhibited increased mobility for example the breakthrough of ni from olivier when applied after zn was earlier by 2 pv relative to single ion experiments likewise zn breakthrough was also about 2 pv earlier when applied after ni and its maximum concentration in the effluent was 68 of the influent compared to 49 in the single cation experiment like concurrent pulse experiments zn recovery was mostly unaffected by ni suggesting the existence of sorption sites specific to zn in windsor maximum effluent concentrations of ni were greater relative to single cation experiments when applied after zn however its retardation unexpectedly increased by about 1 5 pv conversely breakthrough of zn was about 4 pv earlier when applied after ni its maximum relative concentration in the effluent was 81 of the influent 60 during single cation experiment and 92 of the applied zn was recovered in the effluent compared to 74 during single cation experiments enhanced mobility of the second metal cation is due to some proportion of the available sites being occupied by the first metal cation which in turn reduces the sites available for the second metal cation selim 2013a like the current results increased mobility of vanadate following the application of a phosphate pulse was reported by selim 2013a and increased mobility of pb following the application of sn was reported by elbana et al 2014 descriptions of the measured btcs from each experiment using the srst and cdit models are included in figs 3 5 as solid and dashed curves respectively descriptions of ni are shown as black curves while those of zn are blue optimized parameters are provided in supplemental table s2 and goodness of fit statistics are given in table 3 consistency between the isotherm parameters obtained from batch and column experiments can be assessed based on the corresponding ratio of rate coefficients variances of the resulting estimates can be calculated according to the following 14 var c k n k d c k n k d 2 σ kn 2 k d 2 σ kn 2 k d 2 where c is θ ρ for srs and ρ θ for cdit and kn kd is kf kb for srs and kb kf for cdit from the variance standard errors can be calculated for isotherm parameters estimated by the transport models and compared to those obtained from batch experiments two tailed t tests at the α 0 05 level were conducted with results given in supplemental table s3 values of kni and kzn estimated by srst were significantly different than those obtained from batch experiments except for the windsor kni values of ani and azn estimated by the cdit were significantly less than those obtained from batch experiments except for the olivier ani discrepancies between model parameters obtained from batch and transport experiments are common within the literature and have been attributed to methodological differences zhang and selim 2007 cai et al 2015 sun and selim 2017 namely different solid solution ratios greater mixing in batch systems and open vs closed systems on the other hand no significant differences between transport and batch values for bni or bzn existed for any case indicating good conformity between the two methods for capturing the effect of competition both models described the single cation experiments well r2 0 96 except for ni transport in windsor although it was still reasonably well described r2 0 93 simulated btcs by both models were nearly identical in all cases this was expected as the models are identical for the non competitive case values of the competitive parameters αni and αzn for srst k5 and k6 for cdit were obtained by fitting both models to the concurrent pulse experiments overall both models described the observed data well with r2 0 93 in all cases although the srst descriptions were slightly better as indicated by lower values of the sse table 3 for olivier both models captured the timing and magnitude of peak concentrations well while zn retardation was underestimated and overestimated by the srst and cdit respectively for windsor the srst correctly captured the timing and magnitude of the peak effluent concentrations whereas the cdit overestimated peak concentrations for both ni and zn however while the srst underestimated ni and zn retardation the cdit captured the retardation of both well optimized parameters from single ion and concurrent pulse experiments were used to simulate consecutive pulse experiments fig 5 zhang and selim 2007 the cdit provided better descriptions of the consecutive pulse experiments except for the windsor zn ni experiment which both models described poorly a consistent feature of the srst simulations was an underestimation of the retardation of the second pulse with simulated breakthrough occurring earlier than measured in all cases the cdit however captured such retardation to a much better extent in all cases the overall shapes of the simulated btcs were more consistent with those measured for olivier while windsor btcs were poorly approximated by both models specifically the timing of maximum effluent concentrations of zn were underestimated resulting in lower modeled than observed effluent concentrations during the falling limbs of the zn btcs both models overestimated peak ni concentrations during windsor zn ni experiments demonstrating that they overestimated the increase in ni mobility in multicomponent systems for this scenario for the entire data set all five experiments for each soil the cdit was superior for olivier while the srst was superior for windsor indicating that the suitability of either approach was soil dependent however the overall r2 values for olivier and windsor were 0 93 and 0 88 respectively indicating that either model provided a reasonable description of the total data set others described competitive transport of metal cations using single component models tsang and lo 2006 chotpantarat et al 2012 elbana et al 2014 an obvious drawback to such approaches is that they require separate sets of parameters for single and multicomponent systems greatly limiting their utility surface complexation models have successfully been used to model competitive sorption and transport of metal cations in soils serrano et al 2009 2013 however such models applied to soils have been argued as empirical as the attribution of partitioning coefficients to specific adsorption mechanisms is questionable in heterogenous media kretzschmar and voegelin 2001 as such they provide no deeper insight into surface level mechanisms than the empirical srst or cdit but require more parameters when using empirical approaches sposito 1989 argued that a model should be evaluated based on its ability to describe the observed data and such models should contain as few parameters as possible to provide sufficient descriptions kretzschmar and voegelin 2001 furthermore surface complexation models assume chemical equilibrium which may be inappropriate especially during flow conditions to this effect several authors demonstrated that the use of models that incorporate time dependent reactions provide better descriptions than those that assume equilibrium selim et al 1992 tsang and lo 2006 chotpantarat et al 2012 both the srst and cdit are nonequilibrium models and since nonequilibrium was observed during transport experiments were more appropriate for describing the current data overall both transport models offer an advantage to single species kinetic models in that they require a single set of parameters to describe both single ion and multicomponent systems and require fewer parameters than scm based transport models 5 conclusion reduced sorption of ni and zn by olivier and windsor soils in multicomponent batch experiments confirmed that both metal cations compete for sorption sites based on relative reductions in sorbed concentrations zn sorption was dominant in olivier while ni was dominant in windsor a novel multicomponent isotherm cdi was presented and compared to the srs isotherm for describing competitive sorption of ni and zn by both soils the srs isotherm provided reasonable descriptions of olivier batch data for the highest input concentrations however sorption was generally underestimated for the lower input concentrations on the other hand the cdi provided good descriptions of sorbed concentrations across the entire range of solution concentrations srs descriptions of the multicomponent windsor data were poor for both ni and zn cdi descriptions of the windsor ni data were also generally poor however zn sorption data was described well for both soils the cdi was superior to the srs isotherm while requiring the same number of adjustable parameters during transport studies the mobility of ni and zn increased in both soils during concurrent pulse experiments in consecutive pulse experiments the cation applied first was generally unaffected whereas the mobility of the cation applied second increased a novel multicomponent kinetic transport model the cdit was developed and compared to an srs based kinetic transport model srst for describing competitive transport of ni and zn in both soils both the srst and cdit models gave good descriptions of the transport of ni and zn during single cation as well as concurrent application experiments indicating that both are appropriate for describing competitive transport consecutive pulse experiments were generally better described by cdit except for the windsor zn ni experiment which both models described poorly all five experiments were best described by the cdit for olivier while the srst better described the windsor transport data overall the better description of batch data by the cdi coupled with comparable descriptions of transport data by both models suggest the cdi cdit approach for describing competitive sorption and transport of ni and zn is preferable to previous empirical multicomponent approaches

1239,the mobility of contaminants in soil is controlled by sorption reactions which can be affected by the presence of other solutes that compete for sorption sites the ability to model such effects is necessary for evaluating the environmental risk of a given contaminant in this study the competitive sorption and transport of nickel ni and zinc zn in olivier and windsor soils was investigated using batch equilibration and miscible displacement experiments during batch experiments the sorption of ni and zn was mutually reduced in multicomponent systems indicating that the metal cations compete for sorption sites when applied concurrently the retardation of both ions decreased and peak effluent concentrations increased relative to single ion experiments demonstrating that competition increased the mobility of both ions during miscible displacement experiments a novel freundlich type multicomponent isotherm cdi and its kinetic analog cdit were developed and compared to the commonly used srs isotherm and srs based kinetic approach srst in describing the experimental data the cdi provided a superior description of the competitive batch data especially at low surface coverage and may therefore be more applicable to multicomponent sorption than the srs the olivier and windsor transport data were best described by the cdit and srst respectively however both models generally described the data well since both approaches gave comparable descriptions of the transport data while the cdi outperformed the srs in describing the batch data the cdi cdit may be more generally applicable to multicomponent systems and warrants further study keywords competitive sorption competitive transport heavy metals multicomponent isotherms multicomponent kinetic models abbreviations

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction understanding of the mobility of contaminants in soil is necessary for determining their environmental risk the composition of the soil solution namely the presence of multiple species that compete for sorption sites can greatly affect the behavior of a contaminant in the subsurface this is an important consideration as heavy metal contamination of soils often involves multiple species dermont et al 2010 liao et al 2016 which can increase contaminant mobility for example the simultaneous presence of ni and zn was shown to decrease the sorption of both cations by soil although ni was more affected than zn antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 competition for sites has also been demonstrated to reduce ni and zn sorption by fe mn and al oxides trivedi et al 2001 guo et al 2018 choi et al 2020 which have been shown to be dominant materials that control metal behavior in soils bradl 2004 covelo et al 2007a increased mobility due to competition has been well demonstrated for a wide range of transition and post transition metals as reviewed by selim 2013b and violante 2013 moreover designer sorbents such as modified biochars are commonly used to remove multiple chemicals from contaminated soils and water lu et al 2022 liu et al 2022 and as such it is important to consider competitive interactions in engineered systems the ability to model the transport of heavy metals in soil is essential for predicting their fate in the environment tsang and lo 2006 demonstrated that a transport model considering sorption kinetics outperformed an approach assuming linear equilibrium sorption in describing competitive cd and cu transport in soil similarly chotpantarat et al 2012 compared a linear equilibrium model to nonlinear langmuir type equilibrium and kinetic models to describe the competitive transport of pb and several other metal cations in binary systems through a lateritic soil elbana et al 2014 used a two site equilibrium kinetic langmuir type model to describe the competitive transport of sn and pb through two soils however in all cases these studies employed models that do not account for competitive interactions between metal ions resulting in separate sets of parameters for each experiment greatly reducing their utility conversely others have attempted to incorporate terms into the convection dispersion equation cde to account for competition hinz and selim 1994 described the competitive transport of zn and cd by assuming that the sorption of both occurs exclusively via cation exchange and incorporated exchange isotherms into the cde selim et al 1992 incorporated ion exchange to account for competition between cd and ca as well as a specific langmuir type kinetic site to describe cd transport in soils a similar approach was presented by voegelin et al 2001 with the addition of ph dependent exchange coefficients and cation exchange capacities and successfully described the transport of a variety of metal cations more recently serrano et al 2013 employed a non electrostatic surface complexation model where competitive sorption on fe oxide and phyllosilicate sites was assumed and provided reasonable descriptions of pb and cd transport however kretzschmar and voegelin 2001 argued that applying surface complexation models to soils is rarely appropriate due to their inherent heterogeneity and that such approaches should be considered as empirical in such cases the extension of simpler empirical approaches with as few parameters as possible is preferable kretzschmar and voegelin 2001 in this regard zhang and selim 2007 extended the competitive srs isotherm sheindorf et al 1981 into a kinetic formulation and successfully described competitive transport of phosphate and as in soils the same model was used to describe the competitive transport of mo and phosphate sun and selim 2017 further demonstrating its utility besides the approach of zhang and selim 2007 multicomponent kinetic transport models are lacking the goals of this study were to 1 investigate the competitive sorption and transport of ni and zn in two contrasting soils as well as to 2 compare the descriptive capability of a novel freundlich type multicomponent model to the proven approach of sheindorf et al 1981 and zhang and selim 2007 2 modeling 2 1 sheindorf rebhun sheintuch isotherm and kinetic model the freundlich isotherm can be derived based on the assumptions of an exponential distribution of binding site energies and that langmuir type adsorption occurs at each energy level sips 1948 sheindorf et al 1981 furthermore if competing solutes exhibit freundlich type sorption individually then their sorption in a multicomponent system at each energy level can be described according to the competitive langmuir isotherm sheindorf et al 1981 based on this sheindorf et al 1981 derived a competitive freundlich type isotherm commonly referred to as the srs isotherm for a two component system comprised of cation i and j the sorption of both species can be described according to the system of eqs 1 and 2 1 s i k i c i c i α i c j n i 1 2 s j k j c j c j α j c i n j 1 where s is the sorbed concentration mmol kg 1 c is the solution concentration mmol l 1 k is a distribution coefficient l kg 1 n is a dimensionless nonlinearity parameter and the subscripts i and j refer to cation i and j respectively the parameters α i and α j are dimensionless competitive coefficients describing the effect of cation j on the sorption of cation i and vice versa respectively zhang and selim 2007 incorporated the srs into a kinetic formulation giving eqs 3 and 4 that describe the change in sorbed concentration with respect to time for cations i and j respectively 3 ρ s i t θ k 1 c i c i α i c j n i 1 ρk 2 s i 4 ρ s j t θ k 3 c j c j α j c i n j 1 ρk 4 s j where ρ is the bulk density g cm 3 θ is the volumetric water content and k 1 k 4 are rate coefficients hr 1 2 2 competitive distribution coefficient isotherm and kinetic model the change in the sorbed concentration of metal cation i with respect to time can be expressed according to selim 2014 5 ρ s i t θ k 1 c i n i ρk 2 s i the sorption rate of a given ion has been shown to decrease in the presence of a competing ion qin et al 2006 zhang and selim 2007 this can be accounted for in eq 5 by either decreasing or increasing the forward or backward rate coefficient respectively with the former the resulting expression would result in longer equilibration times while the latter would result in shorter equilibration times others demonstrated that competition between sorbates tends to reduce equilibration times zhao et al 2001 tinnacher et al 2013 padilla et al 2022 consistent with expectations of increasing the backward rate coefficient in multicomponent systems as such it was assumed that the overall backward rate coefficient for cation i is proportional to the sorbed concentration of cation j furthermore if freundlich type sorption for cation j is assumed sorbed j is proportional to its solution concentration raised to a fractional power applying the same approach to cation j the change in sorbed concentrations of both cations with respect to time can be given as the system of eqs 6 and 7 6 ρ s i t θ k 1 c i n i ρ k 2 k 5 c j n j s i 7 ρ s j t θ k 3 c j n j ρ k 4 k 6 c i n i s j where k 1 k 4 are rate coefficients hr 1 and k 5 and k 6 are empirical constants l hr 1 mmol 1 that scale the effect of cation j on cation i sorption and vice versa at equilibrium the differential terms are equal to zero rearranging competitive sorption isotherms for both species are obtained referred to here as the competitive distribution coefficient isotherm cdi 8 s i 1 a i b i c j n j c i n i 9 s j 1 a j b j c i n i c j n j where a and b parameters are defined as 10 a i ρ k 2 θ k 1 b i ρ k 5 θ k 1 11 a j ρ k 4 θ k 3 b j ρ k 6 θ k 3 it is important to note that eqs 8 and 9 are empirical and do not imply specific surface mechanisms and therefore should be assessed on their ability to describe measured data sposito 1989 2 3 sensitivity analysis to compare the srs and cdi isotherms a sensitivity analysis was conducted with results displayed in supplemental figs s1 and s2 specifically focus was given to the effect of α and b on modeled isotherms given by the srs and cdi respectively values of k and a were taken as unity and the nonlinearity parameters were varied to simulate highly nonlinear to approximately linear sorption of either cation initial concentrations of cation i and j were 1 0 and 0 5 mm respectively final concentrations of either cation were iteratively solved for using newton raphson for srs the value of αj was taken as 1 αi sheindorf et al 1981 while values of b j were taken as zero for the cdi both isotherms appear reasonably flexible to describe a wide range of competitive sorption scenarios the value of n j appears to have little effect on srs modeled s i whereas values of n j closer to unity result in higher concentrations of s i for the cdi however this is a result of final concentrations of c j 1 for c j 1 the opposite would be expected to determine the effect of the competitive coefficient of cation j on the sorption of i values of αj or b j were varied with resulting isotherms for cation i shown in supplemental fig s3 as expected increasing values of αj resulted in higher sorbed concentrations of cation i due to the αi 1 αj relationship for cdi the effect of b j was low when a j 1 or b i 0 5 as such results in supplemental fig s3 were obtained with a j set to 0 1 and b i set to 1 increasing values of b j resulted in reductions of s i due to increased c j leading to greater values of the denominator in eq 8 a major distinction between the isotherms is that the srs estimates reduced sorption at low surface coverage even when the effect of competition is low α i 0 1 whereas the cdi does so to a much lesser extent to illustrate this further estimated values of the partitioning coefficient kd s c for each isotherm are shown in supplemental fig s4 others have shown that competition between species is lower at low surface coverage due to an abundance of sites and or high energy associations between the surface and sorbed species serrano et al 2005 flogeac et al 2007 violante 2013 the cdi consistently estimates higher kd values at low solution concentration than the srs and may therefore have an advantage in describing low sorbed concentrations in multicomponent systems 2 4 transport the one dimensional simultaneous transport of two metal cations can be described by a system of convection dispersion equations given by eqs 12 and 13 12 θ c i t ρ s i t θd 2 c i x 2 q c i x 13 θ c j t ρ s j t θd 2 c j x 2 q c j x where d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient cm2 hr 1 and q is the darcy flux in the x direction cm hr 1 eqs 12 and 13 are subject to the initial and boundary conditions given by zhang and selim 2007 the incorporation of eqs 3 and 4 on the left hand side of eqs 12 and 13 respectively yields the srs kinetic transport model srst while that of eqs 6 and 7 gives the competitive distribution coefficient transport model cdit eqs 12 and 13 were solved simultaneously using crank nicolson and eqs 3 and 4 or eqs 6 and 7 were solved for each depth and time using 4th

for 10 min and a 3 ml aliquot of supernatant was analyzed via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometry icp oes for solution concentrations of ni and zn prior to analyses all samples were acidified using hcl to determine the effect of competition on the sorption of either metal cation batch experiments were repeated with the inclusion of either 0 50 or 1 00 mm ni or zn in

in supplemental fig s5 and best fit values of d are given in supplemental table s1 the transport of ni and zn in either soil was evaluated under both single ion and multicomponent systems in single ion experiments 25 pv of either 1 0 mm ni or zn in background solution was applied to soil columns and then subsequently leached with background solution until effluent concentrations were 1 of those in the influent to determine whether nonequilibrium conditions were present in the soil column during transport flow was interrupted for 24 h at various times depending on the specific column competitive transport was evaluated using both consecutive and concurrent pulse applications zhang and selim 2007 elbana et al 2014 in concurrent pulse experiments a 25 pv pulse of 1 0 mm ni and zn was applied to columns followed by the application of background solution for consecutive pulse experiments a 25 pv pulse of 1 0 mm ni was applied to the column followed by 25 pv of 1 0 mm zn after which background solution was applied to the column experiments were then repeated in reverse 25 pv of zn followed by 25 pv of ni effluent concentrations of ni and zn were determined via icp oes as

for zn values of αni and αzn or k 5 and k 6 for the srst and cdit models respectively were then obtained by fitting the models to the competitive transport concurrent pulse data while holding the values of k 1 k 4 constant model descriptions by the srst were obtained using the publicly available chem transport software package http www spess lsu edu chem transport while the simulation and fitting modules of the cdit were written in fortran 95 both the srst and cdit models utilize the levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares procedure to acquire estimates of parameter values goodness of fit was evaluated using r2 and the sum of the squared errors 4 results and discussion 4 1 sorption isotherms for the sorption of ni and zn by olivier and windsor soils are displayed in fig 1 olivier had a higher affinity than windsor for both metal cations with consistently higher sorbed concentrations across the range of solution concentrations the sorption of both ni and zn has been positively correlated with cec and organic matter content shaheen et al 2013 covelo et al 2007b both of which are greater for olivier and likely account for its higher affinity both soils had a greater affinity for zn than for ni consistent with results reported previously for a variety of soils elbana et al 2018 differences in the affinities of cations for soil have been explained according to the hard soft acid principle namely that softer acids tend to preferentially form covalent bonds with surface functional groups and are thus of higher affinity shaheen et al 2012 however the misono softness parameter for ni is greater than that of zn 2 82 vs 2 34 misono et al 1967 and is inconsistent with the current results others have related the relative affinities of cations to their first hydrolysis constant antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 usman 2008 du et al 2011 which can be taken as a measure of the tendency of a cation to form a complex with surface coordinated hydroxyls the hydrolysis constant of zn is greater than that of ni pkh of 9 0 vs 9 9 respectively and is consistent with the sorption results in general the presence of zn reduced the sorption of ni and vice versa in both soils this was expected as reduced sorption of both ni and zn while simultaneously present has been demonstrated previously trivedi et al 2001 antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 choi et al 2020 padilla and selim 2021 to determine the effect of input concentrations of both cations on subsequent sorbed concentrations a tukey pairwise comparison was conducted for each input concentration of ni and zn at the α 0 05 level with results displayed in fig 2 the sorption of ni by olivier was continually decreased for each input concentration of zn when ni was added at 0 10 0 25 and 5 00 mm although only 1 0 mm zn reduced ni sorption when ni was added at 1 0 and 0 5 mm the presence of 0 5 mm ni had no effect on zn sorption relative to single cation experiments for all input zn concentrations however ni added at 1 0 mm did significantly decrease zn sorption in all cases this indicates that ni sorption by olivier was more affected than that of zn in the two component system moreover the sorbed concentration of ni decreased relative to non competitive experiments by an average of 11 and 19 in the presence of 0 50 and 1 00 mm zn respectively while zn sorption decreased only by an average of 4 and 13 in the presence of 0 50 and 1 00 mm ni respectively emphasizing the dominance of zn sorption over ni such dominance was demonstrated previously for zn and ni sorption by soil antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 and fe and mn oxides trivedi et al 2001 choi et al 2020 competition between metal cations has been shown to be minimal at low surface coverage serrano et al 2005 flogeac et al 2007 violante 2013 this appears true for zn where only ni added at 1 0 mm decreased zn sorption when added at its lowest input concentration 0 10 mm however the sorption of ni when added at 0 10 mm was significantly decreased in the presence of both levels of zn indicating that the relationship between competition and surface coverage is ion specific for windsor each increase in initial ni concentration resulted in significant decreases of zn sorption across the range of zn input concentrations this contrasts with what was observed for olivier and was likely due to the lower affinity of windsor fewer total available sites resulted in greater competition initial zn concentrations of 1 00 mm significantly decreased ni sorption in all cases whereas 0 50 mm zn decreased ni sorption in limited cases furthermore the average decrease in ni sorption relative to non competitive experiments was 17 and 24 in the presence of 0 50 and 1 00 mm zn respectively while zn sorption decreased an average of 24 and 34 in the presence of 0 50 and 1 00 mm ni respectively this indicates a dominance of ni sorption over that of zn and contrasts with the trend observed in olivier as well as with previous results trivedi et al 2001 antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 choi et al 2020 as such the preference of a sorbent for a metal cation over another should be considered specific to the sorbent rather than the cation pair in contrast to what has been suggested by others shaheen et al 2013 descriptions of the experimental data using the srs and cdi isotherms are shown as solid and dashed curves in fig 1 respectively with optimized parameter values given in table 2 for the single ion case srs and cdi descriptions are nearly identical this is expected as the isotherms reduce to the same form where a 1 k indeed values of k estimated by the cdi were not significantly different than best fit values for the srs α 0 05 in all cases for olivier the srs correctly captured the highest sorbed concentrations of ni and zn during competitive experiments however descriptions of lower sorbed concentrations were poor for both cations the srs overestimated the effect of competition at low surface coverage resulting in an underestimation of sorbed concentrations of both cations in multicomponent systems on the other hand the cdi provided much better descriptions of lower sorbed concentrations in the multicomponent case while maintaining good descriptions of higher sorbed concentrations srs descriptions of the windsor sorption data were generally poor in multicomponent systems lower sorbed concentrations were underestimated while highest sorbed concentrations were overestimated for both ni and zn considerable discrepancies between measured data and srs descriptions were also reported for bicomponent systems involving ni and zn antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 as well as ni and cd liao and selim 2010 vidal et al 2009 did achieve very good descriptions of competitive sorption using the srs however separate sets of parameters were obtained for each dataset negating any benefit of using a multicomponent isotherm conversely the cdi described zn sorption data well correctly capturing both low and high sorbed concentrations cdi descriptions of the ni data were worse where the highest sorbed concentrations were poorly described however descriptions of lower sorbed concentrations were better than those of the srs for both soils the cdi descriptions were superior the cdi sse was about ⅟4 and ½ of that of the srs for olivier and windsor respectively estimated values of the srs competitive coefficients αni and αzn were 9 21 and 1 40 respectively for olivier while cdi values for bni and bzn were 0 13 and 0 03 respectively smaller values of αzn and bzn are indicative of the dominance of zn sorption over that of ni and were consistent with the measured results for windsor the competitive parameters for ni sorption were less than those for zn for both the srs and cdi indicating that ni was dominant over zn also consistent with the measured data the srs was rigorously derived based on mechanistic assumptions exponential distribution of binding site energies coupled with langmuir type sorption at each energy level sheindorf et al 1981 and may therefore be preferable to the purely empirical cdi however the srs in this case can be considered as a purely empirical description specifically αni 1 αzn by definition yet this was not the case for either soil as such the srs and cdi should be compared based on their ability to describe the observed data sposito 1989 where the cdi was superior furthermore it is very common that the αn 1 αzn relationship is not realized roy et al 1986 zhang and selim 2007 antoniadis and tsadilas 2007 liao and selim 2010 vidal et al 2009 sun and selim 2017 therefore the cdi may provide superior descriptions of competitive sorption for other solutes as well 4 2 transport breakthrough curves of ni and zn from both soils during single ion experiments are displayed in fig 3 as expected from batch data the mobility of ni was greater than zn in both soils specifically ni breakthrough from olivier was retarded by 4 pv the maximum concentration in the effluent reached 80 of that in the influent solution and 96 of the applied ni was recovered in the effluent conversely zn breakthrough was retarded by nearly 11 pv the maximum concentration in the effluent was 49 of the influent solution and only 84 of the mass applied was recovered in the effluent for windsor ni breakthrough was retarded by 8 pv and the maximum effluent concentration was 78 of the influent compared to a retardation of zn breakthrough of about 10 pv and a maximum effluent concentration of 60 of the influent recovered ni and zn in the effluent was 87 and 74 of that applied respectively all four btcs were asymmetric with extensive tailing while some have suggested this is a result of nonequilibrium conditions within the column elbana and selim 2010 elbana et al 2014 tailing can also be a result of nonlinear equilibrium sorption serrano et al 2013 to determine whether nonequilibrium conditions were present in the soil columns flow was interrupted during each single cation experiment as indicated by the arrows in fig 3 perturbations in the effluent concentration were observed in all cases indicating sorption nonequilibrium brusseau et al 1989 sorption nonequilibrium has been reported previously for both ni and zn sorption by olivier and windsor soils zhao and selim 2010 liao and selim 2010 selim et al 2013 such nonequilibrium could be attributable to both physical and or chemical processes however the data presented in fig 3 cannot distinguish between the two effluent concentration perturbations following flow interruption during the transport of a conservative tracer are indicative of physical nonequilibrium reedy et al 1996 jardine et al 1998 zhang 2007 performed flow interruption experiments during the transport of 3h2o through windsor and olivier columns no perturbation was observed in the windsor soil indicating that the nonequilibrium during ni and zn transport experiments was due to chemical nonequilibrium however a significant decrease in 3h2o concentration was observed following flow interruption in the olivier column as such physical nonequilibrium as the cause of effluent concentration perturbations of ni and zn could not be ruled out to investigate this further 3h2o btcs from olivier soil were fit using the cfitim module included in the stanmod software package the cfitim module is a nonreactive physical nonequilibrium model that considers both a mobile and immobile region corresponding to inter and intraparticle space respectively van genuchten et al 2012 comparisons between model fits were made using an f test at the α 0 05 level the two region cfitim provided a superior description of the olivier data in three of the five cases however in no case were all parameters significantly different than zero α 0 05 therefore for practical purposes a single flow domain was assumed for reactive transport modeling discussed below breakthrough curves of ni and zn from each soil during concurrent pulse applications 1 0 mm ni and zn are shown in fig 4 the mobility of both metal cations increased when applied simultaneously specifically the retardation of ni was substantially reduced in both soils with breakthrough from olivier and windsor occurring after about 3 and 4 pv respectively similarly zn breakthrough from olivier and windsor was reduced to about 8 and 4 pv respectively earlier breakthrough of metal cations due to competition has been reported previously for example the simultaneous application of sn and pb substantially reduced pb retardation in windsor and olivier soils while ni mn and zn were demonstrated to result in earlier breakthrough of pb from a lateritic soil elbana et al 2014 chotpantarat et al 2011 2012 earlier breakthrough of solutes during multicomponent transport was also demonstrated by several others tsang and lo 2006 zhang and selim 2007 fonseca et al 2011 selim 2013a maximum effluent concentrations of ni and zn from both soils increased substantially relative to single cation experiments maximum concentrations of ni were 100 and 93 of the influent concentration from olivier and windsor respectively while those of zn were 62 and 91 of the influent this further emphasizes the increased mobility of either cation when applied concurrently and has been demonstrated previously tsang and lo 2006 chotpantarat et al 2011 2012 selim 2013a elbana et al 2014 the fraction of the mass of ni and zn applied recovered in the effluent was very similar between single cation and concurrent pulse application experiments for olivier and for zn may suggest the presence of sites for which ni does not compete sun and selim 2017 for windsor substantially more ni and zn were recovered in the effluent relative to single cation experiments consistent with enhanced mobility due to competition results from consecutive pulse experiments ni followed by zn and vice versa are shown in fig 5 in general the metal cation that was applied first was mostly unaffected relative to single cation experiments evidenced by similar retardation maximum effluent concentrations and mass recovery however the metal cation that was applied second exhibited increased mobility for example the breakthrough of ni from olivier when applied after zn was earlier by 2 pv relative to single ion experiments likewise zn breakthrough was also about 2 pv earlier when applied after ni and its maximum concentration in the effluent was 68 of the influent compared to 49 in the single cation experiment like concurrent pulse experiments zn recovery was mostly unaffected by ni suggesting the existence of sorption sites specific to zn in windsor maximum effluent concentrations of ni were greater relative to single cation experiments when applied after zn however its retardation unexpectedly increased by about 1 5 pv conversely breakthrough of zn was about 4 pv earlier when applied after ni its maximum relative concentration in the effluent was 81 of the influent 60 during single cation experiment and 92 of the applied zn was recovered in the effluent compared to 74 during single cation experiments enhanced mobility of the second metal cation is due to some proportion of the available sites being occupied by the first metal cation which in turn reduces the sites available for the second metal cation selim 2013a like the current results increased mobility of vanadate following the application of a phosphate pulse was reported by selim 2013a and increased mobility of pb following the application of sn was reported by elbana et al 2014 descriptions of the measured btcs from each experiment using the srst and cdit models are included in figs 3 5 as solid and dashed curves respectively descriptions of ni are shown as black curves while those of zn are blue optimized parameters are provided in supplemental table s2 and goodness of fit statistics are given in table 3 consistency between the isotherm parameters obtained from batch and column experiments can be assessed based on the corresponding ratio of rate coefficients variances of the resulting estimates can be calculated according to the following 14 var c k n k d c k n k d 2 σ kn 2 k d 2 σ kn 2 k d 2 where c is θ ρ for srs and ρ θ for cdit and kn kd is kf kb for srs and kb kf for cdit from the variance standard errors can be calculated for isotherm parameters estimated by the transport models and compared to those obtained from batch experiments two tailed t tests at the α 0 05 level were conducted with results given in supplemental table s3 values of kni and kzn estimated by srst were significantly different than those obtained from batch experiments except for the windsor kni values of ani and azn estimated by the cdit were significantly less than those obtained from batch experiments except for the olivier ani discrepancies between model parameters obtained from batch and transport experiments are common within the literature and have been attributed to methodological differences zhang and selim 2007 cai et al 2015 sun and selim 2017 namely different solid solution ratios greater mixing in batch systems and open vs closed systems on the other hand no significant differences between transport and batch values for bni or bzn existed for any case indicating good conformity between the two methods for capturing the effect of competition both models described the single cation experiments well r2 0 96 except for ni transport in windsor although it was still reasonably well described r2 0 93 simulated btcs by both models were nearly identical in all cases this was expected as the models are identical for the non competitive case values of the competitive parameters αni and αzn for srst k5 and k6 for cdit were obtained by fitting both models to the concurrent pulse experiments overall both models described the observed data well with r2 0 93 in all cases although the srst descriptions were slightly better as indicated by lower values of the sse table 3 for olivier both models captured the timing and magnitude of peak concentrations well while zn retardation was underestimated and overestimated by the srst and cdit respectively for windsor the srst correctly captured the timing and magnitude of the peak effluent concentrations whereas the cdit overestimated peak concentrations for both ni and zn however while the srst underestimated ni and zn retardation the cdit captured the retardation of both well optimized parameters from single ion and concurrent pulse experiments were used to simulate consecutive pulse experiments fig 5 zhang and selim 2007 the cdit provided better descriptions of the consecutive pulse experiments except for the windsor zn ni experiment which both models described poorly a consistent feature of the srst simulations was an underestimation of the retardation of the second pulse with simulated breakthrough occurring earlier than measured in all cases the cdit however captured such retardation to a much better extent in all cases the overall shapes of the simulated btcs were more consistent with those measured for olivier while windsor btcs were poorly approximated by both models specifically the timing of maximum effluent concentrations of zn were underestimated resulting in lower modeled than observed effluent concentrations during the falling limbs of the zn btcs both models overestimated peak ni concentrations during windsor zn ni experiments demonstrating that they overestimated the increase in ni mobility in multicomponent systems for this scenario for the entire data set all five experiments for each soil the cdit was superior for olivier while the srst was superior for windsor indicating that the suitability of either approach was soil dependent however the overall r2 values for olivier and windsor were 0 93 and 0 88 respectively indicating that either model provided a reasonable description of the total data set others described competitive transport of metal cations using single component models tsang and lo 2006 chotpantarat et al 2012 elbana et al 2014 an obvious drawback to such approaches is that they require separate sets of parameters for single and multicomponent systems greatly limiting their utility surface complexation models have successfully been used to model competitive sorption and transport of metal cations in soils serrano et al 2009 2013 however such models applied to soils have been argued as empirical as the attribution of partitioning coefficients to specific adsorption mechanisms is questionable in heterogenous media kretzschmar and voegelin 2001 as such they provide no deeper insight into surface level mechanisms than the empirical srst or cdit but require more parameters when using empirical approaches sposito 1989 argued that a model should be evaluated based on its ability to describe the observed data and such models should contain as few parameters as possible to provide sufficient descriptions kretzschmar and voegelin 2001 furthermore surface complexation models assume chemical equilibrium which may be inappropriate especially during flow conditions to this effect several authors demonstrated that the use of models that incorporate time dependent reactions provide better descriptions than those that assume equilibrium selim et al 1992 tsang and lo 2006 chotpantarat et al 2012 both the srst and cdit are nonequilibrium models and since nonequilibrium was observed during transport experiments were more appropriate for describing the current data overall both transport models offer an advantage to single species kinetic models in that they require a single set of parameters to describe both single ion and multicomponent systems and require fewer parameters than scm based transport models 5 conclusion reduced sorption of ni and zn by olivier and windsor soils in multicomponent batch experiments confirmed that both metal cations compete for sorption sites based on relative reductions in sorbed concentrations zn sorption was dominant in olivier while ni was dominant in windsor a novel multicomponent isotherm cdi was presented and compared to the srs isotherm for describing competitive sorption of ni and zn by both soils the srs isotherm provided reasonable descriptions of olivier batch data for the highest input concentrations however sorption was generally underestimated for the lower input concentrations on the other hand the cdi provided good descriptions of sorbed concentrations across the entire range of solution concentrations srs descriptions of the multicomponent windsor data were poor for both ni and zn cdi descriptions of the windsor ni data were also generally poor however zn sorption data was described well for both soils the cdi was superior to the srs isotherm while requiring the same number of adjustable parameters during transport studies the mobility of ni and zn increased in both soils during concurrent pulse experiments in consecutive pulse experiments the cation applied first was generally unaffected whereas the mobility of the cation applied second increased a novel multicomponent kinetic transport model the cdit was developed and compared to an srs based kinetic transport model srst for describing competitive transport of ni and zn in both soils both the srst and cdit models gave good descriptions of the transport of ni and zn during single cation as well as concurrent application experiments indicating that both are appropriate for describing competitive transport consecutive pulse experiments were generally better described by cdit except for the windsor zn ni experiment which both models described poorly all five experiments were best described by the cdit for olivier while the srst better described the windsor transport data overall the better description of batch data by the cdi coupled with comparable descriptions of transport data by both models suggest the cdi cdit approach for describing competitive sorption and transport of ni and zn is preferable to previous empirical multicomponent approaches
