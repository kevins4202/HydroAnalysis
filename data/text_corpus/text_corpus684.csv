3420,because of the risk transmission and superposition among dams in cascade reservoirs the analysis and probability calculation of dam risk become more complex compared with a single reservoir by analyzing the main risk sources and actionmechanisms the disaster causing factors disaster transmitting body and disaster bearing body in the cascade reservoirs system were determined by defining the influence coefficient ic to express the transmission and superposition degree of dam risk among cascade reservoirs dam risk was divided into two parts own risk or and additional risk ar on this basis the relevant concepts and equations for the calculation of the dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs were proposed the numerical simulation was carried out to quantify the ic and a bayesian network analysis model was constructed to calculate the or finally taking five cascade reservoir dams in the dadu river basin as examples the value of their ors ars and risk probabilities were calculated and thereafter the weakest cascade controlling cascade and general cascade in the system were divided the proposed methodology realizes an effective connection with the dam risk calculation method of a single reservoir which can provide a reference for the risk assessment and management of cascade reservoirs in the basin keywords cascade reservoirs risk transmission risk superposition dam break probability 1 introduction the cascade reservoir group refers to a complex system comprising multiple reservoirs in the same basin which has obvious advantages such as full utilization of water flow rolling project development and coordinated power dispatching ardeshirtanha and sharafati 2020 latrubesse et al 2017 it has become a major livelihood project with strategic and overall impact on social and economic development zhou et al 2018 at present cascade reservoirs account for 48 of china s built reservoir projects and 50 of the reservoir projects under construction hu et al 2020 in the next 20 years the main rivers in china such as jinsha river yalong river dadu river and lancang river will continue to carry out cascade development and construction of river basins forming more than 100 cascade reservoirs including tributaries that are successive in recent years aging dams and levees in combination with an increasing frequency of climate extremes pose an unprecedented risk to communities around the world larruari and lall 2020 compared with ordinary reservoirs the dam risk in cascade reservoirs has transmission and superposition effects one of the cascade dam breaks can easily lead to successive dam breaks in downstream reservoirs resulting in serious losses in august 2014 the ludian earthquake in china formed a barrier lake which flooded hongshiyan hydropower station in the main stream of the niulan river and posed a serious threat to the safety of two downstream cascade hydropower stations zhou et al 2015d in may 2020 heavy rainfall in michigan led to the collapse of two cascade dams the edenville dam and sanford dam resulting in the emergency evacuation of more than 10 000 residents and the destruction of infrastructure downstream mehta et al 2020 with the rolling development of cascade reservoirs and the enhancement of public self protection awareness the risk problem of cascade reservoirs has become a public safety problem it is critical to carry out the risk analysis to improve the safety of the basin with the transformation of dam management mode from traditional safety management to risk management the risk analysis theory and technology of a single reservoir dam are becoming increasingly mature ge et al 2020a ge et al 2020b ge et al 2021 li et al 2018b kravits et al 2021 presented a machine learning dam hazard potential classification model that demonstrated the utility of this approach for dams in massachusetts united states larruari and lall 2020 proposed a framework to assess the probability and financial consequences of dam failures which provided an effective solution for risk analysis under the action of dam aging and climate trends assaad and el adaway 2020 developed a computational data driven asset management system to evaluate and predict the deterioration conditions of a bridge deck feinberg et al 2016 provided an overview of reclamation s consequences estimation methodology rcem for estimating life loss due to dam failure luo et al 2009 adopted the improved graham method to estimate the life loss of dam failure by comparison it is rare to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the dam risk of cascade reservoirs as a whole professor david bowles put forward the concept of reservoir group risk analysis for the first time david et al 1999 in recent years some scholars have also carried out active exploration in this field and have achieved some valuable results zhou et al 2015a explored the reasons for failure mechanism and chain failure mode of cascade dams and the results showed that overtopping was the main failure mechanism dewals et al 2008 combined the one dimensional and two dimensional calculation methods of break flood into a series of models for dam break calculation of reservoir groups which effectively improved the accuracy of successive break flood prediction takayama et al 2021 studied the chain failure of landslide dams through channel experiments and the results were significant in predicting the flood flow caused by successive dam failures riha et al 2020 carried out dam break simulation for three cascade reservoirs and analyzed the attenuation effect of dam break peak discharge combining the hydraulic characteristics of reservoirs with flood routing simulation hu et al 2020 carried out numerical simulations and risk analysis of dam failure of cascade reservoirs zhang et al 2016 considered the role of upstream dam break flood in reservoir overtopping risk analysis and proposed a reservoir overtopping risk analysis model based on a a right angle trapezoidal fuzzy number chen et al 2017 calculated the failure probability of earth rock dam slope considering the joint action of earthquakes and upstream cascade dam break floods lin and chen 2018 and li et al 2018a li and liang 2016 analyzed the key risk factors of reservoir overtopping and established a bayesian network bn risk analysis model of overtopping of cascade reservoirs despite the fact that the above efforts have been made for risk calculation and assessment there is still a lack of quantitative analysis on the risk transmission and superposition mechanism among the dams of cascade reservoirs moreover most of them are limited to the risk analysis and calculation of unilateral factors such as floods which fail to consider the failure mode and actual risk status of cascade dams under the coupling action of multiple factors zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 risk probability is usually used to describe the probability of accidents or risk events liu et al 2020 schwabe et al 2015 su et al 2009 considering that the risks faced by a single reservoir dam are also applicable to cascade reservoirs and its risk calculation method has been widely used the calculation method of risk probability of cascade reservoir dams should be connected with the calculation method for a single reservoir dam to form a unified system therefore this paper divided the total risk of a cascade dam into two parts or and ar based on the risk theory and uncertainty analysis method an influence coefficient ic was defined and quantified to reflect the risk transmission and superposition degree among cascade dams and a bayesian network analysis model was constructed to calculate the or ultimately the formulas and methods for calculating the dam risk probability of cascaded reservoirs were proposed which realizes the transition of dam risk probability method from single reservoir to cascade reservoirs through a case study of five cascade reservoirs the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed models and methods were verified the research is not only a supplement and improvement of reservoir risk management theory but also the support for risk assessment and control technology of cascade reservoirs in the basin 2 background 2 1 risk identification and uncertainty analysis of cascade reservoirs geographically cascade reservoirs are mainly concentrated in high mountains and valleys with engineering characteristics such as high altitude high seismic intensity high slope and extremely complex geological conditions zhou et al 2018 in terms of dam type earth rock dams and rockfill dams can adapt to various topographic geological and climatic conditions owing to their convenient materials arch dams have a strong overload capacity and are suitable for construction in high mountains and valleys these characteristics make the above dam types more common in cascade reservoir groups according to the statistics of dam failures in china earth rock dams account for more than 95 of the total number of dam failures becoming the main dam failure type li et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 therefore the risk analysis of cascade reservoirs in this study considers earth rock dams as the main object of study considering the complexity of the service environment of the cascade reservoir group dams and the characteristics of the earth rock dam breaking in case of overtopping li et al 2018a li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 the flood strong earthquake and landslide are regarded as the main sources of natural risks tothe cascade reservoir group dams and the overtopping and dam slope instability are regarded as the main failure forms flood according to statistics overtopping caused by floods is the main failure mode of reservoir dams accounting for more than 50 li et al 2018a li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 floods in cascade reservoirs can be divided into natural flood and upstream dam break flood natural floods were generated by natural rainfall and interval confluence upstream dam break flood refers to the dam break flood transmitted from the upstream cascade which often directly evolves to the downstream reservoir through the river canyon resulting in the surge of the downstream reservoir water level or even overtopping therefore dam break flood is also the main carrier of risk transmission among cascade reservoirs the uncertainty of natural flood risk analysis is mainly the hydrological factors including the possibility of different scale floods flood frequency and the uncertainty of reservoir operating water level while the uncertainty of the upstream dam break flood risk analysis is mainly related to the dam height operating water level river channel parameters and other factors of cascade reservoirs hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 earthquake earthquakes are the main factors inducing landslides the strong action of earthquakes and the repeated vibration of aftershocks destroy the internal structure of the slope earth rock resulting in the overall landslide and instability in cascade reservoirs when a strong earthquake occurs the damage of landslide and collapse induced by the earthquake is greater than the loss directly caused by the earthquake therefore it is essential to analyze the seismic risk of reservoir dams in particular high dams the uncertainty of seismic risk analysis is mainly due to the uncertainty of the occurrence possibility and intensity of earthquakes chen et al 2017 li and liang 2016 landslide the most basic topographic and geomorphological features of the area where the terrace reservoir group is located are numerous mountains steep mountains loose soil structure and the extensive existence of basic conditions for landslides to occur the fluctuation of the reservoir water level caused by the joint operation of cascade reservoirs has a significant impact on the hydrogeological conditions and internal balance relationship in rock and soil mass which can reduce the anti sliding coefficient on the sliding surface and lead to instability chen et al 2017 in terms of the location of the reservoir landslide it can be divided into bank and dam landslides bank landslide refers to the sliding instability of the reservoir bank which can block the river channel to form a weir plug or produce surge resulting in an overtopping accident the dam landslide refers to the instability of the dam slope according to the statistics of engineering practice the ratio of upstream landslide dam break to downstream landslide dam break is approximately 1 9 luo et al 2014 the uncertainty of reservoir landslide risk analysis is due to the uncertainty of the reservoir water level and parameters of the soil material in addition to the above factors dam leakage improper dispatching and some other factors are added uncertain risks that may occur in engineering practice li et al 2019 2 2 analysis of risk action mechanism and division of cascade reservoirs system from the analysis above it can be seen that there is a correlation among various risk sources which induce dam break and act on the reservoir together according to the disaster theory li et al 2018b natural floods earthquakes and landslides are the main disaster causing factors in cascade reservoir systems dam break flood as the carrier of risk transmission and superposition among the cascade units in the system is not only the disaster causing factor of the downstream cascade but also the disaster transmitting body in the cascade system each cascade reservoir dam is the direct risk bearing body that is the object directly affected by the risk accidents which is defined as the disaster bearing body in the system the break of the upstream cascade will have varying degrees of impact on the downstream cascades with some probability of causing successive breaks chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 therefore the risk analysis of cascade reservoirs can be based on the risk assessment of a single reservoir dam but the risk transmission and superposition effect among cascades should be considered to reduce the complexity of risk analysis and probability calculation of cascade reservoirs according to the source of risk the total risk of a cascade dam in cascade reservoirs is divided into its own risk or and the additional risk ar or refers to the failure probability of a cascade dam under its own risk factors without considering the impact of upstream cascade which corresponds to each disaster causing factor in the cascade system ar is transmitted from the upstream cascade through the dam break flood which depends on the degree of risk transmission and superposition and corresponds to the disaster transmission body in the cascade system this proposed risk classification method can effectively connect the risk assessment method of cascade reservoir dams with that of a single reservoir dam on the one hand the risk of cascade reservoir dams can be calculated according to the traditional risk probability calculation method of a single reservoir dam ge et al 2020a ge et al 2020b ge et al 2021 li et al 2019 its risk analysis is no longer limited to the unilateral risk source of flood but can more comprehensively consider the impact of various risk factors on the other hand the source of dam risk of each cascade reservoir becomes clear and intuitive which lays a foundation for the quantification of risk correlation the risk identification results for the cascade reservoirs are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the ar of m includes the conditional probability of n failing and the conditional probability of k failing given that m fails while the ar of n is the conditional probability of k failing given that n fails 3 methods 3 1 quantitative model of risk transmission and superposition effect 3 1 1 expression of dam risk relevance of cascade reservoir groups the break of each dam in cascade reservoirs will have varying degrees of impact on the entire basin thus the cascade reservoirs can be regarded as a series system comprising several single reservoirs most of the existing studies reflect the possibility of risk transmission of adjacent cascades from a qualitative point of view zhang et al 2016 without considering the uncertainty of water level in front of dams which has certain limitations in practical application in particular when the difference between the flood regulation storage capacity of the downstream cascade and the upstream adjacent cascade storage capacity is not obvious it is difficult to determine the possibility of their successive break the dam risk correlation in the cascade reservoir system is mainly the risk transmission and superposition effect among the cascade dams which is manifested in the change in the dam break probability of the downstream cascade reservoirs caused by the upstream cascade reservoirs li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 to more clearly reflect the degree of risk transmission and superposition the ic is defined here to represent the dam break probability of the targeted cascade under the condition that the upstream cascade dam breaks that is the conditional probability of successive dam break of the adjacent upstream and downstream cascades the value range of ic is 0 1 as the disaster transmission body in the cascade reservoir group system a break flood is the carrier of risk transmission and superposition among different cascade reservoirs regardless of the upstream dam break scenario the dam failure flood must act on the downstream dams therefore the risk transmission and superposition effect can be quantified by analyzing the impact of upstream dam break floods on downstream cascade dams most reservoir dams in particular earth rock dams are generally considered to break in the case of overtopping du et al 2015 zhou et al 2015b zhou et al 2015c therefore the downstream cascade dam overtopping under the action of an upstream dam break flood can be directly used as the basis for its break the calculation of the ic in this study is also based on the assumption that the cascade dam will break if overtopping occurs under the action of an upstream dam break flood in practical engineering the water level in front of the cascade dam formed by the upstream dam break flood is affected by multiple factors with great uncertainty therefore ic is determined by sampling different initial storage levels combinations and taking the frequency of uncertain events as the probability which is based on the dam break simulation and mathematical statistics as shown in fig 2 3 1 2 dam break simulation and flood routing models a dam break simulation which includes calculation models and empirical formulas is carried out to obtain the maximum discharge and the dam break flood hydrograph mahdizadeh et al 2012 dam break calculation models such as the mike hec ras dss wise and db iwhr models are widely used aggarwal et al 2016 larruari and lall 2020 pilotti et al 2020 wang et al 2016 in these models the initial size final size and development process of the breach must be set to ensure accurate results the dam break flood hydrograph is generalized by a quartic parabola li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 which is related to the maximum discharge qm water storage capacity w of the upstream reservoir inflow discharge q 0 during dam break and emptying time t of dam break storage capacity the dam break simulation of cascade reservoirs mainly focuses on the maximum discharge and flood flow processes under each successive break condition therefore the simplified equations can be used for relevant calculations which are simple fast and can meet a certain accuracy the xierenzhi formula has wide application conditions with high calculation accuracy li et al 2018a li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 as shown in eq 1 1 qm λ b 0 g 0 5 h 0 1 5 where qm is the maximum discharge λ is the discharge coefficient b 0 is the width of the valley at the dam site g is the gravitational acceleration which can be taken as 9 8 m s2 h 0 is the upstream water depth before dam break in the cascade reservoir system the dam break flood enters the river channel and flows to the downstream reservoir after the upstream dam breaks the flood routing model aims to deduce and describe the change process of hydraulic factors in the river channel over time such as the discharge and water level of the flood in order to obtain the inflow flood characteristics of the downstream reservoir perumal et al 2007 according to the hydraulic theory the natural river channel is often regarded as one dimensional flow and the description of river flow is mainly based on the saint venant equations goutal and sainte marie 2011 liu et al 2015 as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 a t q x 0 3 t q a x β q 2 2 a 2 g h x g s f s 0 0 where a is the cross sectional area of water discharge t is the time step q is the flow x is the spatial coordinate h is the water depth s 0 is the river bottom gradient sf is the resistance gradient gradient of head loss along the way k is the flow modulus 3 1 3 determination of the ic the water level of the reservoir has great uncertainty during the operation period which leads to the uncertainty of the water level in front of the downstream cascade dam formed by the upstream dam break flood in order to reasonably quantify the value of ic the monte carlo mc method widely used for uncertainty analysis is selected in this study for random sampling which has the advantages of high precision and is more effective for nonlinear different distributions and related systems sharafati and azamathulla 2018 the following process is proposed to calculate the value of ic 1 according to the measured data during the operation period the water level distribution characteristics of the upstream cascade reservoirs are counted 2 according to the water level distribution characteristics in front of the upstream cascade dam n times of random sampling are carried out through the mc method and the corresponding dam break flow hydrograph is obtained by dam break simulation so as to generate n types of inflow floods to the downstream cascade reservoir 3 the water levels in front of the downstream cascade dam are obtained by storage routing accordingly the value of n is determined indicating the number of times that the water level exceeds the dam height finally the conditional probability that successive breaks of upstream and downstream cascades are determined as ic n n as shown in fig 2 the proposed method considers the uncertainty of reservoir water level and dam break flood during reservoir operation and the analysis results can effectively reflect and quantify the degree of risk transmission and superposition among cascade dams owing to the complexity of discharge analysis of cascade reservoirs which is affected by operation rules and other factors the discharge of water release facilities was not considered in this study 3 2 calculation of ar and the dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs based on influence coefficient the ar of the cascade reservoir dam is transmitted from the upstream cascade and its value depends on two factors the dam break probability of the upstream cascadeand the conditional probability that the upstream dam break causes successive break that is the ic dam k at the most downstream location in fig 1 was taken as the object of study in addition to the or this cascade dam bears ar from dams m and n therefore the risk probability calculation method for dam k is as follows 4 pk o r a r o r p n k p m n k where pnk represents the probability that dam n break leads to the successive break of dam k and pmnk is the probability that dam m break leads to the successive failure of dams n and k because the ic represents the conditional probability of the targeted dam break caused by its upstream dam break pnk and pmnk can be further deduced as shown in eq 5 5 pnk p n i n k p m n k p m i m n i m n k where pn and pm are the total risk probabilities of dam n and dam m in the cascade reservoir system respectively their calculation idea of them is the same as pk which can be obtained by iterative operation using eqs 4 and 5 ink imn and imnk are the ics which respectively represent the conditional probability of n k successive break caused by dam n the conditional probability of m n successive break caused by dam m and the conditional probability of m n k successive failure caused by m n successive break by substituting eq 5 into eq 4 the total risk probability of dam k in the cascade reservoir system is obtained as shown in eq 6 6 pk o r a r o r p n i n k p m i m n i n k moreover if there is a concrete dam or arch dam in the upstream cascade in addition to the successive break scenario there may be a case where the concrete dam or arch dam in the middle cascade does not break but the downstream earth rock dam breaks assuming that dam n in fig 1 is an arch dam when calculating the risk probability of downstream dam k it is only necessary to replace imnimnk in equ 6 with the influence coefficient im k which represents the conditional probability of dam k break in this case in addition to their ors dams m and n in fig 1 create ars to their downstream dams according to the characteristics of the series system the calculation method above is applied to the entire cascade reservoir system to calculate the total risk probability σp as shown in eq 7 7 p p m p n p k or ar o r m o r n o r k p m i m n p m i m n i m n k p n i n k where pm pn and pk are the risk probabilities of dams m n and k in the cascade reservoir system respectively and orm orn and ork are the ors of the dams respectively 3 3 calculation of or based on bayesian network according to the division of the cascade reservoir system above the or of cascade dam refers to the risk probability without considering the effect of upstream dam break flood which can be calculated based on the traditional dam risk calculation methods in fact the or is the basis for calculating ar which should be estimated first mathematical models commonly used for dam risk probability calculation include event trees fault trees and bns li et al 2019 peng and zhang 2012 wu et al 2020 in view of the great uncertainty of the risk of cascade reservoir group dams the selected risk probability calculation model needs to solve two basic problems one is to meet the needs of uncertainty analysis of the occurrence possibility and combination mode of disaster causing factors the other is to reflect the correlation between disaster causing factors and risk events as well as their impact on dam break therefore an or calculation model based on bn is constructed for reference 3 3 1 bayesian network a bn also known as a belief network is a directed acyclic graph that expresses and calculates the probability relationship between random variables li et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 the bayesian formula and total probability formula are the theoretical bases of the bn as shown in eqs 8 and 9 8 p b a p a b p b p a 9 p a i p a b i p b i where p b is the a priori probability of event b without considering any other factors li et al 2019 peng and zhang 2012 p b a is the probability of event b under the condition that event a has occurred also known as a posteriori probability p a b is the likelihood ratioand i is the number of events the operation result of a bn is the joint probability distribution of all variables in the studied problem which is the probability value under the influence of all factors for example the joint probability distribution of the simple bayesian network in fig 3 is as follows 10 p a b c p c a b p a b p c a b p a p b according to the risk identification results and the action relationship of risk factors of the cascade reservoir system in section 2 1 the bn model for or calculation of cascade reservoir dam is constructed as shown in fig 4 the probability calculation formula of node dam break is shown in eq 11 11 p o l d p d o l p o l p d o l p o p l where o l and d represent the nodes overtopping landslide of dam slope and dam break respectively p o l d and p o l are joint probabilities p d o l are the conditional probabilities 3 3 2 determination of node probability value the a priori probability of natural flood is generally determined by hydrological statistics based on the measured data cai et al 2019 larruari and lall 2020 lin and chen 2018 according to the flood scale this node in fig 4 is divided into several state intervals as below design flood between design flood and check flood and beyond check flood to facilitate the setting of node states in bn for subsequent analysis and calculation each state corresponds to an a priori probability similarly the node state of strong earthquake is set as occurred and not occurred according to the earthquake intensity data the probability of exceeding this earthquake intensity in a reference period is taken as the a priori probability li and liang 2016 in addition to the nodes mentioned above other nodes were all determined the corresponding conditional probability the numerical simulation was also based on the mc method the landslide risk events in fig 4 include landslide of reservoir bank and landslide of dam slope of which the parent nodes are natural flood and strong earthquake natural floods of different scales will form different reservoir levels the slope safety factors under various conditions are calculated respectively considering the variation characteristics of materials the pseudo static method li and liang 2016 is used to simulate the impact of seismic load on reservoir bank landslide and dam slope instability thereafter the critical slip surface corresponding to the minimum safety factor is searched based on the simplified bishop method and the optimization method mahdi and merabtene 2010 in order to obtain different safety factor k which combines the action of reservoir water level earthquake and material parameters when the dam body forms stable seepage at a certain water level the circular arc sliding slice and calculation formula for calculating k by simplified bishop method are shown in fig 5 and eq 12 12 k w v sec α u b sec α tan φ c b sec α 1 1 tan α tan φ k w v sin α mc r where w is the weight of the soil strip kn v is the vertical seismic inertia force kn μ is the pore pressure acting on the ground of the soil strip kn m c and φ are the cohesion kpa and internal friction angle of the bottom surface of the soil strip respectively and mc is the moment of horizontal seismic inertia force to the center of the circle kn m previous studies have shown that the cohesion φ and friction coefficient tan φ usually follow an extreme value type i distribution and lognormal distribution chen et al 2012 li and liang 2016 by substituting the parameter distribution of each variable into eq 12 the random distribution of the safety factor k is calculated and thereafter the conditional probability of landslide of reservoir bank and landslide of dam slope are obtained by counting the times that k is less than the allowable value the reservoir bank landslide near the upstream of the dam will easily lead to surge in front of the dam resulting in overtopping therefore the occurrence of overtopping under the combination of natural flood and reservoir bank landslide is closely related to the surge height and the original reservoir water level the calculation of the water inflow velocity of a landslide mass is the basis for estimating its surge height which is effectively solved by the formula recommended by the american society of civil engineers cao et al 2011 13 v 2 g h 1 cot α tan φ cl mg sin α the equations proposed by pan jiazheng were used for the surge propagation attenuation analysis and climbing calculation of landslide mass li and liang 2016 as shown in eqs 14 and 15 respectively 14 η 0 h 1 17 0 00189 β v gh 15 η x η 0 π n 1 3 5 n 1 k cos θ n k n 1 ln 1 n b x 0 l 2 1 x 0 x 0 l 1 n b x 0 l 2 1 where η 0 is the initial surge height formed after the landslide mass enters the water m h is the distance from the center of gravity of the landslide mass to the water surface m β is the water inflow angle ηx is the surge height formed by the landslide on the reservoir bank in front of the dam m k is the wave reflection coefficient k 1 l is the length of the landslide along the river bank m and b is the average width of the reservoir water surface m x 0 is the distance from the calculation point to the landslide m and θ is the inclination angle tan θ n x 0 nb according to the parameter distribution of the variables in the equations above a random distribution of ηx is obtained by the mc simulation method by superposing ηx with the reservoir water level formed by natural flood the random distribution of surge elevation in front of the dam is obtained and then the frequency at which it exceeds the dam crest elevation is taken as the value of conditional probability of overtopping it is undeniable that the age of the dam and climate change will also affect the probability of dam risk the former is reflected in the change in material parameters and properties li et al 2019 and the latter is reflected in the changes of external factors such as flood event recurrence larruari and lall 2020 according to the division concept of this study these factors mainly cause changes in their or therefore the basic concept and model proposed in this study are still suitable for analyzing the risk calculation under age and climate change although the specific calculation is more complex likewise the risk events that impact a dam that weaken its structure but do not cause a full dam break will increase its or which indirectly leads to an increase in the total risk probability in summary the flow of the calculation of dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs is shown in fig 6 4 results 4 1 project overview dadu river is one of the important tributaries in the upper reaches of the yangtze river a total of 24 cascade reservoirs are planned to be built in the main stream with a total storage capacity of more than 16 5 billion m3 a drop of 2750 m and an installed capacity of 25000 mw cai et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 xiaerga shuangjiangkou and pubugou are the leading reservoirs of the planned river reach and the controlling reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches respectively geological disasters are mainly landslides and debris flows historically several geological disasters have blocked this river chen et al 2018 five cascade reservoirs connected to xiaerxia bala dawei busigou and shuangjiangkou in the upper reaches of the basin were selected as the objects of study for the dam risk probability calculation their geographical locations and the parameter datas of the cascade reservoirs are shown in fig 7 and table 1 respectively 4 2 calculation of or taking the concrete face rockfill dam of shuangjiangkou reservoir as an example its or of a single reservoir is calculated according to the hydrological data li and liang 2016 the natural flood node in fig 4 is divided into three states below design flood a between design flood and check flood b and beyond check flood c and the corresponding a priori probabilities are 0 999 0 0009 and 0 0001 respectively the basic earthquake intensity in the dam site area is vii and the peak acceleration of bedrock with an exceedance probability of 2 in 100 years of the design reference period is a 0 2 g that is the prior probability of strong earthquakes above this intensity is 0 02 a landslide mass was set on the reservoir bank 3 km upstream from the dam site and the soil parameters were determined in a previous study li and liang 2016 the statistics of the material index parameters are listed in table 2 according to the method for determining the node probability value in section 3 3 2 above the most dangerous slip arc surface of rock and soil mass under the corresponding reservoir water level is determined using slope software thereafter 10 000 mc random simulations were programmed using matlab to calculate the conditional probability value of the corresponding node after input into the bn in fig 4 the probability value of each cascade reservoir risk event and its or were deduced as shown in tables 3 and 4 the calculation process was realized by genie a software specially used for bn modeling and calculation li et al 2019 4 3 determination of ic according to the comparison of the storage capacity of the five cascade reservoirs in table 1 it can be inferred that if the xiaerga reservoir dam breaks the dam break flood will cause overtopping in the four downstream reservoirs so the corresponding ics can be directly taken as 1 for other cascade dams the ics are calculated one by one according to the method described in section 3 1 two dam break scenarios were selected as examples in which the reservoir water level conditions were set to the normal pool levels scenario i was set as the dam of dawei reservoir breaks alone after dam break simulation and flood regulation routing it is concluded that the maximum water level in front of the busigou dam is approximately 2614 m indicating that this dam break scenario will lead to overtopping in busigou reservoir similarly scenario ii was set to reflect the successive break of bosigou caused by the dawei dam break under the normal pool level thereafter the successive flood is simulated and the water level in front of the dam formed in shuangjiangkou reservoir is about 2504 2 m indicating that the successive failure flood under this scenario will not lead to overtopping in the shuangjiangkou reservoir the corresponding hydrograph of the dam break flood is shown in fig 8 the previous research shows that the water level in front of the dam during the operation period of the reservoir generally follows the normal distribution and is mostly below the normal pool level li and liang 2016 if the detailed distribution of the water level can be obtained by measurement the result will be more reliable it was set that the water levels in front of the dam during the operation period of the dawei pusigou and shuangjiangkou reservoirs follow the normal distribution of 2685 0 8 2599 1 1 and 2498 1 8 respectively the former in brackets referred to the mean and the latter was the standard deviation respectively 10 000 groups of reservoir water level combinations were sampled in matlab and all possible dam break floods for each of the five reservoirs were considered dam break flood simulation and flood regulation routing were carried out to obtain the random distribution of water level in front of the downstream cascade dam after superimposing the upstream dam break flood as shown in fig 9 by repeating the above process the overtopping times under different dam break scenarios can be obtained and the corresponding ics can be determined because the difference in storage capacity of the middle three cascades in this project case is not obvious there are many dam break scenarios with ics of 0 or 1 the sampling simulation and calculation results of the ics are shown in table 5 4 4 calculation of dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs combined with the calculation results of or and i of the cascade reservoir dams under each dam break scenario the ar and the risk probabilities of the cascade reservoir dams under the risk transmission and superposition effect are calculated according to eq 6 accordingly the total risk the cascade reservoirs can be calculated using eq 7 the results are presented in table 6 and fig 10 5 discussion it can be seen from table 6 that the ors of xiaerga reservoir and shuangjiangkou reservoir are less than those of the other three reservoirs this is because they have a larger storage capacity and the space for flood storage and detention is relatively sufficient in addition according to the current reservoir classification standards of china ge et al 2020a both belong to the large 1 type with higher corresponding fortification standards and stronger ability to resist extraordinary floods and earthquakes in this paper it is assumed that the dam will break in the case of overtopping or landslides which may cause the risk calculation results to be slightly higher than the actual value it does not affect the analysis and comparison of the final results because the same mathematical model and method were used in the calculation in engineering practice the management department often resolves the risk in time through operation scheduling and emergency management measures so as to avoid the occurrence of dam breaks it can be seen from table 6 and fig 10 that the or of the dawei reservoir dam is the highest among the five cascade reservoirs so the dawei reservoir is the weakest cascade that may trigger the failure of the cascade reservoir system which requires special attention the or of the xiaerga reservoir dam is relatively lower but it will directly lead to the successive break of four cascade reservoirs downstream once it breaks and shuangjiangkou reservoir can effectively intercept and weaken the upstream dam break flood to a certain extent and its ar is significantly reduced compared with the upstream cascade which indicates that the risk is blocked and prevented further amplification in this cascade therefore both reservoirs belong to the controlling cascades which determine the risk level of the entire system zhou et al 2018 although risks to the dawei reservoir and busigou reservoir are not the largest they will break under the action of upstream dam break flood further amplifying the risk and transmitting it downstream which belong to the general cascades of the system according to the concept proposed in this study the ar is the product of the dam risk of the upstream cascade and its ics therefore there are two ways to reduce the ar of cascade reservoir dams one is to reduce the upstream controlling cascade risk by means of risk elimination and reinforcement and the other is to reduce the ic by increasing the emergency storage capacity of the targeted cascade in the construction and management of engineering practice the system risk should be reasonably designed based on the risk analysis and calculation results for an incomplete project the interaction among the cascades in the basin needs to be fully considered and the position of the controlling cascade should be reasonably arranged with the reserved risk emergency storage capacity what needs to be addressed is not only the full utilization of water resources but also the reasonable control of system risk for the built projects the or of each cascade dam and the ar transmitted from the upstream cascade should be scientifically evaluated and the dam safety in particular the weakest cascade dam should be ensured by reinforcement measures and strengthening monitoring the risk analysis and calculation model proposed in this study considers the combination of various working conditions during the long term operation of the reservoir dam which makes the risk calculation and evaluation results more reasonable and reliable or and ar are used to divide the risk probability of cascade reservoir dam and the degree of risk transmission and superposition between adjacent cascades is expressed by the value of influence coefficient ic which makes the risk analysis and calculation process clearer and more intuitive more importantly this treatment realizes an effective connection with the traditional risk probability calculation method for a single reservoir in addition the landslide dam formed by the landslide blocking the river can be regarded as natural earth rock dam cao et al 2011 and thus the risk probability calculation model in this study is also suitable for analyzing and evaluating the risk of landslide dams in downstream reservoirs 6 conclusions owing to the transmission and superposition effect of dam risk the traditional dam risk calculation methods for a single reservoir cannot meet the needs of risk management in cascade reservoirs in this study the risk of cascade dam was divided based on the risk analysis the degree of risk transfer and superposition effect was defined as the ic which was quantified in combination with uncertainty analysis dam break simulation and flood routing considering the uncertainty of natural floods earthquake intensity soil parameters and reservoir water level a bn model for calculating the or of cascade reservoir dams was constructed thereafter a method for calculating the ar and the the dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs was proposed in the case analysis all possible water level combinations and successive break scenarios were considered of which two dam break scenarios under a normal pool level were discussed as examples in detail this study aims to provide a new idea for the risk analysis and calculation of cascade reservoirs limited by the simulation model and the hydrology earthquake and soil parameter data in this study it will be further improved upon and

3420,because of the risk transmission and superposition among dams in cascade reservoirs the analysis and probability calculation of dam risk become more complex compared with a single reservoir by analyzing the main risk sources and actionmechanisms the disaster causing factors disaster transmitting body and disaster bearing body in the cascade reservoirs system were determined by defining the influence coefficient ic to express the transmission and superposition degree of dam risk among cascade reservoirs dam risk was divided into two parts own risk or and additional risk ar on this basis the relevant concepts and equations for the calculation of the dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs were proposed the numerical simulation was carried out to quantify the ic and a bayesian network analysis model was constructed to calculate the or finally taking five cascade reservoir dams in the dadu river basin as examples the value of their ors ars and risk probabilities were calculated and thereafter the weakest cascade controlling cascade and general cascade in the system were divided the proposed methodology realizes an effective connection with the dam risk calculation method of a single reservoir which can provide a reference for the risk assessment and management of cascade reservoirs in the basin keywords cascade reservoirs risk transmission risk superposition dam break probability 1 introduction the cascade reservoir group refers to a complex system comprising multiple reservoirs in the same basin which has obvious advantages such as full utilization of water flow rolling project development and coordinated power dispatching ardeshirtanha and sharafati 2020 latrubesse et al 2017 it has become a major livelihood project with strategic and overall impact on social and economic development zhou et al 2018 at present cascade reservoirs account for 48 of china s built reservoir projects and 50 of the reservoir projects under construction hu et al 2020 in the next 20 years the main rivers in china such as jinsha river yalong river dadu river and lancang river will continue to carry out cascade development and construction of river basins forming more than 100 cascade reservoirs including tributaries that are successive in recent years aging dams and levees in combination with an increasing frequency of climate extremes pose an unprecedented risk to communities around the world larruari and lall 2020 compared with ordinary reservoirs the dam risk in cascade reservoirs has transmission and superposition effects one of the cascade dam breaks can easily lead to successive dam breaks in downstream reservoirs resulting in serious losses in august 2014 the ludian earthquake in china formed a barrier lake which flooded hongshiyan hydropower station in the main stream of the niulan river and posed a serious threat to the safety of two downstream cascade hydropower stations zhou et al 2015d in may 2020 heavy rainfall in michigan led to the collapse of two cascade dams the edenville dam and sanford dam resulting in the emergency evacuation of more than 10 000 residents and the destruction of infrastructure downstream mehta et al 2020 with the rolling development of cascade reservoirs and the enhancement of public self protection awareness the risk problem of cascade reservoirs has become a public safety problem it is critical to carry out the risk analysis to improve the safety of the basin with the transformation of dam management mode from traditional safety management to risk management the risk analysis theory and technology of a single reservoir dam are becoming increasingly mature ge et al 2020a ge et al 2020b ge et al 2021 li et al 2018b kravits et al 2021 presented a machine learning dam hazard potential classification model that demonstrated the utility of this approach for dams in massachusetts united states larruari and lall 2020 proposed a framework to assess the probability and financial consequences of dam failures which provided an effective solution for risk analysis under the action of dam aging and climate trends assaad and el adaway 2020 developed a computational data driven asset management system to evaluate and predict the deterioration conditions of a bridge deck feinberg et al 2016 provided an overview of reclamation s consequences estimation methodology rcem for estimating life loss due to dam failure luo et al 2009 adopted the improved graham method to estimate the life loss of dam failure by comparison it is rare to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the dam risk of cascade reservoirs as a whole professor david bowles put forward the concept of reservoir group risk analysis for the first time david et al 1999 in recent years some scholars have also carried out active exploration in this field and have achieved some valuable results zhou et al 2015a explored the reasons for failure mechanism and chain failure mode of cascade dams and the results showed that overtopping was the main failure mechanism dewals et al 2008 combined the one dimensional and two dimensional calculation methods of break flood into a series of models for dam break calculation of reservoir groups which effectively improved the accuracy of successive break flood prediction takayama et al 2021 studied the chain failure of landslide dams through channel experiments and the results were significant in predicting the flood flow caused by successive dam failures riha et al 2020 carried out dam break simulation for three cascade reservoirs and analyzed the attenuation effect of dam break peak discharge combining the hydraulic characteristics of reservoirs with flood routing simulation hu et al 2020 carried out numerical simulations and risk analysis of dam failure of cascade reservoirs zhang et al 2016 considered the role of upstream dam break flood in reservoir overtopping risk analysis and proposed a reservoir overtopping risk analysis model based on a a right angle trapezoidal fuzzy number chen et al 2017 calculated the failure probability of earth rock dam slope considering the joint action of earthquakes and upstream cascade dam break floods lin and chen 2018 and li et al 2018a li and liang 2016 analyzed the key risk factors of reservoir overtopping and established a bayesian network bn risk analysis model of overtopping of cascade reservoirs despite the fact that the above efforts have been made for risk calculation and assessment there is still a lack of quantitative analysis on the risk transmission and superposition mechanism among the dams of cascade reservoirs moreover most of them are limited to the risk analysis and calculation of unilateral factors such as floods which fail to consider the failure mode and actual risk status of cascade dams under the coupling action of multiple factors zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 risk probability is usually used to describe the probability of accidents or risk events liu et al 2020 schwabe et al 2015 su et al 2009 considering that the risks faced by a single reservoir dam are also applicable to cascade reservoirs and its risk calculation method has been widely used the calculation method of risk probability of cascade reservoir dams should be connected with the calculation method for a single reservoir dam to form a unified system therefore this paper divided the total risk of a cascade dam into two parts or and ar based on the risk theory and uncertainty analysis method an influence coefficient ic was defined and quantified to reflect the risk transmission and superposition degree among cascade dams and a bayesian network analysis model was constructed to calculate the or ultimately the formulas and methods for calculating the dam risk probability of cascaded reservoirs were proposed which realizes the transition of dam risk probability method from single reservoir to cascade reservoirs through a case study of five cascade reservoirs the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed models and methods were verified the research is not only a supplement and improvement of reservoir risk management theory but also the support for risk assessment and control technology of cascade reservoirs in the basin 2 background 2 1 risk identification and uncertainty analysis of cascade reservoirs geographically cascade reservoirs are mainly concentrated in high mountains and valleys with engineering characteristics such as high altitude high seismic intensity high slope and extremely complex geological conditions zhou et al 2018 in terms of dam type earth rock dams and rockfill dams can adapt to various topographic geological and climatic conditions owing to their convenient materials arch dams have a strong overload capacity and are suitable for construction in high mountains and valleys these characteristics make the above dam types more common in cascade reservoir groups according to the statistics of dam failures in china earth rock dams account for more than 95 of the total number of dam failures becoming the main dam failure type li et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 therefore the risk analysis of cascade reservoirs in this study considers earth rock dams as the main object of study considering the complexity of the service environment of the cascade reservoir group dams and the characteristics of the earth rock dam breaking in case of overtopping li et al 2018a li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 the flood strong earthquake and landslide are regarded as the main sources of natural risks tothe cascade reservoir group dams and the overtopping and dam slope instability are regarded as the main failure forms flood according to statistics overtopping caused by floods is the main failure mode of reservoir dams accounting for more than 50 li et al 2018a li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 floods in cascade reservoirs can be divided into natural flood and upstream dam break flood natural floods were generated by natural rainfall and interval confluence upstream dam break flood refers to the dam break flood transmitted from the upstream cascade which often directly evolves to the downstream reservoir through the river canyon resulting in the surge of the downstream reservoir water level or even overtopping therefore dam break flood is also the main carrier of risk transmission among cascade reservoirs the uncertainty of natural flood risk analysis is mainly the hydrological factors including the possibility of different scale floods flood frequency and the uncertainty of reservoir operating water level while the uncertainty of the upstream dam break flood risk analysis is mainly related to the dam height operating water level river channel parameters and other factors of cascade reservoirs hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 earthquake earthquakes are the main factors inducing landslides the strong action of earthquakes and the repeated vibration of aftershocks destroy the internal structure of the slope earth rock resulting in the overall landslide and instability in cascade reservoirs when a strong earthquake occurs the damage of landslide and collapse induced by the earthquake is greater than the loss directly caused by the earthquake therefore it is essential to analyze the seismic risk of reservoir dams in particular high dams the uncertainty of seismic risk analysis is mainly due to the uncertainty of the occurrence possibility and intensity of earthquakes chen et al 2017 li and liang 2016 landslide the most basic topographic and geomorphological features of the area where the terrace reservoir group is located are numerous mountains steep mountains loose soil structure and the extensive existence of basic conditions for landslides to occur the fluctuation of the reservoir water level caused by the joint operation of cascade reservoirs has a significant impact on the hydrogeological conditions and internal balance relationship in rock and soil mass which can reduce the anti sliding coefficient on the sliding surface and lead to instability chen et al 2017 in terms of the location of the reservoir landslide it can be divided into bank and dam landslides bank landslide refers to the sliding instability of the reservoir bank which can block the river channel to form a weir plug or produce surge resulting in an overtopping accident the dam landslide refers to the instability of the dam slope according to the statistics of engineering practice the ratio of upstream landslide dam break to downstream landslide dam break is approximately 1 9 luo et al 2014 the uncertainty of reservoir landslide risk analysis is due to the uncertainty of the reservoir water level and parameters of the soil material in addition to the above factors dam leakage improper dispatching and some other factors are added uncertain risks that may occur in engineering practice li et al 2019 2 2 analysis of risk action mechanism and division of cascade reservoirs system from the analysis above it can be seen that there is a correlation among various risk sources which induce dam break and act on the reservoir together according to the disaster theory li et al 2018b natural floods earthquakes and landslides are the main disaster causing factors in cascade reservoir systems dam break flood as the carrier of risk transmission and superposition among the cascade units in the system is not only the disaster causing factor of the downstream cascade but also the disaster transmitting body in the cascade system each cascade reservoir dam is the direct risk bearing body that is the object directly affected by the risk accidents which is defined as the disaster bearing body in the system the break of the upstream cascade will have varying degrees of impact on the downstream cascades with some probability of causing successive breaks chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 therefore the risk analysis of cascade reservoirs can be based on the risk assessment of a single reservoir dam but the risk transmission and superposition effect among cascades should be considered to reduce the complexity of risk analysis and probability calculation of cascade reservoirs according to the source of risk the total risk of a cascade dam in cascade reservoirs is divided into its own risk or and the additional risk ar or refers to the failure probability of a cascade dam under its own risk factors without considering the impact of upstream cascade which corresponds to each disaster causing factor in the cascade system ar is transmitted from the upstream cascade through the dam break flood which depends on the degree of risk transmission and superposition and corresponds to the disaster transmission body in the cascade system this proposed risk classification method can effectively connect the risk assessment method of cascade reservoir dams with that of a single reservoir dam on the one hand the risk of cascade reservoir dams can be calculated according to the traditional risk probability calculation method of a single reservoir dam ge et al 2020a ge et al 2020b ge et al 2021 li et al 2019 its risk analysis is no longer limited to the unilateral risk source of flood but can more comprehensively consider the impact of various risk factors on the other hand the source of dam risk of each cascade reservoir becomes clear and intuitive which lays a foundation for the quantification of risk correlation the risk identification results for the cascade reservoirs are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the ar of m includes the conditional probability of n failing and the conditional probability of k failing given that m fails while the ar of n is the conditional probability of k failing given that n fails 3 methods 3 1 quantitative model of risk transmission and superposition effect 3 1 1 expression of dam risk relevance of cascade reservoir groups the break of each dam in cascade reservoirs will have varying degrees of impact on the entire basin thus the cascade reservoirs can be regarded as a series system comprising several single reservoirs most of the existing studies reflect the possibility of risk transmission of adjacent cascades from a qualitative point of view zhang et al 2016 without considering the uncertainty of water level in front of dams which has certain limitations in practical application in particular when the difference between the flood regulation storage capacity of the downstream cascade and the upstream adjacent cascade storage capacity is not obvious it is difficult to determine the possibility of their successive break the dam risk correlation in the cascade reservoir system is mainly the risk transmission and superposition effect among the cascade dams which is manifested in the change in the dam break probability of the downstream cascade reservoirs caused by the upstream cascade reservoirs li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 to more clearly reflect the degree of risk transmission and superposition the ic is defined here to represent the dam break probability of the targeted cascade under the condition that the upstream cascade dam breaks that is the conditional probability of successive dam break of the adjacent upstream and downstream cascades the value range of ic is 0 1 as the disaster transmission body in the cascade reservoir group system a break flood is the carrier of risk transmission and superposition among different cascade reservoirs regardless of the upstream dam break scenario the dam failure flood must act on the downstream dams therefore the risk transmission and superposition effect can be quantified by analyzing the impact of upstream dam break floods on downstream cascade dams most reservoir dams in particular earth rock dams are generally considered to break in the case of overtopping du et al 2015 zhou et al 2015b zhou et al 2015c therefore the downstream cascade dam overtopping under the action of an upstream dam break flood can be directly used as the basis for its break the calculation of the ic in this study is also based on the assumption that the cascade dam will break if overtopping occurs under the action of an upstream dam break flood in practical engineering the water level in front of the cascade dam formed by the upstream dam break flood is affected by multiple factors with great uncertainty therefore ic is determined by sampling different initial storage levels combinations and taking the frequency of uncertain events as the probability which is based on the dam break simulation and mathematical statistics as shown in fig 2 3 1 2 dam break simulation and flood routing models a dam break simulation which includes calculation models and empirical formulas is carried out to obtain the maximum discharge and the dam break flood hydrograph mahdizadeh et al 2012 dam break calculation models such as the mike hec ras dss wise and db iwhr models are widely used aggarwal et al 2016 larruari and lall 2020 pilotti et al 2020 wang et al 2016 in these models the initial size final size and development process of the breach must be set to ensure accurate results the dam break flood hydrograph is generalized by a quartic parabola li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 which is related to the maximum discharge qm water storage capacity w of the upstream reservoir inflow discharge q 0 during dam break and emptying time t of dam break storage capacity the dam break simulation of cascade reservoirs mainly focuses on the maximum discharge and flood flow processes under each successive break condition therefore the simplified equations can be used for relevant calculations which are simple fast and can meet a certain accuracy the xierenzhi formula has wide application conditions with high calculation accuracy li et al 2018a li and liang 2016 lin and chen 2018 as shown in eq 1 1 qm λ b 0 g 0 5 h 0 1 5 where qm is the maximum discharge λ is the discharge coefficient b 0 is the width of the valley at the dam site g is the gravitational acceleration which can be taken as 9 8 m s2 h 0 is the upstream water depth before dam break in the cascade reservoir system the dam break flood enters the river channel and flows to the downstream reservoir after the upstream dam breaks the flood routing model aims to deduce and describe the change process of hydraulic factors in the river channel over time such as the discharge and water level of the flood in order to obtain the inflow flood characteristics of the downstream reservoir perumal et al 2007 according to the hydraulic theory the natural river channel is often regarded as one dimensional flow and the description of river flow is mainly based on the saint venant equations goutal and sainte marie 2011 liu et al 2015 as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 a t q x 0 3 t q a x β q 2 2 a 2 g h x g s f s 0 0 where a is the cross sectional area of water discharge t is the time step q is the flow x is the spatial coordinate h is the water depth s 0 is the river bottom gradient sf is the resistance gradient gradient of head loss along the way k is the flow modulus 3 1 3 determination of the ic the water level of the reservoir has great uncertainty during the operation period which leads to the uncertainty of the water level in front of the downstream cascade dam formed by the upstream dam break flood in order to reasonably quantify the value of ic the monte carlo mc method widely used for uncertainty analysis is selected in this study for random sampling which has the advantages of high precision and is more effective for nonlinear different distributions and related systems sharafati and azamathulla 2018 the following process is proposed to calculate the value of ic 1 according to the measured data during the operation period the water level distribution characteristics of the upstream cascade reservoirs are counted 2 according to the water level distribution characteristics in front of the upstream cascade dam n times of random sampling are carried out through the mc method and the corresponding dam break flow hydrograph is obtained by dam break simulation so as to generate n types of inflow floods to the downstream cascade reservoir 3 the water levels in front of the downstream cascade dam are obtained by storage routing accordingly the value of n is determined indicating the number of times that the water level exceeds the dam height finally the conditional probability that successive breaks of upstream and downstream cascades are determined as ic n n as shown in fig 2 the proposed method considers the uncertainty of reservoir water level and dam break flood during reservoir operation and the analysis results can effectively reflect and quantify the degree of risk transmission and superposition among cascade dams owing to the complexity of discharge analysis of cascade reservoirs which is affected by operation rules and other factors the discharge of water release facilities was not considered in this study 3 2 calculation of ar and the dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs based on influence coefficient the ar of the cascade reservoir dam is transmitted from the upstream cascade and its value depends on two factors the dam break probability of the upstream cascadeand the conditional probability that the upstream dam break causes successive break that is the ic dam k at the most downstream location in fig 1 was taken as the object of study in addition to the or this cascade dam bears ar from dams m and n therefore the risk probability calculation method for dam k is as follows 4 pk o r a r o r p n k p m n k where pnk represents the probability that dam n break leads to the successive break of dam k and pmnk is the probability that dam m break leads to the successive failure of dams n and k because the ic represents the conditional probability of the targeted dam break caused by its upstream dam break pnk and pmnk can be further deduced as shown in eq 5 5 pnk p n i n k p m n k p m i m n i m n k where pn and pm are the total risk probabilities of dam n and dam m in the cascade reservoir system respectively their calculation idea of them is the same as pk which can be obtained by iterative operation using eqs 4 and 5 ink imn and imnk are the ics which respectively represent the conditional probability of n k successive break caused by dam n the conditional probability of m n successive break caused by dam m and the conditional probability of m n k successive failure caused by m n successive break by substituting eq 5 into eq 4 the total risk probability of dam k in the cascade reservoir system is obtained as shown in eq 6 6 pk o r a r o r p n i n k p m i m n i n k moreover if there is a concrete dam or arch dam in the upstream cascade in addition to the successive break scenario there may be a case where the concrete dam or arch dam in the middle cascade does not break but the downstream earth rock dam breaks assuming that dam n in fig 1 is an arch dam when calculating the risk probability of downstream dam k it is only necessary to replace imnimnk in equ 6 with the influence coefficient im k which represents the conditional probability of dam k break in this case in addition to their ors dams m and n in fig 1 create ars to their downstream dams according to the characteristics of the series system the calculation method above is applied to the entire cascade reservoir system to calculate the total risk probability σp as shown in eq 7 7 p p m p n p k or ar o r m o r n o r k p m i m n p m i m n i m n k p n i n k where pm pn and pk are the risk probabilities of dams m n and k in the cascade reservoir system respectively and orm orn and ork are the ors of the dams respectively 3 3 calculation of or based on bayesian network according to the division of the cascade reservoir system above the or of cascade dam refers to the risk probability without considering the effect of upstream dam break flood which can be calculated based on the traditional dam risk calculation methods in fact the or is the basis for calculating ar which should be estimated first mathematical models commonly used for dam risk probability calculation include event trees fault trees and bns li et al 2019 peng and zhang 2012 wu et al 2020 in view of the great uncertainty of the risk of cascade reservoir group dams the selected risk probability calculation model needs to solve two basic problems one is to meet the needs of uncertainty analysis of the occurrence possibility and combination mode of disaster causing factors the other is to reflect the correlation between disaster causing factors and risk events as well as their impact on dam break therefore an or calculation model based on bn is constructed for reference 3 3 1 bayesian network a bn also known as a belief network is a directed acyclic graph that expresses and calculates the probability relationship between random variables li et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 the bayesian formula and total probability formula are the theoretical bases of the bn as shown in eqs 8 and 9 8 p b a p a b p b p a 9 p a i p a b i p b i where p b is the a priori probability of event b without considering any other factors li et al 2019 peng and zhang 2012 p b a is the probability of event b under the condition that event a has occurred also known as a posteriori probability p a b is the likelihood ratioand i is the number of events the operation result of a bn is the joint probability distribution of all variables in the studied problem which is the probability value under the influence of all factors for example the joint probability distribution of the simple bayesian network in fig 3 is as follows 10 p a b c p c a b p a b p c a b p a p b according to the risk identification results and the action relationship of risk factors of the cascade reservoir system in section 2 1 the bn model for or calculation of cascade reservoir dam is constructed as shown in fig 4 the probability calculation formula of node dam break is shown in eq 11 11 p o l d p d o l p o l p d o l p o p l where o l and d represent the nodes overtopping landslide of dam slope and dam break respectively p o l d and p o l are joint probabilities p d o l are the conditional probabilities 3 3 2 determination of node probability value the a priori probability of natural flood is generally determined by hydrological statistics based on the measured data cai et al 2019 larruari and lall 2020 lin and chen 2018 according to the flood scale this node in fig 4 is divided into several state intervals as below design flood between design flood and check flood and beyond check flood to facilitate the setting of node states in bn for subsequent analysis and calculation each state corresponds to an a priori probability similarly the node state of strong earthquake is set as occurred and not occurred according to the earthquake intensity data the probability of exceeding this earthquake intensity in a reference period is taken as the a priori probability li and liang 2016 in addition to the nodes mentioned above other nodes were all determined the corresponding conditional probability the numerical simulation was also based on the mc method the landslide risk events in fig 4 include landslide of reservoir bank and landslide of dam slope of which the parent nodes are natural flood and strong earthquake natural floods of different scales will form different reservoir levels the slope safety factors under various conditions are calculated respectively considering the variation characteristics of materials the pseudo static method li and liang 2016 is used to simulate the impact of seismic load on reservoir bank landslide and dam slope instability thereafter the critical slip surface corresponding to the minimum safety factor is searched based on the simplified bishop method and the optimization method mahdi and merabtene 2010 in order to obtain different safety factor k which combines the action of reservoir water level earthquake and material parameters when the dam body forms stable seepage at a certain water level the circular arc sliding slice and calculation formula for calculating k by simplified bishop method are shown in fig 5 and eq 12 12 k w v sec α u b sec α tan φ c b sec α 1 1 tan α tan φ k w v sin α mc r where w is the weight of the soil strip kn v is the vertical seismic inertia force kn μ is the pore pressure acting on the ground of the soil strip kn m c and φ are the cohesion kpa and internal friction angle of the bottom surface of the soil strip respectively and mc is the moment of horizontal seismic inertia force to the center of the circle kn m previous studies have shown that the cohesion φ and friction coefficient tan φ usually follow an extreme value type i distribution and lognormal distribution chen et al 2012 li and liang 2016 by substituting the parameter distribution of each variable into eq 12 the random distribution of the safety factor k is calculated and thereafter the conditional probability of landslide of reservoir bank and landslide of dam slope are obtained by counting the times that k is less than the allowable value the reservoir bank landslide near the upstream of the dam will easily lead to surge in front of the dam resulting in overtopping therefore the occurrence of overtopping under the combination of natural flood and reservoir bank landslide is closely related to the surge height and the original reservoir water level the calculation of the water inflow velocity of a landslide mass is the basis for estimating its surge height which is effectively solved by the formula recommended by the american society of civil engineers cao et al 2011 13 v 2 g h 1 cot α tan φ cl mg sin α the equations proposed by pan jiazheng were used for the surge propagation attenuation analysis and climbing calculation of landslide mass li and liang 2016 as shown in eqs 14 and 15 respectively 14 η 0 h 1 17 0 00189 β v gh 15 η x η 0 π n 1 3 5 n 1 k cos θ n k n 1 ln 1 n b x 0 l 2 1 x 0 x 0 l 1 n b x 0 l 2 1 where η 0 is the initial surge height formed after the landslide mass enters the water m h is the distance from the center of gravity of the landslide mass to the water surface m β is the water inflow angle ηx is the surge height formed by the landslide on the reservoir bank in front of the dam m k is the wave reflection coefficient k 1 l is the length of the landslide along the river bank m and b is the average width of the reservoir water surface m x 0 is the distance from the calculation point to the landslide m and θ is the inclination angle tan θ n x 0 nb according to the parameter distribution of the variables in the equations above a random distribution of ηx is obtained by the mc simulation method by superposing ηx with the reservoir water level formed by natural flood the random distribution of surge elevation in front of the dam is obtained and then the frequency at which it exceeds the dam crest elevation is taken as the value of conditional probability of overtopping it is undeniable that the age of the dam and climate change will also affect the probability of dam risk the former is reflected in the change in material parameters and properties li et al 2019 and the latter is reflected in the changes of external factors such as flood event recurrence larruari and lall 2020 according to the division concept of this study these factors mainly cause changes in their or therefore the basic concept and model proposed in this study are still suitable for analyzing the risk calculation under age and climate change although the specific calculation is more complex likewise the risk events that impact a dam that weaken its structure but do not cause a full dam break will increase its or which indirectly leads to an increase in the total risk probability in summary the flow of the calculation of dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs is shown in fig 6 4 results 4 1 project overview dadu river is one of the important tributaries in the upper reaches of the yangtze river a total of 24 cascade reservoirs are planned to be built in the main stream with a total storage capacity of more than 16 5 billion m3 a drop of 2750 m and an installed capacity of 25000 mw cai et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 xiaerga shuangjiangkou and pubugou are the leading reservoirs of the planned river reach and the controlling reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches respectively geological disasters are mainly landslides and debris flows historically several geological disasters have blocked this river chen et al 2018 five cascade reservoirs connected to xiaerxia bala dawei busigou and shuangjiangkou in the upper reaches of the basin were selected as the objects of study for the dam risk probability calculation their geographical locations and the parameter datas of the cascade reservoirs are shown in fig 7 and table 1 respectively 4 2 calculation of or taking the concrete face rockfill dam of shuangjiangkou reservoir as an example its or of a single reservoir is calculated according to the hydrological data li and liang 2016 the natural flood node in fig 4 is divided into three states below design flood a between design flood and check flood b and beyond check flood c and the corresponding a priori probabilities are 0 999 0 0009 and 0 0001 respectively the basic earthquake intensity in the dam site area is vii and the peak acceleration of bedrock with an exceedance probability of 2 in 100 years of the design reference period is a 0 2 g that is the prior probability of strong earthquakes above this intensity is 0 02 a landslide mass was set on the reservoir bank 3 km upstream from the dam site and the soil parameters were determined in a previous study li and liang 2016 the statistics of the material index parameters are listed in table 2 according to the method for determining the node probability value in section 3 3 2 above the most dangerous slip arc surface of rock and soil mass under the corresponding reservoir water level is determined using slope software thereafter 10 000 mc random simulations were programmed using matlab to calculate the conditional probability value of the corresponding node after input into the bn in fig 4 the probability value of each cascade reservoir risk event and its or were deduced as shown in tables 3 and 4 the calculation process was realized by genie a software specially used for bn modeling and calculation li et al 2019 4 3 determination of ic according to the comparison of the storage capacity of the five cascade reservoirs in table 1 it can be inferred that if the xiaerga reservoir dam breaks the dam break flood will cause overtopping in the four downstream reservoirs so the corresponding ics can be directly taken as 1 for other cascade dams the ics are calculated one by one according to the method described in section 3 1 two dam break scenarios were selected as examples in which the reservoir water level conditions were set to the normal pool levels scenario i was set as the dam of dawei reservoir breaks alone after dam break simulation and flood regulation routing it is concluded that the maximum water level in front of the busigou dam is approximately 2614 m indicating that this dam break scenario will lead to overtopping in busigou reservoir similarly scenario ii was set to reflect the successive break of bosigou caused by the dawei dam break under the normal pool level thereafter the successive flood is simulated and the water level in front of the dam formed in shuangjiangkou reservoir is about 2504 2 m indicating that the successive failure flood under this scenario will not lead to overtopping in the shuangjiangkou reservoir the corresponding hydrograph of the dam break flood is shown in fig 8 the previous research shows that the water level in front of the dam during the operation period of the reservoir generally follows the normal distribution and is mostly below the normal pool level li and liang 2016 if the detailed distribution of the water level can be obtained by measurement the result will be more reliable it was set that the water levels in front of the dam during the operation period of the dawei pusigou and shuangjiangkou reservoirs follow the normal distribution of 2685 0 8 2599 1 1 and 2498 1 8 respectively the former in brackets referred to the mean and the latter was the standard deviation respectively 10 000 groups of reservoir water level combinations were sampled in matlab and all possible dam break floods for each of the five reservoirs were considered dam break flood simulation and flood regulation routing were carried out to obtain the random distribution of water level in front of the downstream cascade dam after superimposing the upstream dam break flood as shown in fig 9 by repeating the above process the overtopping times under different dam break scenarios can be obtained and the corresponding ics can be determined because the difference in storage capacity of the middle three cascades in this project case is not obvious there are many dam break scenarios with ics of 0 or 1 the sampling simulation and calculation results of the ics are shown in table 5 4 4 calculation of dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs combined with the calculation results of or and i of the cascade reservoir dams under each dam break scenario the ar and the risk probabilities of the cascade reservoir dams under the risk transmission and superposition effect are calculated according to eq 6 accordingly the total risk the cascade reservoirs can be calculated using eq 7 the results are presented in table 6 and fig 10 5 discussion it can be seen from table 6 that the ors of xiaerga reservoir and shuangjiangkou reservoir are less than those of the other three reservoirs this is because they have a larger storage capacity and the space for flood storage and detention is relatively sufficient in addition according to the current reservoir classification standards of china ge et al 2020a both belong to the large 1 type with higher corresponding fortification standards and stronger ability to resist extraordinary floods and earthquakes in this paper it is assumed that the dam will break in the case of overtopping or landslides which may cause the risk calculation results to be slightly higher than the actual value it does not affect the analysis and comparison of the final results because the same mathematical model and method were used in the calculation in engineering practice the management department often resolves the risk in time through operation scheduling and emergency management measures so as to avoid the occurrence of dam breaks it can be seen from table 6 and fig 10 that the or of the dawei reservoir dam is the highest among the five cascade reservoirs so the dawei reservoir is the weakest cascade that may trigger the failure of the cascade reservoir system which requires special attention the or of the xiaerga reservoir dam is relatively lower but it will directly lead to the successive break of four cascade reservoirs downstream once it breaks and shuangjiangkou reservoir can effectively intercept and weaken the upstream dam break flood to a certain extent and its ar is significantly reduced compared with the upstream cascade which indicates that the risk is blocked and prevented further amplification in this cascade therefore both reservoirs belong to the controlling cascades which determine the risk level of the entire system zhou et al 2018 although risks to the dawei reservoir and busigou reservoir are not the largest they will break under the action of upstream dam break flood further amplifying the risk and transmitting it downstream which belong to the general cascades of the system according to the concept proposed in this study the ar is the product of the dam risk of the upstream cascade and its ics therefore there are two ways to reduce the ar of cascade reservoir dams one is to reduce the upstream controlling cascade risk by means of risk elimination and reinforcement and the other is to reduce the ic by increasing the emergency storage capacity of the targeted cascade in the construction and management of engineering practice the system risk should be reasonably designed based on the risk analysis and calculation results for an incomplete project the interaction among the cascades in the basin needs to be fully considered and the position of the controlling cascade should be reasonably arranged with the reserved risk emergency storage capacity what needs to be addressed is not only the full utilization of water resources but also the reasonable control of system risk for the built projects the or of each cascade dam and the ar transmitted from the upstream cascade should be scientifically evaluated and the dam safety in particular the weakest cascade dam should be ensured by reinforcement measures and strengthening monitoring the risk analysis and calculation model proposed in this study considers the combination of various working conditions during the long term operation of the reservoir dam which makes the risk calculation and evaluation results more reasonable and reliable or and ar are used to divide the risk probability of cascade reservoir dam and the degree of risk transmission and superposition between adjacent cascades is expressed by the value of influence coefficient ic which makes the risk analysis and calculation process clearer and more intuitive more importantly this treatment realizes an effective connection with the traditional risk probability calculation method for a single reservoir in addition the landslide dam formed by the landslide blocking the river can be regarded as natural earth rock dam cao et al 2011 and thus the risk probability calculation model in this study is also suitable for analyzing and evaluating the risk of landslide dams in downstream reservoirs 6 conclusions owing to the transmission and superposition effect of dam risk the traditional dam risk calculation methods for a single reservoir cannot meet the needs of risk management in cascade reservoirs in this study the risk of cascade dam was divided based on the risk analysis the degree of risk transfer and superposition effect was defined as the ic which was quantified in combination with uncertainty analysis dam break simulation and flood routing considering the uncertainty of natural floods earthquake intensity soil parameters and reservoir water level a bn model for calculating the or of cascade reservoir dams was constructed thereafter a method for calculating the ar and the the dam risk probability of cascade reservoirs was proposed in the case analysis all possible water level combinations and successive break scenarios were considered of which two dam break scenarios under a normal pool level were discussed as examples in detail this study aims to provide a new idea for the risk analysis and calculation of cascade reservoirs limited by the simulation model and the hydrology earthquake and soil parameter data in this study it will be further improved upon and

3421,as an important indicator of pollutant transport and dispersion conditions in lakes the water exchange capacity of large shallow lakes has always been a focus in research on lake hydrodynamic and water environment poyang lake is a large shallow lake and also the largest freshwater lake in china which is being given prominent environmental and ecological status poyang lake s hydrological situation fluctuates dramatically and the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of its water exchange capacity are complicated in this paper water age was selected to describe the water exchange capacity of poyang lake and a water age model of poyang lake was established with the water age model the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of water age of poyang lake were studied and the law of response of the water age to the evolution of river lake relationship between yangtze river and poyang lake and the proposed poyang lake water conservancy hub was analyzed the results showed that 1 the water age of poyang lake demonstrates significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity that is the water age in summer and autumn is obviously higher than that in winter and spring and the water age in the disc shaped lake and lake bay area is obviously higher than that in the main river channel and beach 2 the water stage at hukou and catchment inflow are the main factors affecting the water age of poyang lake and the influence of the water stage at hukou on the water age of poyang lake is greater than that of the catchment inflow and the higher water stage at hukou the higher the water age of poyang lake while the higher the catchment inflow the lower the water age of poyang lake 3 after 2003 the water age of poyang lake decreases with the evolution of river lake relationship and the most significant decrease happens in autumn 4 the proposed poyang lake water conservancy hub may increase the water age of poyang lake to some extent while it alleviates the problem of low water in poyang lake this study can provide a scientific base for the water environment management of poyang lake and provide a reference for research on water exchange capacity of other large shallow lakes keywords water age poyang lake river lake relationship evolution law 1 introduction transport time scale of water is a key hydrodynamic parameter of lakes which can demonstrate water exchange characteristics jay and musiak 1994 li et al 2011 ni et al 2020 the time scale of physical exchange of water in lake is also important for understanding the fate of pollutants and eutrophication lucas et al 2009 gao et al 2018 li et al 2020a with economic development and human activities more and more lakes are threatened by water pollution and eutrophication bechmannet al 2005 meinikmann et al 2015 bhagowati and ahamad 2019 wang et al 2019 lin et al 2021 some studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between physical exchange process and eutrophication especially for large shallow lakes in which the geological heterogeneity of lake water exchange capacity is great and the distributions of nutrients chlorophyll and other substances dependent on water exchange capacity also shows some geological heterogeneity for example in some lake bay areas with poor water exchange capacity nutrients and chlorophyll are more likely to accumulate increasing the risk of eutrophication in these areas liu et al 2012 merel et al 2013 gao et al 2018 therefore the study of water exchange capacity is a key research component to reveal the hydrodynamic and environmental characteristics of large shallow lakes and has attracted great attention in recent years flushing time turnover time and water age are the indicators that are often used to estimate water exchange capacity li et al 2010 brauwere et al 2011 shen et al 2011 viero and defina 2016 either flushing time or turnover time only reflects the situation of the whole lake but ignores the spatial difference thus not suitable for the investigation into the pollutant transport of the whole lake therefore water age is a better choice which is defined as the time that has elapsed since the particle under consideration left the region in which its age is prescribed as zero delhez et al 1999 deleersnijder et al 2001 the higher the water age the less intense the exchange between the water body and the outside environment which may lead to worse hydrodynamic condition of the water body and vice versa karna et al 2015 li et al 2011 bolin and rodhe 1973 proposed the idea of studying water age from a kinetic perspective and delhez and deleersnijder 2002 proposed a general theory of mean water age of soluble matter in 2002 and applied it to the study on the geological distribution of mean water age in the english channel and the southern north sea because of its spatial and temporal significance water age has gained extensive attention and been widely applied in recent years gong et al 2009 ren et al 2014 wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 pinilla et al 2020 these studies show that water age is a very effective means to research the temporal and spatial characteristics of lake water exchange capacity huang et al 2016 poyang lake is a typical large shallow lake and it is of great significance to study its water exchange capacity characteristics as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake is of great ecological importance to china and even the world hu et al 2007 feng et al 2013 xu et al 2020 as an internationally important wetland poyang lake has rich wetland vegetation and is home to a variety of migratory birds which makes it the largest bird sanctuary in the world mu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 due to the compound effect of hydraulic interaction between yangtze river and poyang lake and poyang lake catchment inflow there are remarkable seasonal variations in water stage and water area of poyang lake which bring about significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity of hydrodynamic characteristics in summer as it is in flood season the catchment inflow of poyang lake basin is large and the supporting effect of yangtze river on poyang lake is obvious and thus the water stage is high the slope of the lake area is small and most of the lake area is flooded showing obvious characteristics of lakes huang et al 2017a wu et al 2021 by contrast in winter the water stage is low most of the beaches are exposed and only the main channels have water showing obvious characteristics of rivers therefore a suitable indicator is needed for the characterization of the remarkable geological and temporal heterogeneities of transport time scale in poyang lake some studies have been carried out on the water age of poyang lake tang et al 2015 showed through numerical simulation that the water discharge from poyang lake cannot be smooth due to backflow effect of yangtze river which increases the water age of poyang lake qi et al 2016 analyzed the intra annual and inter annual variations of water age at hukou through simulation and qualitatively analyzed the correlation between water age and water quality zhang et al 2018 studied the seasonal variation of water age at hukou and the effect of backflow on water age in the lake area the research on water age of poyang lake still has two shortcomings first previous research on the spatial heterogeneity of water age in the lake area is not deep enough and mostly focuses on the temporal variation of water age at hukou and the research on water age in the lake area is mostly qualitative description second quantitative research on the factors influencing water age in poyang lake is absent and the influence law of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on water age is not clear yet in addition due to the evolution of meteorological conditions in the basin and the operation of three gorges project that began in 2003 the water stage of poyang lake during the dry season has declined and the water area has decreased in order to alleviate the drought problem the poyang lake water conservancy hub is proposed wang et al 2015 which is a sluice project as a result the hydrodynamic characteristics of poyang lake have been changed since 2003 and new changes may occur in the future in order to meet the needs of flood control irrigation and power generation many lakes around the world have built water conservancy projects liu et al 2017 such as chaohu sluice constructed for lake chaohu peng et al 2021 taipu sluice constructed for lake taihu yao et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the construction of sluice not only plays an important role in the utilization of lake water resources but also significantly changes the hydrodynamic conditions such as water level and velocity of the lake however how they affect the spatiotemporal characteristics of water age and pollutant transport need to be further studied therefore the following questions remain to be answered a what are the characteristics of spatial distribution of water age b what are the influencing factors of water age and the influence laws and c what are the differences between water age distributions before and after 2003 and what are the possible impacts of poyang lake water conservancy hub on water age in the future in this paper poyang lake a typical large shallow lake was taken as the example to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of water exchange capacity in large shallow lakes by introducing the concept of water age and its main influencing factors and the effect law were analyzed a two dimensional environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model was used to simulate water age in this study and ten simulation scenarios based on the model were established specifically the spatiotemporal traits of water age were researched and the laws of influence of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on water age were explored finally the differences between water age distributions before and after 2003 and possible impacts of poyang lake water conservancy hub on water age were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as one of the only two large lakes connected to the yangtze river in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river poyang lake is located at 115 49 116 46 e and 28 24 29 46 n in the north of jiangxi province its geographical position is shown in fig 1 located in middle and low latitude poyang lake belongs to east asian monsoon area with abundant rainfall and the multi year average precipitation of 1323 mm 1836 mm the precipitation is unevenly distributed within the year mainly concentrated from april to june accounting for 44 5 49 3 of the annual precipitation the water system of poyang lake is mainly composed of five major rivers ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river raohe river and xiushui river the five rivers converge into poyang lake and then flow into yangtze river through hukou the total length of poyang lake is 173 km in north south direction the average width is 17 km in east west direction and the total length of the complex and variable lake shoreline is 1200 km there are a lot of lake bay areas in the west and northeast the micro topography is intricate and complex distributing various forms of disc shaped lakes deep troughs and continental beaches li et al 2020b under the unique topography of the lake area and the influence of the complex river lake relationship which refers to the hydrodynamic relationship between poyang lake and yangtze river mainly reflected in the water stage at the mouth of poyang lake the spatial and temporal differentiation of hydrology and water quality in the lake area is outstanding which intuitively shows that it is a lake when water stage is high and a river when water stage is low liu et al 2020 plp is an open sluice located at laoyemiao of poyang lake see fig 1 the sluice can regulate the water stage of poyang lake and the regulation mode is as follows the regulation period is from september of every year to march of the following year the sluice is fully open in all other months when poyang lake freely communicates with the yangtze river poyang lake basin and flow velocity show obvious geological heterogeneity and previous studies mostly divide poyang lake into inlet waterway area in the north and main lake area in the south by songmen mountain but the geological heterogeneity in the main lake area is still great thus this division can hardly reflect the spatial characteristics of poyang lake zhang et al 2014 to effectively analyze the spatial characteristics of water age in poyang lake area poyang lake is divided into 6 divisions in this paper fig 1 according to the incoming water of five rivers combined with the basin morphology and distribution of protected areas division vi is the southern area which receives the incoming water of fuhe river and xinjiang river west tributary and mainly reflects the influence of the incoming water of fuhe river and xinjiang river west tributary on the water age of poyang lake the area is mainly estuarine delta but there are lake bay areas with an high water age and a risk of eutrophication division iv is the eastern lake area which receives water from raohe river and the east tributary of xinjiang river and the north of the area is a typical lake bay area with an old water age division v is the central lake area which receives water from the north tributary middle tributary and south tributary of ganjiang river with a lot of disc shaped lakes and beaches as well as poyang lake nanji mountain wetland national nature reserve division ii is the western lake area which receives water from the west tributary of ganjiang river and xiushui river most of which is disc shaped lakes with a high water age such as banghu lake it s also home to poyang lake national nature reserve division iii is the northeastern lake area which receives water from five rivers except ganjiang river west tributary and xiushui river division i is the waterway zone into yangtze river which receives water from all the five rivers and is mainly river type water body with a high flow rate 2 2 model description efdc environmental fluid dynamics code is an open source integrated surface water simulation model that has been widely used for hydrodynamic sediment and water quality simulation of various water bodies such as rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands estuaries and offshore areas huang et al 2017b kim et al 2017 luo and li 2018 chen et al 2020 in this paper a two dimensional hydrodynamic model of poyang lake was constructed based on efdc in the early stage huang et al 2017a and the model settings are as follows a grid division the model adopts a uniform grid of 180 m 180 m and the total number of grids is 93410 b boundary location and hydrodynamic condition settings the inlet boundary of the model is in six places xiushui river ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river le an river and changjiang river and the hydrodynamic conditions are actual flow data the outlet boundary is at hukou and the hydrodynamic conditions are actual water stage data from hukou hydrometric station meteorological data such as air pressure temperature rainfall and evaporation and wind field data such as wind speed and wind direction were obtained from poyang national meteorological station the calibration and validation of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model were completed by comparing the simulated values of water stage flow and water surface area with the actual measured values and the details are shown in the authors previous published paper huang et al 2017a in the previous published papers the data from four water stage stations of xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan were used to validate the model s simulation effect for water stage and the average relative error for the four water stage stations was 1 31 2 85 the data from hukou hydrometric station were used to validate the simulation effect for flow and the average relative error was 9 87 the model s simulation effect for water surface area was validated by comparing the simulated water surface areas in typical dates in high medium and low water periods with remote sensing image data and the relative errors were 1 59 5 37 and 11 15 respectively therefore the model after calibration and validation can accurately reflect the hydrodynamic process in poyang lake the water age model of poyang lake is constructed on the basis of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model of poyang lake the average water age theory of soluble substances established by deleernijder et al firstly defines the concentration of a substance in the water body as c and its two dimensional control equation is as follows 1 c t u c x v c y x k h c x y k h c y where c is the concentration of a substance in the water body x and y denote spatial coordinates t denotes time u and v denote the flow velocity in x y direction respectively kh denotes the horizontal diffusion coefficient next the weighted water age product β is defined and its control equation is 2 β t c u β x v β y x k h β x y k h β y where β is the weighted water age product and other symbols have the same meaning as above finally the weighted water age product β is divided by the concentration c to obtain the average water age a 3 a β c where a is the average concentration of a substance in the water body and other symbols have the same meaning as above the water age model of poyang lake was set as follows a initial and boundary conditions of substance concentration the substance concentration is 1 at the inlet boundary and the initial concentration of the whole model calculation area is zero b initial and boundary conditions of water age concentration the water age concentration at the inlet boundary is zero and the initial concentration of the whole model calculation area is also zero according to the calculation formula of water age water age is derived from hydrodynamic indicators such as flow velocity and diffusion coefficient delhez et al 1999 deleersnijder et al 2001 different from the monitorable hydrodynamic indicators such as flow velocity water age is difficult to monitor since there is no monitored water age value the water age model generally cannot be directly calibrated or validated fortunately the water age model can be indirectly calibrated and validated by calibrating and validating the hydrodynamic model that is after rigorous calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model the water age model based on the hydrodynamic model can be considered accurate and reliable zhang et al 2016 qi et al 2016 gao et al 2018 therefore the two dimensional water age model of poyang lake established in this paper is credible since it is based on the two dimensional hydrodynamic model of poyang lake that has been rigorously calibrated and validated 2 3 setting of computational scenarios the scenario analysis method is one of effective methods of studying hydrological characteristics of basins caseri et al 2016 based on the constructed water age model of poyang lake 10 working conditions were simulated with the scenario analysis method to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of water age of poyang lake the influencing factors and the law of response to the evolution of river lake relationship and the water conservancy hub of poyang lake for the working condition settings refer to table 1 the upper boundary of the model is the basin flow into the lake and the lower boundary is the water stage at hukou a analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics of water age in poyang lake the water age of poyang lake under multi year average hydrological conditions is more universal than that in typical years the inlet flow and outlet water stage under multi year average hydrological condition adopt multi year average data from 2003 to 2016 see working condition s1 in table 1 b the factors and laws influencing the water age of poyang lake the possible influencing factors of water age of poyang lake are basin inlet flow water stage at hukou wind field and temperature field but the existing research has shown that wind field and temperature field have less influence on the hydrodynamics of poyang lake zhang et al 2018 and their influence on the water age of poyang lake can be ignored therefore this paper only studies the influence of basin inlet flow and water stage at hukou on the water age the variation range of daily catchment inflow in poyang lake from 2003 to 2016 is 422 45 820 m3 s and the variation range of water stage at hukou is 4 7 19 5 m in this variation range the working conditions of increased inflow decreased inflow average inflow increased water stage decreased water stage and average water stage based on working condition s1 are set respectively see working conditions s1 to s7 in table 1 through the comparison of these seven working conditions the influence of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on the water age of poyang lake can be quantified c the response of water age of poyang lake to the evolution of river lake relationship as the river lake relationship underwent significant changes after 2003 the evolution of river lake relationship is represented by multi year average from 1956 to 2002 and multi year average from 2003 to 2016 see working conditions s1 and s8 in table 1 d the response of the water age of poyang lake to the poyang lake water conservancy hub the impact of poyang lake water conservancy hub on the water stage of poyang lake in typical low water year 2006 is greater than that in typical median water year and high water year wang et al 2015 in order to analyze the possible maximum impact of the water conservancy hub on the water age of poyang lake the water ages of poyang lake with and without the water conservancy hub in a typical low water year were simulated and analyzed see working condition s9 and working condition s10 in table 1 among them the lower boundary of the model without the water conservancy hub is the water stage at hukou in 2006 and the lower boundary of the model with the hub is the dispatching water stage at the sluice site multi year average meteorological data from 2003 to 2016 multi year average data from 1956 to 2002 and data in 2006 of poyang meteorological station are respectively used in working conditions s1 s2 s8 and s9 s10 2 4 geostatistical analysis method basing on the principle of geostatistical analysis the semi variogram function of water age in different seasons and annual average conditions of poyang lake is calculated to quantitatively analyze the spatial heterogeneity of water age the semi variogram function is as follows 4 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where γ h is the semi variogram value h is the spatial distance of samples n h is the number of samples z xi and z xi h is the sample value at space point xi and xi h respectively 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of water age the calculation results of working condition s1 showed that the annual average water age of poyang lake estuary i e hukou is 16d the monthly average water age varies significantly within the year the variation interval is 9d 32d the maximum value occurs in august the minimum value occurs in april and the maximum value is 3 5 times of the minimum value standard deviation and coefficient of variation of monthly water age are 8 and 0 5 respectively which indicates a medium variation the monthly water age value is shown in fig 2 the water age of poyang lake shows obvious seasonal fluctuation the seasonal water age value is shown in fig 3 the average water ages in spring summer autumn and winter are 10d 23d 22d and 11d respectively the water ages of the estuary in summer and autumn are obviously higher than those in winter and spring the connotation of water age and calculation formula showed that water age is closely related to the hydrodynamic state such as flow rate of water body in summer the rainfall in the poyang lake basin is abundant and the flow of the five rivers into the lake is higher but the backwater effect of yangtze river on poyang lake is also stronger in this period the combined effect of those leads to a gentle slope of poyang lake water surface the insufficient exchange capacity of the water body of the whole poyang lake and a higher water age at hukou in autumn the inlet flow decreases and the backwater effect of yangtze river on poyang lake still exists so that the water surface slope of poyang lake is still gentle and the water age at hukou is higher in winter the inlet flow is relatively small but at this time poyang lake shows obvious river characteristics and the water stage of poyang lake is pulled down by the low water stage of yangtze river so that the water surface slope of poyang lake is greater and the water body exchange capacity is stronger and the water age at hukou is lower in spring the water surface slope of poyang lake keeps great and the water age at hukou is lower the geological distribution of water age in poyang lake area in typical dates in spring summer autumn and winter is shown in fig 4 from the figure the water age in poyang lake area has obvious geological heterogeneity in different seasons and the geological distribution pattern of water age is similar in different seasons the water age of disc shaped lakes and lake bay areas is obviously higher than that of main river channels 1 in spring the water age of division i is obviously lower than those of other divisions the disc shaped lakes of division ii are partially or completely detached from the river at this time and the hydraulic connection between them is weak resulting in a higher water age in the disc shaped lake areas with a maximum approximate to 280d the hydrodynamic exchange between division iii and the main river channels is intense and thus the water age value is lower but slightly higher than that of division i the water age in the northern lake bay area of division iv is significantly higher than that of the southern area and the exchange between water body in this area and surrounding water bodies is more difficult with a maximum approximate to 300d which is also one of the reasons for the high concentration of algae in this area the southwest area of division v has a large number of disc shaped lakes similar to division ii these disc shaped lakes have a weak hydraulic connection with the main river channel and thus have a higher water age while the beaches in the northwest area communicates with the main river channel thus showing a higher water age in the southwest and a lower water age in the northeast the southern lake crossing water body of division vi has not been exchanged or renewed for a long time and thus has a higher water age while the rest of the area communicating with the main river channel has a lower water age 2 in summer due to the backwater effect of the main stream of yangtze river the flow velocity of the whole poyang lake slows down and the water age at hukou is much higher than that in spring while the heterogeneity of water age in the lake area is much smaller than that in spring at this time the whole poyang lake is in the lake phase and there are hydraulic connections between water bodies in each division especially the disc shaped lake areas which mostly communicate with the main river channel therefore the geological distribution pattern of water age between divisions is similar to that in spring but the relative heterogeneity is smaller than that in spring 3 in autumn similar to summer the water age of poyang lake estuary is higher in autumn but the disc shaped lakes start to detach from the main river channel gradually and the geological heterogeneity of water age starts to increase 4 in winter similar to spring the flow velocity of the main channel of poyang lake is higher and the water age of hukou is lower while the water ages of the disc shaped lakes are higher and the geological heterogeneity of water age is greater than those in summer and autumn in order to quantify the geological distribution of water age in poyang lake the average annual water age values of different divisions are counted and shown in fig 5 1 the average annual water age of division i is the smallest only 22d 2 division ii is the division with the highest water age 128d due to the disc shaped lakes covering most of its area such as banghu lake and dahuchi lake 3 division iii keeps a good hydraulic communication with the main river most of the time so its water age is only higher than that of division i 4 divisions iv and v are more similar comprising both disc shaped lakes and beaches or lake bays and beaches the water ages of disc shaped lakes and lake bays are higher while the water ages of beaches are lower resulting in a medium water age in the whole division 5 division vi is mainly composed of lake bays and thus has a relatively higher water age in addition the water ages of divisions ii iv and v are more dispersed than those of other divisions due to the large difference between water ages of disc shaped lakes lake bays and beaches semi variation functions of annual and seasonal average water age of poyang lake are analyzed and shown in table 2 the fitting model of annual average water age is exponential and the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 94 the semi variogram value namely sill value is up to 2047d and the range of influence is 47 700 m which indicates that the spatial heterogeneity of annual average water age of poyang lake is strong from the point of the season the sill values in spring and winter are significantly higher than those in summer and autumn indicating that the spatial heterogeneity of water age in spring and winter is stronger the reason for this phenomenon is that water levels of poyang lake are low in spring and winter and the hydraulic connection between the disc shaped lake and the main channel flow is weak which results in that the water age of the disc shaped lake is much larger than that of the main channel flow 3 2 major influencing factors of water age generally speaking the factors affecting the water age of the lake are mainly upstream and downstream boundaries temperature and wind fields for poyang lake the effect of upstream and downstream boundary conditions on hydrodynamics in the lake is obviously larger than that of temperature or wind field as a typical large shallow lake poyang lake s vertical distribution of water temperature is in line with mixed distribution rather than layered distribution xu and ouyang 1989 li et al 2017 therefore water temperature affects but does not dominate water age in poyang lake the lake current in poyang lake is dominated by inertia flow and wind field has some effect on flow field but the effect is quite limited yao et al 2019 therefore water temperature is not a major influencing factor of water age in poyang lake though it has some effect on the water age the main influencing factors of water age of poyang lake are basin inlet and water stage at hukou as the only outflow of poyang lake hukou receives the incoming water of five rivers in the basin which can reflect the overall water age of poyang lake to reveal the influence law of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on the overall water age of poyang lake in this paper the water age of hukou under different catchment inflow and water stage at hukou were compared and analyzed according to the simulation results from working conditions s1 to s7 the effects of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on the monthly average water age at hukou are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively from the figures it can be seen that when the catchment inflow increases by 20 the slope of water surface of poyang lake increases and the monthly average water age at hukou decreases and the annual average value decreases by 1 2d or 7 when the catchment inflow decreases by 20 the slope of water surface of poyang lake decreases and the flow of water body decreases the average age of water in each month at hukou increases and the annual average value increases by 2 8d or 17 when the water stage of hukou increases by 20 the backwater effect of yangtze river to poyang lake is obviously strengthened and the ability of water exchange outward of poyang lake is greatly weakened the annual average value of water age of hukou is increased by 9 7d or 59 when the water stage of hukou is decreased by 20 the annual average value of water age of hukou is decreased by 5 6d or 34 when the catchment inflow takes a fixed value throughout the year the water age at hukou still shows obvious seasonal variation and the water age at hukou is mainly influenced by the water stage at hukou at this time and the water stage at hukou peaks in july which leads to the change of peak time of the water age of hukou from august to july when the water stage of hukou takes a fixed value throughout the year the month over month difference in the water age at hukou becomes significantly smaller and the intra year fluctuation of water age weakens significantly in conclusion the influence of the water stage at hukou on the water age of poyang lake is greater than that of the catchment inflow the higher the water stage at hukou the higher the water age of poyang lake while the for the higher the catchment inflow the lower the water age of poyang lake the main reason for the dramatic fluctuation of the water age of poyang lake is the intra annual variation of the water stage at hukou 4 discussions 4 1 response of water age to changes in river lake relationship after 2003 the scheduling of the three gorges reservoir and other controlled projects in the upper reaches of the yangtze river affected the intra annual distribution of the flow of the yangtze river main stream coupled with the effects of river undercutting in the yangtze river main stream the runoff and water stage of yichang and hankou hydrometric stations on the yangtze river main stream were subject to a tendency of decrease wu et al 2019 the decreasing water stage of yangtze river main stream weakened its backwater effect on poyang lake and the water stage at hukou decreased obviously and the river lake relationship between poyang lake and yangtze river evolved obviously the comparison of multi year average monthly water stage at hukou from 1956 to 2002 and 2003 2016 is shown in fig 8 from the figure the water stage decreases from april to december in 2003 2016 among which the maximum decrease in october is 2 2 m while the water stage at hukou increases slightly from january to march due to the recharge effect of the yangtze river main stream compared with 1956 2002 the change of catchment inflow of poyang lake from 2003 to 2016 is not obvious and the overall trend is decreasing among which the catchment inflow decreases in most months such as april and increases in fewer months such as january fig 8 the influence of river lake relationship and catchment inflow evolution on the water age of poyang lake was analyzed according to the simulation results of working conditions s1 and s8 fig 9 from the previous analysis the decrease in water stage at hukou can lead to the decrease in water age of poyang lake while the decrease in catchment inflow can lead to the increase in water age of poyang lake in addition the influence of water stage evolution at hukou on water age is greater than that of catchment inflow compared with 1956 2002 the intra year distribution characteristics of water age in poyang lake does not change in 2003 2016 under the influence of both the decline of water stage at hukou and catchment inflow but the water age decreases and the water exchange capacity of poyang lake is enhanced among which the water age decreases most obviously in autumn with a decrease of 12 4d while decreases 2 3 2 4d in spring summer and winter 4 2 response of water age to poyang lake water conservancy hub to cope with the problems such as low water of poyang lake the poyang lake water conservancy hub was proposed the construction of a water conservancy hub often has multifaceted and complex impacts on lake reservoirs zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 while solving the problem of low water the possible impacts on the water age water quality and ecology of poyang lake brought by the poyang lake water conservancy hub deserve attention and study wang et al 2015 according to the simulation results of working conditions s9 and s10 the comparison of the average monthly water age at the sluice site with and without the hub in typical low water year is shown in fig 10 from the figure the water conservancy hub of poyang lake increases the water age of poyang lake to some extent and the average monthly water age at the sluice site increases by 0 3d 8 4d from september of every year to march of the following year among which the most obvious increase falls in october the comparison of the monthly average water stages at the sluice site with and without the water conservancy hub is shown in fig 11 from the figure the monthly average water stage at the sluice site with the water conservancy hub increases by 1 0 6 8 m from september of every year to march of the following year compared with the time without the water conservancy hub and the water stage at the sluice site is obviously improved and the problem of low water of poyang lake is relieved the months when the problem of low water in poyang lake is most serious are september october and november and the months when water stage regulation at the sluice site by poyang lake water conservancy hub is most significant are also these three months correspondingly the most influential months of water age in poyang lake by poyang lake water conservancy hub are also these three months the poyang lake hub will change the outflow conditions of poyang lake raises the water stage reduces the flow velocity increases the water age and weakens the water exchange capacity of poyang lake 5 conclusions as a typical large shallow lake poyang lake has significant geological and temporal heterogeneities in water age poyang lake is a complex floodplain system where rapid water exchange and slow water exchange coexist and the water ages in the disc shaped lakes and lake bay areas are obviously higher than that in the main river channel in this paper the lake was divided into six divisions and the water age varies obviously from division to division among which the water age in division i is the lowest and that in division ii is the oldest the water age of poyang lake demonstrates obvious seasonal characteristics and the average water ages at hukou in spring summer autumn and winter are 10d 23d 22d and 11d respectively and the water ages in summer and autumn are obviously higher than those in winter and spring the main influencing factors of the water age of poyang lake are the water stage at hukou and the catchment inflow the water stage at hukou is the dominant factor influencing the water age of poyang lake the decrease of the water stage at hukou can lead to the decrease of the water age of poyang lake while the decrease of the catchment inflow can increase the water age the intra year fluctuation of the water stage at hukou can lead to the intra year fluctuation of the water age of poyang lake the evolution of river lake relationship in recent decades has led to the decrease of water age in poyang lake after 2003 with the evolution of the river lake relationship the water stage at hukou decreased and the thus water age of poyang lake decreased with a decrease of 12 4d in autumn the poyang lake water conservancy hub will increase the water age of poyang lake to a certain extent while it alleviates the problem of low water in this paper a two dimensional water age model of poyang lake was constructed and the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of the water age of poyang lake were quantitatively studied with the scenario analysis method and the law of response of water age to the evolution of river lake relationship and poyang lake water conservancy hub was analyzed in the future the relationship between water age nutrient migration and transformation and spatial and temporal distribution of eutrophication in poyang lake will be an important part of the study on the evolution of water environment in poyang lake under changing

3421,as an important indicator of pollutant transport and dispersion conditions in lakes the water exchange capacity of large shallow lakes has always been a focus in research on lake hydrodynamic and water environment poyang lake is a large shallow lake and also the largest freshwater lake in china which is being given prominent environmental and ecological status poyang lake s hydrological situation fluctuates dramatically and the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of its water exchange capacity are complicated in this paper water age was selected to describe the water exchange capacity of poyang lake and a water age model of poyang lake was established with the water age model the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of water age of poyang lake were studied and the law of response of the water age to the evolution of river lake relationship between yangtze river and poyang lake and the proposed poyang lake water conservancy hub was analyzed the results showed that 1 the water age of poyang lake demonstrates significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity that is the water age in summer and autumn is obviously higher than that in winter and spring and the water age in the disc shaped lake and lake bay area is obviously higher than that in the main river channel and beach 2 the water stage at hukou and catchment inflow are the main factors affecting the water age of poyang lake and the influence of the water stage at hukou on the water age of poyang lake is greater than that of the catchment inflow and the higher water stage at hukou the higher the water age of poyang lake while the higher the catchment inflow the lower the water age of poyang lake 3 after 2003 the water age of poyang lake decreases with the evolution of river lake relationship and the most significant decrease happens in autumn 4 the proposed poyang lake water conservancy hub may increase the water age of poyang lake to some extent while it alleviates the problem of low water in poyang lake this study can provide a scientific base for the water environment management of poyang lake and provide a reference for research on water exchange capacity of other large shallow lakes keywords water age poyang lake river lake relationship evolution law 1 introduction transport time scale of water is a key hydrodynamic parameter of lakes which can demonstrate water exchange characteristics jay and musiak 1994 li et al 2011 ni et al 2020 the time scale of physical exchange of water in lake is also important for understanding the fate of pollutants and eutrophication lucas et al 2009 gao et al 2018 li et al 2020a with economic development and human activities more and more lakes are threatened by water pollution and eutrophication bechmannet al 2005 meinikmann et al 2015 bhagowati and ahamad 2019 wang et al 2019 lin et al 2021 some studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between physical exchange process and eutrophication especially for large shallow lakes in which the geological heterogeneity of lake water exchange capacity is great and the distributions of nutrients chlorophyll and other substances dependent on water exchange capacity also shows some geological heterogeneity for example in some lake bay areas with poor water exchange capacity nutrients and chlorophyll are more likely to accumulate increasing the risk of eutrophication in these areas liu et al 2012 merel et al 2013 gao et al 2018 therefore the study of water exchange capacity is a key research component to reveal the hydrodynamic and environmental characteristics of large shallow lakes and has attracted great attention in recent years flushing time turnover time and water age are the indicators that are often used to estimate water exchange capacity li et al 2010 brauwere et al 2011 shen et al 2011 viero and defina 2016 either flushing time or turnover time only reflects the situation of the whole lake but ignores the spatial difference thus not suitable for the investigation into the pollutant transport of the whole lake therefore water age is a better choice which is defined as the time that has elapsed since the particle under consideration left the region in which its age is prescribed as zero delhez et al 1999 deleersnijder et al 2001 the higher the water age the less intense the exchange between the water body and the outside environment which may lead to worse hydrodynamic condition of the water body and vice versa karna et al 2015 li et al 2011 bolin and rodhe 1973 proposed the idea of studying water age from a kinetic perspective and delhez and deleersnijder 2002 proposed a general theory of mean water age of soluble matter in 2002 and applied it to the study on the geological distribution of mean water age in the english channel and the southern north sea because of its spatial and temporal significance water age has gained extensive attention and been widely applied in recent years gong et al 2009 ren et al 2014 wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 pinilla et al 2020 these studies show that water age is a very effective means to research the temporal and spatial characteristics of lake water exchange capacity huang et al 2016 poyang lake is a typical large shallow lake and it is of great significance to study its water exchange capacity characteristics as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake is of great ecological importance to china and even the world hu et al 2007 feng et al 2013 xu et al 2020 as an internationally important wetland poyang lake has rich wetland vegetation and is home to a variety of migratory birds which makes it the largest bird sanctuary in the world mu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 due to the compound effect of hydraulic interaction between yangtze river and poyang lake and poyang lake catchment inflow there are remarkable seasonal variations in water stage and water area of poyang lake which bring about significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity of hydrodynamic characteristics in summer as it is in flood season the catchment inflow of poyang lake basin is large and the supporting effect of yangtze river on poyang lake is obvious and thus the water stage is high the slope of the lake area is small and most of the lake area is flooded showing obvious characteristics of lakes huang et al 2017a wu et al 2021 by contrast in winter the water stage is low most of the beaches are exposed and only the main channels have water showing obvious characteristics of rivers therefore a suitable indicator is needed for the characterization of the remarkable geological and temporal heterogeneities of transport time scale in poyang lake some studies have been carried out on the water age of poyang lake tang et al 2015 showed through numerical simulation that the water discharge from poyang lake cannot be smooth due to backflow effect of yangtze river which increases the water age of poyang lake qi et al 2016 analyzed the intra annual and inter annual variations of water age at hukou through simulation and qualitatively analyzed the correlation between water age and water quality zhang et al 2018 studied the seasonal variation of water age at hukou and the effect of backflow on water age in the lake area the research on water age of poyang lake still has two shortcomings first previous research on the spatial heterogeneity of water age in the lake area is not deep enough and mostly focuses on the temporal variation of water age at hukou and the research on water age in the lake area is mostly qualitative description second quantitative research on the factors influencing water age in poyang lake is absent and the influence law of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on water age is not clear yet in addition due to the evolution of meteorological conditions in the basin and the operation of three gorges project that began in 2003 the water stage of poyang lake during the dry season has declined and the water area has decreased in order to alleviate the drought problem the poyang lake water conservancy hub is proposed wang et al 2015 which is a sluice project as a result the hydrodynamic characteristics of poyang lake have been changed since 2003 and new changes may occur in the future in order to meet the needs of flood control irrigation and power generation many lakes around the world have built water conservancy projects liu et al 2017 such as chaohu sluice constructed for lake chaohu peng et al 2021 taipu sluice constructed for lake taihu yao et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the construction of sluice not only plays an important role in the utilization of lake water resources but also significantly changes the hydrodynamic conditions such as water level and velocity of the lake however how they affect the spatiotemporal characteristics of water age and pollutant transport need to be further studied therefore the following questions remain to be answered a what are the characteristics of spatial distribution of water age b what are the influencing factors of water age and the influence laws and c what are the differences between water age distributions before and after 2003 and what are the possible impacts of poyang lake water conservancy hub on water age in the future in this paper poyang lake a typical large shallow lake was taken as the example to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of water exchange capacity in large shallow lakes by introducing the concept of water age and its main influencing factors and the effect law were analyzed a two dimensional environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model was used to simulate water age in this study and ten simulation scenarios based on the model were established specifically the spatiotemporal traits of water age were researched and the laws of influence of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on water age were explored finally the differences between water age distributions before and after 2003 and possible impacts of poyang lake water conservancy hub on water age were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as one of the only two large lakes connected to the yangtze river in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river poyang lake is located at 115 49 116 46 e and 28 24 29 46 n in the north of jiangxi province its geographical position is shown in fig 1 located in middle and low latitude poyang lake belongs to east asian monsoon area with abundant rainfall and the multi year average precipitation of 1323 mm 1836 mm the precipitation is unevenly distributed within the year mainly concentrated from april to june accounting for 44 5 49 3 of the annual precipitation the water system of poyang lake is mainly composed of five major rivers ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river raohe river and xiushui river the five rivers converge into poyang lake and then flow into yangtze river through hukou the total length of poyang lake is 173 km in north south direction the average width is 17 km in east west direction and the total length of the complex and variable lake shoreline is 1200 km there are a lot of lake bay areas in the west and northeast the micro topography is intricate and complex distributing various forms of disc shaped lakes deep troughs and continental beaches li et al 2020b under the unique topography of the lake area and the influence of the complex river lake relationship which refers to the hydrodynamic relationship between poyang lake and yangtze river mainly reflected in the water stage at the mouth of poyang lake the spatial and temporal differentiation of hydrology and water quality in the lake area is outstanding which intuitively shows that it is a lake when water stage is high and a river when water stage is low liu et al 2020 plp is an open sluice located at laoyemiao of poyang lake see fig 1 the sluice can regulate the water stage of poyang lake and the regulation mode is as follows the regulation period is from september of every year to march of the following year the sluice is fully open in all other months when poyang lake freely communicates with the yangtze river poyang lake basin and flow velocity show obvious geological heterogeneity and previous studies mostly divide poyang lake into inlet waterway area in the north and main lake area in the south by songmen mountain but the geological heterogeneity in the main lake area is still great thus this division can hardly reflect the spatial characteristics of poyang lake zhang et al 2014 to effectively analyze the spatial characteristics of water age in poyang lake area poyang lake is divided into 6 divisions in this paper fig 1 according to the incoming water of five rivers combined with the basin morphology and distribution of protected areas division vi is the southern area which receives the incoming water of fuhe river and xinjiang river west tributary and mainly reflects the influence of the incoming water of fuhe river and xinjiang river west tributary on the water age of poyang lake the area is mainly estuarine delta but there are lake bay areas with an high water age and a risk of eutrophication division iv is the eastern lake area which receives water from raohe river and the east tributary of xinjiang river and the north of the area is a typical lake bay area with an old water age division v is the central lake area which receives water from the north tributary middle tributary and south tributary of ganjiang river with a lot of disc shaped lakes and beaches as well as poyang lake nanji mountain wetland national nature reserve division ii is the western lake area which receives water from the west tributary of ganjiang river and xiushui river most of which is disc shaped lakes with a high water age such as banghu lake it s also home to poyang lake national nature reserve division iii is the northeastern lake area which receives water from five rivers except ganjiang river west tributary and xiushui river division i is the waterway zone into yangtze river which receives water from all the five rivers and is mainly river type water body with a high flow rate 2 2 model description efdc environmental fluid dynamics code is an open source integrated surface water simulation model that has been widely used for hydrodynamic sediment and water quality simulation of various water bodies such as rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands estuaries and offshore areas huang et al 2017b kim et al 2017 luo and li 2018 chen et al 2020 in this paper a two dimensional hydrodynamic model of poyang lake was constructed based on efdc in the early stage huang et al 2017a and the model settings are as follows a grid division the model adopts a uniform grid of 180 m 180 m and the total number of grids is 93410 b boundary location and hydrodynamic condition settings the inlet boundary of the model is in six places xiushui river ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river le an river and changjiang river and the hydrodynamic conditions are actual flow data the outlet boundary is at hukou and the hydrodynamic conditions are actual water stage data from hukou hydrometric station meteorological data such as air pressure temperature rainfall and evaporation and wind field data such as wind speed and wind direction were obtained from poyang national meteorological station the calibration and validation of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model were completed by comparing the simulated values of water stage flow and water surface area with the actual measured values and the details are shown in the authors previous published paper huang et al 2017a in the previous published papers the data from four water stage stations of xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan were used to validate the model s simulation effect for water stage and the average relative error for the four water stage stations was 1 31 2 85 the data from hukou hydrometric station were used to validate the simulation effect for flow and the average relative error was 9 87 the model s simulation effect for water surface area was validated by comparing the simulated water surface areas in typical dates in high medium and low water periods with remote sensing image data and the relative errors were 1 59 5 37 and 11 15 respectively therefore the model after calibration and validation can accurately reflect the hydrodynamic process in poyang lake the water age model of poyang lake is constructed on the basis of the two dimensional hydrodynamic model of poyang lake the average water age theory of soluble substances established by deleernijder et al firstly defines the concentration of a substance in the water body as c and its two dimensional control equation is as follows 1 c t u c x v c y x k h c x y k h c y where c is the concentration of a substance in the water body x and y denote spatial coordinates t denotes time u and v denote the flow velocity in x y direction respectively kh denotes the horizontal diffusion coefficient next the weighted water age product β is defined and its control equation is 2 β t c u β x v β y x k h β x y k h β y where β is the weighted water age product and other symbols have the same meaning as above finally the weighted water age product β is divided by the concentration c to obtain the average water age a 3 a β c where a is the average concentration of a substance in the water body and other symbols have the same meaning as above the water age model of poyang lake was set as follows a initial and boundary conditions of substance concentration the substance concentration is 1 at the inlet boundary and the initial concentration of the whole model calculation area is zero b initial and boundary conditions of water age concentration the water age concentration at the inlet boundary is zero and the initial concentration of the whole model calculation area is also zero according to the calculation formula of water age water age is derived from hydrodynamic indicators such as flow velocity and diffusion coefficient delhez et al 1999 deleersnijder et al 2001 different from the monitorable hydrodynamic indicators such as flow velocity water age is difficult to monitor since there is no monitored water age value the water age model generally cannot be directly calibrated or validated fortunately the water age model can be indirectly calibrated and validated by calibrating and validating the hydrodynamic model that is after rigorous calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model the water age model based on the hydrodynamic model can be considered accurate and reliable zhang et al 2016 qi et al 2016 gao et al 2018 therefore the two dimensional water age model of poyang lake established in this paper is credible since it is based on the two dimensional hydrodynamic model of poyang lake that has been rigorously calibrated and validated 2 3 setting of computational scenarios the scenario analysis method is one of effective methods of studying hydrological characteristics of basins caseri et al 2016 based on the constructed water age model of poyang lake 10 working conditions were simulated with the scenario analysis method to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of water age of poyang lake the influencing factors and the law of response to the evolution of river lake relationship and the water conservancy hub of poyang lake for the working condition settings refer to table 1 the upper boundary of the model is the basin flow into the lake and the lower boundary is the water stage at hukou a analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics of water age in poyang lake the water age of poyang lake under multi year average hydrological conditions is more universal than that in typical years the inlet flow and outlet water stage under multi year average hydrological condition adopt multi year average data from 2003 to 2016 see working condition s1 in table 1 b the factors and laws influencing the water age of poyang lake the possible influencing factors of water age of poyang lake are basin inlet flow water stage at hukou wind field and temperature field but the existing research has shown that wind field and temperature field have less influence on the hydrodynamics of poyang lake zhang et al 2018 and their influence on the water age of poyang lake can be ignored therefore this paper only studies the influence of basin inlet flow and water stage at hukou on the water age the variation range of daily catchment inflow in poyang lake from 2003 to 2016 is 422 45 820 m3 s and the variation range of water stage at hukou is 4 7 19 5 m in this variation range the working conditions of increased inflow decreased inflow average inflow increased water stage decreased water stage and average water stage based on working condition s1 are set respectively see working conditions s1 to s7 in table 1 through the comparison of these seven working conditions the influence of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on the water age of poyang lake can be quantified c the response of water age of poyang lake to the evolution of river lake relationship as the river lake relationship underwent significant changes after 2003 the evolution of river lake relationship is represented by multi year average from 1956 to 2002 and multi year average from 2003 to 2016 see working conditions s1 and s8 in table 1 d the response of the water age of poyang lake to the poyang lake water conservancy hub the impact of poyang lake water conservancy hub on the water stage of poyang lake in typical low water year 2006 is greater than that in typical median water year and high water year wang et al 2015 in order to analyze the possible maximum impact of the water conservancy hub on the water age of poyang lake the water ages of poyang lake with and without the water conservancy hub in a typical low water year were simulated and analyzed see working condition s9 and working condition s10 in table 1 among them the lower boundary of the model without the water conservancy hub is the water stage at hukou in 2006 and the lower boundary of the model with the hub is the dispatching water stage at the sluice site multi year average meteorological data from 2003 to 2016 multi year average data from 1956 to 2002 and data in 2006 of poyang meteorological station are respectively used in working conditions s1 s2 s8 and s9 s10 2 4 geostatistical analysis method basing on the principle of geostatistical analysis the semi variogram function of water age in different seasons and annual average conditions of poyang lake is calculated to quantitatively analyze the spatial heterogeneity of water age the semi variogram function is as follows 4 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where γ h is the semi variogram value h is the spatial distance of samples n h is the number of samples z xi and z xi h is the sample value at space point xi and xi h respectively 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of water age the calculation results of working condition s1 showed that the annual average water age of poyang lake estuary i e hukou is 16d the monthly average water age varies significantly within the year the variation interval is 9d 32d the maximum value occurs in august the minimum value occurs in april and the maximum value is 3 5 times of the minimum value standard deviation and coefficient of variation of monthly water age are 8 and 0 5 respectively which indicates a medium variation the monthly water age value is shown in fig 2 the water age of poyang lake shows obvious seasonal fluctuation the seasonal water age value is shown in fig 3 the average water ages in spring summer autumn and winter are 10d 23d 22d and 11d respectively the water ages of the estuary in summer and autumn are obviously higher than those in winter and spring the connotation of water age and calculation formula showed that water age is closely related to the hydrodynamic state such as flow rate of water body in summer the rainfall in the poyang lake basin is abundant and the flow of the five rivers into the lake is higher but the backwater effect of yangtze river on poyang lake is also stronger in this period the combined effect of those leads to a gentle slope of poyang lake water surface the insufficient exchange capacity of the water body of the whole poyang lake and a higher water age at hukou in autumn the inlet flow decreases and the backwater effect of yangtze river on poyang lake still exists so that the water surface slope of poyang lake is still gentle and the water age at hukou is higher in winter the inlet flow is relatively small but at this time poyang lake shows obvious river characteristics and the water stage of poyang lake is pulled down by the low water stage of yangtze river so that the water surface slope of poyang lake is greater and the water body exchange capacity is stronger and the water age at hukou is lower in spring the water surface slope of poyang lake keeps great and the water age at hukou is lower the geological distribution of water age in poyang lake area in typical dates in spring summer autumn and winter is shown in fig 4 from the figure the water age in poyang lake area has obvious geological heterogeneity in different seasons and the geological distribution pattern of water age is similar in different seasons the water age of disc shaped lakes and lake bay areas is obviously higher than that of main river channels 1 in spring the water age of division i is obviously lower than those of other divisions the disc shaped lakes of division ii are partially or completely detached from the river at this time and the hydraulic connection between them is weak resulting in a higher water age in the disc shaped lake areas with a maximum approximate to 280d the hydrodynamic exchange between division iii and the main river channels is intense and thus the water age value is lower but slightly higher than that of division i the water age in the northern lake bay area of division iv is significantly higher than that of the southern area and the exchange between water body in this area and surrounding water bodies is more difficult with a maximum approximate to 300d which is also one of the reasons for the high concentration of algae in this area the southwest area of division v has a large number of disc shaped lakes similar to division ii these disc shaped lakes have a weak hydraulic connection with the main river channel and thus have a higher water age while the beaches in the northwest area communicates with the main river channel thus showing a higher water age in the southwest and a lower water age in the northeast the southern lake crossing water body of division vi has not been exchanged or renewed for a long time and thus has a higher water age while the rest of the area communicating with the main river channel has a lower water age 2 in summer due to the backwater effect of the main stream of yangtze river the flow velocity of the whole poyang lake slows down and the water age at hukou is much higher than that in spring while the heterogeneity of water age in the lake area is much smaller than that in spring at this time the whole poyang lake is in the lake phase and there are hydraulic connections between water bodies in each division especially the disc shaped lake areas which mostly communicate with the main river channel therefore the geological distribution pattern of water age between divisions is similar to that in spring but the relative heterogeneity is smaller than that in spring 3 in autumn similar to summer the water age of poyang lake estuary is higher in autumn but the disc shaped lakes start to detach from the main river channel gradually and the geological heterogeneity of water age starts to increase 4 in winter similar to spring the flow velocity of the main channel of poyang lake is higher and the water age of hukou is lower while the water ages of the disc shaped lakes are higher and the geological heterogeneity of water age is greater than those in summer and autumn in order to quantify the geological distribution of water age in poyang lake the average annual water age values of different divisions are counted and shown in fig 5 1 the average annual water age of division i is the smallest only 22d 2 division ii is the division with the highest water age 128d due to the disc shaped lakes covering most of its area such as banghu lake and dahuchi lake 3 division iii keeps a good hydraulic communication with the main river most of the time so its water age is only higher than that of division i 4 divisions iv and v are more similar comprising both disc shaped lakes and beaches or lake bays and beaches the water ages of disc shaped lakes and lake bays are higher while the water ages of beaches are lower resulting in a medium water age in the whole division 5 division vi is mainly composed of lake bays and thus has a relatively higher water age in addition the water ages of divisions ii iv and v are more dispersed than those of other divisions due to the large difference between water ages of disc shaped lakes lake bays and beaches semi variation functions of annual and seasonal average water age of poyang lake are analyzed and shown in table 2 the fitting model of annual average water age is exponential and the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 94 the semi variogram value namely sill value is up to 2047d and the range of influence is 47 700 m which indicates that the spatial heterogeneity of annual average water age of poyang lake is strong from the point of the season the sill values in spring and winter are significantly higher than those in summer and autumn indicating that the spatial heterogeneity of water age in spring and winter is stronger the reason for this phenomenon is that water levels of poyang lake are low in spring and winter and the hydraulic connection between the disc shaped lake and the main channel flow is weak which results in that the water age of the disc shaped lake is much larger than that of the main channel flow 3 2 major influencing factors of water age generally speaking the factors affecting the water age of the lake are mainly upstream and downstream boundaries temperature and wind fields for poyang lake the effect of upstream and downstream boundary conditions on hydrodynamics in the lake is obviously larger than that of temperature or wind field as a typical large shallow lake poyang lake s vertical distribution of water temperature is in line with mixed distribution rather than layered distribution xu and ouyang 1989 li et al 2017 therefore water temperature affects but does not dominate water age in poyang lake the lake current in poyang lake is dominated by inertia flow and wind field has some effect on flow field but the effect is quite limited yao et al 2019 therefore water temperature is not a major influencing factor of water age in poyang lake though it has some effect on the water age the main influencing factors of water age of poyang lake are basin inlet and water stage at hukou as the only outflow of poyang lake hukou receives the incoming water of five rivers in the basin which can reflect the overall water age of poyang lake to reveal the influence law of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on the overall water age of poyang lake in this paper the water age of hukou under different catchment inflow and water stage at hukou were compared and analyzed according to the simulation results from working conditions s1 to s7 the effects of catchment inflow and water stage at hukou on the monthly average water age at hukou are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively from the figures it can be seen that when the catchment inflow increases by 20 the slope of water surface of poyang lake increases and the monthly average water age at hukou decreases and the annual average value decreases by 1 2d or 7 when the catchment inflow decreases by 20 the slope of water surface of poyang lake decreases and the flow of water body decreases the average age of water in each month at hukou increases and the annual average value increases by 2 8d or 17 when the water stage of hukou increases by 20 the backwater effect of yangtze river to poyang lake is obviously strengthened and the ability of water exchange outward of poyang lake is greatly weakened the annual average value of water age of hukou is increased by 9 7d or 59 when the water stage of hukou is decreased by 20 the annual average value of water age of hukou is decreased by 5 6d or 34 when the catchment inflow takes a fixed value throughout the year the water age at hukou still shows obvious seasonal variation and the water age at hukou is mainly influenced by the water stage at hukou at this time and the water stage at hukou peaks in july which leads to the change of peak time of the water age of hukou from august to july when the water stage of hukou takes a fixed value throughout the year the month over month difference in the water age at hukou becomes significantly smaller and the intra year fluctuation of water age weakens significantly in conclusion the influence of the water stage at hukou on the water age of poyang lake is greater than that of the catchment inflow the higher the water stage at hukou the higher the water age of poyang lake while the for the higher the catchment inflow the lower the water age of poyang lake the main reason for the dramatic fluctuation of the water age of poyang lake is the intra annual variation of the water stage at hukou 4 discussions 4 1 response of water age to changes in river lake relationship after 2003 the scheduling of the three gorges reservoir and other controlled projects in the upper reaches of the yangtze river affected the intra annual distribution of the flow of the yangtze river main stream coupled with the effects of river undercutting in the yangtze river main stream the runoff and water stage of yichang and hankou hydrometric stations on the yangtze river main stream were subject to a tendency of decrease wu et al 2019 the decreasing water stage of yangtze river main stream weakened its backwater effect on poyang lake and the water stage at hukou decreased obviously and the river lake relationship between poyang lake and yangtze river evolved obviously the comparison of multi year average monthly water stage at hukou from 1956 to 2002 and 2003 2016 is shown in fig 8 from the figure the water stage decreases from april to december in 2003 2016 among which the maximum decrease in october is 2 2 m while the water stage at hukou increases slightly from january to march due to the recharge effect of the yangtze river main stream compared with 1956 2002 the change of catchment inflow of poyang lake from 2003 to 2016 is not obvious and the overall trend is decreasing among which the catchment inflow decreases in most months such as april and increases in fewer months such as january fig 8 the influence of river lake relationship and catchment inflow evolution on the water age of poyang lake was analyzed according to the simulation results of working conditions s1 and s8 fig 9 from the previous analysis the decrease in water stage at hukou can lead to the decrease in water age of poyang lake while the decrease in catchment inflow can lead to the increase in water age of poyang lake in addition the influence of water stage evolution at hukou on water age is greater than that of catchment inflow compared with 1956 2002 the intra year distribution characteristics of water age in poyang lake does not change in 2003 2016 under the influence of both the decline of water stage at hukou and catchment inflow but the water age decreases and the water exchange capacity of poyang lake is enhanced among which the water age decreases most obviously in autumn with a decrease of 12 4d while decreases 2 3 2 4d in spring summer and winter 4 2 response of water age to poyang lake water conservancy hub to cope with the problems such as low water of poyang lake the poyang lake water conservancy hub was proposed the construction of a water conservancy hub often has multifaceted and complex impacts on lake reservoirs zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 while solving the problem of low water the possible impacts on the water age water quality and ecology of poyang lake brought by the poyang lake water conservancy hub deserve attention and study wang et al 2015 according to the simulation results of working conditions s9 and s10 the comparison of the average monthly water age at the sluice site with and without the hub in typical low water year is shown in fig 10 from the figure the water conservancy hub of poyang lake increases the water age of poyang lake to some extent and the average monthly water age at the sluice site increases by 0 3d 8 4d from september of every year to march of the following year among which the most obvious increase falls in october the comparison of the monthly average water stages at the sluice site with and without the water conservancy hub is shown in fig 11 from the figure the monthly average water stage at the sluice site with the water conservancy hub increases by 1 0 6 8 m from september of every year to march of the following year compared with the time without the water conservancy hub and the water stage at the sluice site is obviously improved and the problem of low water of poyang lake is relieved the months when the problem of low water in poyang lake is most serious are september october and november and the months when water stage regulation at the sluice site by poyang lake water conservancy hub is most significant are also these three months correspondingly the most influential months of water age in poyang lake by poyang lake water conservancy hub are also these three months the poyang lake hub will change the outflow conditions of poyang lake raises the water stage reduces the flow velocity increases the water age and weakens the water exchange capacity of poyang lake 5 conclusions as a typical large shallow lake poyang lake has significant geological and temporal heterogeneities in water age poyang lake is a complex floodplain system where rapid water exchange and slow water exchange coexist and the water ages in the disc shaped lakes and lake bay areas are obviously higher than that in the main river channel in this paper the lake was divided into six divisions and the water age varies obviously from division to division among which the water age in division i is the lowest and that in division ii is the oldest the water age of poyang lake demonstrates obvious seasonal characteristics and the average water ages at hukou in spring summer autumn and winter are 10d 23d 22d and 11d respectively and the water ages in summer and autumn are obviously higher than those in winter and spring the main influencing factors of the water age of poyang lake are the water stage at hukou and the catchment inflow the water stage at hukou is the dominant factor influencing the water age of poyang lake the decrease of the water stage at hukou can lead to the decrease of the water age of poyang lake while the decrease of the catchment inflow can increase the water age the intra year fluctuation of the water stage at hukou can lead to the intra year fluctuation of the water age of poyang lake the evolution of river lake relationship in recent decades has led to the decrease of water age in poyang lake after 2003 with the evolution of the river lake relationship the water stage at hukou decreased and the thus water age of poyang lake decreased with a decrease of 12 4d in autumn the poyang lake water conservancy hub will increase the water age of poyang lake to a certain extent while it alleviates the problem of low water in this paper a two dimensional water age model of poyang lake was constructed and the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of the water age of poyang lake were quantitatively studied with the scenario analysis method and the law of response of water age to the evolution of river lake relationship and poyang lake water conservancy hub was analyzed in the future the relationship between water age nutrient migration and transformation and spatial and temporal distribution of eutrophication in poyang lake will be an important part of the study on the evolution of water environment in poyang lake under changing

3422,the impacts of hydrological model components on performance and uncertainty of streamflow simulations are investigated using a multi model approach over 698 catchments in north america an ensemble of 180 different hydrological model structures is obtained by combining five snow models sm four potential evapotranspiration formulations pet three vertical vfs and three horizontal hfs flow rounting schemes this study aims to first compare the multiple component combinations of sm pet vfs and hfs in terms of their ability at simulating streamflows for ten köppen climate zones a secondary goal is to evaluate the contribution of each model component to the total variance of the streamflow response according to the model structure for three streamflow metrics representing mean high and low flows results indicate that there is no clear relationship between the structural and parametric complexity of the hydrological components and model performance for all three streamflow metrics there is no single model structure which performs best in all climate zones and for all streamflow metrics streamflow uncertainty generated by the 180 synthetic hydrological model structures depends primarily on the metrics under study but also on the climate zone the evapotranspiration formulation is only critical for the mean flow metric for the low flow criterion the vfs generates the most uncertainty and is therefore the most critical whereas for the high flow metric performance is mostly related to the hfs component and sm for nordic catchments a better understanding of how hydrological model components generate uncertainty for a given climate and streamflow metric will lead to more robust model structures and therefore reduce the uncertainty of hydrological simulations keywords model components structural uncertainty snow models pet methods horizontal and vertical flow routing schemes hydrological models north america 1 introduction hydrological models are essential tools for a broad spectrum of operational applications and scientific research purposes such as water resources planning decision support ruiz ortiz et al 2019 flood forecasting givati et al 2016 troin et al 2021a impact analysis of climate change on water resources shrestha et al 2017 rocha et al 2020 and hydrological processes understanding troin et al 2012 mockler et al 2016 however since the lumped hydrological models are by definition a simplification of the real world hydrological system through mathematical equations describing hydrological processes and interactions they inevitably contain some biases or errors that can lead to poor streamflow simulations or predictions over the last years much attention has been paid to uncertainty issues in hydrological modelling clark et al 2016 and in hydrological forecasting pappenberger and beven 2006 due to their potential impacts on operational decision making van griensven et al 2008 sudheer et al 2011 arsenault and brissette 2016a thielen and bruen 2019 uncertainty in hydrological modelling originates mainly from three sources 1 model inputs due to natural climate variability limitations in hydrometeorological observational dataset and lack of data consistency 2 model parameterization due to the difficulty in parameter estimation because of missing information and uncertainty in the calibration data imperfect process understanding approximations and 3 model structures referred to as model uncertainty or structural uncertainty resulting mainly from the conceptual representation and simplification of hydrological process structures lindenschmidt et al 2007 renard et al 2010 other uncertainties can be accounted for non stationary climate conditions changing climate conditions coming from the instability of model parameters due to the variability of both hydrological processes and catchment characteristics brigode et al 2013 when comparing the sources of uncertainty to each other structural uncertainty of the hydrological models remains an important issue for both stationary and non stationary climate conditions najafi et al 2011 poulin et al 2011 fu et al 2015 model uncertainty can be addressed by comparing the performance from various structures of hydrological model gupta et al 2012 the approach of using multiple models i e multi model with different structures to create ensemble simulations is well established in climate modelling najafi and moradkhani 2015 khan et al 2018 ahmed et al 2019 and is becoming more employed in the field of hydrology for both streamflow simulations velázquez et al 2013 arsenault et al 2015 li et al 2018 zaherpour et al 2018 krysanova et al 2020 troin et al 2021b and forecasts cloke and pappenberger 2009 velazquez et al 2011 the ensemble approach must be perceived as a pragmatic means of quantifying uncertainty and ultimately reducing the model structural uncertainty tyralla and schumann 2016 several studies have investigated the issues of model structure uncertainty on model performance and modelling uncertainty by using an ensemble of structurally different hydrological models georgakakos et al 2004 ajami et al 2007 chen et al 2012 lee et al 2020 knoben et al 2020 a systematic comparison of model complexity in terms of process description and spatial distribution is well documented in butts et al 2004 in yin et al 2018 three hydrological models embodying three different model structures and degrees of rainfall spatial distribution are compared by using a systematic calibration and validation procedure orth et al 2015 use hydrological models of increasing spatial complexity from lumped to distributed to investigate the trade off between model complexity and accuracy to determine the physical controls on extreme streamflow simulations some other studies compare multiple hydrological models with varying levels of spatial complexity over multiple catchments to investigate the model ability at integrating the available physical and meteorological data reed et al 2004 smith et al 2012 martel et al 2020 with respect to the simulation of streamflow at the catchment s outlet it remains unclear if distributed hydrological models provide significant improvement over lumped hydrological models while many studies have assessed the issue of model uncertainty in terms of representing hydrological processes or spatial variability few have examined the structural uncertainty of the hydrological models regarding their own model components typically a hydrological model depicts the hydrological cycle into two major divisions the first division is the land vegetation atmospheric phase of the hydrological cycle which controls the amount of water loading in the catchment this includes the collective evapotranspiration et term for all processes by which water becomes atmospheric water vapor usually a fraction of the potential et pet that could be achieved if water were available for et to take place and snow routine models sm when needed the second division is the water routine phase of the hydrological cycle which can be defined as the movement of water which enters into the soil profile through the channel network until the catchment s outlet this includes both the vertical flow routing schemes vfs between the surface and both the vadose and phreatic zones and the horizontal flow routing schemes hfs such as surface lateral subsurface and groundwater flow routing the way in which key processes are represented in the land vegetation atmospheric and water routing components introduces a great deal of uncertainty into the modelling system contributing to the full uncertainty of the model structure some studies have contributed to the assessment of the model structure uncertainty by independently investigating the uncertainty related to one or a few model components solely over a limited number of catchments pet computation methods birhanu et al 2018 explored the impacts of five hydrological models with twelve pet related computation methods temperature and radiation based of increasing complexity on average and extreme hydrological conditions over ten catchments the authors show that the complexity of the pet computation methods and the model structure did not improve model performance and robustness on the contrary the simplest pet estimation method might perform better if reliable input datasets are available furthermore the robustness of the pet methods seems to be more dependent of the hydrological conditions rather than their complexity there is a relatively large body of literature investigating the model structural uncertainty regarding the pet computation methods e g oudin et al 2005 oudin et al 2006 chen et al 2020 chia et al 2020 dallaire et al 2021 sms in recent years several attempts were made to estimate the uncertainty on snowmelt streamflows related to the type of the sms degree day versus mixed degree day energy balance included in the typical hydrological models troin et al 2015 used twenty one combinations of sm and model structure to evaluate the performance of such combinations at simulating historical snowmelt streamflows over a canadian catchment the authors conclude that the type of sm plays only a minor role compared to the choice of the model structure pet vfs hfs combined troin et al 2016 supported these previous results by using an ensemble of eight sms finding that both the degree day and mixed degree day energy balance sms provide comparable snow water equivalent projections at the catchment scale with a low level of uncertainty associated for three study catchments an additional sm sensitivity analysis study indicates that the complexity of the sms in terms of representation of snow accumulation and melting processes does not neccesary lead to an improved robustness of the hydrological model debele et al 2009 water routing schemes without separating vfs and hfs in previous work a 105 combination ensemble of sms pet computation methods and routing schemes of different structural complexity and type was compared regarding the ability of each combination at simulating historical streamflows over two catchments troin et al 2018 it was found that the water routing scheme contributes significantly to the total model uncertainty followed by the choice of the pet method and the sms in last position comparing multiple combinations of model components and showing how the ensemble affects streamflow simulations constitutes an important and final step forward the evaluation of the structural uncertainty of the hydrological model recent studies focusing on the analysis of structural uncertainty have highlighted that the multi model strategy is a skillful framework to characterize the uncertainty resulting from the hydrological model velasquez et al 2011 zappa et al 2011 troin et al 2021a to our knowledge the application of multi model strategy to the ensemble of the key hydrological model components such as sms pet methods and water routing schemes with separation of vfs and hfs has not been considered in any study to date this study aims at assessing multiple sm pet vfs hfs combinations for simulating streamflows by considering uncertainties from the sms degree day versus mixed degree day energy balance models the pet methods temperature based versus radiation based methods and the water routing schemes vertical versus horizontal specifically the three addressed issues are 1 is the structural uncertainty related to hydrological conditions i e mean high and low flows in other words does a model component provide greater uncertainty for a particular hydrological situation 2 does the uncertainty of the model component depend on climatic conditions 3 does the complexity of the sm pet vfs hfs modeling chain have an impact on the performance of the model if so is this significant an ensemble approach made up of 180 combinations of sm pet vfs hfs with different levels of component complexity is used to answer to the objectives of this study the multi model ensemble is implemented over a large sampling of 698 north american catchments covering ten köppen climate zones beck et al 2018 the evaluation is made over all the available observations by evaluating the discrepancies between the observed and simulated streamflows at the catchment scale for three flow metrics representative of mean high and low flows some implications for the hydrological studies to come is brought regarding the understanding and quantification of structural uncertainty which are both critical aspects to be considered in hydrological modelling in the following section the experimental design including the study area the datasets and the multi model ensemble approach are presented the relevant findings from the ensemble approach are analyzed in section 3 the associated uncertainty to each model component on the streamflow simulations is discussed in section 4 concluding remarks are provided in section 5 2 experimental design 2 1 study area the present study is performed on a set of 698 north american catchments selected from the canadian canopex arsenault et al 2016b and the united states mopex schaake et al 2006 model parameter estimation experiment databases the selected catchments are also part of a recent larger database of 14 425 catchments hysets arsenault et al 2020 these catchments are unregulated and have a drainage area varying between 104 and 127 631 km2 the selected catchments are distributed over the north american continent and are representative of ten köppen climate zones covering both canada and the united states fig 1 all selected catchments have at least 20 years of available data except for one catchment in a particular climate zone dsc where a catchment with 20 years is included to have at least four catchments per climate zone the köppen classification is employed for grouping climatically comparable catchments as the hydrological response is typically driven by climate forcings knoben et al 2018 the north american köppen climate classification zones are defined in table 1 a summary of the catchment distribution in the selected ten köppen climate groups is given in table 2 2 2 datasets two hydrometerological datasets are used as inputs the multiple model component combinations the canopex and the mopex databases the canopex database includes meteorological and hydrometric data as well as catchment boundaries and drainage area the catchment averaged meteorological datasets are provided for precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures taken from the natural resources canada nrcan gridded climate data product hutchinson et al 2009 hopkinson et al 2011 mckenney et al 2011 streamflow records as well as the metadata of the hydrometric stations are extracted from the environment and climate change canada eccc water survey canada wsc national water data archive hydat for further details of these data sources refer to arsenault et al 2016 the mopex database contains daily meteorological data such as precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures in addition to daily hydrometric time series and river basin characteristics the daily meteorological data is averaged at the catchment scale using weather station observations the streamflow data come from the us geological survey usgs see schaake et al 2006 for a detailed description of this dataset 2 3 the multi model ensemble framework to evaluate the structural uncertainty of the model components on the streamflow simulations the multi model ensemble is built based on multiple sm pet vfs hfs combinations all models selected for the purpose of the present study satisfy the following two conditions 1 they are commonly used in north america for hydrological modelling and climate change impact studies the present study region and 2 their structure is easily interchangeable allowing to easily build a large ensemble of synthetic hydrological models sm pet vfs hfs the multi model ensemble relies on all possible pairings of five sms with four pet computation methods and with three vfs and hfs each for a total number of 180 synthetic hydrological models a brief description of all components is given below and summarized in table 3 in the present study the selection of sms satisfies the following two points 1 sms in the two relevant types of snow modeling approaches for hydrological modeling purposes degree day and mixed degree day energy balance and 2 sms with various structures in each type of snow modeling approaches the more physically based snow models are not selected in this work because their implementation is difficult input data not available and generally little used in the traditional hydrological models the five sms are the standalone cemaneige cem valéry 2010 sm as well as the four sms derived from

horizontal hfs flow routing schemes are extracted from gr4j gr modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier perrin et al 2003 mohyse and hmets the structure of the three hydrological models is shown in fig 2 where the vfs and hfs separation is shown using a red line as mentioned earlier this leads to an ensemble of 180 synthetic hydrological models 5 4 3 3 180 generating 180 distinct streamflow simulations for each catchment 2 4 multi model calibration evaluation and uncertainty the multi model ensemble is implemented over the 698 catchments distributed over ten köppen climate zones for each sm pet vfs hfs combination the parameters are calibrated based on the first half of available daily observed streamflows minimum mean and maximum of 20 35 and 61 years respectively and the model performance is validated over the second half the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1994 optimization method is used to calibrate the parameters of the sm pet vfs hfs combinations based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 criterion the nse criterion is calculated to independently evaluate the relative performance of the component combinations at simulating daily streamflows performance of the sm pet vfs hfs combination is considered good if nse 0 65 satisfactory if 0 65 nse 0 5 and unsatisfactory if nse 0 5 partly based on moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 the structural uncertainty in the streamflow simulations is assessed by analyzing the effects of each model component sm versus pet versus vfs versus hfs by climate zone on three flow metrics the chosen metrics are representative of mean qm high qx1day and low qmin7 flows table 4 a variance decomposition method is used to isolate and compare the magnitude of each uncertainty source on the three flow metrics kendall et al 1977 von storch and zwiers 1999 this approach follows ferro 2004 déqué et al 2007 and roberts and snelgrove 2015 let xspvh be the simulated value of a given metric for sm s 1 5 pet method e 1 4 vfs v 1 3 and hfs h 1 3 the decomposition of the total variance v of xspvh can be expressed as 1 v x spvh s e v h s e s v s h e v

their independent contribution to variance the other terms represent the interaction terms for example the se term in equation 2 identifies the percentage of variance resulting from interactions between the snow model s and the potential evapotranspiration e a large variance associated to this interaction term means that the impact of one component s depends on the other e or in other words that they are not independent and interact with each other the variance components can be expressed in absolute e g in m3s 1 2 for flow metrics or in relative form in percentage the former is chosen as it allows for the comparison of catchments of different sizes and characteristics 3 results 3 1 evaluating the multi model ensemble at simulating streamflows in this work a hydrological model is defined as a combination of four components covering the main processes by which precipitation ultimately becomes streamflow at a catchment outlet the combination of four components therefore results in 180 distinct synthetic hydrological models even though many of them share common subsets of structural components before evaluating the relative contribution of each model component on the performance of the multi model ensemble the latter s ability at simulating streamflows is first analyzed over both the calibration and validation period the nse validation scores for the ensemble are important as poor validation nse values would limit the assessment of the model components relative performance on streamflow simulations the performance of the ensemble is first evaluated without an individual assessment of the model components and of a climate classification on streamflows over the 698 catchments fig 3 presents the nse calibration and validation scores for the full ensemble of 125640 values 180 combinations 698 catchments purple box plot as well as separated by each model component the boxplots represent key quantiles of the distribution of nse with the interquartile range represented by the central box 25th and 75th quantiles with the median 50th quantile as the central line the overall performance of the ensemble is found to be satisfactory over the study catchments over both the calibration median nse value of 0 66 fig 3a and validation median nse value of 0 62 fig 3b period the results indicate that the pet ensemble is similar across all four different formulations with close median nse values nse variation 0 02 over both the calibration and validation periods this suggests a minor impact of this component on the nse for the sm ensemble cemaneige cem provides a small but consistent performance increase compared to the other four sms for the calibration and validation periods it does not mean it is systematically the better sm but that on average the likelihood of obtaining a higher nse score is higher than for the others the interquartile ranges are similar across the sms and pet methods over the calibration and validation periods for the vfs and hfs components there are large differences in the interquatile ranges suggesting more robust vertical and horizontal flow formulations for ets and gr respectively these results show that the impact of vfs and hfs are more important than those of the sms or pet computation methods on the calibration and validation nse scores fig 4 presents the results in a similar format as fig 3 but for the three flow metrics the results strongly differ depending on the considered flow metric the range of bias is smallest for qm fig 4a and by far the largest for qmin7 fig 4c the smallest differences across the various model components are observed for qx1day fig 4b there are significant performance differences between the components for both qm and qmin7 the best specific formulation and variability of a component for a given flow metric may not be the same for another flow metric the gr vfs component for example generates a much larger uncertainty than the other two vfs structures but only for qm 3 2 performance of the multi model ensemble by climate zone this section evaluates the relationships between the performance of the multi model combinations and climate conditions while trying to bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the different hydrological model components the main interest is to understand to what extent climate conditions influence the optimal model structure and uncertainty related to model components to that end the performance of the ensemble at simulating streamflows is evaluated with respect to the four components for all ten climate zones table 1 the results are presented in figs 5 to 7 for the three flow metrics table 4 all evaluated over the validation period figs 5 to 7 follow the same format of fig 4 but the results are further decomposed by climate zone the number of points in each boxplot depends on the number of catchments in each climate zone see table 2 for example for the yellow boxplots in the upper plot of figs 5 to 7 for the snow models there are 252 data points corresponding to the 7 bsk catchments and 36 combinations of synthetic structures of hydrological model for each sm 1 sm 4 pet 3 vfs 3 hfs the results show that the performances of the sm pet vfs hfs combinations vary significantly between climate zones some sm pet vfs hfs combinations are better worse for some flow metrics and climate zones all sm pet vfs hfs combinations perform relatively poorly in the semi arid bsk climate zone the different sm pet vfs hfs combinations perform best in temperate and continental areas without a dry season e g cfa cfb dfa and dfc the importance of the sm which seems relatively low in figs 3 and 4 is now made clear for high flows fig 6 for the four coldest climate zones e g dsb dsc dfc and et it is also quite important for the low flows in the same climate zones fig 7 the simplest moh and most parameterized ets sms are the best performing ones for the two extreme flow metrics indicating that the complexity of the hydrological model is not necessarily an indicator of model performance the pet method has little impact on the high flow bias across all climate zones whereas its impact is clearly more significant for the mean and low flow biases and particularly so for the catchments located in the southern half of the united states e g cfa and cfb comparatively the relative performance of the vfs and hfs is relatively consistent across all climate zones and not much additional information can be extracted from figs 5 to 7 when compared to the aggregated fig 4 in order to better appreciate the seasonal differences between each climate zone an analysis is performed wherein one catchment from each climate zone is selected and mean annual hydrographs plotted supplementary figure s1 shows the results for the catchment that displays the best calibration nse value within each climate zone and figure s2 shows the same but for the catchment with the median calibration nse for each climate zone results show that the hydrological cycle is strongly dependent on the climate zone as expected but even more interestingly that the variance attributed to each component of the hydrological modelling process strongly depends on the climate zone and season for example for snowmelt dominated climate zones the snowmelt module accounts for most of the variability for almost half of the year after which other components become more important although to a lesser degree for the cfb and csb climate zones the seasonality plays a much smaller role this is in line with recent findings from mai et al 2022 where the relative sensitivity of hydrological model processes is shown to be highly dependent on the season climate zone and location of the investigated catchments over north america 3 3 structural uncertainty on streamflow simulations this section evaluates the uncertainties in streamflow simulations by analyzing the impacts of the four model components sm pet vfs and hfs by climate zone the main interest is to quantify the role of the four sources of uncertainty related to the structure of the hydrological model on the simulated streamflows and to explore the climate dependence of the component uncertainty the design of the present experiment allows the testing of a large ensemble of sm pet vfs hfs combinations over ten climate zones the 15 components of explained variance main effect and interactions are presented in table 5 for the three flow metrics qm qx1day and qmin7 by climate zone the results indicate contrasted differences between the model components across climate zones and flow metrics for qm most of the structural uncertainty is related to the pet e and vfs v components and by extension the interactions between both component ev interaction term the colder climate zones e g dfc and dfb and in particular the polar climate zone et differ from the others where the vfs v and hfs h components provide the highest uncertainty with a propagation of uncertainty in the interactions between these 2 components vh interaction term for qx1day the dominant source of uncertainty is attributed to the hfs h component and to the interactions with the vfs v component vh interaction term the results show that the sm component provides a significant level of uncertainty only for the colder climate zones the pet component contributes to the total structural uncertainty weakly whatever the climate zone for qmin7 and most climate zones the vfs v component provides the most level of uncertainty except for some colder climate zones where the hfs h component brings a large part of the uncertainty such as for the dfb zone where it is dominant the pet e component contributes slightly to the total structural uncertainty for qmin7 and mostly through its interaction with the vfs v component ev interaction term as expected the sm component plays a minor role in the total structural uncertainty of qmin7 overall the interaction terms are much smaller for the low flow metric compared to the other two metrics 4 discussion this work has provided insights regarding the contribution of each key model component to the total hydrologic uncertainty by using a combination of these components into 180 synthetic structures of the hydrological model this process is performed over a large sample of north america catchments and analysed for three flow metrics the main results outline the complexity of the process by which the model components interact and ultimately influence the performance of the hydrological model the uncertainty analysis nonetheless highlights the key processes related to each flow metric and climate zone as is discussed below 4 1 does the structural uncertainty relate to hydrological conditions the results highlight that the structural uncertainty of the hydrological model is strongly dependent on the hydrological conditions the critical pet component for the average hydrological conditions become irrelevant for extreme hydrological conditions where higher discreapancies in extreme flows are associated with the flow rounting schemes table 5 this implies that given the different synthetic hydrologiccal models used in this work no optimal structure or combination of model components can capture all hydrological conditions this corresponds to the fundamental idea that the ability of a hydrological model to deal with changing conditions is not to be taken for granted thirel et al 2015 as the model structure and or optimized calibration parameters under certain hydroclimatic conditions are not transferable in time coron et al 2012 in other words are the model structure robust and or flexible enough to be used under contrasted hydrological conditions in light of our results targeting a structure of a hydrological model for specific applications such as availability of water resources and hydrological risks floods and droughts should be preferred trying to develop a single model structure to account for all hydrological issues water availability and risks may be a compromise leading to sub optimal model performance when a single issue e g flood with a flow metric e g q1xday needs to be prioritized in that perspective the selection of the model structure seems to have a weak impact on the model performance in simulating mean streamflows onyutha 2016 whereas the choice of the model structure appears to be more critical for extreme events van kempen et al 2020 onyutha 2016 also indicates that the selection of the best model structure for extreme events may be influenced by the chosen criteria for extracting high and low flows which is in agreememt with the results of this study 4 2 does the uncertainty of the model component depend on climatic conditions structural uncertainty of the hydrological model is shown to be dependent on the climate zone but to a lesser extent than the flow metric the best performing components are typically the same across climate zones for a given flow metric but the range in performance varies significantly from one climate zone to the other figs 5 to 7 van kempen et al 2020 show that the impact of the model structure varies between the climate zones in cold and temperate climate zones the magnitude and timing of extreme flows are affected by different parameter sets and model components such as the pet method while the impact of the model structure on extreme flows is smaller in the arid and tropical climate zones lidén and harlin 2000 shows that catchments located under dry conditions are sensitive to the structure of the hydrological model especially for mean flows as also discussed by jones et al 2006 4 3 quantifying the impact of the complexity of the sm pet vfs hfs modeling chain on simulation performance this work is not about trying to identify the optimal model structure as no attempt is made at identifying the optimal component for each catchment in a specific climate zone however based on the distribution of component performance across the three flow metrics it is nonetheless possible to make some statements about the likelihood of a given hydrological model structure out performing another a first observation is that the component complexity as defined by its number of parameters or formulation does not lead to a higher performance and or better robustness across climate zones based on the validation nse scores fig 3 the most likely best performing sm is cemaneige followed by mohyse which both have the fewest number of parameters and by far the simplest structure is mohyse the combined degree day energy balance hydrotel model follows on the other hand for the vfs component the order of performance follows the number or parameters the order is reversed for the high flow metric qx1day in fig 4 even when sifting through the different climate zones figs 5 to 7 it is not possible to establish any patterns relating the component complexity either structural or parametric with performance it is generally recognized that hydrological models with few calibrated parameters can challenge more complex hysdrological models in terms of the number of free parameters and the representatives of main hydrological processes e g perrin et al 2003 knoben et al 2020 overfitting and the difficulty to adequately identify optimal parameter values during calibration are likely the main reasons for this observation orth et al 2015 4 4 limitations and implications for hydrological studies the results presented in this work indicate that the no free lunch theorem often quoted in the field of optimization can be translated into hydrological modeling in the form of there is no optimal model structure which will consistently outperform others for all catchments streamflow metrics and climate zones the understanding and quantification of structural uncertainty are critical aspects to be considered in hydrological modelling the understanding of hydrological structural uncertainty is still far from complete and further efforts are required to improve this situation in this respect it is important to distinguish the uncertainty related to the model component parameters from the overall model structure although the greatest uncertainty is generally associated to the model structure e g najafi et al 2011 poulin et al 2011 in that scope the uncertainty associated with each component needs to be explored with the goal of reducing the uncertainty associated with the model structure and better assess the uncertainty of hydrological modelling in impact studies however the experimental design of the present study has some drawbacks related to the complexity of model components the number of models methods by components the sample of catchments even though all catchments are aggregated by climate zones the input meteorological datasets and the objective function used to evaluate the overall performance of the synthetic hydrological models nevertheless we can affirm that these limitations have quite few impacts on the findings of the uncertainty analysis because they are included in the directive line of the bench test i e the same input meteorological data and objective function used for the entire synthetic hydrological models these limitations can be considered as individual sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain that need to be however further explored if the investigation of the total hydrological uncertainty is addressed which is out of the scope of this study considering the medium size of the simulations over the large sample of north american catchments this work allows the role of the structural uncertainty on simulated streamflows to be explored the uncertainty attribution has nonetheless yielded some interesting results that are of interest to hydrological model users when studying low flows at lower latitudes climate zones b and c the largest portion of uncertainty is related to the vfs component this is consistent with low flows originating from the slow contribution of the water table pet methods and sms only had a limited impact for high flows the horizontal flow movement is dominant for most climate zones with an important contribution of the sms on the higher latitude catchments pet method contribution to uncertainty is again very small the mean flow metric is the only one where pet was important along with its interactions with the vertical water movement component since pet and water availability to compute real evapotranspiration and which is therefore related to vertical movement are critical for a correct mass balance these results are not surprising these findings summarized in table 6 provide some guidelines on where the focus should be when trying to find a best model structure for a given flow target and climate zone these findings are in line and add to the previous works of troin et al 2015b 2016 2018 this reinforces the fact that some conceptual structures of hydrological models are better suited for simulating certain streamflow regimes knoben et al 2020 although additional aspects can also play a non negligible role such as drainage area topography soil land cover and land use features welde and gebremariam 2017 dos santos et al 2018 5 summary and conclusions the present study compares multiple combinations of snow accumulation and snowmelt models potential evapotranspiration formulations as well as vertical and horizontal flow routing schemes into 180 synthetic structures of hydrological models all these model structures are used to simulate streamflows over 698 catchments in north america located in 10 köppen climate zones the impact and uncertainty related to the structure of the hydrological model are studied for three streamflow metrics representing low mean and high flows the relevant findings of this work are synthesized below 1 the 180 synthetic combinations of model components per catchment provide satisfactory performances in simulating streamflows across all climate zones except for the arid bsk zone the ensemble combinations tend to underestimate the high flows while the low flows are overestimated in all the investigated climate zones 2 there is no clear relationship between the structural and parametric complexity of the hydrological components and model performance 3 there is no single structure of hydrological model which performs best in all climate zones and for all hydrological conditions 4 a ranking of the structural uncertainty related to the key components in streamflow simulations is provided this ranking depends on the hydrological situation for the mean hydrological conditions the vertical flow routing schemes and potential evapotranspiration methods are the critical components for most climate zones for extreme events such as high flows the horizontal flow routing scheme is key in addition to the snow model for nordic catchments for low flows the vertical flow routing scheme is the most important source of uncertainty this study gives pathways to assess the structural uncertainty of hydrological modelling in impact studies comparing the uncertainties related to the key hydrological model components to changing climatic conditions is useful to increase the reliability of the model structure and to reduce uncertainty in hydrological projections declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

3422,the impacts of hydrological model components on performance and uncertainty of streamflow simulations are investigated using a multi model approach over 698 catchments in north america an ensemble of 180 different hydrological model structures is obtained by combining five snow models sm four potential evapotranspiration formulations pet three vertical vfs and three horizontal hfs flow rounting schemes this study aims to first compare the multiple component combinations of sm pet vfs and hfs in terms of their ability at simulating streamflows for ten köppen climate zones a secondary goal is to evaluate the contribution of each model component to the total variance of the streamflow response according to the model structure for three streamflow metrics representing mean high and low flows results indicate that there is no clear relationship between the structural and parametric complexity of the hydrological components and model performance for all three streamflow metrics there is no single model structure which performs best in all climate zones and for all streamflow metrics streamflow uncertainty generated by the 180 synthetic hydrological model structures depends primarily on the metrics under study but also on the climate zone the evapotranspiration formulation is only critical for the mean flow metric for the low flow criterion the vfs generates the most uncertainty and is therefore the most critical whereas for the high flow metric performance is mostly related to the hfs component and sm for nordic catchments a better understanding of how hydrological model components generate uncertainty for a given climate and streamflow metric will lead to more robust model structures and therefore reduce the uncertainty of hydrological simulations

tools for a broad spectrum of operational applications and scientific research purposes such as water resources planning decision support ruiz ortiz et al 2019 flood forecasting givati et al 2016 troin et al 2021a impact analysis of climate change on water resources shrestha et al 2017 rocha et al 2020 and hydrological processes understanding troin et al 2012 mockler et al 2016 however since the lumped hydrological models are by definition a simplification of the real world hydrological system through mathematical equations describing hydrological processes and interactions they inevitably contain some biases or errors that can lead to poor streamflow simulations or predictions over the last years much attention has been paid to uncertainty issues in hydrological modelling clark et al 2016 and in hydrological forecasting pappenberger and beven 2006 due to their potential impacts on operational decision making van griensven et al 2008 sudheer et al 2011 arsenault and brissette 2016a thielen and bruen 2019 uncertainty in hydrological modelling originates mainly from three sources 1 model inputs due to natural climate variability limitations in hydrometeorological observational dataset and lack of data consistency 2 model parameterization due to the difficulty in parameter estimation because of missing information and uncertainty in the calibration data imperfect process understanding approximations and 3 model structures referred to as model uncertainty or structural uncertainty resulting mainly from the conceptual representation and simplification of hydrological process structures lindenschmidt et al 2007 renard et al 2010 other uncertainties can be accounted for non stationary climate conditions changing climate conditions coming from the instability of model parameters due to the variability of both hydrological processes and catchment characteristics brigode et al 2013 when comparing the sources of uncertainty to each other structural uncertainty of the hydrological models remains an important issue for both stationary and non stationary climate conditions najafi et al 2011 poulin et al 2011 fu et al 2015 model uncertainty can be addressed by comparing the performance from various structures of hydrological model gupta et al 2012 the approach of using multiple models i e multi model with different structures to create ensemble simulations is well established in climate modelling najafi and moradkhani 2015 khan et al 2018 ahmed et al 2019 and is becoming more employed in the field of hydrology for both streamflow simulations velázquez et al 2013 arsenault et al 2015 li et al 2018 zaherpour et al 2018 krysanova et al 2020 troin et al 2021b and forecasts cloke and pappenberger 2009 velazquez et al 2011 the ensemble approach must be perceived as a pragmatic means of quantifying uncertainty and ultimately reducing the model structural uncertainty tyralla and schumann 2016 several studies have investigated the issues of model structure uncertainty on model performance and modelling uncertainty by using an ensemble of structurally different hydrological models georgakakos et al 2004 ajami et al 2007 chen et al 2012 lee et al 2020 knoben et al 2020 a systematic comparison of model complexity in terms of process description and spatial distribution is well documented in butts et al 2004 in yin et al 2018 three hydrological models embodying three different model structures and degrees of rainfall spatial distribution are compared by using a systematic calibration and validation procedure orth et al 2015 use hydrological models of increasing spatial complexity from lumped to distributed to investigate the trade off between model complexity and accuracy to determine the physical controls on extreme streamflow simulations some other studies compare multiple hydrological models with varying levels of spatial complexity over multiple catchments to investigate the model ability at integrating the available physical and meteorological data reed et al 2004 smith et al 2012 martel et al 2020 with respect to the simulation of streamflow at the catchment s outlet it remains unclear if distributed hydrological models provide significant improvement over lumped hydrological models while many studies have assessed the issue of model uncertainty in terms of representing hydrological processes or spatial variability few have examined the structural uncertainty of the hydrological models regarding their own model components typically a hydrological model depicts the hydrological cycle into two major divisions the first division is the land vegetation atmospheric phase of the hydrological cycle which controls the amount of water loading in the catchment this includes the collective evapotranspiration et term for all processes by which water becomes atmospheric water vapor usually a fraction of the potential et pet that could be achieved if water were available for et to take place and snow routine models sm when needed the second division is the water routine phase of the hydrological cycle which can be defined as the movement of water which enters into the soil profile through the channel network until the catchment s outlet this includes both the vertical flow routing schemes vfs between the surface and both the vadose and phreatic zones and the horizontal flow routing schemes hfs such as surface lateral subsurface and groundwater flow routing the way in which key processes are represented in the land vegetation atmospheric and water routing components introduces a great deal of uncertainty into the modelling system contributing to the full uncertainty of the model structure some studies have contributed to the assessment of the model structure uncertainty by independently investigating the uncertainty related to one or a few model components solely over a limited number of catchments pet computation methods birhanu et al 2018 explored the impacts of five hydrological models with twelve pet related computation methods temperature and radiation based of increasing complexity on average and extreme hydrological conditions over ten catchments the authors show that the complexity of the pet computation methods and the model structure did not improve model performance and robustness on the contrary the simplest pet estimation method might perform better if reliable input datasets are available furthermore the robustness of the pet methods seems to be more dependent of the hydrological conditions rather than their complexity there is a relatively large body of literature investigating the model structural uncertainty regarding the pet computation methods e g oudin et al 2005 oudin et al 2006 chen et al 2020 chia et al 2020 dallaire et al 2021 sms in recent years several attempts were made to estimate the uncertainty on snowmelt streamflows related to the type of the sms degree day versus mixed degree day energy balance included in the typical hydrological models troin et al 2015 used twenty one combinations of sm and model structure to evaluate the performance of such combinations at simulating historical snowmelt streamflows over a canadian catchment the authors conclude that the type of sm plays only a minor role compared to the choice of the model structure pet vfs hfs combined troin et al 2016 supported these previous results by using an ensemble of eight sms finding that both the degree day and mixed degree day energy balance sms provide comparable snow water equivalent projections at the catchment scale with a low level of uncertainty associated for three study catchments an additional sm sensitivity analysis study indicates that the complexity of the sms in terms of representation of snow accumulation and melting processes does not neccesary lead to an improved robustness of the hydrological model debele et al 2009 water routing schemes without separating vfs and hfs in previous work a 105 combination ensemble of sms pet computation methods and routing schemes of different structural complexity and type was compared regarding the ability of each combination at simulating historical streamflows over two catchments troin et al 2018 it was found that the water routing scheme contributes significantly to the total model uncertainty followed by the choice of the pet method and the sms in last position comparing multiple combinations of model components and showing how the ensemble affects streamflow simulations constitutes an important and final step forward the evaluation of the structural uncertainty of the hydrological model recent studies focusing on the analysis of structural uncertainty have highlighted that the multi model strategy is a skillful framework to characterize the uncertainty resulting from the hydrological model velasquez et al 2011 zappa et al 2011 troin et al 2021a to our knowledge the application of multi model strategy to the ensemble of the key hydrological model components such as sms pet methods and water routing schemes with separation of vfs and hfs has not been considered in any study to date this study aims at assessing multiple sm pet vfs hfs combinations for simulating streamflows by considering uncertainties from the sms degree day versus mixed degree day energy balance models the pet methods temperature based versus radiation based methods and the water routing schemes vertical versus horizontal specifically the three addressed issues are 1 is the structural uncertainty related to hydrological conditions i e mean high and low flows in other words does a model component provide greater uncertainty for a particular hydrological situation 2 does the uncertainty of the model component depend on climatic conditions 3 does the complexity of the sm pet vfs hfs modeling chain have an impact on the performance of the model if so is this significant an ensemble approach made up of 180 combinations of sm pet vfs hfs with different levels of component complexity is used to answer to the objectives of this study the multi model ensemble is implemented over a large sampling of 698 north american catchments covering ten köppen climate zones beck et al 2018 the evaluation is made over all the available observations by evaluating the discrepancies between the observed and simulated streamflows at the catchment scale for three flow metrics representative of mean high and low flows some implications for the hydrological studies to come is brought regarding the understanding and quantification of structural uncertainty which are both critical aspects to be considered in hydrological modelling in the following section the experimental design including the study area the datasets and the multi model ensemble approach are presented the relevant findings from the ensemble approach are analyzed in section 3 the associated uncertainty to each model component on the streamflow simulations is discussed in section 4 concluding remarks are provided in section 5 2 experimental design 2 1 study area the present study is performed on a set of 698 north american catchments selected from the canadian canopex arsenault et al 2016b and the united states mopex schaake et al 2006 model parameter estimation experiment databases the selected catchments are also part of a recent larger database of 14 425 catchments hysets arsenault et al 2020 these catchments are unregulated and have a drainage area varying between 104 and 127 631 km2 the selected catchments are distributed over the north american continent and are representative of ten köppen climate zones covering both canada and the united states fig 1 all selected catchments have at least 20 years of available data except for one catchment in a particular climate zone dsc where a catchment with 20 years is included to have at least four catchments per climate zone the köppen classification is employed for grouping climatically comparable catchments as the hydrological response is typically driven by climate forcings knoben et al 2018 the north american köppen climate classification zones are defined in table 1 a summary of the catchment distribution in the selected ten köppen climate groups is given in table 2 2 2 datasets two hydrometerological datasets are used as inputs the multiple model component combinations the canopex and the mopex databases the canopex database includes meteorological and hydrometric data as well as catchment boundaries and drainage area the catchment averaged meteorological datasets are provided for precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures taken from the natural resources canada nrcan gridded climate data product hutchinson et al 2009 hopkinson et al 2011 mckenney et al 2011 streamflow records as well as the metadata of the hydrometric stations are extracted from the environment and climate change canada eccc

precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures in addition to daily hydrometric time series and river basin characteristics the daily meteorological data is averaged at the catchment scale using weather station observations the streamflow data come from the us geological survey usgs see schaake et al 2006 for a detailed description of this dataset 2 3 the multi model ensemble framework to evaluate the structural uncertainty of the model components on the streamflow simulations the multi model ensemble is built based on multiple sm pet vfs hfs combinations all models selected for the purpose of the present study satisfy the following two conditions 1 they are commonly used in north america for hydrological modelling and climate change impact studies the present study region and 2 their structure is easily interchangeable allowing to easily build a large ensemble of synthetic hydrological models sm pet vfs hfs the multi model ensemble relies on all possible pairings of five sms with four pet computation methods and with three vfs and hfs each for a total number of 180 synthetic hydrological models a brief description of all components is given below and summarized in table 3 in the present study the selection of sms satisfies the following two points 1 sms in the two relevant types of snow modeling approaches for hydrological modeling purposes degree day and mixed degree day energy balance and 2 sms with various structures in each type of snow modeling approaches the more physically based snow models are not selected in this work because their implementation is difficult input data not available and generally little used in the traditional hydrological models the five sms are the standalone cemaneige cem valéry 2010 sm as well as the four sms derived from

the model performance is validated over the second half the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1994 optimization method is used to calibrate the parameters of the sm pet vfs hfs combinations based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 criterion the nse criterion is calculated to independently evaluate the relative performance of the component combinations at simulating daily streamflows performance of the sm pet vfs hfs combination is considered good if nse 0 65 satisfactory if 0 65 nse 0 5 and unsatisfactory if nse 0 5 partly based on moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 the structural uncertainty in the streamflow simulations is assessed by analyzing the effects of each model component sm versus pet versus vfs versus hfs by climate zone on three flow metrics the chosen metrics are representative of mean qm high qx1day and low qmin7 flows table 4 a variance decomposition method is used to isolate and compare the magnitude of each uncertainty source on the three flow metrics kendall et al 1977 von storch and zwiers 1999 this approach follows ferro 2004 déqué et al 2007 and roberts and snelgrove 2015 let xspvh be the simulated value of a given metric for sm s 1 5 pet method e 1 4 vfs v 1 3 and hfs h 1 3 the decomposition of the total variance v of xspvh can be expressed as 1 v x spvh s e v h s e s v s h e v e h v h s e v s e h s v h e v h s e v h with for example 2 s 1 5 s 1 5 x s x 2 a n d s e 1 20 s 1 5 e 1 4 x se x s x e x 2 where is the average of the index it has substituted the total variance attributed to the sm can be expressed for example as 3 v s s s e s h s c s e h s e c s h c s e h c in equation 1 the terms s e v and h are the main effects of each model component which represent their independent contribution to variance the other terms represent the interaction terms for example the se term in equation 2 identifies the percentage of variance resulting from interactions between the snow model s and the potential evapotranspiration e a large variance associated to this interaction term means that the impact of one component s depends on the other e or in other words that they are not independent and interact with each other the variance components can be expressed in absolute e g in m3s 1 2 for flow metrics or in relative form in percentage the former is chosen as it allows for the comparison of catchments of different sizes and characteristics 3 results 3 1 evaluating the multi model ensemble at simulating streamflows in this work a hydrological model is defined as a combination of four components covering the main processes by which precipitation ultimately becomes streamflow at a catchment outlet the combination of four components therefore results in 180 distinct synthetic hydrological models even though many of them share common subsets of structural components before evaluating the relative contribution of each model component on the performance of the multi model ensemble the latter s ability at simulating streamflows is first analyzed over both the calibration and validation period the nse validation scores for the ensemble are important as poor validation nse values would limit the assessment of the model components relative performance on streamflow simulations the performance of the ensemble is first evaluated without an individual assessment of the model components and of a climate classification on streamflows over the 698 catchments fig 3 presents the nse calibration and validation scores for the full ensemble of 125640 values 180 combinations 698 catchments purple box plot as well as separated by each model component the boxplots represent key quantiles of the distribution of nse with the interquartile range represented by the central box 25th and 75th quantiles with the median 50th quantile as the central line the overall performance of the ensemble is found to be satisfactory over the study catchments over both the calibration median nse value of 0 66 fig 3a and validation median nse value of 0 62 fig 3b period the results indicate that the pet ensemble is similar across all four different formulations with close median nse values nse variation 0 02 over both the calibration and validation periods this suggests a minor impact of this component on the nse for the sm ensemble cemaneige cem provides a small but consistent performance increase compared to the other four sms for the calibration and validation periods it does not mean it is systematically the better sm but that on average the likelihood of obtaining a higher nse score is higher than for the others the interquartile ranges are similar across the sms and pet methods over the calibration and validation periods for the vfs and hfs components there are large differences in the interquatile ranges suggesting more robust vertical and horizontal flow formulations for ets and gr respectively these results show that the impact of vfs and hfs are more important than those of the sms or pet computation methods on the calibration and validation nse scores fig 4 presents the results in a similar format as fig 3 but for the three flow metrics the results strongly differ depending on the considered flow metric the range of bias is smallest for qm fig 4a and by far the largest for qmin7 fig 4c the smallest differences across the various model components are observed for qx1day fig 4b there are significant performance differences between the components for both qm and qmin7 the best specific formulation and variability of a component for a given flow metric may not be the same for another flow metric the gr vfs component for example generates a much larger uncertainty than the other two vfs structures but only for qm 3 2 performance of the multi model ensemble by climate zone this section evaluates the relationships between the performance of the multi model combinations and climate conditions while trying to bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the different hydrological model components the main interest is to understand to what extent climate conditions influence the optimal model structure and uncertainty related to model components to that end the performance of the ensemble at simulating streamflows is evaluated with respect to the four components for all ten climate zones table 1 the results are presented in figs 5 to 7 for the three flow metrics table 4 all evaluated over the validation period figs 5 to 7 follow the same format of fig 4 but the results are further decomposed by climate zone the number of points in each boxplot depends on the number of catchments in each climate zone see table 2 for example for the yellow boxplots in the upper plot of figs 5 to 7 for the snow models there are 252 data points corresponding to the 7 bsk catchments and 36 combinations of synthetic structures of hydrological model for each sm 1 sm 4 pet 3 vfs 3 hfs the results show that the performances of the sm pet vfs hfs combinations vary significantly between climate zones some sm pet vfs hfs combinations are better worse for some flow metrics and climate zones all sm pet vfs hfs combinations perform relatively poorly in the semi arid bsk climate zone the different sm pet vfs hfs combinations perform best in temperate and continental areas without a dry season e g cfa cfb dfa and dfc the importance of the sm which seems relatively low in figs 3 and 4 is now made clear for high flows fig 6 for the four coldest climate zones e g dsb dsc dfc and et it is also quite important for the low flows in the same climate zones fig 7 the simplest moh and most parameterized ets sms are the best performing ones for the two extreme flow metrics indicating that the complexity of the hydrological model is not necessarily an indicator of model performance the pet method has little impact on the high flow bias across all climate zones whereas its impact is clearly more significant for the mean and low flow biases and particularly so for the catchments located in the southern half of the united states e g cfa and cfb comparatively the relative performance of the vfs and hfs is relatively consistent across all climate zones and not much additional information can be extracted from figs 5 to 7 when compared to the aggregated fig 4 in order to better appreciate the seasonal differences between each climate zone an analysis is performed wherein one catchment from each climate zone is selected and mean annual hydrographs plotted supplementary figure s1 shows the results for the catchment that displays the best calibration nse value within each climate zone and figure s2 shows the same but for the catchment with the median calibration nse for each climate zone results show that the hydrological cycle is strongly dependent on the climate zone as expected but even more interestingly that the variance attributed to each component of the hydrological modelling process strongly depends on the climate zone and season for example for snowmelt dominated climate zones the snowmelt module accounts for most of the variability for almost half of the year after which other components become more important although to a lesser degree for the cfb and csb climate zones the seasonality plays a much smaller role this is in line with recent findings from mai et al 2022 where the relative sensitivity of hydrological model processes is shown to be highly dependent on the season climate zone and location of the investigated catchments over north america 3 3 structural uncertainty on streamflow simulations this section evaluates the uncertainties in streamflow simulations by analyzing the impacts of the four model components sm pet vfs and hfs by climate zone the main interest is to quantify the role of the four sources of uncertainty related to the structure of the hydrological model on the simulated streamflows and to explore the climate dependence of the component uncertainty the design of the present experiment allows the testing of a large ensemble of sm pet vfs hfs combinations over ten climate zones the 15 components of explained variance main effect and interactions are presented in table 5 for the three flow metrics qm qx1day and qmin7 by climate zone the results indicate contrasted differences between the model components across climate zones and flow metrics for qm most of the structural uncertainty is related to the pet e and vfs v components and by extension the interactions between both component ev interaction term the colder climate zones e g dfc and dfb and in particular the polar climate zone et differ from the others where the vfs v and hfs h components provide the highest uncertainty with a propagation of uncertainty in the interactions between these 2 components vh interaction term for qx1day the dominant source of uncertainty is attributed to the hfs h component and to the interactions with the vfs v component vh interaction term the results show that the sm component provides a significant level of uncertainty only for the colder climate zones the pet component contributes to the total structural uncertainty weakly whatever the climate zone for qmin7 and most climate zones the vfs v component provides the most level of uncertainty except for some colder climate zones where the hfs h component brings a large part of the uncertainty such as for the dfb zone where it is dominant the pet e component contributes slightly to the total structural uncertainty for qmin7 and mostly through its interaction with the vfs v component ev interaction term as expected the sm component plays a minor role in the total structural uncertainty of qmin7 overall the interaction terms are much smaller for the low flow metric compared to the other two metrics 4 discussion this work has provided insights regarding the contribution of each key model component to the total hydrologic uncertainty by using a combination of these components into 180 synthetic structures of the hydrological model this process is performed over a large sample of north america catchments and analysed for three flow metrics the main results outline the complexity of the process by which the model components interact and ultimately influence the performance of the hydrological model the uncertainty analysis nonetheless highlights the key processes related to each flow metric and climate zone as is discussed below 4 1 does the structural uncertainty relate to hydrological conditions the results highlight that the structural uncertainty of the hydrological model is strongly dependent on the hydrological conditions the critical pet component for the average hydrological conditions become irrelevant for extreme hydrological conditions where higher discreapancies in extreme flows are associated with the flow rounting schemes table 5 this implies that given the different synthetic hydrologiccal models used in this work no optimal structure or combination of model components can capture all hydrological conditions this corresponds to the fundamental idea that the ability of a hydrological model to deal with changing conditions is not to be taken for granted thirel et al 2015 as the model structure and or optimized calibration parameters under certain hydroclimatic conditions are not transferable in time coron et al 2012 in other words are the model structure robust and or flexible enough to be used under contrasted hydrological conditions in light of our results targeting a structure of a hydrological model for specific applications such as availability of water resources and hydrological risks floods and droughts should be preferred trying to develop a single model structure to account for all hydrological issues water availability and risks may be a compromise leading to sub optimal model performance when a single issue e g flood with a flow metric e g q1xday needs to be prioritized in that perspective the selection of the model structure seems to have a weak impact on the model performance in simulating mean streamflows onyutha 2016 whereas the choice of the model structure appears to be more critical for extreme events van kempen et al 2020 onyutha 2016 also indicates that the selection of the best model structure for extreme events may be influenced by the chosen criteria for extracting high and low flows which is in agreememt with the results of this study 4 2 does the uncertainty of the model component depend on climatic conditions structural uncertainty of the hydrological model is shown to be dependent on the climate zone but to a lesser extent than the flow metric the best performing components are typically the same across climate zones for a given flow metric but the range in performance varies significantly from one climate zone to the other figs 5 to 7 van kempen et al 2020 show that the impact of the model structure varies between the climate zones in cold and temperate climate zones the magnitude and timing of extreme flows are affected by different parameter sets and model components such as the pet method while the impact of the model structure on extreme flows is smaller in the arid and tropical climate zones lidén and harlin 2000 shows that catchments located under dry conditions are sensitive to the structure of the hydrological model especially for mean flows as also discussed by jones et al 2006 4 3 quantifying the impact of the complexity of the sm pet vfs hfs modeling chain on simulation performance this work is not about trying to identify the optimal model structure as no attempt is made at identifying the optimal component for each catchment in a specific climate zone however based on the distribution of component performance across the three flow metrics it is nonetheless possible to make some statements about the likelihood of a given hydrological model structure out performing another a first observation is that the component complexity as defined by its number of parameters or formulation does not lead to a higher performance and or better robustness across climate zones based on the validation nse scores fig 3 the most likely best performing sm is cemaneige followed by mohyse which both have the fewest number of parameters and by far the simplest structure is mohyse the combined degree day energy balance hydrotel model follows on the other hand for the vfs component the order of performance follows the number or parameters the order is reversed for the high flow metric qx1day in fig 4 even when sifting through the different climate zones figs 5 to 7 it is not possible to establish any patterns relating the component complexity either structural or parametric with performance it is generally recognized that hydrological models with few calibrated parameters can challenge more complex hysdrological models in terms of the number of free parameters and the representatives of main hydrological processes e g perrin et al 2003 knoben et al 2020 overfitting and the difficulty to adequately identify optimal parameter values during calibration are likely the main reasons for this observation orth et al 2015 4 4 limitations and implications for hydrological studies the results presented in this work indicate that the no free lunch theorem often quoted in the field of optimization can be translated into hydrological modeling in the form of there is no optimal model structure which will consistently outperform others for all catchments streamflow metrics and climate zones the understanding and quantification of structural uncertainty are critical aspects to be considered in hydrological modelling the understanding of hydrological structural uncertainty is still far from complete and further efforts are required to improve this situation in this respect it is important to distinguish the uncertainty related to the model component parameters from the overall model structure although the greatest uncertainty is generally associated to the model structure e g najafi et al 2011 poulin et al 2011 in that scope the uncertainty associated with each component needs to be explored with the goal of reducing the uncertainty associated with the model structure and better assess the uncertainty of hydrological modelling in impact studies however the experimental design of the present study has some drawbacks related to the complexity of model components the number of models methods by components the sample of catchments even though all catchments are aggregated by climate zones the input meteorological datasets and the objective function used to evaluate the overall performance of the synthetic hydrological models nevertheless we can affirm that these limitations have quite few impacts on the findings of the uncertainty analysis because they are included in the directive line of the bench test i e the same input meteorological data and objective function used for the entire synthetic hydrological models these limitations can be considered as individual sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain that need to be however further explored if the investigation of the total hydrological uncertainty is addressed which is out of the scope of this study considering the medium size of the simulations over the large sample of north american catchments this work allows the role of the structural uncertainty on simulated streamflows to be explored the uncertainty attribution has nonetheless yielded some interesting results that are of interest to hydrological model users when studying low flows at lower latitudes climate zones b and c the largest portion of uncertainty is related to the vfs component this is consistent with low flows originating from the slow contribution of the water table pet methods and sms only had a limited impact for high flows the horizontal flow movement is dominant for most climate zones with an important contribution of the sms on the higher latitude catchments pet method contribution to uncertainty is again very small the mean flow metric is the only one where pet was important along with its interactions with the vertical water movement component since pet and water availability to compute real evapotranspiration and which is therefore related to vertical movement are critical for a correct mass balance these results are not surprising these findings summarized in table 6 provide some guidelines on where the focus should be when trying to find a best model structure for a given flow target and climate zone these findings are in line and add to the previous works of troin et al 2015b 2016 2018 this reinforces the fact that some conceptual structures of hydrological models are better suited for simulating certain streamflow regimes knoben et al 2020 although additional aspects can also play a non negligible role such as drainage area topography soil land cover and land use features welde and gebremariam 2017 dos santos et al 2018 5 summary and conclusions the present study compares multiple combinations of snow accumulation and snowmelt models potential evapotranspiration formulations as well as vertical and horizontal flow routing schemes into 180 synthetic structures of hydrological models all these model structures are used to simulate streamflows over 698 catchments in north america located in 10 köppen climate zones the impact and uncertainty related to the structure of the hydrological model are studied for three streamflow metrics representing low mean and high flows the relevant findings of this work are synthesized below 1 the 180 synthetic combinations of model components per catchment provide satisfactory performances in simulating streamflows across all climate zones except for the arid bsk zone the ensemble combinations tend to underestimate the high flows while the low flows are overestimated in all the investigated climate zones 2 there is no clear relationship between the structural and parametric complexity of the hydrological components and model performance 3 there is no single structure of hydrological model which performs best in all climate zones and for all hydrological conditions 4 a ranking of the structural uncertainty related to the key components in streamflow simulations is provided this ranking depends on the hydrological situation for the mean hydrological conditions the vertical flow routing schemes and potential evapotranspiration methods are the critical components for most climate zones for extreme events such as high flows the horizontal flow routing scheme is key in addition to the snow model for nordic catchments for low flows the vertical flow routing scheme is the most important source of uncertainty this study gives pathways to assess the structural uncertainty of hydrological modelling in impact studies comparing the uncertainties related to the key hydrological model components to changing climatic conditions is useful to increase the reliability of the model structure and to reduce uncertainty in hydrological projections declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

3423,actual evapotranspiration aet is one of the decisive factors controlling the water balance at the catchment level particularly in arid and semi arid regions but measured data for which are generally unavailable in this study performance of a base artificial intelligence ai model adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and its hybrids with two bio inspired optimization algorithms namely shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla and grey wolf optimization gwo in estimating monthly aet was evaluated over 2001 2010 across neishaboor watershed in iran the inputs of these models were categorized into three groups including meteorological remotely sensed and hybrid based predictors and defined in the form of 8 different scenarios net radiation rn land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and soil wetness deficit index swdi were the remotely sensed predictors computed using modis satellite images on the monthly scale for the study area the results showed that the swdi predictor has played a significant role in improving the accuracy of aet estimation with the highest error reduction 12 5 17 and 26 5 for anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo respectively obtained under scenarios including swdi compared to corresponding scenarios excluding this predictor in testing set the three aforementioned models exhibited their best performance under scenario 8 rmse 11 93 nse 0 69 rrmse 0 37 scenario 4 rmse 11 06 nse 0 74 rrmse 0 37 and scenario 4 rmse 10 9 nse 0 76 rrmse 0 36 respectively coupling the sfla and gwo optimization algorithms to the base model improved the accuracy of aet estimation with the maximum error reduction for the two algorithms being about 12 scenarios 2 and 4 and 14 scenario 4 respectively examining the performance of the best scenarios of the three models in three intervals including the first middle and last third of measured aet values showed that all models were the most accurate in the first third interval the results also indicated that all models have had higher accuracies in the first and middle third intervals of under estimation set and the last interval of over estimation set keywords aet bio inspired optimization algorithms iran meteorological parameters remotely sensed predictors 1 introduction aet is one of the principal factors controlling water balance and plays a central role in the hydrological cycle cobaner 2011 lucas et al 2020 talebmorad et al 2021 this parameter shows tremendous temporal variations due to global environmental changes such as climate change and anthropogenic ecosystem modifications dou and yang 2018 importance of aet is twofold from a spatial scale point of view on a small regional scale the farm it plays an important part in determining crop water requirements appropriate irrigation times and various aspects of irrigation scheduling in general ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2020 on the large global scale the importance of this parameter in determining the water balance of the catchment and its indirect impact on the share of such major components as runoff and infiltration is obvious mehdizadeh 2018 pandey and pandey 2020 the water shortage crisis has more than ever highlighted the necessity of making the right management and policy decisions at the catchment level these measures should be implemented even more carefully and sensitively in arid and semi arid regions such as iran nourani et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 in the agricultural sector increasing water use efficiency can help manage the water crisis and improve food security therefore reliable estimation of aet is of prime importance direct measurement of aet using lysimeters flux towers or scintillometers is performed on a very limited scale due to the high installation and maintenance costs of the instruments shiri et al 2014b tang et al 2018 in addition application of lysimeters on a large scale in areas covered by various plants has limitations because it provides point estimates aet is thus indirectly estimated allen et al 1998 as the product of crop coefficient kc and reference evapotranspiration eto the most common method of estimating eto is the use of fao penman monteith equation fao 56 pm however the large number of parameters and the variety of units used for these parameters are cited as limitations of this equation talebmorad et al 2020 nourani et al 2020 chen et al 2020 researchers have thus tried to simplify eto estimation by using fewer meteorological parameters in the form of ai methods shiri et al 2014a gocic et al 2015 patil and deka 2016 yassin et al 2016 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 feng et al 2017a jovic et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 reis et al 2019 saggi and jain 2019 petkovic et al 2020 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 roy et al 2020 ahmadi et al 2021 feng et al 2017b evaluated the performance of two ai models in estimating eto using temperature as the only input in china under local data and pooled data scenarios elm and grnn models exhibited the best performance with rrmses of 0 198 and 0 194 respectively kisi and alizamir 2018 concluded that solar radiation was the most important parameter for estimating eto and the welm model was superior to ann and elm decreasing the error rate by 32 and 58 respectively at two stations in turkey maroufpoor et al 2020 examined the potential of the ann gwo hybrid model for estimating eto under 5 different climates in iran and reported that this approach has decreased estimation error by 42 and 30 in comparison with ann and ls svr models respectively estimation of aet rather than eto and regional estimation as opposed to point estimation are important advantages of satellite imagery which has caught the attention of researchers in recent years vinukollu et al 2011 yebra et al 2013 bai et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 rawat et al 2019 pocas et al 2021 paciolla et al 2021 chen et al 2021 landsat 8 images processed by the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal algorithm were used to determine the water requirement of maize in northern iran kamali and nazari 2018 silva et al 2019 developed an r package named agriwater which uses the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer to estimate surface energy balance components and aet based on landsat 8 sentinel 2 and modis images potential of surface energy balance system iran sebs iran and mod16 models for estimating aet and water stress in qom basin iran in two years 2000 wet and 2014 dry was investigated by jahangir and arast 2020 with an r2 of 0 93 the sebs algorithm showed a slightly better correlation with measured daily aet over mod16 r2 0 9 in the wet year aet values are generally obtained using two methods the first is direct measurement which is both time consuming and costly and only provides point values of this parameter and also has limitations when applied to large areas or where there is a varied plant cover the second method employs kc and eto the most practical method of estimating eto is the use of the fao 56 pm equation which consists of diverse parameters and thus several researchers have attempted to replace it with nonlinear methods and with application of fewer but effective meteorological parameters according to the fact that satellite images possess suitable spatial and temporal resolution various algorithms have been developed in recent years for estimating aet most of which estimate this component as a residual term of the energy equation despite their advantages the complexities involved in application of these algorithms e g estimating other components of the energy balance equation such as sensible heat flux or sensitivity of proper determination of the hot and cold anchor pixels contribute to the uncertainty of aet estimation therefore the novelty of the present work was the use of an ai method anfis as a powerful tool for simulating the nonlinear aet process and defining three groups of predictors as inputs to the ai method the first group consisted of the main meteorological parameters the second group included remotely sensed predictors that both affect the evapotranspiration process and can be generated for large areas such as catchments and the third group was a combination of the former two in addition an attempt was made to improve the performance of the base anfis model using two bio inspired optimization algorithms in order to obtain more accurate aet estimates the important point here is the extraction of remotely sensed predictors which affect the evapotranspiration process on the one and on the other hand are free from computational errors that are an inherent part of remote sensing algorithms for aet estimation therefore the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the possibility of estimating monthly aet using satellite images but by ai models and bio inspired optimization algorithms instead of the aforementioned algorithms to this end a number of meteorological variables and parameters extracted from satellite images taken over the time period 2001 2010 from neishaboor watershed area in iran were used as inputs of the models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area neishaboor watershed is located in north eastern iran between latitudes 35 40ʹ n and 36 39ʹ n and longitudes 58 17ʹ e and 59 30ʹ e and has a semi arid to arid climate the total study area is 9158 km2 4241 km2 mountainous terrains and approximately 4917 km2 of plains maximum elevation is 3300 m in binalood mountains and minimum elevation is 1050 m at the outlet of the watershed hoseinabad average annual precipitation is 265 mm but the figure varies considerably from one year to another cv 0 13 mean annual temperatures at bar mountainous and fedisheh plain stations are 13 and 13 8 c respectively neishaboor watershed covering 21 counties is one of the main watersheds in razavi khorasan province approximately 47 of its area is used for agriculture about 70 of which is devoted to barely and irrigated wheat and the remaining 30 to such crops as sugar beet cotton alfalfa and tomato and its annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated at about 2335 mm izady et al 2015 the only synoptic station in the study area is located in the city of neishaboor at an altitude of 1213 m in addition there are 23 rain gauge stations 4 temperature stations 3 solar radiation stations and 9 hydrometric stations across the watershed according to iranian government reports about 93 5 of the water resources are consumed by the agricultural sector mostly for irrigation in fact evapotranspiration accounts for about 90 of water consumption land use map of the study area consists of 14 main classes fig 1 the recent droughts unsustainable agricultural development population growth and relatively low water prices charged to farmers are among the most important reasons of extensive unrestrained extraction of groundwater resources in neishaboor watershed which has led to a severe drop in groundwater level environmental hazards soil erosion and land subsidence and eventually the negative water balance of the aquifer according to the climate arid and semi arid and land use irrigated agriculture water policy and water resources management practices are greatly controlled by aet 2 2 data collection two main sources of data were used in the present study the first was meteorological data obtained from neishaboor synoptic station 58 48 e 36 16 n

sensed data based on satellite images captured by the modis sensor on board the terra platform explained below in more detail 2 2 1 remotely sensed data as illustrated in fig 2 various energy and vegetation based indices including rn ndvi lst savi and swdi were used in the form of different scenarios as predictors of the ai based models for this purpose a cloud free image was chosen for each month of the selected time period 2001 2010 and the aforementioned indices were calculated after initial processing projection adequacy corrections layer stacking and image cropping rn ndvi and savi

constant for savi which varies between zero and 1 in this study lst was calculated using a split window algorithm developed by coll and casselles 1997 and swdi was calculated after keshavarz et al 2014 as follows i a triangle space concept between lst and ndvi was considered and the vegetation temperature condition index vtci was calculated by eq 4 4 v t c i l s t n d v i i m a x l s t n d v i

number of frogs divided into collections known as memeplexes which differ in culture memeplex frogs believe that the philosophy of each individual is influenced by those of others and evolves through memetic evolution eusuff et al 2006 a shuffling procedure is used in this algorithm to transfer concepts between memeplexes after considering the number of memetic evolution steps the local examination should continue until the convergence criteria are met each frog has ideas which can influence those of other memeplex members once the fitness function has been generated the population of frogs solutions is primarily created randomly in the search space and fitness of each frog is calculated the population is sorted by fitness in descending order and grouped into memeplexes using eq 7 karakoyun et al 2020 7 y k x i k x i x k m i 1 i 1 n k 1 m where m and n are the number of memeplexes and the number of members in each memeplex respectively each memeplex undergoes memetic evolution only the least fit or worst fit frog is evolved improved in each cycle and then resorting is performed using eq 8 bhattacharjee and sarmah 2014 8 d i r a n d x b x w where xb and xw are the best and worst fit frogs respectively di is the change in the position of ith frog and rand is a random number rand u 0 1 the new position of frogs is calculated using eq 9 9 x w n e w x w d i d m i n d i d m a x x w d m i n d i d m i n x w d m a x d i d m a x where dmin and dmax are the minimum and maximum permissible alterations in the position of a frog respectively if this leads to a better solution it replaces the worst one otherwise the frog with the global best fitness xg is used instead of xb in equations 8 and 9 if using xg also fails to provide any improvement a new random solution is generated to replace xw memeplexes are then conglomerated and frogs are shuffled in order to get the ideas passed along and the process is reiterated from the sorting step until the termination criterion is reached in order to determine the fitness value frogs new positions must be evaluated by iterating sfla s updating process for running sfla the optimal parameters included 500 as the maximum number of iterations 40 as population size 5 as the number of memeplexes 3 as the number of offspring and 10 as memeplex size all the above mentioned processes are represented in the pseudocode below fig 4 2 5 grey wolf optimizer gwo the gwo meta heuristic population based and iterative algorithm mirjalili et al 2014 simulates the hierarchy and hunting strategies of grey wolves it consists of four parts including social hierarchy prey encircling hunting and attacking the prey karakoyun et al 2020 gwo can be focused on the following aspects 1 social hierarchy and 2 hunting mechanism which are the sources of inspiration for this algorithm each grey wolf pack has a strict social dominance hierarchy with four levels fig 5 the alpha α or dominant wolf is the leader of the pack and corresponds to the fittest solution alpha wolves can be male or female and are responsible for any type of decision made in each group and their orders should be followed in the group beta β wolves occupy the second level can be male or female and their most important duty is to help the α make better decisions they can be the best candidates to replace the α wolves which have become old or are away and also play the role of advisors to the α and the links between them and other members of the pack the lowest ranking is related to the omega ω wolves or the rest of the population that is other candidate solutions which are the candidates to be scapegoats and the last members that are allowed to eat if a wolf is not an α β or ω then it is called a delta δ according to muro et al 2011 group hunting is another interesting social behaviour of grey wolves the main steps of which are as follows 1 exploring and approaching the prey 2 chasing and encircling until prey stops moving 3 attacking the prey eq 10 to 13 show the mathematical representation of this behaviour in gwo 10 x x p a d 11 d c x p x where a and c are coefficient vectors calculated by equations 12 and 13 respectively x p is the location of prey and x and x are the current and next locations of the wolf respectively 12 a 2 α r 1 α 13 c 2 r 2 where α is a real number decreased gradually and linearly from 2 to 0 based on the number of iterations and r 1 and r 2 are real number arrays generated randomly in the range 0 1 hunting is predominantly guided by alpha beta and delta wolves and omega wolves follow these pack leaders to update their locations relative to the potential prey wolves decide to attack the prey or search for a better one based on a eq 12 they will attack the prey when a 1 and continue the search for a better prey when a 1 mirjalili et al 2014 heidari and pahlavani 2017 the gwo algorithm was executed using 500 as the maximum number of iterations and 40 as the number of populations and a linear decrease rate from 2 to 0 was employed to calculate the candidate position all the above mentioned processes are shown in the pseudocode below fig 6 2 6 aet estimation the capability of an ai based model anfis and its hybrids with two bio inspired optimization algorithms namely sfla and gwo for estimating monthly aet using three types of input variables including meteorological based remotely sensed and hybrid predictors was examined table 1 eight scenarios were defined with various combinations of these predictors scenarios 1 and 2 were based on meteorological predictors given that not all predictors are measured in all synoptic stations especially in developing countries scenario 1 was designed so as to enable running the models with minimum input predictors scenarios 3 and 4 were based on remotely sensed predictors with the only difference being that scenario 4 had one additional input the swdi index in fact these two scenarios were defined in order to examine the impact of swdi on aet estimation finally scenarios 5 to 8 evaluated the combined effects of both types of predictors due to the lack of measured aet data in the study area aet values were calculated by the sebal algorithm bastiaanssen et al 1998 and used as a benchmark for training and testing of ai based models since not all parts of the watershed are utilized for agriculture the authors selected nine subbasins for calculating remotely sensed indices and estimation of aet by ai based models fig 7 these subbasins were produced using the hydrologic response unit concept in the soil and water assessment tool swat model fig 8 shows modeling flowcharts for sfla and gwo coupled with anfis anfis sfla anfis gwo as used in the present study fig 9 shows the methodology used to prepare the data and calculate the remote sensing based predictors as inputs to the ai models for estimating aet 2 7 model performance criteria three statistical indices including rmse nash sutcliffe equation nse and relative root mean square error rrmse were used for evaluating the performance of each model in estimating aet under the eight defined scenarios equations 14 16 14

where e t a c t i o b s and e t a c t i e s t are observed and estimated actual evapotranspiration values and n refers to the number of data points also a taylor diagram which illustrates the model s accuracy based on various indices including standard deviation rmse and correlation coefficient was used for depicting the results of the best scenario of each model 3 results and discussion 3 1 remotely sensed predictors in the present study the predictors of ai models for estimating monthly aet were categorized into three groups including meteorological remotely sensed and hybrid predictors as an example fig 10 depicts the spatial distribution of remotely sensed predictors rn lst ndvi savi swdi for the entire neishaboor watershed on 13rd july 2003 after calculating the rs based predictors from satellite images boundaries of nine selected subbasins were extracted from these images and their mean values were fed into the modelling process comparison of the different parts of fig 10 indicates a significant congruence among the calculated predictors the regions with lower surface temperatures yellowy in fig 10b for instance correspond to those with higher ndvi bluish parts in fig 10c which means higher vegetation density and higher aet values in fact more solar energy is consumed as latent heat of vaporization in these regions and the weight of the λet term will be higher in the surface energy balance equation in comparison with sensible heat flux h and soil heat flux g terms the same areas appear with lighter colours and higher values on the swdi map fig 10e indicating a greater tendency towards wet conditions compared to drought endeavoring to measure aet and its parameters including stomatal conductance leaf area index lai canopy temperature tc and soil moisture sm using remotely sensed data such as ndvi savi and vvi vegetation vigour index panda et al 2019 developed a radial basis function network rbfn for estimating aet and its parameters in south eastern usa the lowest and highest rmses were 0 002 tc and 0 47 sm for switchgrass 0 007 tc and 0 08 sm for pine switchgrass and 0 016 tc and 0 055 lai for pine understory cultures 3 2 performance of ai based models error rates of anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo under the 8 defined scenarios are given in table 2 comparison of the results for testing sets of anfis and anfis sfla models under scenarios 1 and 2 meteorological based scenarios shows that the maximum use of meteorological predictors scenario 2 has decreased aet estimation error though only by about 5 3 and 6 for the two models respectively scenario 2 was also ineffective in improving the performance of anfis gwo therefore increasing the number of meteorological predictors in different ai models does not necessarily improve their performance comparison of results of the rs based scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 reveals that inclusion of the swdi predictor has noticeably improved aet estimation in testing set resulting in 12 5 17 and 26 5 decrease in error rates of anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo models respectively in training set corresponding values were 18 4 25 4 and 24 5 for the aforementioned models respectively xing et al 2018 developed a non linear model for estimating monthly aet across 24 catchments in china using budyko framework and grace derived terrestrial water storage change datasets the best budyko results were obtained for shixiali catchment with r nsce and re of 0 994 0 951 and 0 11 in validation set respectively original and modified water stress scalars in the ndvi csws method which combines meteorological observations and ndvi images derived from sentinel 2 were used to estimate aet in central italy maselli et al 2020 comparison of various statistical indices rmse 0 5 mm for modified scalars and rmse 1 26 mm for original scalars at pescia site rmse 0 57 mm for modified scalars and rmse 1 73 mm for original scalars at roselle site proved the effectiveness of modified scalars in improving aet estimation effect of the swdi predictor in improving aet estimation is also evident in the hybrid scenarios scenarios 5 to 8 with scenarios 6 and 8 having outperformed scenarios 5 and 7 respectively in both training and testing sets of all three models using scenario 6 rather than scenario 5 has reduced the error rates in testing set of anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo models by about 12 4 10 6 and 2 5 respectively and corresponding values for using scenario 8 instead of scenario 7 are approximately 11 10 1 and 7 5 respectively this finding shows that addition of the swdi predictor to the input set of models in the hybrid scenarios scenarios 5 to 8 has exerted varying effects on the accuracy of aet estimation by the various models particularly in case of the comparison between scenarios 5 and 6 and anfis has exhibited the greatest improvement in aet estimation followed by anfis sfla in training set replacing scenario 5 with scenario 6 led to 18 28 and 17 reduction in error for anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo respectively whereas corresponding values for replacing scenario 7 with scenario 8 were 18 22 and 19 for the same models respectively indicating better performance of anfis sfla and similar performance of the other two models two methods including vegetation index based estimates derived from satellite images sentinel 2 and venus sensors were used by french et al 2020 for determining aet at 6 sites in yuma and one site in maricopa arizona usa their results indicated that rmses were in the range 0 86 1 16 mm day 1 in yuma sites and 1 09 mm day 1 at maricopa granata 2019 evaluated several machine learning ml algorithms including m5p regression tree bagging rf and svr under various scenarios for aet estimation in central florida the scenario with net solar radiation sensible heat flux moisture content wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature as inputs outperformed all others with rmse 0 179 0 219 0 218 and 0 201 mm day 1 for the aforementioned algorithms respectively the highest errors for m5p and bagging algorithms ranged between 0 and 2 mm and for rf this range increased to 0 3 mm also a clear tendency to under estimate aet values above 3 mm day 1 was reported for svr an important point inferred from comparison of the results of the scenarios defined in table 2 is that the use of predictors derived from satellite imagery does not necessarily improve evapotranspiration simulation scenario 3 for example which is based on predictors derived from satellite images had higher rmse compared to scenarios 1 and 2 which are based on meteorological predictors whereas this issue is resolved in the case of scenario 4 which is also based on predictors extracted from satellite images it can be thus concluded that the type of satellite imagery based predictors i e to what extent they affect the evapotranspiration process along with the degree of uncertainty in the process of extracting these predictors can affect the accuracy of aet estimation also it should not be forgotten that the capabilities of different ai models with the same predictors may vary depending on the structure of each model in the present study for instance the greatest effect of the sfla optimization algorithm in reducing the error rate compared to the base model was observed under scenarios 2 and 4 about 12 5 whereas the gwo optimization algorithm exhibited its greatest effect under scenario 4 about 13 7 four ensemble et models with various ml classifiers namely k nearest neighbours rf svm and mlp rmse 18 21 w m 2 outperformed two conventional ensemble models rmse 23 25 w m 2 and six physically driven rs based et models rmse 26 35 w m 2 in estimating daily λe at 47 cropland sites throughout asia america and europe bai et al 2021 comparison of the results of the models presented in table 2 demonstrates that the use of bio inspired algorithms both sfla and gwo has been effective in optimizing the parameters of the base model anfis the lowest and highest decrements in error rate relative to the base model in training set were 1 2 scenario 2 of the anfis gwo model and 22 2 scenario 6 of anfis sfla respectively in testing set corresponding values were 2 5 scenario 2 of anfis gwo and 13 7 scenario 4 of anfis gwo respectively although the anfis gwo model has performed imperceptibly better than anfis sfla under scenarios 4 and 7 only in testing set examination of the results in table 2 shows that anfis sfla has outperformed anfis gwo under the other scenarios and in both training and testing sets talib et al 2021 investigated the performance of a process based land surface model lsm and two data driven models including rf and lstm long short term memory based on soil plant meteorological and rs based predictors in estimating daily aet for maize soybean and potato in midwest usa using 16 predictors rf r2 0 7 wilmott s skill score 0 9 outperformed lstm r2 0 65 wilmott s skill score 0 89 and lsm r2 0 57 wilmott s skill score 0 86 with a sample size of 4320 for maize more samples were over estimated by both rf and lstm models especially in case of aet values near 4 mm day 1 judging by model performance in testing set scenario 8 for the anfis model and scenario 4 for both anfis sfla and anfis gwo were selected as the best scenarios therefore two other statistical indices nse and rrmse are given in table 3 for scenarios 4 and 8 of all three models accordingly anfis sfla and anfis gwo have been the best performing models in training and testing sets respectively figure 11 shows taylor diagrams for all the three models under the 8 scenarios in training and testing sets which confirm the relative superiority of both anfis sfla and anfis gwo over the base model in training set in testing set anfis sfla has had lower error rates under all scenarios except scenarios 4 and 7 under which anfis gwo has exhibited a better performance although rmses in test sets of all three models and all scenarios were in the range 10 15 mm month 1 the closer distribution around the rmse 10 line for anfis sfla and anfis gwo and the more similar performance of scenarios 4 and 8 as best scenarios of anfis sfla were among the features of these models measured and estimated monthly aet values for all three models under all 8 scenarios are given in figs 12 to 14 3 2 1 model capability in different intervals for a more accurate analysis of the results of all three models performances of the best scenarios of all models were examined over three intervals including the first middle and last third of measured aet values in both training and testing sets the results of which are presented in fig 15 and table 4 also performance of all models was evaluated from the standpoint of under or over estimation of aet values over the three intervals with the results given in table 4 in training set of all models aet estimation error was higher in the last third interval compared to the other two intervals due partly to the relatively poor performance of all three models in under estimation set of last third interval for a particular group of evapotranspiration values which are marked by polygons in fig 15 the marked dots represent measured evapotranspiration values generally falling in the 75 90 mm range whereas their corresponding estimated values range between 40 and 60 mm for the anfis model and between 30 and 50 mm for the other two models relatively serious under estimation a deep neural network dnn framework was developed by elbeltagi et al 2020 for estimating validation set 2000 2017 and forecasting 2022 2038 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios monthly aet at three sites on the nile delta egypt for the proposed model rmses were in the ranges 3 21 9 43 5 01 12 56 and 4 71 10 8 mm in ad daqahliyah kafr ash shaykh and ash sharqiyah respectively an overall tendency to under estimate the aet values 45 mm and to over estimate the values between 45 and 65 mm was observed at the three sites at the first two sites estimated aet values corresponding to all measured values above 75 mm were the same in the present study estimation errors and the distribution pattern of data points were also similar for all models with over estimation set having more data points and higher error rates in the first and middle third intervals and under estimation set having more data points and higher errors in the last third interval a coupling form of tseb the land surface temperature based two source energy balance enhanced by a deep neural network tseb dnn was developed for estimating daily aet at four sites in arid and semi arid regions of china by cui et al 2021 their proposed model significantly improved aet estimation compared with the original form of tseb with r 0 87 0 93 and rmse 0 64 1 43 mm day 1 on the whole a relatively significant over estimation at guantan and under estimation at yingke and daman by the tseb dnn model for peak etact values was observed despite its overall improvement of aet estimation relative to tseb for anfis the difference in aet estimation error δrmse between under and over estimation sets in the first middle and last third intervals was about 7 27 1 83 and 10 6 mm month 1 respectively corresponding values were 3 93 5 49 and 10 42 mm month 1 for anfis sfla and 5 1 3 61 and 13 56 mm month 1 for anfis gwo therefore one can conclude that the highest and lowest degrees of similarity between under and over estimation sets in terms of aet estimation error have occurred in the middle third interval of anfis and the last third interval of anfis gwo respectively using 9 landsat 7 etm images covering 21 1 ha of olive orchard under drip irrigation in chile ortega salazar et al 2021 calibrated surface energy balance components of metric algorithm for estimating aet and kc rn h g and latent heat flux were calculated with rmses 29 46 40 and 45 w m2 respectively estimation errors for aet and kc were reported to be about 0 42 mm day 1 and 0 09 respectively the number of days with over estimation was fewer but error rates were higher in this data set in testing set and for the anfis model the lowest and highest estimation errors have occurred in the first third interval aet 18 mm month 1 rmse 10 69 and last third interval aet 48 mm month 1 rmse 12 7 respectively δrmse between under and over estimation sets of anfis were 10 42 4 96 and 6 05 in the first middle and last third intervals and the relatively higher δrmse in the first third interval is caused by the very low error in under estimation set rmse 2 98 in other words although the balance of estimation error between under and over estimation sets of anfis in the first third interval has not been as good as that in the other two intervals this i e the first interval has exhibited the best performance rmse 10 69 because it has had the lowest error rate in its under estimation set two water management parameters including aet and soil water content swc were estimated for maize using vegetation indices derived from modis products as inputs of six regression algorithms in brazil filgueiras et al 2020 among these models rf rmse 0 48 mm day 1 cubist regression rmse 0 38 mm day 1 and gbm gradient boosting machine rmse 0 4 mm day 1 outperformed the others in estimating aet with slight superiority of cubist the results showed a general trend of under estimation by rf and gbm and over estimation by cubist regression especially for values 2 mm day 1 potential of the sebal algorithm for aet estimation during summer in nile delta egypt using 18 landsat 8 images was analysed by el din fawzy et al 2021 according to statistical indices including r2 0 84 and rmse 0 26 mm day 1 the accuracy was acceptable especially in the case of over estimation in the first and last intervals of aet values lower than 7 and higher than 9 mm day 1 and under estimation for aet values falling between those intervals for anfis sfla the small aet estimation error in under estimation set of the first third interval aet 14 mm month 1 rmse 3 65 has ultimately led to the lowest error rate in this interval rmse 7 32 compared to middle third rmse 12 78 and last third rmse 12 28 intervals the most conspicuous advantage of anfis sfla compared to the base anfis model has been its better aet estimation in over estimation set of the first third interval which has been accompanied by an approximately 34 reduction of error this model has shown a relatively consistent behaviour from the viewpoint of the balance between error rates of under and over estimation sets in all three intervals namely the first δrmse 5 24 middle δrmse 5 53 and last δrmse 5 79 third interval similar to anfis sfla and for the same reason the anfis gwo model has also performed best in the first third interval rmse 9 11 relative to middle rmse 10 51 and last rmse 12 76 intervals compared to anfis sfla the anfis gwo model has decreased estimation error in under estimation set of all three intervals by about 17 18 and 3 5 in the first middle and last third respectively and also in over estimation set of middle and last third intervals by about 20 and 4 5 respectively and only in the first third interval of over estimation set it has been accompanied by an increase of estimation error by about 13 it can be therefore concluded that the main advantage of anfis gwo over anfis sfla under the best scenario scenario 4 is the former s better estimation of aet in the middle third interval 14 mm aet 44 mm similar to the training set higher error rates in over estimation set of the first and middle third intervals and in under estimation set of the last third interval is a feature of aet estimation in testing set of all the three models obviously under or over estimation of aet by simulator models and the use of such model outputs in water resources management planning at the watershed level can potentially lead to lower yields or to wastage of water resources respectively all three models show a relative tendency to under estimate the higher evapotranspiration values the last third interval and relevant management measures at the watershed scale will be necessary if the results of these models are applied 4 conclusions aet plays an essential role in water resources management both on the farm scale by determining the irrigation depth and schedule and on the watershed scale by controlling the water balance and an arid or semi arid climate adds to its importance generally this component is not measured at the watershed level especially in developing countries and its direct measurement is usually costly and only provides point values accordingly application of ai models with impressive capability for capturing nonlinear relationships and feeding satellite imagery based predictors as inputs to such models can help overcome these limitations the present study aimed to investigate the performance of a base ai model anfis and its hybrids with two optimization algorithms sfla and gwo in estimating monthly aet over 2001 2010 across neishaboor watershed in iran inputs of these models were classified into three categories including meteorological remotely sensed and hybrid predictors our results showed that the swdi predictor which is based on satellite images has served a significant role in estimating aet in all the three models reducing estimation error by 18 4 25 4 and 24 5 in training set and by 12 5 17 and 26 5 in testing set for anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo respectively the results also indicated that the use of either optimization algorithm has been effective in improving aet estimation with the greatest decrease in error rates in testing set for anfis sfla compared to anfis being 12 5 scenarios 2 and 4 and for anfis gwo relative to anfis being 13 7 scenario 4 using rmse as the benchmark in testing phase scenario 8 of anfis rmse 11 93 nse 0 69 scenario 4 of anfis sfla rmse 11 06 nse 0 74 and scenario 4 of anfis gwo rmse 10 9 nse 0 76 were selected as the best scenarios which demonstrates the superiority of anfis sfla and anfis gwo over the base anfis model due to the smaller number of input predictors performance analysis of the models over three intervals the first middle and last third of measured aet values showed that in training set all the three models have exhibited their highest estimation errors in the last third interval in testing set the highest error rates for anfis rmse 12 7 and anfis gwo rmse 12 76 were observed in the last third interval and anfis sfla had its highest estimation error rmse 12 78 in the middle third interval overall all three models tended to over estimate aet in the first and middle third intervals and under estimate in the last third interval the best and poorest model performances were respectively observed in the first third interval under estimation set rmse 2 98 and the last third interval under estimation set rmse 14 1 for anfis first third under estimation set rmse 3 65 and middle third over estimation set rmse 14 45 for anfis sfla and first third under estimation set rmse 3 03 and last third under estimation set rmse 13 44 for anfis gwo the use of satellite imagery based predictors in the form of ai models can be considered a useful approach for estimating aet at the watershed level

3423,actual evapotranspiration aet is one of the decisive factors controlling the water balance at the catchment level particularly in arid and semi arid regions but measured data for which are generally unavailable in this study performance of a base artificial intelligence ai model adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and its hybrids with two bio inspired optimization algorithms namely shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla and grey wolf optimization gwo in estimating monthly aet was evaluated over 2001 2010 across neishaboor watershed in iran the inputs of these models were categorized into three groups including meteorological remotely sensed and hybrid based predictors and defined in the form of 8 different scenarios net radiation rn land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and soil wetness deficit index swdi were the remotely sensed predictors computed using modis satellite images on the monthly scale for the study area the results showed that the swdi predictor has played a significant role in improving the accuracy of aet estimation with the highest error reduction 12 5 17 and 26 5 for anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo respectively obtained under scenarios including swdi compared to corresponding scenarios excluding this predictor in testing set the three aforementioned models exhibited their best performance under scenario 8 rmse 11 93 nse 0 69 rrmse 0 37 scenario 4 rmse 11 06 nse 0 74 rrmse 0 37 and scenario 4 rmse 10 9 nse 0 76 rrmse 0 36 respectively coupling the sfla and gwo optimization algorithms to the base model improved the accuracy of aet estimation with the maximum error reduction for the two algorithms being about 12 scenarios 2 and 4 and 14 scenario 4 respectively examining the performance of the best scenarios of the three models in three intervals including the first middle and last third of measured aet values showed that all models were the most accurate in the first third interval the results also indicated that all models have had higher accuracies in the first and middle third intervals of under estimation set and the last interval of over estimation set keywords aet bio inspired optimization algorithms iran meteorological parameters remotely sensed predictors 1 introduction aet is one of the principal factors controlling water balance and plays a central role in the hydrological cycle cobaner 2011 lucas et al 2020 talebmorad et al 2021 this parameter shows tremendous temporal variations due to global environmental changes such as climate change and anthropogenic ecosystem modifications dou and yang 2018 importance of aet is twofold from a spatial scale point of view on a small regional scale the farm it plays an important part in determining crop water requirements appropriate irrigation times and various aspects of irrigation scheduling in general ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2020 on the large global scale the importance of this parameter in determining the water balance of the catchment and its indirect impact on the share of such major components as runoff and infiltration is obvious mehdizadeh 2018 pandey and pandey 2020 the water shortage crisis has more than ever highlighted the necessity of making the right management and policy decisions at the catchment level these measures should be implemented even more carefully and sensitively in arid and semi arid regions such as iran nourani et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 in the agricultural sector increasing water use efficiency can help manage the water crisis and improve food security therefore reliable estimation of aet is of prime importance direct measurement of aet using lysimeters flux towers or scintillometers is performed on a very limited scale due to the high installation and maintenance costs of the instruments shiri et al 2014b tang et al 2018 in addition application of lysimeters on a large scale in areas covered by various plants has limitations because it provides point estimates aet is thus indirectly estimated allen et al 1998 as the product of crop coefficient kc and reference evapotranspiration eto the most common method of estimating eto is the use of fao penman monteith equation fao 56 pm however the large number of parameters and the variety of units used for these parameters are cited as limitations of this equation talebmorad et al 2020 nourani et al 2020 chen et al 2020 researchers have thus tried to simplify eto estimation by using fewer meteorological parameters in the form of ai methods shiri et al 2014a gocic et al 2015 patil and deka 2016 yassin et al 2016 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 feng et al 2017a jovic et al 2018 zhang

estimating eto using temperature as the only input in china under local data and pooled data scenarios elm and grnn models exhibited the best performance with rrmses of 0 198 and 0 194 respectively kisi and alizamir 2018 concluded that solar radiation was the most important parameter for estimating eto and the welm model was superior to ann and elm decreasing the error rate by 32 and 58 respectively at two stations in turkey maroufpoor et al 2020 examined the potential of the ann gwo hybrid model for estimating eto under 5 different climates in iran and reported that this approach has decreased estimation error by 42 and 30 in comparison with ann and ls svr models respectively estimation of aet rather than eto and regional estimation as opposed to point estimation are important advantages of satellite imagery which has caught the attention of researchers in recent years vinukollu et al 2011 yebra et al 2013 bai et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 rawat et al 2019 pocas et al 2021 paciolla et al 2021 chen et al 2021 landsat 8 images processed by the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal algorithm were used to determine the water requirement of maize in northern iran kamali and nazari 2018 silva et al 2019 developed an r package named agriwater which uses the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer to estimate surface energy balance components and aet based on landsat 8 sentinel 2 and modis images potential of surface energy balance system iran sebs iran and mod16 models for estimating aet and water stress in qom basin iran in two years 2000 wet and 2014 dry was investigated by jahangir and arast 2020 with an r2 of 0 93 the sebs algorithm showed a slightly better correlation with measured daily aet over mod16 r2 0 9 in the wet year aet values are generally obtained using two methods the first is direct measurement which is both time consuming and costly and only provides point values of this parameter and also has limitations when applied to large areas or where there is a varied plant cover the second method employs kc and eto the most practical method of estimating eto is the use of the fao 56 pm equation which consists of diverse parameters and thus several researchers have attempted to replace it with nonlinear methods and with application of fewer but effective meteorological parameters according to the fact that satellite images possess suitable spatial and temporal resolution various algorithms have been developed in recent years for estimating aet most of which estimate this component as a residual term of the energy equation despite their advantages the complexities involved in application of these algorithms e g estimating other components of the energy balance equation such as sensible heat flux or sensitivity of proper determination of the hot and cold anchor pixels contribute to the uncertainty of aet estimation therefore the novelty of the present work was the use of an ai method anfis as a powerful tool for simulating the nonlinear aet process and defining three groups of predictors as inputs to the ai method the first group consisted of the main meteorological parameters the second group included remotely sensed predictors that both affect the evapotranspiration process and can be generated for large areas such as catchments and the third group was a combination of the former two in addition an attempt was made to improve the performance of the base anfis model using two bio inspired optimization algorithms in order to obtain more accurate aet estimates the important point here is the extraction of remotely sensed predictors which affect the evapotranspiration process on the one and on the other hand are free from computational errors that are an inherent part of remote sensing algorithms for aet estimation therefore the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the possibility of estimating monthly aet using satellite images but by ai models and bio inspired optimization algorithms instead of the aforementioned algorithms to this end a number of meteorological variables and parameters extracted from satellite images taken over the time period 2001 2010 from neishaboor watershed area in iran were used as inputs of the models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area neishaboor watershed is located in north eastern iran between latitudes 35 40ʹ n and 36 39ʹ n and longitudes 58 17ʹ e and 59 30ʹ e and has a semi arid to arid climate the total study area is 9158 km2 4241 km2 mountainous terrains and approximately 4917 km2 of plains maximum elevation is 3300 m in binalood mountains and minimum elevation is 1050 m at the outlet of the watershed hoseinabad average annual precipitation is 265 mm but the figure varies considerably from one year to another cv 0 13 mean annual temperatures at bar mountainous and fedisheh plain stations are 13 and 13 8 c respectively neishaboor watershed covering 21 counties is one of the main watersheds in razavi khorasan province approximately 47 of its area is used for agriculture about 70 of which is devoted to barely and irrigated wheat and the remaining 30 to such crops as sugar beet cotton alfalfa and tomato and its annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated at about 2335 mm izady et al 2015 the only synoptic station in the study area is located in the city of neishaboor at an altitude of 1213 m in addition there are 23 rain gauge stations 4 temperature stations 3 solar radiation stations and 9 hydrometric stations across the watershed according to iranian government reports about 93 5 of the water resources are consumed by the agricultural sector mostly for irrigation in fact evapotranspiration accounts for about 90 of water consumption land use map of the study area consists of 14 main classes fig 1 the recent droughts unsustainable agricultural development population growth and relatively low water prices charged to farmers are among the most important reasons of extensive unrestrained extraction of groundwater resources in neishaboor watershed which has led to a severe drop in groundwater level environmental hazards soil erosion and land subsidence and eventually the negative water balance of the aquifer according to the climate arid and semi arid and land use irrigated agriculture water policy and water resources management practices are greatly controlled by aet 2 2 data collection two main sources of data were used in the present study the first was meteorological data obtained from neishaboor synoptic station 58 48 e 36 16 n wind speed u2 relative humidity rh air temperature tair tmin tmax dew point tdew and sunshine hours n were used in different combinations to form the scenarios fig 2 the second source was remotely sensed data based on satellite images captured by the modis sensor on board the terra platform explained below in more detail 2 2 1 remotely sensed data as illustrated in fig 2 various energy and vegetation based indices including rn ndvi lst savi and swdi were used in the form of different scenarios as predictors of the ai based models for this purpose a cloud free image was chosen for each month of the selected time period 2001 2010 and the aforementioned indices were calculated after initial processing projection adequacy corrections layer stacking and image cropping rn ndvi and savi were calculated according to eq 1 to eq 3 as follows 1 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε r l 2 n d v i ρ n i r ρ r ρ n i r ρ r 3 s a v i ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r l 1 l where α is surface albedo r s and r l are incoming short and long wave radiation respectively r l is outgoing longwave radiation ε0 is surface emissivity ρ n i r and ρ r are reflectance at near infrared and red bands respectively and l is a constant for savi which varies between zero and 1 in this study lst was calculated using a split window algorithm developed by coll and casselles 1997 and swdi was calculated after keshavarz et al 2014 as follows i a triangle space concept between lst and ndvi was considered and the vegetation temperature condition index vtci was calculated by eq 4 4 v t c i l s t n d v i i m a x l s t n d v i i l s t n d v i i m a x l s t n d v i i m i n where l s t n d v i i m a x and l s t n d v i i m i n are the maximum and minimum lsts of the pixels with the same ndvii respectively calculated by linear regression hu et al 2019 ii soil moisture deficit index sd was calculated from maximum and minimum vtci values and long term mean of vtci in each month mvtci by eq 5 5 s d v t c i m v t c i v t c i m a x v t c i m i n 100 iii with some computation and assumptions see keshavarz et al 2014 drought severity in each month can be calculated through eq 6 using sd of the same month and swdi of the previous month 6 s w d i i s d i 50 0 5 s w d i i 1 2 3 anfis introduced by jang 1993 anfis combines anns and fuzzy logic if then rules in a consolidated structure to take advantage of both for estimation of non linear functions it benefits from ann s learning capabilities to learn the if then rules of fuzzy inference systems fiss anfis architecture consists of nodes which serve as membership functions mfs and rules which enable the relationship between input and output to be modeled zhou et al 2019 it begins with selecting a rule base including fuzzy rules then a learning algorithm with compatible mfs is used to create a set of fuzzy if then laws by modifying the primary fis with a propagation algorithm finally a logical inference system is used to reach an acceptable output in the present study optimal anfis parameters included epoch 1000 error goal 0 initial step size 0 01 step size decrease 0 9 step size increase 1 1 and hybrid method was used as the optimizing method fig 3 illustrates the anfis structure consisting of 5 layers with circles and squares representing stable and adaptive nodes respectively 2 4 shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla sfla eusuff and lansey 2003 is a metaheuristic bio inspired algorithm based on the social behaviour of frogs who try to find the most food with the least movement generally each sfla group consists of a certain number of frogs divided into collections known as memeplexes which differ in culture memeplex frogs believe that the philosophy of each individual is influenced by those of others and evolves through memetic evolution eusuff et al 2006 a shuffling procedure is used in this algorithm to transfer concepts between memeplexes after considering the number of memetic evolution steps the local examination should continue until the convergence criteria are met each frog has ideas which can influence those of other memeplex members once the fitness function has been generated the population of frogs solutions is primarily created randomly in the search space and fitness of each frog is calculated the population is sorted by fitness in descending order and grouped into memeplexes using eq 7 karakoyun et al 2020 7 y k x i k x i x k m i 1 i 1 n k 1 m where m and n are the number of memeplexes and the number of members in each memeplex respectively each memeplex undergoes memetic evolution only the least fit or worst fit frog is evolved improved in each cycle and then resorting is performed using eq 8 bhattacharjee and sarmah 2014 8 d i r a n d x b x w where xb and xw are the best and worst fit frogs respectively di is the change in the position of ith frog and rand is a random number rand u 0 1 the new position of frogs is calculated using eq 9 9 x w n e w x w d i d m i n d i d m a x x w d m i n d i d m i n x w d m a x d i d m a x where dmin and dmax are the minimum and maximum permissible alterations in the position of a frog respectively if this leads to a better solution it replaces the worst one otherwise the frog with the global best fitness xg is used instead of xb in equations 8 and 9 if using xg also fails to provide any improvement a new random solution is generated to replace xw memeplexes are then conglomerated and frogs are shuffled in order to get the ideas passed along and the process is reiterated from the sorting step until the termination criterion is reached in order to determine the fitness value frogs new positions must be evaluated by iterating sfla s updating process for running sfla the optimal parameters included 500 as the maximum number of iterations 40 as population size 5 as the number of memeplexes 3 as the number of offspring and 10 as memeplex size all the above mentioned processes are represented in the pseudocode below fig 4 2 5 grey wolf optimizer gwo the gwo meta heuristic population based and iterative algorithm mirjalili et al 2014 simulates the hierarchy and hunting strategies of grey wolves it consists of four parts including social hierarchy prey encircling hunting and attacking the prey karakoyun et al 2020 gwo can be focused on the following aspects 1 social hierarchy and 2 hunting mechanism which are the sources of inspiration for this algorithm each grey wolf pack has a strict social dominance hierarchy with four levels fig 5 the alpha α or dominant wolf is the leader of the pack and corresponds to the fittest solution alpha wolves can be male or female and are responsible for any type of decision made in each group and their orders should be followed in the group beta β wolves occupy the second level can be male or female and their most important duty is to help the α make better decisions they can be the best candidates to replace the α wolves which have become old or are away and also play the role of advisors to the α and the links between them and other members of the pack the lowest ranking is related to the omega ω wolves or the rest of the population that is other candidate solutions which are the candidates to be scapegoats and the last members that are allowed to eat if a wolf is not an α β or ω then it is called a delta δ according to muro et al 2011 group hunting is another interesting social behaviour of grey wolves the main steps of which are as follows 1 exploring and approaching the prey 2 chasing and encircling until prey stops moving 3 attacking the prey eq 10 to 13 show the mathematical representation of this behaviour in gwo 10 x x p a d 11 d c x p x where a and c are coefficient vectors calculated by equations 12 and 13 respectively x p is the location of prey and x and x are the current and next locations of the wolf respectively 12 a 2 α r 1 α 13 c 2 r 2 where α is a real number decreased gradually and linearly from 2 to 0 based on the number of iterations and r 1 and r 2 are real number arrays generated randomly in the range 0 1 hunting is predominantly guided by alpha beta and delta wolves and omega wolves follow these pack leaders to update their locations relative to the potential prey wolves decide to attack the prey or search for a better one based on a eq 12 they will attack the prey when a 1 and continue the search for a better prey when a 1 mirjalili et al 2014 heidari and pahlavani 2017 the gwo algorithm was executed using 500 as the maximum number of iterations and 40 as the number of populations and a linear decrease rate from 2 to 0 was employed to calculate the candidate position all the above mentioned processes are shown in the pseudocode below fig 6 2 6 aet estimation the capability of an ai based model anfis and its hybrids with two bio inspired optimization algorithms namely sfla and gwo for estimating monthly aet using three types of input variables including meteorological based remotely sensed and hybrid predictors was examined table 1 eight scenarios were defined with various combinations of these predictors scenarios 1 and 2 were based on meteorological predictors given that not all predictors are measured in all synoptic stations especially in developing countries scenario 1 was designed so as to enable running the models with minimum input predictors scenarios 3 and 4 were based on remotely sensed predictors with the only difference being that scenario 4 had one additional input the swdi index in fact these two scenarios were defined in order to examine the impact of swdi on aet estimation finally scenarios 5 to 8 evaluated the combined effects of both types of predictors due to the lack of measured aet data in the study area aet values were calculated by the sebal algorithm bastiaanssen et al 1998 and used as a benchmark for training and testing of ai based models since not all parts of the watershed are utilized for agriculture the authors selected nine subbasins for calculating remotely sensed indices and estimation of aet by ai based models fig 7 these subbasins were produced using the hydrologic response unit concept in the soil and water assessment tool swat model fig 8 shows modeling flowcharts for sfla and gwo coupled with anfis anfis sfla anfis gwo as used in the present study fig 9 shows the methodology used to prepare the data and calculate the remote sensing based predictors as inputs to the ai models for estimating aet 2 7 model performance criteria three statistical indices including rmse nash sutcliffe equation nse and relative root mean square error rrmse were used for evaluating the performance of each model in estimating aet under the eight defined scenarios equations 14 16 14 r m s e i 1 n e t a c t i o b s e t a c t i e s t 2 n 0 5 15 n s e 1 i 1 n e t a c t i o b s e t a c t i e s t 2 i 1 n e t a c t i o b s e t o b s 2 16 r r m s e r m s e 1 n i 1 n e t a c t i o b s where e t a c t i o b s and e t a c t i e s t are observed and estimated actual evapotranspiration values and n refers to the number of data points also a taylor diagram which illustrates the model s accuracy based on various indices including standard deviation rmse and correlation coefficient was used for depicting the results of the best scenario of each model 3 results and discussion 3 1 remotely sensed predictors in the present study the predictors of ai models for estimating monthly aet were categorized into three groups including meteorological remotely sensed and hybrid predictors as an example fig 10 depicts the spatial distribution of remotely sensed predictors rn lst ndvi savi swdi for the entire neishaboor watershed on 13rd july 2003 after calculating the rs based predictors from satellite images boundaries of nine selected subbasins were extracted from these images and their mean values were fed into the modelling process comparison of the different parts of fig 10 indicates a significant congruence among the calculated predictors the regions with lower surface temperatures yellowy in fig 10b for instance correspond to those with higher ndvi bluish parts in fig 10c which means higher vegetation density and higher aet values in fact more solar energy is consumed as latent heat of vaporization in these regions and the weight of the λet term will be higher in the surface energy balance equation in comparison with sensible heat flux h and soil heat flux g terms the same areas appear with lighter colours and higher values on the swdi map fig 10e indicating a greater tendency towards wet conditions compared to drought endeavoring to measure aet and its parameters including stomatal conductance leaf area index lai canopy temperature tc and soil moisture sm using remotely sensed data such as ndvi savi and vvi vegetation vigour index panda et al 2019 developed a radial basis function network rbfn for estimating aet and its parameters in south eastern usa the lowest and highest rmses were 0 002 tc and 0 47 sm for switchgrass 0 007 tc and 0 08 sm for pine switchgrass and 0 016 tc and 0 055 lai for pine understory cultures 3 2 performance of ai based models error rates of anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo under the 8 defined scenarios are given in table 2 comparison of the results for testing sets of anfis and anfis sfla models under scenarios 1 and 2 meteorological based scenarios shows that the maximum use of meteorological predictors scenario 2 has decreased aet estimation error though only by about 5 3 and 6 for the two models respectively scenario 2 was also ineffective in improving the performance of anfis gwo therefore increasing the number of meteorological predictors in different ai models does not necessarily improve their performance comparison of results of the rs based scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 reveals that inclusion of the swdi predictor has noticeably improved aet estimation in testing set resulting in 12 5 17 and 26 5 decrease in error rates of anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo models respectively in training set corresponding values were 18 4 25 4 and 24 5 for the aforementioned models respectively xing et al 2018 developed a non linear model for estimating monthly aet across 24 catchments in china using budyko framework and grace derived terrestrial water storage change datasets the best budyko results were obtained for shixiali catchment with r nsce and re of 0 994 0 951 and 0 11 in validation set respectively original and modified water stress scalars in the ndvi csws method which combines meteorological observations and ndvi images derived from sentinel 2 were used to estimate aet in central italy maselli et al 2020 comparison of various statistical indices rmse 0 5 mm for modified scalars and rmse 1 26 mm for original scalars at pescia site rmse 0 57 mm for modified scalars and rmse 1 73 mm for original scalars at roselle site proved the effectiveness of modified scalars in improving aet estimation effect of the swdi predictor in improving aet estimation is also evident in the hybrid scenarios scenarios 5 to 8 with scenarios 6 and 8 having outperformed scenarios 5 and 7 respectively in both training and testing sets of all three models using scenario 6 rather than scenario 5 has reduced the error rates in testing set of anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo models by about 12 4 10 6 and 2 5 respectively and corresponding values for using scenario 8 instead of scenario 7 are approximately 11 10 1 and 7 5 respectively this finding shows that addition of the swdi predictor to the input set of models in the hybrid scenarios scenarios 5 to 8 has exerted varying effects on the accuracy of aet estimation by the various models particularly in case of the comparison between scenarios 5 and 6 and anfis has exhibited the greatest improvement in aet estimation followed by anfis sfla in training set replacing scenario 5 with scenario 6 led to 18 28 and 17 reduction in error for anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo respectively whereas corresponding values for replacing scenario 7 with scenario 8 were 18 22 and 19 for the same models respectively indicating better performance of anfis sfla and similar performance of the other two models two methods including vegetation index based estimates derived from satellite images sentinel 2 and venus sensors were used by french et al 2020 for determining aet at 6 sites in yuma and one site in maricopa arizona usa their results indicated that rmses were in the range 0 86 1 16 mm day 1 in yuma sites and 1 09 mm day 1 at maricopa granata 2019 evaluated several machine learning ml algorithms including m5p regression tree bagging rf and svr under various scenarios for aet estimation in central florida the scenario with net solar radiation sensible heat flux moisture content wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature as inputs outperformed all others with rmse 0 179 0 219 0 218 and 0 201 mm day 1 for the aforementioned algorithms respectively the highest errors for m5p and bagging algorithms ranged between 0 and 2 mm and for rf this range increased to 0 3 mm also a clear tendency to under estimate aet values above 3 mm day 1 was reported for svr an important point inferred from comparison of the results of the scenarios defined in table 2 is that the use of predictors derived from satellite imagery does not necessarily improve evapotranspiration simulation scenario 3 for example which is based on predictors derived from satellite images had higher rmse compared to scenarios 1 and 2 which are based on meteorological predictors whereas this issue is resolved in the case of scenario 4 which is also based on predictors extracted from satellite images it can be thus concluded that the type of satellite imagery based predictors i e to what extent they affect the evapotranspiration process along with the degree of uncertainty in the process of extracting these predictors can affect the accuracy of aet estimation also it should not be forgotten that the capabilities of different ai models with the same predictors may vary depending on the structure of each model in the present study for instance the greatest effect of the sfla optimization algorithm in reducing the error rate compared to the base model was observed under scenarios 2 and 4 about 12 5 whereas the gwo optimization algorithm exhibited its greatest effect under scenario 4 about 13 7 four ensemble et models with various ml classifiers namely k nearest neighbours rf svm and mlp rmse 18 21 w m 2 outperformed two conventional ensemble models rmse 23 25 w m 2 and six physically driven rs based et models rmse 26 35 w m 2 in estimating daily λe at 47 cropland sites throughout asia america and europe bai et al 2021 comparison of the results of the models presented in table 2 demonstrates that the use of bio inspired algorithms both sfla and gwo has been effective in optimizing the parameters of the base model anfis the lowest and highest decrements in error rate relative to the base model in training set were 1 2 scenario 2 of the anfis gwo model and 22 2 scenario 6 of anfis sfla respectively in testing set corresponding values were 2 5 scenario 2 of anfis gwo and 13 7 scenario 4 of anfis gwo respectively although the anfis gwo model has performed imperceptibly better than anfis sfla under scenarios 4 and 7 only in testing set examination of the results in table 2 shows that anfis sfla has outperformed anfis gwo under the other scenarios and in both training and testing sets talib et al 2021 investigated the performance of a process based land surface model lsm and two data driven models including rf and lstm long short term memory based on soil plant meteorological and rs based predictors in estimating daily aet for maize soybean and potato in midwest usa using 16 predictors rf r2 0 7 wilmott s skill score 0 9 outperformed lstm r2 0 65 wilmott s skill score 0 89 and lsm r2 0 57 wilmott s skill score 0 86 with a sample size of 4320 for maize more samples were over estimated by both rf and lstm models especially in case of aet values near 4 mm day 1 judging by model performance in testing set scenario 8 for the anfis model and scenario 4 for both anfis sfla and anfis gwo were selected as the best scenarios therefore two other statistical indices nse and rrmse are given in table 3 for scenarios 4 and 8 of all three models accordingly anfis sfla and anfis gwo have been the best performing models in training and testing sets respectively figure 11 shows taylor diagrams for all the three models under the 8 scenarios in training and testing sets which confirm the relative superiority of both anfis sfla and anfis gwo over the base model in training set in testing set anfis sfla has had lower error rates under all scenarios except scenarios 4 and 7 under which anfis gwo has exhibited a better performance although rmses in test sets of all three models and all scenarios were in the range 10 15 mm month 1 the closer distribution around the rmse 10 line for anfis sfla and anfis gwo and the more similar performance of scenarios 4 and 8 as best scenarios of anfis sfla were among the features of these models measured and estimated monthly aet values for all three models under all 8 scenarios are given in figs 12 to 14 3 2 1 model capability in different intervals for a more accurate analysis of the results of all three models performances of the best scenarios of all models were examined over three intervals including the first middle and last third of measured aet values in both training and testing sets the results of which are presented in fig 15 and table 4 also performance of all models was evaluated from the standpoint of under or over estimation of aet values over the three intervals with the results given in table 4 in training set of all models aet estimation error was higher in the last third interval compared to the other two intervals due partly to the relatively poor performance of all three models in under estimation set of last third interval for a particular group of evapotranspiration values which are marked by polygons in fig 15 the marked dots represent measured evapotranspiration values generally falling in the 75 90 mm range whereas their corresponding estimated values range between 40 and 60 mm for the anfis model and between 30 and 50 mm for the other two models relatively serious under estimation a deep neural network dnn framework was developed by elbeltagi et al 2020 for estimating validation set 2000 2017 and forecasting 2022 2038 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios monthly aet at three sites on the nile delta egypt for the proposed model rmses were in the ranges 3 21 9 43 5 01 12 56 and 4 71 10 8 mm in ad daqahliyah kafr ash shaykh and ash sharqiyah respectively an overall tendency to under estimate the aet values 45 mm and to over estimate the values between 45 and 65 mm was observed at the three sites at the first two sites estimated aet values corresponding to all measured values above 75 mm were the same in the present study estimation errors and the distribution pattern of data points were also similar for all models with over estimation set having more data points and higher error rates in the first and middle third intervals and under estimation set having more data points and higher errors in the last third interval a coupling form of tseb the land surface temperature based two source energy balance enhanced by a deep neural network tseb dnn was developed for estimating daily aet at four sites in arid and semi arid regions of china by cui et al 2021 their proposed model significantly improved aet estimation compared with the original form of tseb with r 0 87 0 93 and rmse 0 64 1 43 mm day 1 on the whole a relatively significant over estimation at guantan and under estimation at yingke and daman by the tseb dnn model for peak etact values was observed despite its overall improvement of aet estimation relative to tseb for anfis the difference in aet estimation error δrmse between under and over estimation sets in the first middle and last third intervals was about 7 27 1 83 and 10 6 mm month 1 respectively corresponding values were 3 93 5 49 and 10 42 mm month 1 for anfis sfla and 5 1 3 61 and 13 56 mm month 1 for anfis gwo therefore one can conclude that the highest and lowest degrees of similarity between under and over estimation sets in terms of aet estimation error have occurred in the middle third interval of anfis and the last third interval of anfis gwo respectively using 9 landsat 7 etm images covering 21 1 ha of olive orchard under drip irrigation in chile ortega salazar et al 2021 calibrated surface energy balance components of metric algorithm for estimating aet and kc rn h g and latent heat flux were calculated with rmses 29 46 40 and 45 w m2 respectively estimation errors for aet and kc were reported to be about 0 42 mm day 1 and 0 09 respectively the number of days with over estimation was fewer but error rates were higher in this data set in testing set and for the anfis model the lowest and highest estimation errors have occurred in the first third interval aet 18 mm month 1 rmse 10 69 and last third interval aet 48 mm month 1 rmse 12 7 respectively δrmse between under and over estimation sets of anfis were 10 42 4 96 and 6 05 in the first middle and last third intervals and the relatively higher δrmse in the first third interval is caused by the very low error in under estimation set rmse 2 98 in other words although the balance of estimation error between under and over estimation sets of anfis in the first third interval has not been as good as that in the other two intervals this i e the first interval has exhibited the best performance rmse 10 69 because it has had the lowest error rate in its under estimation set two water management parameters including aet and soil water content swc were estimated for maize using vegetation indices derived from modis products as inputs of six regression algorithms in brazil filgueiras et al 2020 among these models rf rmse 0 48 mm day 1 cubist regression rmse 0 38 mm day 1 and gbm gradient boosting machine rmse 0 4 mm day 1 outperformed the others in estimating aet with slight superiority of cubist the results showed a general trend of under estimation by rf and gbm and over estimation by cubist regression especially for values 2 mm day 1 potential of the sebal algorithm for aet estimation during summer in nile delta egypt using 18 landsat 8 images was analysed by el din fawzy et al 2021 according to statistical indices including r2 0 84 and rmse 0 26 mm day 1 the accuracy was acceptable especially in the case of over estimation in the first and last intervals of aet values lower than 7 and higher than 9 mm day 1 and under estimation for aet values falling between those intervals for anfis sfla the small aet estimation error in under estimation set of the first third interval aet 14 mm month 1 rmse 3 65 has ultimately led to the lowest error rate in this interval rmse 7 32 compared to middle third rmse 12 78 and last third rmse 12 28 intervals the most conspicuous advantage of anfis sfla compared to the base anfis model has been its better aet estimation in over estimation set of the first third interval which has been accompanied by an approximately 34 reduction of error this model has shown a relatively consistent behaviour from the viewpoint of the balance between error rates of under and over estimation sets in all three intervals namely the first δrmse 5 24 middle δrmse 5 53 and last δrmse 5 79 third interval similar to anfis sfla and for the same reason the anfis gwo model has also performed best in the first third interval rmse 9 11 relative to middle rmse 10 51 and last rmse 12 76 intervals compared to anfis sfla the anfis gwo model has decreased estimation error in under estimation set of all three intervals by about 17 18 and 3 5 in the first middle and last third respectively and also in over estimation set of middle and last third intervals by about 20 and 4 5 respectively and only in the first third interval of over estimation set it has been accompanied by an increase of estimation error by about 13 it can be therefore concluded that the main advantage of anfis gwo over anfis sfla under the best scenario scenario 4 is the former s better estimation of aet in the middle third interval 14 mm aet 44 mm similar to the training set higher error rates in over estimation set of the first and middle third intervals and in under estimation set of the last third interval is a feature of aet estimation in testing set of all the three models obviously under or over estimation of aet by simulator models and the use of such model outputs in water resources management planning at the watershed level can potentially lead to lower yields or to wastage of water resources respectively all three models show a relative tendency to under estimate the higher evapotranspiration values the last third interval and relevant management measures at the watershed scale will be necessary if the results of these models are applied 4 conclusions aet plays an essential role in water resources management both on the farm scale by determining the irrigation depth and schedule and on the watershed scale by controlling the water balance and an arid or semi arid climate adds to its importance generally this component is not measured at the watershed level especially in developing countries and its direct measurement is usually costly and only provides point values accordingly application of ai models with impressive capability for capturing nonlinear relationships and feeding satellite imagery based predictors as inputs to such models can help overcome these limitations the present study aimed to investigate the performance of a base ai model anfis and its hybrids with two optimization algorithms sfla and gwo in estimating monthly aet over 2001 2010 across neishaboor watershed in iran inputs of these models were classified into three categories including meteorological remotely sensed and hybrid predictors our results showed that the swdi predictor which is based on satellite images has served a significant role in estimating aet in all the three models reducing estimation error by 18 4 25 4 and 24 5 in training set and by 12 5 17 and 26 5 in testing set for anfis anfis sfla and anfis gwo respectively the results also indicated that the use of either optimization algorithm has been effective in improving aet estimation with the greatest decrease in error rates in testing set for anfis sfla compared to anfis being 12 5 scenarios 2 and 4 and for anfis gwo relative to anfis being 13 7 scenario 4 using rmse as the benchmark in testing phase scenario 8 of anfis rmse 11 93 nse 0 69 scenario 4 of anfis sfla rmse 11 06 nse 0 74 and scenario 4 of anfis gwo rmse 10 9 nse 0 76 were selected as the best scenarios which demonstrates the superiority of anfis sfla and anfis gwo over the base anfis model due to the smaller number of input predictors performance analysis of the models over three intervals the first middle and last third of measured aet values showed that in training set all the three models have exhibited their highest estimation errors in the last third interval in testing set the highest error rates for anfis rmse 12 7 and anfis gwo rmse 12 76 were observed in the last third interval and anfis sfla had its highest estimation error rmse 12 78 in the middle third interval overall all three models tended to over estimate aet in the first and middle third intervals and under estimate in the last third interval the best and poorest model performances were respectively observed in the first third interval under estimation set rmse 2 98 and the last third interval under estimation set rmse 14 1 for anfis first third under estimation set rmse 3 65 and middle third over estimation set rmse 14 45 for anfis sfla and first third under estimation set rmse 3 03 and last third under estimation set rmse 13 44 for anfis gwo the use of satellite imagery based predictors in the form of ai models can be considered a useful approach for estimating aet at the watershed level

3424,this review provides a synthesis of advances in our understanding of urban flood processes and their modelling over the last four years 2018 2021 four aspects are covered knowledge of urban flood flow and transport processes stability of humans and objects within flooded streets reliability of computational modelling and approaches for speeding up computations of urban flood event new laboratory setups have shed light on previously unexplored processes such as flow intrusion into buildings or contaminant exchanges between surface and underground drainage the stability of a single pedestrians or object e g vehicles waste containers under urban flooding was analysed but not group effects such as clogging improvements in computations were achieved by new strategies for merging and processing various sources of high quality topographic and forcing data e g precipitation the incorporation of more and more details on the drainage systems e g effect of gullies and 3d instead of 2d simulations computational efficiency was enhanced based on massive parallelization adaptive mesh porosity models surrogate models as well as machine learning finally crowd sourced data are shown to offer an avenue for next generation model validation methods remaining knowledge gaps and guidance for future research are proposed and predict that additional research work will be performed in following years 1 introduction managing urban flood risk is a high priority worldwide as suggested by the large number of cities from all continents taken as case studies in recent research papers dedicated to urban flood modelling more than half of the global population lives in urbanized areas and the frequency as well as intensity of hydro meteorological extremes are on the rise eea 2019 hirabayashi et al 2013 in inland urban areas the invading water may originate from a combination of local precipitations overflowing urban rivers surcharging drainage system and runoff from upstream bulti abebe 2020 in coastal areas urban flooding may additionally result from high tides storms tsunamis or effects of rising sea level in the following the focus is mainly set on floods taking place in inland urban areas urban flooding involves complex flow phenomena which vary rapidly in space due to the multiple flow paths typical of urban areas rubinato et al 2020 when water is conveyed in streets local head losses are created by the presence of obstacles such as vehicles or urban furniture as well as by the interplay between the drainage system and surface flow flow features are particularly intricate at crossroads and other configurations such as when water invades open areas courtyards parks enters buildings e g through damaged doors or windows and large underground areas malls metro stations or follows unusual flow paths resulting from the layout of obstacles present in urbanized areas moreover rapid urban flooding such as induced by flash floods leads to complex transient effects as well as to the transport of debris and objects e g vehicles containers urban furniture martínez gomariz et al 2018 computational modelling of these flow and transport processes is instrumental for guiding urban flood risk management however such modelling remains challenging not only due to the variety of processes at stake and the complexity of urban topography but also because of the broad range of expected outcomes such as predicting the loads acting on buildings or pedestrians the drift of vehicles or urban furniture the bidirectional flow exchanges between drainage system and surface flow or the dispersion of contaminants mignot et al 2019 moreover computed flow variables must reach the right level of accuracy to serve as suitable inputs for complementary analyses such as damage modelling mei et al 2020 sediment transport and morphodynamic modelling e g scour prediction an additional challenge lies in the scarcity of observational data for the verification of urban flood computations indeed such data remain mostly limited to water marks on building facades registered by visual inspection shortly after the flood event macchione et al 2019a this approach leads to a lack of suitable calibration and validation data especially in terms of velocity fields time dependent hydraulic data and accidental events such as sudden sewer overflows building intrusions and damages dams created by cars blocked at a crossroad or a street narrowing the increasing use of smartphones and of videos by citizens is a new paradigm for harvesting validation data and much current research is dedicated to extract reliable information from amateur videos and crowd sourced data moy de vitry et al 2019 modelling urban flooding is a relatively recent field of research indeed although urban floods and their impacts have been reported for centuries e g since the xiv century in the city of nîmes france research dedicated to the understanding and modelling of urban flooding remained scarce until the beginning of the 21st century beforehand pioneering contributions were made by braschi et al 1989 kinoshita et al 1996 nania 1999 djordjevic et al 1999 and heping et al 1999 conversely the past 20 years showed a dramatic increase in the number of experimental and computational studies on this topic e g mignot et al 2019 guo et al 2021a rubinato et al 2020 over the last four years 2018 2021 we identified more than sixty peer reviewed journal papers presenting substantial advances in the understanding of flow processes and modelling capacity of urban flooding in inland areas due to this high number of new contributions the present synthesis is deemed valuable for the community by focusing on the most recent contributions it provides both an update and a complement to previous more specific syntheses restricted generally either to laboratory experiments mignot et al 2019 or to computational models bulti and abebe 2020 guo et al 2021a nkwunonwo et al 2020 studies based solely on the application of existing modelling techniques to case studies were not incorporated in this review as detailed in table 1 the scope of the present review targets the specific features of flooding in urban areas in contrast it does not aim at covering general aspects of flood modelling and prediction which are not tightly linked to the urban nature of the exposed area therefore this review does not include studies on rainfall prediction nor on catchment hydrology and fluvial hydraulics in general e g brunner et al 2021 while the quality of accessible topographic data required for urban flood modelling lies in the scope of the review we do not report developments in data processing algorithms nor purely technical advances such as in geographic information systems gis similarly the review extends up to the interface between flow modelling and complementary analyses such as economic damage assessment decision support systems or resilience studies but it does not cover these complementary analyses themselves green infrastructures e g fowdar et al 2021 are also considered beyond the scope of the present review in which the focus is set on the hydraulic mechanisms involved in urban flooding the review is organized in two main sections section 2 summarizes recent research works on understanding urban flood flow processes and vulnerability factors derived both from experimental and numerical approaches section 3 presents advances in numerical modelling of urban flooding aiming either at enhancing the accuracy of computational predictions section 3 1 or at speeding up the computations section 3 2 fig 1 provides an overview of the number of studies reviewed in each section of this paper finally a discussion and concluding remarks are given in section 4 2 physical understanding of urban floods and associated vulnerability 2 1 flow processes mignot et al 2019 reviewed the experimental studies and datasets published before 2018 aiming at advancing our understanding of flow processes during urban flooding such as flows at crossroads in street networks and urban districts as well as flow exchanges between surface and urban drainage systems table 2 summarizes 19 more recent studies pursuing the same goal most of them involve laboratory experiments which also deliver quantitative well documented data of high value for validating current and new computational models in table 2 the studies are classified according to the modelling approach experimental vs computational the extent of the considered domain single street vs urban district including or not urban drainage pipes the source of water from rain over the studied domain runoff over the upstream catchment or from the surcharged urban drainage system as well as the type of analysed data discharge partition in street networks or at manholes flow depths and velocities as detailed below six laboratory setups reported here are totally new and were not included in the previous review by mignot et al 2019 several recent studies focused on the prediction of flow exchanges between surface and urban drainage at the technical university of catalonia barcelona spain gómez et al 2019 used a laboratory platform representing a road lane at prototype scale to estimate orifice discharge coefficients through an urban drainage inlet under surcharging sewer flow conditions the coefficients were found not to vary with the road slope based on a new experimental setup at the university of wuppertal germany kemper schlenkhoff 2019 developed an empirical formula to estimate the type specific hydraulic capacity of grate inlets with supercritical surface flows the experiments represent a single steep sloped street with water supplied upstream the parameters influencing the grate inlet capacity are the flow depth and velocity upstream of the grate as well as the grate characteristics dimensions and orientation of the bars in contrast with the tests performed by gómez et al 2019 and kemper schlenkhoff 2019 other recent experiments include an explicit representation of urban drainage pipes in the laboratory four recent studies are based on an experimental setup installed at the university of sheffield and already reported by mignot et al 2019 the setup is a 1 6 scale representation of a single street linked to a single urban drainage pipe by a manhole rubinato et al 2018b measured the inflow discharge into the manhole under steady surface inundation conditions weir and orifice discharge coefficients were determined for a range of grate designs and a 2d finite difference model was validated in terms of simulated flow depths around the inlet with a 2d surface particle image velocimetry technique martins et al 2018a measured for the first time details of the velocity field in the vicinity of the manhole with ten different grate designs only drainage flow was considered under subcritical surface flow conditions a 2d numerical model was also assessed rubinato et al 2018a quantified energy losses within the manhole for surcharging and non surcharging outflow conditions the tests enabled evaluating the influence of a manhole lid and of a shallow flow on the surface as well as validating a computational model beg et al 2020 used the same experimental setup to quantify flow and solute mass exchange through the manhole with the aim of better understanding how pollutant is released from the sewer network to the street surface during urban flooding in the same experimental facility rubinato et al 2021 considered a variety of street configurations involving parking slots cars on the road and various locations of the manhole on the street to generate a novel dataset covering flow exchanges energy losses and quantification of exchanges of soluble pollutant from the sewer to the surface during urban flooding dong et al 2021 used a new laboratory setup at north china university of water resources and electric power it consists in a 16 m long and 3 m wide model of a single street with an urban drainage pipe underneath in their tests dong et al 2021 analysed the influence of varying the number of buildings and the spacing in between them on the flow generated by a dam break at the street inlet hydrographs flow depths and velocities were recorded in unsteady conditions at several points and the predictions of a 2d finite volume model were compared to the observations another new setup at inrae lyon france was used by chibane et al 2021 in its present form it involves a single street connected to a single urban drainage pipe by means of up to two drains and it was used for evaluating the influence of the flow exchange both under drainage and surcharged configurations on the 3d velocity field and water depth in the street near and downstream from the connections this new dataset is valuable to validate numerical models including vertical exchange flows through manholes another research topic which was hardly explored in the past is the quantification of water intrusion into buildings zhou et al 2016 liu et al 2018 sturm et al 2018 during urban floods a new experimental dataset collected at insa lyon france is presented by mignot et al 2020 it was obtained using a scale model of a single building façade with various openings door window gate conducted measurements include the discharge partition between the street and through the façade along with flow depths and velocity fields in the street the novel experimental facility used by chibane et al 2021 was also used by mejía morales et al 2021 under another configuration to study at reduced scale flood flows in the vicinity of an urban block surrounded by four streets the number and positioning of door like openings along the faces of the urban block were varied and their influence was assessed in terms of exchange flow with the streets flow depth and velocity in the streets and in the block as well as danger for pedestrians notable effects were found in the near field of the openings while all studies mentioned above are based on laboratory setups representing at most four streets with or without a single conduit underneath finaud guyot et al 2018 2019 investigated the discharge partition in a 1 200 scale model of an urban district 14 streets which was already analysed earlier by arrault et al 2016 due to the multi scale nature of urban flooding at the district level the scale model of finaud guyot et al 2018 2019 was geometrically distorted i e the scale factor along the vertical direction is ten times lower than the horizontal one this approach was also used in earlier studies of urban flooding e g güney et al 2014 haltas et al 2016a b smith et al 2016 the possible bias induced by this geometric distortion was studied by li et al 2019 the effect of geometric distortion of scale models of urban flooding was further analysed by li et al 2020 2021 based on a comprehensive series of numerical computations and dedicated laboratory tests on a new experimental set up seong et al 2020 used a new 1 200 scale representation of an urban district in sadang south korea unlike all other experiments mentioned above water was supplied to the scale model by means of a rainfall simulator with an intensity ranging between 80 and 200 mm h intricate measurements of flow depth and surface velocity were performed under falling rain for similar pluvial flooding conditions bruwier et al 2020 investigated computationally the influence of the layout of buildings in a synthetic urban area on flow variables such as the flow hydrograph at the outlet of the considered urban district as well as the evolution of flow depths bruwier et al 2018 performed the same type of analyses for the case of flood water originating from upstream drainage or river overflow instead of local rain overall these recent pieces of research aiming at improving our knowledge of flow processes in urban flooding tackle both previously studied processes e g water exchanges between surface and underground drainage system flow partition within a network of streets and newly explored processes such as the flow intrusion towards a building mignot et al 2020 the effects of geometric distortion on street flows li et al 2019 2020 and the release of contaminants by a surcharging sewer beg et al 2020 rubinato et al 2021 still in line with the list drawn by mignot et al 2019 in their table 2 other gaps in existing data remain such as the flow processes in a street network in supercritical regime flow exchanges between a network of streets and a network of pipes chibane et al 2018 or pollution furniture and trash dispersion in a street network 2 2 stability of humans and objects results from hydraulic modelling are often used to predict the stability of pedestrians during urban flooding as this information is of utmost importance for planning safe evacuation routes and rescue operations empirical closures are needed to assess pedestrians stability based on computed flow variables while such closures have been proposed for over a decade e g kvocka et al 2016 martínez gomariz et al 2016 they were further improved over the last few years with new measurement campaigns as shown in table 3 postacchini et al 2021 developed a novel laboratory approach in which a physical model of a human body is towed by an engine in water at rest and hydraulic forces and moments applied on the body are measured according to the measurements conducted for a range of flow depth and velocity the stability condition differs substantially whether the body front or the body back faces the flow this contrasts with previous research in which both positions were considered similar as regards pedestrian stability based on a re analysis of field measurements during a major flood event in brisbane australia chanson and brown 2018 suggested that the influence of local topographic effects and debris was underestimated in previous research leading to unsafe assessment of the stability of pedestrians they proposed new more conservative guidelines however simulations of safe evacuation during urban flooding requires not only stability criteria but also estimates of the speed of motion of individuals in flowing water baba et al 2017 recently bernardini et al 2020 involved 200 volunteers in laboratory experiments of evacuation in still water their results enable quantifying the speed of isolated pedestrians as a function of flow depth and body characteristics such as age height and mass the results highlight that fire or general purpose databases of evacuation speed should not be used for analyses in floodwaters due to a strong reduction of speed induced by water forces evaluating the stability of vehicles during urban flooding is also of paramount importance not only because drifting vehicles may endanger pedestrians or rescue services but also because the number of people perishing in vehicles made unstable by floodwaters is reported to grow globally complementing earlier experimental works martínez gomariz et al 2017 2018 smith et al 2019 present a novel series of tests using full scale vehicles various flow depths buoyancy conditions vehicle types and bed surface concrete gravel or sand were tested the observations were combined with measurements in smaller scale laboratory tests to derive stability criteria applying to a broad range of vehicles in a recent review bocanegra et al 2020 highlighted the need for improvement and standardization in the vehicle stability criteria used across various studies during urban flooding pedestrians also face the danger of being hit by drifting urban objects urban furniture trash etc such as waste containers which are used in many cities worldwide martínez gomariz et al 2020 derived new stability criteria for waste containers based on an analytical model and proposed adaptation measures note that waste containers made unstable may lead to street damming and are likely to induce environmental and health risks due to contaminated material possibly released in the floodwaters the stability of single pedestrians vehicles or other objects such as waste containers is today comprehensively assessed and lead to formally similar expressions in terms of flow depth and velocity data which remain missing concern mainly group effects such as i several objects vehicles containers or other made unstable transported and possibly clogging a street or a narrow path ii stability and speed of motion of several interacting pedestrians typically evacuating towards shelters moreover most tests reported above were conducted under controlled experimental conditions even if performed at full scale so that the derived criteria still need verification in real world conditions as conducted by chanson and brown 2018 for the case of pedestrians 3 computational models validated computational models are particularly valuable for guiding disaster risk reduction strategies in practice they permit both to reproduce historical events for which validation data is available and simulate scenarios for various return periods and anticipating changes in climate conditions and land use several reviews of urban flood modelling were recently published by authors such as bulti and abebe 2020 guo et al 2021a and nkwunonwo et al 2020 rosenzweig et al 2021 recently listed remaining challenges of such modelling notably with respect to access to input data e g sewer system location of buildings topography from gis databases precipitation data processing of data e g building treatment method coupling method of overland flow models e g with sewer pipe system groundwater model green infrastructure access to validation data for historical events e g in situ measurements crowdsourcing and flow characteristics within the sewer network translate hydrodynamics results in terms of flow variables flow depths flood extent to damage and or risk data and maps the 40 reviewed novel contributions are classified into two categories first category deals with efforts made to improve the agreement of simulations outcomes with reference data section 3 1 second category deals with efforts aiming at reducing the runtime of computational models or increasing the domain size section 3 2 some overlap exists between the two categories since in the latter the pursued objective is generally to reach an optimal balance between computational efficiency and accuracy 3 1 improving urban flood numerical simulations accuracy recent contributions aiming at improving the ability of urban flood computational models to match observations were structured along four main groups in table 4 first a lot of attention was paid to the influence of topographic data including digital elevation model dem and building treatment methods btm as well as their processing e g merging various data sources the influence of landcover data resolution and roughness parametrization was also studied a second group of papers analysed the effects on model outputs of characteristics and spatial distribution of forcing inputs boundary conditions such as rainfall or inflow hydrograph in the third group the influence of sewer flow modelling was evaluated particularly as regards the numerical representation of the modelling interconnections between overland flow and sewer flow finally a fourth group of studies aimed at collecting more validation data including non conventional data and improving their quality recent contributions along these four lines are detailed in the following paragraphs 3 1 1 digital elevation model dem and building treatment method btm several recent studies focused on the representation of buildings in the computational model schubert sanders 2012 defined three standard building treatment methods the building resistance br method in which a high local roughness is assigned to the cells occupied by buildings the building block bb method in which the topography is raised up to the roof level over the building footprint and the building hole bh method which excludes the footprint of the buildings from the computational domain using a 2d shallow water model mustafa and szydłowski 2021 compared the br and bb methods for predicting time series of pointwise water levels in a reduced scale experiment representing a hypothetical network of buildings flooded by a dam break wave they highlighted a strong sensitivity of the model outcomes to the value of the roughness parameter assigned to the buildings in the br method and the superiority of the bb method for simulating realistic flow fields within an urban area bermúdez zischg 2018 performed a similar comparison by considering also the bh method and extending their analysis to the effects of the building treatment method on damage estimation at the micro scale building level for a real world case study covering an area of about 5 km2 close to bern switzerland they found that the building treatment method had little effect on exposure i e number of elements at risk which depends on flood extent but a substantial influence on the flow depth attributed to each building among the tested methods attributing the maximum flow depth of all nodes within the building footprint and a specified buffer distance to the building showed robust results in the sense that it reduced the influence of the building treatment method on damage estimates considering a pluvial flooding event in 2016 in wuhan china shen et al 2018 tested a different building representation in their approach ground surface elevations are raised by the building entrance height compared to nearby ground level and a high value of roughness coefficient is assigned to areas within the building footprints to account for resistance due to inner walls they report an improved model performance for the same case study shen tan 2020 showed that a high resolution resampling of the dem close to buildings improves the computations the influence of dem resolution 17 35 and 70 m and representations of buildings and roads was also investigated by geng et al 2020 for the case of pluvial flooding 2 and 10 year design storms in a densely urbanized district of nanjing china the bb method was compared to an alternate approach in which the elevation of roads was reduced by a predefined value corresponding to a standard kerb height so that roads act as shallow drainage channels in the considered case study the terrain resolution had a stronger influence on the accuracy of flow depth and flood extent estimates than the representation of buildings and roads considering the overwhelming influence of topographic data and the uncertainties affecting such data recent studies emphasized the value of merging several data sources for a small urban area 2 8 km2 in italy arrighi campo 2019 compared flood extents flow depths and building level damage estimates using four dems constructed based on raw data from a lidar survey raw data with building footprints filled by linear interpolation of terrain elevations raw data with bb method and the same merged with additional elevation data surveyed in the field local differences between dem data and field surveyed elevation points were generally small 0 26 m bias but reached up to 2 5 m locally an assimilation technique was used to merge the two data sources lidar and field survey weighted by the inverse of their uncertainties in the considered case study the data merging brought limited improvement due to the limited differences between the two datasets along the same line leitão de sousa 2018 assessed the influence on modelling results of various methods for merging airborne lidar and uav photogrammetry data they provide evidence for the necessity of advanced merging techniques which take into consideration the systematic inaccuracies of the individual datasets this was found particularly important when the merging boundaries are parallel to the contour lines topographic data resampling techniques generally used to avoid excessive simulation runtimes often result in blurred representation of small scale urban and topographical features e g narrow paths between buildings are incorrectly represented to address this issue ramsauer et al 2021 implemented virtual surface links between buildings to mimic the flow paths of a high resolution model when applied to a synthetic rainfall case study the virtual surface links demonstrated a substantial improvement but the magnitude of the improvement primarily depends on the size density and arrangement of the buildings in each specific floodplain using extremely fine resolution terrain data 10 cm in an urban flood case study in the uk de almeida et al 2018 demonstrated that decimetre scale alterations in the elevation of streets can lead to remarkable differences in predicted flow data on one hand this makes urban flood modelling challenging since such small scale topographic details are rarely available for practical engineering studies and considering them would lead to prohibitive computational costs on the other hand slight alterations in the topography at tactically selected locations proved sufficient to guide flow to low impact zones e g parks and away from key vulnerable assets this creates new opportunities for flood mitigation however such conclusions seem case specific and strongly dependent on the studied events and topography of floodplains as suggested by yalcin 2020 who comes to conclusions somehow contrasting with those of de almeida et al 2018 for the case of an urban floodplain in kirsehir turkey affected by a 500 year flood scenario yalcin 2020 compared 19 combinations of resolutions used for dem 0 04 to 10 m manning roughness layer 2 to 25 m and computational grid 2 m to 25 m the computations with 10 m cell size performed similarly to the very fine resolution so that very fine resolution of topography and high resolution landcover were judged unnecessary in the tested case in a game changing contribution rong et al 2020 demonstrated the potential of 3d computational fluid dynamics compared to conventional 2d approaches for a flooding case study in a coastal city due to storm surges data inferred from digital aerial photogrammetry enabled reproducing more realistic flow patterns than when the 3d flow model is combined with a standard dem particularly in the presence of narrow streets and complex topographic features or when a 2d flow model is used moreover the use of building information model bim combined with 3d computational fluid dynamics enables extending the flood simulation inside the buildings as the flow enters through openings 3 1 2 effect of forcing inputs and friction based on a depth averaged surface flow model paquier et al 2020 simulated two real world cases in france 2000 pluvial flooding in marseilles and 2008 river flooding in oulins with the aim of assessing uncertainties arising from forcing inputs such as rainfall spatial distribution over the domain or upstream hydrograph in the river in the first case study rainfall distribution was found to change peak flow depths more than any other input parameter in the second case study flood level in the river has more influence than e g the building treatment method using a hydro inundation model i e surface flow model incorporating also a rainfall runoff module mei et al 2020 studied the influence of a design rainstorm on inundation and damage levels for a field case study xiamen island in china several design rainstorms corresponding to various return periods asymmetry and durations constant volume were compared the authors show that for a given rainfall volume intensity is the key factor influencing inundated area flow depth and direct damage to buildings while the effect of rainfall pattern is slightly weaker based on variance decomposition methods chen et al 2018 conducted spatial global sensitivity analysis of shallow water models applied to steady subcritical flood flows in an experimental setup representing an idealized urban district in the considered setting flow depth variance is explained at almost 70 by prescribed downstream flow depth to less than 10 by the friction coefficient and to less than 25 by the upstream discharge for supercritical cases sensitivity to friction coefficient is higher 3 1 3 effect of sewer systems modelling and interactions with surface flow guo et al 2021a and nkwunonwo et al 2020 listed the numerical models available to simulate surcharging sewer networks and overland surface flows these models are generally referred to as dual drainage models djordjevic et al 1999 as they involve the coupling of a 1d sewer flow model and a 2d overland flow model anni et al 2020 revealed that for the case of a pluvial flooding event in tuscaloosa usa incorporating or not stormwater infrastructures in the modelling changed the flood volumes by factors 8 to 20 depending on the return period the same flood simulations were also sensitive to the spatial explicitness of soil input data pervious vs impervious moreover based on comparisons with full scale laboratory experiments and the simulation of a storm event in beijing china hao et al 2021 stress the importance of representing bidirectional flow exchanges and initial surface runoff dynamics while accounting for the pressure needed to lift manhole cover only marginally improves the results still a remaining major challenge for such urban flood simulations is the scarcity of data on location and characteristics of stormwater infrastructures bulti and abebe 2020 analysed the necessary level of detail in representing the connections between surface flow and sewer network should each inlet be modelled or does lumping the exchanges at the level of manholes provide sufficient accuracy for the case of a high intensity storm in 2015 in taipei city taiwan jang et al 2018 showed that modelling individual inlets performs considerably better in terms of comparison with field observations of flood extent modelling not only sewer pipes but also gullies which act as buffers between surface and sewer further improves the agreement with field observations for the same 2015 storm and for a milder one which occurred in 1993 jang et al 2019 similar conclusions were obtained by chang et al 2018 by simulating three historical flood events in another district of taipei the extra computational time for inclusion of flow processes in gullies was deemed limited compared to the gain in accuracy martins et al 2018b focused on the influence of the sewer flow model by comparing four different sewer flow models for a case study in bradford uk the authors found an overall good agreement between the model outcomes with differences in estimated damage of the order of 6 in a recent contribution quintana romero leandro 2021 compared seven model structures involving overland flow representation by various combinations of 1d and or 2d models and sewer flow representation either computed using 1d models or being neglected the results of the model structures were evaluated based on data from a 2007 flash flood in the town of baiersdorf germany characterized by a heterogeneous urban density several model structures performed as well as a full 1d 2d dual drainage model and the model outcome uncertainties were found highly spatially variable a lagrangian transport model coupled to a sewer overland flow model 1d 2d dual drainage model was introduced by sämann et al 2019 to compute the transport of solute originating from surcharged sewers and to predict the resulting pollution spreading in streets during an urban pluvial flooding a random walk approach was used for mixing and dispersion calculation the impact of various simplifications in the hydrodynamic model was assessed but no useful simplification could be recommended particularly the authors showed that the flow patterns are better captured by hydrodynamic models than by simplified ones and that a high temporal resolution of the flow field is required to reproduce short duration changes in contaminant paths 3 1 4 validation data the scarcity of available data for model elaboration calibration and validation is another major challenge hampering the development of flood modelling and management models molinari et al 2019 to overcome this considerable efforts were made to retrieve valuable data from unconventional sources such as crowd sourced data to reconstruct hydraulic data from an urban flood event in the town of crotone italy macchione et al 2019a combined amateur videos photographs traditional topographic surveys news reports among others they proposed a methodology to merge various conventional and unconventional sources of information scotti et al 2020 presented another integrated approach for the reconstruction of temporal and spatial patterns of a flood event for the case of hurricane harvey in houston texas usa in 2017 they combined satellite images and markers from social media hydraulic for effectively calibrating and validating the outcomes of their hydraulic model authors showed that merging various data sources helps coping with the high uncertainties affecting each individual source of information moy de vitry et al 2019 used existing surveillance cameras to infer insights on the flood level evolution their image processing technique relies on a deep convolutional neural network trained based on over 1 2000 flooding images the system was deemed cheap versatile scalable and transferable to other sites 3 2 reducing the computational time of urban flood modelling improving the computational performance of urban flood models is of utmost importance for a range of reasons e g bates 2022 first this contributes to handling larger domains at a higher spatial resolution and or over longer time horizons second this is particularly relevant for models used not only in planning phase but also for forecasting and crisis management purposes since in that case model outputs are required in real time various strategies are currently explored to accelerate urban flood calculations the 19 reviewed publications were separated in four groups corresponding to four main acceleration strategies a massive parallelization group 1 an adaptative mesh group 2 the use of a porosity model group 3 and the use of surrogate models and machine learning group 4 see table 5 3 2 1 massive parallelization massive parallelization techniques are one avenue to speed up urban flood calculations the use of graphic processing units gpu is particularly efficient as it enables leveraging thousands of processors within a single device based on a gpu implementation of a hydrodynamic model xing et al 2019 simulated in nearly real time a flood event over a 268 km2 urbanised area at 2 m spatial resolution i e with about 67million computational cells by comparing model outcomes for five different spatial resolutions the authors revealed a high sensitivity of model outcomes due to the inability of coarser resolutions to resolve narrow flow paths narrow rivers small roads and flow paths between buildings hence reducing the connectivity in densely urbanized areas similarly restricting the computation to localized subdomains introduces large simulation errors fernández pato garcía navarro 2021 presented the first gpu implementation of a coupled dual drainage model including overland and sewer flow along with exchanges between both models and pollutant transport both in the sewer network and on the surface this gpu model was applied to real world cases for which it led to speed up factors of the order of 100 compared to a standard cpu computation 3 2 2 adaptive mesh an alternate approach to accelerate urban flood computation consists in using a dynamically adaptive meshing technique enabling the mesh to adapt in space and time as a function of the evolution of flow features hu et al 2018 used the hessian matrix of flow depth and velocity to adapt the mesh every 10 time steps with the algorithm gmsh geuzaine remacle 2009 for a real world case study the method provided accurate results with a computation time reduced by a factor of about 2 3 2 3 porosity models porosity models use a subgrid modelling technique to speed up simulations of overland flow the flow computations are performed on a relatively coarse grid while information on the sub grid scale topography is preserved through additional parameters referred to as porosities guinot soares frazão 2006 mcmillan brasington 2007 sanders et al 2008 these parameters reflect the effects of obstacles on storage in the cells and on flow conveyance between the cells alternate names have also been used for the porosity parameters such as building coverage ratio and conveyance reduction factor chen et al 2012 or area and width reduction factors haltas et al 2016a b porosity models are classified as single or dual porosity depending on the types of considered porosity parameters and as differential or integral depending on their mathematical formulation over the last years major improvements were brought to these models dewals et al 2021 guinot et al 2018 introduced depth dependent porosities as a generalization of the dual integral porosity model which was proposed earlier by guinot et al 2017 to fix erroneous wave celerities arising in the original integral porosity model of sanders et al 2008 to reduce the mesh sensitivity of the porosity models ferrari et al 2019 tested an isotropic single porosity formulation for the fluxes complemented by anisotropic conveyance porosities in the estimation of flow resistance with the same objective viero 2019 implemented a dual porosity model in which the conveyance porosity is not evaluated at the cell interfaces but at the level of a computational cell along the same line an algorithm for the cell based determination of the conveyance porosity for real world urban areas was presented by ferrari and viero 2020 their approach performs well for a single obstacle in a computational cell but not in the presence of multiple obstacles varra et al 2020 introduced a novel local differential porosity model formulation referred to as the binary single porosity model it was derived regardless of the existence of a representative elementary volume as assumed in the derivation of earlier differential porosity models guinot soares frazão 2006 the variety of approaches being currently developed emphasizes the need for further research on modelling of anisotropic conveyance effects in urban flood porosity models costabile et al 2020 systematically compared the outcomes of a single porosity model to those of a standard fully dynamic shallow water model and a simplified zero inertia model unlike previous model benchmarking often restricted to comparisons of flooded extents and flow depths costabile et al 2020 also evaluated the flow velocities and the product of flow depth and velocity which is a determinant for flood impacts the results reveal that a dynamic wave model is necessary in all situations where not only the flood extent needs to be predicted but also the flood impacts both the porosity model and the zero inertia model lead to wrong estimations of the depth velocity product 3 2 4 surrogate models and machine learning many recent studies explored radically different approaches to speed up urban flood computations namely machine learning in a recent review of urban drainage models based on machine learning kwon and kim 2021 point at the extensive use of such models to advance model performance and efficiency machine learning models are trained based on detailed hydrodynamic data mostly water depths and velocities and can then deliver fast predictions of flow patterns over large areas for scenarios slightly departing from the configurations used for the training two types of machine learning approaches can be identified as a function of the origin of data used to train the model first type considers output data from process based numerical calculations performed for a range of input parameters topography boundary conditions etc second type considers the data measured on site and collected from historical events but without any hydraulic calculation for the first type training data are output from hydraulic models a binary logistic regression model embedded in a gis system was presented by feng et al 2020 and applied to a 100 km2 catchment in london ontario canada with reductions in computational time by three orders of magnitude bermúdez et al 2018 tested two computationally efficient surrogate models the first one combines a detailed 1d sewer network model with a gis volume spreading algorithm for overland flow in the second approach a conceptual lumped sewer and flood model is derived based on a blend of data driven and physically based components as well as pre simulated flood maps both approaches provide results of comparable accuracy as a detailed hydraulic model at a fraction of the computational cost speed up factor up to 104 kriging was used by contreras et al 2020 to interpolate flow variables from a database of 49 pre simulated scenarios generated by means of high fidelity hydrological and hydraulic models a critical factor to design the database is the coverage of the entire range of possible storm characteristics kim et al 2019 and kim and han 2020 used a 1d 2d coupled model to produce the training data to learn the relationship between rainfall and overflow and inundation area resulting from manhole overflows the database used by berkhahn et al 2019 and rözer et al 2021 for training and testing of their ann real time water level prediction model was generated with the 2d hydrodynamic model hystem extran 2d he 2d guo et al 2021b used a cellular automate and a hydrodynamic model to train deep convolutional neural networks for predicting flow depth for urban pluvial flooding for the second type training data are historical measured data wu et al 2020 used 14 historical rainfall and flooding records from 2013 to 2016 in zhengzhou city china 11 for training and 3 for validating their machine learning model aiming at predicting flow depth maps the most important parameters for the training are the road and building occupation ratio the soil permeability the grassland and forestland occupation ratios darabi et al 2019 2020 used flood historical database obtained from sari city authority over the period 2015 2017 precipitation slope curve number distance to river distance to channel depth to groundwater land use and elevation were used to train the machine learning model hydraulics data were then transferred to vulnerability maps the authors concluded that distance to channel land use and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination whereas population density quality of buildings and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability the model used by lei et al 2021 was trained using the 295 locations of flooding in the city of seoul korea in the period 2018 2020 as a function of 10 flood affecting factors terrain ruggedness index bed slope bed elevation and topographic wetness index appear to be the dominant factors to predict the inundation locations 4 discussions and conclusion this review provides a synthesis of current knowledge in the understanding and modelling of urban flood processes it is based on journal papers published over the last four years 2018 2021 and it is structured along four lines understanding of urban flood processes stability and evacuation realism and accuracy of computational modelling and speed up of computations the review highlights the maturity of the field nevertheless numerous open questions still to be addressed for improving our understanding and modelling capacity of urban flood flow processes some examples are given below currently available laboratory and field observations miss information on important flow and transport processes flow exchanges between sewer and surface were measured only in idealized settings involving a single street with a single pipe underneath observations of the interactions between a sewer network and a surface street network are still lacking measurements of flow intrusion inside buildings remain also limited while such exchanges alter flow patterns in the streets and danger for pedestrians little is known on the dispersion in a street network of contaminants released by surcharging sewers similar questions exist for the particulate transport of trash urban furniture vehicles and other debris besides laboratory studies have enabled assessing the stability conditions of an isolated pedestrian vehicle or piece of urban furniture verification of these results for real world conditions remain scarce and no information is available on group effects such as the evacuation of a group of pedestrians from a flooded mall or metro station the same type of knowledge gaps exists for groups of floating objects or vehicles likely to clog narrow flow paths or singularities such as crossroads improved methodologies for merging data from various sources pave the way for increasingly accurate representations of small scale topographic features and forcings in computational models such methodologies are instrumental for taking full benefit of extreme high resolution e g sub metric remote sensing data de almeida et al 2018 techniques such as gpu based massive parallelization or machine learning have proved successful for speeding up calculations while theoretical advances are still needed with respect to some modelling concepts such as the incorporation of anisotropic conveyance effects in porosity based urban flood models for the computation of transport processes debris vehicles contaminants existing modelling paradigms e g lagrangian vs eulerian 2d vs 3d still need to be compared among each other and with measured concentration maps to point at the most effective calculation strategies during urban floods usually of short duration collecting flow depth and velocity observations is particularly challenging according to macchione et al 2019a among the ten best documented urban flood events three of them contain no suitable data for validating flow computations and the others include only watermarks the recent proliferation of mobile phones and online video sharing platforms gives access to countless amateur videos le coz et al 2016 kankanamge et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a which are being used in most geophysical sciences urban floods are particularly well documented by such crowd sourced data since they occur in densely populated areas moreover the presence of urban furniture and easily identifiable geometric features of buildings facilitate the estimation of water level and surface flow velocity from image processing algorithms difficulties with retrieving the location and time of the scenes impairs the use of these data for detailed model validation surveillance cameras are another potential source of validation data even if access to recorded data by scientists is hindered by legal barriers for privacy reasons conversely accessing validation data for the sewer component of dual drainage models appears much more intricate anni et al 2020 chang et al 2018 a particular impediment to advances in the science of urban flood modelling is that conclusions of most studies remain genuinely site specific in their formulation major steps forward could be taken by attempting to extract generic knowledge from collections of existing case studies although challenging this may be achieved by designing appropriate metrics for classifying and standardizing the definition of flooding scenarios investigated processes and effects of analysed variables e g model settings finally several of the reviewed studies demonstrate considerable recent efforts for translating the flow modelling results into information and data of direct use for impact assessment and risk communication among others darabi et al 2019 2020 and wang et al 2021 plotted vulnerability and risk maps mejía morales et al 2021 used stability curves for pedestrians to draw danger maps and mei et al 2020 mapped monetary damage for a range of flood frequencies to communicate the computed flow characteristics texture mapping techniques are used for synthesizing realistic 3d images of the urban fabric under various flooding scenarios macchione et al 2019b wang et al 2019 costabile et al 2021 moreover the calculation results are more and more communicated through web services shen et al 2020 heyer et al 2020 nonetheless as recently highlighted by rosenzweig et al 2021 further efforts should be dedicated to bridge the gaps between advances in hydrodynamic modelling and their transfer towards improved studies by water managers and engineering offices declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3424,this review provides a synthesis of advances in our understanding of urban flood processes and their modelling over the last four years 2018 2021 four aspects are covered knowledge of urban flood flow and transport processes stability of humans and objects within flooded streets reliability of computational modelling and approaches for speeding up computations of urban flood event new laboratory setups have shed light on previously unexplored processes such as flow intrusion into buildings or contaminant exchanges between surface and underground drainage the stability of a single pedestrians or object e g vehicles waste containers under urban flooding was analysed but not group effects such as clogging improvements in computations were achieved by new strategies for merging and processing various sources of high quality topographic and forcing data e g precipitation the incorporation of more and more details on the drainage systems e g effect of gullies and 3d instead of 2d simulations computational efficiency was enhanced based on massive parallelization adaptive mesh porosity models surrogate models as well as machine learning finally crowd sourced data are shown to offer an avenue for next generation model validation methods remaining knowledge gaps and guidance for future research are proposed and predict that additional research work will be performed in following years 1 introduction managing urban flood risk is a high priority worldwide as suggested by the large number of cities from all continents taken as case studies in recent research papers dedicated to urban flood modelling more than half of the global population lives in urbanized areas and the frequency as well as intensity of hydro meteorological extremes are on the rise eea 2019 hirabayashi et al 2013 in inland urban areas the invading water may originate from a combination of local precipitations overflowing urban rivers surcharging drainage system and runoff from upstream bulti abebe 2020 in coastal areas urban flooding may additionally result from high tides storms tsunamis or effects of rising sea level in the following the focus is mainly set on floods taking place in inland urban areas urban flooding involves complex flow phenomena which vary rapidly in space due to the multiple flow paths typical of urban areas rubinato et al 2020 when water is conveyed in streets local head losses are created by the presence of obstacles such as vehicles or urban furniture as well as by the interplay between the drainage system and surface flow flow features are particularly intricate at crossroads and other configurations such as when water invades open areas courtyards parks enters buildings e g through damaged doors or windows and large underground areas malls metro stations or follows unusual flow paths resulting from the layout of obstacles present in urbanized areas moreover rapid urban flooding such as induced by flash floods leads to complex transient effects as well as to the transport of debris and objects e g vehicles containers urban furniture martínez gomariz et al 2018 computational modelling of these flow and transport processes is instrumental for guiding urban flood risk management however such modelling remains challenging not only due to the variety of processes at stake and the complexity of urban topography but also because of the broad range of expected outcomes such as predicting the loads acting on buildings or pedestrians the drift of vehicles or urban furniture the bidirectional flow exchanges between drainage system and surface flow or the dispersion of contaminants mignot et al 2019 moreover computed flow variables must reach the right level of accuracy to serve as suitable inputs for complementary analyses such as damage modelling mei et al 2020 sediment transport and morphodynamic modelling e g scour prediction an additional challenge lies in the scarcity of observational data for the verification of urban flood computations indeed such data remain mostly limited to water marks on building facades registered by visual inspection shortly after the flood event macchione et al 2019a this approach leads to a lack of suitable calibration and validation data especially in terms of velocity fields time dependent hydraulic data and accidental events such as sudden sewer overflows building intrusions and damages dams created by cars blocked at a crossroad or a street narrowing the increasing use of smartphones and of videos by citizens is a new paradigm for harvesting validation data and much current research is dedicated to extract reliable information from amateur videos and crowd sourced data moy de vitry et al 2019 modelling urban flooding is a relatively recent field of research indeed although urban floods and their impacts have been reported for centuries e g since the xiv century in the city of nîmes france research dedicated to the understanding and modelling of urban flooding remained scarce until the beginning of the 21st century beforehand pioneering contributions were made by braschi et al 1989 kinoshita et al 1996 nania 1999 djordjevic et al 1999 and heping et al 1999 conversely the past 20 years showed a dramatic increase in the number of experimental and computational studies on this topic e g mignot et al 2019 guo et al 2021a rubinato et al 2020 over the last four years 2018 2021 we identified more than sixty peer reviewed journal papers presenting substantial advances in the understanding of flow processes and modelling capacity of urban flooding in inland areas due to this high number of new contributions the present synthesis is deemed valuable for the community by focusing on the most recent contributions it provides both an update and a complement to previous more specific syntheses restricted generally either to laboratory experiments mignot et al 2019 or to computational models bulti and abebe 2020 guo et al 2021a nkwunonwo et al 2020 studies based solely on the application of existing modelling techniques to case studies were not incorporated in this review as detailed in table 1 the scope of the present review targets the specific features of flooding in urban areas in contrast it does not aim at covering general aspects of flood modelling and prediction which are not tightly linked to the urban nature of the exposed area therefore this review does not include studies on rainfall prediction nor on catchment hydrology and fluvial hydraulics in general e g brunner et al 2021 while the quality of accessible topographic data required for urban flood modelling lies in the scope of the review we do not report developments in data processing algorithms nor purely technical advances such as in geographic information systems gis similarly the review extends up to the interface between flow modelling and complementary analyses such as economic damage assessment decision support systems or resilience studies but it does not cover these complementary analyses themselves green infrastructures e g fowdar et al 2021 are also considered beyond the scope of the present review in which the focus is set on the hydraulic mechanisms involved in urban flooding the review is organized in two main sections section 2 summarizes recent research works on understanding urban flood flow processes and vulnerability factors derived both from experimental and numerical approaches section 3 presents advances in numerical modelling of urban flooding aiming either at enhancing the accuracy of computational predictions section 3 1 or at speeding up the computations section 3 2 fig 1 provides an overview of the number of studies reviewed in each section of this paper finally a discussion and concluding remarks are given in section 4 2 physical understanding of urban floods and associated vulnerability 2 1 flow processes mignot et al 2019 reviewed the experimental studies and datasets published before 2018 aiming at advancing our understanding of flow processes during urban flooding such as flows at crossroads in street networks and urban districts as well as flow exchanges between surface and urban drainage systems table 2 summarizes 19 more recent studies pursuing the same goal most of them involve laboratory experiments which also deliver quantitative well documented data of high value for validating current and new computational models in table 2 the studies are classified according to the modelling approach experimental vs computational the extent of the considered domain single street vs urban district including or not urban drainage pipes the source of water from rain over the studied domain runoff over the upstream catchment or from the surcharged urban drainage system as well as the type of analysed data discharge partition in street networks or at manholes flow depths and velocities as detailed below six laboratory setups reported here are totally new and were not included in the previous review by mignot et al 2019 several recent studies focused on the prediction of flow exchanges between surface and urban drainage at the technical university of catalonia barcelona spain gómez et al 2019 used a laboratory platform representing a road lane at prototype scale to estimate orifice discharge coefficients through an urban drainage inlet under surcharging sewer flow conditions the coefficients were found not to vary with the road slope based on a new experimental setup at the university of wuppertal germany kemper schlenkhoff 2019 developed an empirical formula to estimate the type specific hydraulic capacity of grate inlets with supercritical surface flows the experiments represent a single steep sloped street with water supplied upstream the parameters influencing the grate inlet capacity are the flow depth and velocity upstream of the grate as well as the grate characteristics dimensions and orientation of the bars in contrast with the tests performed by gómez et al 2019 and kemper schlenkhoff 2019 other recent experiments include an explicit representation of urban drainage pipes in the laboratory four recent studies are based on an experimental setup installed at the university of sheffield and already reported by mignot et al 2019 the setup is a 1 6 scale representation of a single street linked to a single urban drainage pipe by a manhole rubinato et al 2018b measured the inflow discharge into the manhole under steady surface inundation conditions weir and orifice discharge coefficients were determined for a range of grate designs and a 2d finite difference model was validated in terms of simulated flow depths around the inlet with a 2d surface particle image velocimetry technique martins et al 2018a measured for the first time details of the velocity field in the vicinity of the manhole with ten different grate designs only drainage flow was considered under subcritical surface flow conditions a 2d numerical model was also assessed rubinato et al 2018a quantified energy losses within the manhole for surcharging and non surcharging outflow conditions the tests enabled evaluating the influence of a manhole lid and of a shallow flow on the surface as well as validating a computational model beg et al 2020 used the same experimental setup to quantify flow and solute mass exchange through the manhole with the aim of better understanding how pollutant is released from the sewer network to the street surface during urban flooding in the same experimental facility rubinato et al 2021 considered a variety of street configurations involving parking slots cars on the road and various locations of the manhole on the street to generate a novel dataset covering flow exchanges energy losses and quantification of exchanges of soluble pollutant from the sewer to the surface during urban flooding dong et al 2021 used a new laboratory setup at north china university of water resources and electric power it consists in a 16 m long and 3 m wide model of a single street with an urban drainage pipe underneath in their tests dong et al 2021 analysed the influence of varying the number of buildings and the spacing in between them on the flow generated by a dam break at the street inlet hydrographs flow depths and velocities were recorded in unsteady conditions at several points and the predictions of a 2d finite volume model were compared to the observations another new setup at inrae lyon france was used by chibane et al 2021 in its present form it involves a single street connected to a single urban drainage pipe by means of up to two drains and it was used for evaluating the influence of the flow exchange both under drainage and surcharged configurations on the 3d velocity field and water depth in the street near and downstream from the connections this new dataset is valuable to validate numerical models including vertical exchange flows through manholes another research topic which was hardly explored in the past is the quantification of water intrusion into buildings zhou et al 2016 liu et al 2018 sturm et al 2018 during urban floods a new experimental dataset collected at insa lyon france is presented by mignot et al 2020 it was obtained using a scale model of a single building façade with various openings door window gate conducted measurements include the discharge partition between the street and through the façade along with flow depths and velocity fields in the street the novel experimental facility used by chibane et al 2021 was also used by mejía morales et al 2021 under another configuration to study at reduced scale flood flows in the vicinity of an urban block surrounded by four streets the number and positioning of door like openings along the faces of the urban block were varied and their influence was assessed in terms of exchange flow with the streets flow depth and velocity in the streets and in the block as well as danger for pedestrians notable effects were found in the near field of the openings while all studies mentioned above are based on laboratory setups representing at most four streets with or without a single conduit underneath finaud guyot et al 2018 2019 investigated the discharge partition in a 1 200 scale model of an urban district 14 streets which was already analysed earlier by arrault et al 2016 due to the multi scale nature of urban flooding at the district level the scale model of finaud guyot et al 2018 2019 was geometrically distorted i e the scale factor along the vertical direction is ten times lower than the horizontal one this approach was also used in earlier studies of urban flooding e g güney et al 2014 haltas et al 2016a b smith et al 2016 the possible bias induced by this geometric distortion was studied by li et al 2019 the effect of geometric distortion of scale models of urban flooding was further analysed by li et al 2020 2021 based on a comprehensive series of numerical computations and dedicated laboratory tests on a new experimental set up seong et al 2020 used a new 1 200 scale representation of an urban district in sadang south korea unlike all other experiments mentioned above water was supplied to the scale model by means of a rainfall simulator with an intensity ranging between 80 and 200 mm h intricate measurements of flow depth and surface velocity were performed under falling rain for similar pluvial flooding conditions bruwier et al 2020 investigated computationally the influence of the layout of buildings in a synthetic urban area on flow variables such as the flow hydrograph at the outlet of the considered urban district as well as the evolution of flow depths bruwier et al 2018 performed the same type of analyses for the case of flood water originating from upstream drainage or river overflow instead of local rain overall these recent pieces of research aiming at improving our knowledge of flow processes in urban flooding tackle both previously studied processes e g water exchanges between surface and underground drainage system flow partition within a network of streets and newly explored processes such as the flow intrusion towards a building mignot et al 2020 the effects of geometric distortion on street flows li et al 2019 2020 and the release of contaminants by a surcharging sewer beg et al 2020 rubinato et al 2021 still in line with the list drawn by mignot et al 2019 in their table 2 other gaps in existing data remain such as the flow processes in a street network in supercritical regime flow exchanges between a network of streets and a network of pipes chibane et al 2018 or pollution furniture and trash dispersion in a street network 2 2 stability of humans and objects results from hydraulic modelling are often used to predict the stability of pedestrians during urban flooding as this information is of utmost importance for planning safe evacuation routes and rescue operations empirical closures are needed to assess pedestrians stability based on computed flow variables while such closures have been proposed for over a decade e g kvocka et al 2016 martínez gomariz et al 2016 they were further improved over the last few years with new measurement campaigns as shown in table 3 postacchini et al 2021 developed a novel laboratory approach in which a physical model of a human body is towed by an engine in water at rest and hydraulic forces and moments applied on the body are measured according to the measurements conducted for a range of flow depth and velocity the stability condition differs substantially whether the body front or the body back faces the flow this contrasts with previous research in which both positions were considered similar as regards pedestrian stability based on a re analysis of field measurements during a major flood event in brisbane australia chanson and brown 2018 suggested that the influence of local topographic effects and debris was underestimated in previous research leading to unsafe assessment of the stability of pedestrians they proposed new more conservative guidelines however simulations of safe evacuation during urban flooding requires not only stability criteria but also estimates of the speed of motion of individuals in flowing water baba et al 2017 recently bernardini et al 2020 involved 200 volunteers in laboratory experiments of evacuation in still water their results enable quantifying the speed of isolated pedestrians as a function of flow depth and body characteristics such as age height and mass the results highlight that fire or general purpose databases of evacuation speed should not be used for analyses in floodwaters due to a strong reduction of speed induced by water forces evaluating the stability of vehicles during urban flooding is also of paramount importance not only because drifting vehicles may endanger pedestrians or rescue services but also because the number of people perishing in vehicles made unstable by floodwaters is reported to grow globally complementing earlier experimental works martínez gomariz et al 2017 2018 smith et al 2019 present a novel series of tests using full scale vehicles various flow depths buoyancy conditions vehicle types and bed surface concrete gravel or sand were tested the observations were combined with measurements in smaller scale laboratory tests to derive stability criteria applying to a broad range of vehicles in a recent review bocanegra et al 2020 highlighted the need for improvement and standardization in the vehicle stability criteria used across various studies during urban flooding pedestrians also face the danger of being hit by drifting urban objects urban furniture trash etc such as waste containers which are used in many cities worldwide martínez gomariz et al 2020 derived new stability criteria for waste containers based on an analytical model and proposed adaptation measures note that waste containers made unstable may lead to street damming and are likely to induce environmental and health risks due to contaminated material possibly released in the floodwaters the stability of single pedestrians vehicles or other objects such as waste containers is today comprehensively assessed and lead to formally similar expressions in terms of flow depth and velocity data which remain missing concern mainly group effects such as i several objects vehicles containers or other made unstable transported and possibly clogging a street or a narrow path ii stability and speed of motion of several interacting pedestrians typically evacuating towards shelters moreover most tests reported above were conducted under controlled experimental conditions even if performed at full scale so that the derived criteria still need verification in real world conditions as conducted by chanson and brown 2018 for the case of pedestrians 3 computational models validated computational models are particularly valuable for guiding disaster risk reduction strategies in practice they permit both to reproduce historical events for which validation data is available and simulate scenarios for various return periods and anticipating changes in climate conditions and land use several reviews of urban flood modelling were recently published by authors such as bulti and abebe 2020 guo et al 2021a and nkwunonwo et al 2020 rosenzweig et al 2021 recently listed remaining challenges of such modelling notably with respect to access to input data e g sewer system location of buildings topography from gis databases precipitation data processing of data e g building treatment method coupling method of overland flow models e g with sewer pipe system groundwater model green infrastructure access to validation data for historical events e g in situ measurements crowdsourcing and flow characteristics within the sewer network translate hydrodynamics results in terms of flow variables flow depths flood extent to damage and or risk data and maps the 40 reviewed novel contributions are classified into two categories first category deals with efforts made to improve the agreement of simulations outcomes with reference data section 3 1 second category deals with efforts aiming at reducing the runtime of computational models or increasing the domain size section 3 2 some overlap exists between the two categories since in the latter the pursued objective is generally to reach an optimal balance between computational efficiency and accuracy 3 1 improving urban flood numerical simulations accuracy recent contributions aiming at improving the ability of urban flood computational models to match observations were structured along four main groups in table 4 first a lot of attention was paid to the influence of topographic data including digital elevation model dem and building treatment methods btm as well as their processing e g merging various data sources the influence of landcover data resolution and roughness parametrization was also studied a second group of papers analysed the effects on model outputs of characteristics and spatial distribution of forcing inputs boundary conditions such as rainfall or inflow hydrograph in the third group the influence of sewer flow modelling was evaluated particularly as regards the numerical representation of the modelling interconnections between overland flow and sewer flow finally a fourth group of studies aimed at collecting more validation data including non conventional data and improving their quality recent contributions along these four lines are detailed in the following paragraphs 3 1 1 digital elevation model dem and building treatment method btm several recent studies focused on the representation of buildings in the computational model schubert sanders 2012 defined three standard building treatment methods the building resistance br method in which a high local roughness is assigned to the cells occupied by buildings the building block bb method in which the topography is raised up to the roof level over the building footprint and the building hole bh method which excludes the footprint of the buildings from the computational domain using a 2d shallow water model mustafa and szydłowski 2021 compared the br and bb methods for predicting time series of pointwise water levels in a reduced scale experiment representing a hypothetical network of buildings flooded by a dam break wave they highlighted a strong sensitivity of the model outcomes to the value of the roughness parameter assigned to the buildings in the br method and the superiority of the bb method for simulating realistic flow fields within an urban area bermúdez zischg 2018 performed a similar comparison by considering also the bh method and extending their analysis to the effects of the building treatment method on damage estimation at the micro scale building level for a real world case study covering an area of about 5 km2 close to bern switzerland they found that the building treatment method had little effect on exposure i e number of elements at risk which depends on flood extent but a substantial influence on the flow depth attributed to each building among the tested methods attributing the maximum flow depth of all nodes within the building footprint and a specified buffer distance to the building showed robust results in the sense that it reduced the influence of the building treatment method on damage estimates considering a pluvial flooding event in 2016 in wuhan china shen et al 2018 tested a different building representation in their approach ground surface elevations are raised by the building entrance height compared to nearby ground level and a high value of roughness coefficient is assigned to areas within the building footprints to account for resistance due to inner walls they report an improved model performance for the same case study shen tan 2020 showed that a high resolution resampling of the dem close to buildings improves the computations the influence of dem resolution 17 35 and 70 m and representations of buildings and roads was also investigated by geng et al 2020 for the case of pluvial flooding 2 and 10 year design storms in a densely urbanized district of nanjing china the bb method was compared to an alternate approach in which the elevation of roads was reduced by a predefined value corresponding to a standard kerb height so that roads act as shallow drainage channels in the considered case study the terrain resolution had a stronger influence on the accuracy of flow depth and flood extent estimates than the representation of buildings and roads considering the overwhelming influence of topographic data and the uncertainties affecting such data recent studies emphasized the value of merging several data sources for a small urban area 2 8 km2 in italy arrighi campo 2019 compared flood extents flow depths and building level damage estimates using four dems constructed based on raw data from a lidar survey raw data with building footprints filled by linear interpolation of terrain elevations raw data with bb method and the same merged with additional elevation data surveyed in the field local differences between dem data and field surveyed elevation points were generally small 0 26 m bias but reached up to 2 5 m locally an assimilation technique was used to merge the two data sources lidar and field survey weighted by the inverse of their uncertainties in the considered case study the data merging brought limited improvement due to the limited differences between the two datasets along the same line leitão de sousa 2018 assessed the influence on modelling results of various methods for merging airborne lidar and uav photogrammetry data they provide evidence for the necessity of advanced merging techniques which take into consideration the systematic inaccuracies of the individual datasets this was found particularly important when the merging boundaries are parallel to the contour lines topographic data resampling techniques generally used to avoid excessive simulation runtimes often result in blurred representation of small scale urban and topographical features e g narrow paths between buildings are incorrectly represented to address this issue ramsauer et al 2021 implemented virtual surface links between buildings to mimic the flow paths of a high resolution model when applied to a synthetic rainfall case study the virtual surface links demonstrated a substantial improvement but the magnitude of the improvement primarily depends on the size density and arrangement of the buildings in each specific floodplain using extremely fine resolution terrain data 10 cm in an urban flood case study in the uk de almeida et al 2018 demonstrated that decimetre scale alterations in the elevation of streets can lead to remarkable differences in predicted flow data on one hand this makes urban flood modelling challenging since such small scale topographic details are rarely available for practical engineering studies and considering them would lead to prohibitive computational costs on the other hand slight alterations in the topography at tactically selected locations proved sufficient to guide flow to low impact zones e g parks and away from key vulnerable assets this creates new opportunities for flood mitigation however such conclusions seem case specific and strongly dependent on the studied events and topography of floodplains as suggested by yalcin 2020 who comes to conclusions somehow contrasting with those of de almeida et al 2018 for the case of an urban floodplain in kirsehir turkey affected by a 500 year flood scenario yalcin 2020 compared 19 combinations of resolutions used for dem 0 04 to 10 m manning roughness layer 2 to 25 m and computational grid 2 m to 25 m the computations with 10 m cell size performed similarly to the very fine resolution so that very fine resolution of topography and high resolution landcover were judged unnecessary in the tested case in a game changing contribution rong et al 2020 demonstrated the potential of 3d computational fluid dynamics compared to conventional 2d approaches for a flooding case study in a coastal city due to storm surges data inferred from digital aerial photogrammetry enabled reproducing more realistic flow patterns than when the 3d flow model is combined with a standard dem particularly in the presence of narrow streets and complex topographic features or when a 2d flow model is used moreover the use of building information model bim combined with 3d computational fluid dynamics enables extending the flood simulation inside the buildings as the flow enters through openings 3 1 2 effect of forcing inputs and friction based on a depth averaged surface flow model paquier et al 2020 simulated two real world cases in france 2000 pluvial flooding in marseilles and 2008 river flooding in oulins with the aim of assessing uncertainties arising from forcing inputs such as rainfall spatial distribution over the domain or upstream hydrograph in the river in the first case study rainfall distribution was found to change peak flow depths more than any other input parameter in the second case study flood level in the river has more influence than e g the building treatment method using a hydro inundation model i e surface flow model incorporating also a rainfall runoff module mei et al 2020 studied the influence of a design rainstorm on inundation and damage levels for a field case study xiamen island in china several design rainstorms corresponding to various return periods asymmetry and durations constant volume were compared the authors show that for a given rainfall volume intensity is the key factor influencing inundated area flow depth and direct damage to buildings while the effect of rainfall pattern is slightly weaker based on variance decomposition methods chen et al 2018 conducted spatial global sensitivity analysis of shallow water models applied to steady subcritical flood flows in an experimental setup representing an idealized urban district in the considered setting flow depth variance is explained at almost 70 by prescribed downstream flow depth to less than 10 by the friction coefficient and to less than 25 by the upstream discharge for supercritical cases sensitivity to friction coefficient is higher 3 1 3 effect of sewer systems modelling and interactions with surface flow guo et al 2021a and nkwunonwo et al 2020 listed the numerical models available to simulate surcharging sewer networks and overland surface flows these models are generally referred to as dual drainage models djordjevic et al 1999 as they involve the coupling of a 1d sewer flow model and a 2d overland flow model anni et al 2020 revealed that for the case of a pluvial flooding event in tuscaloosa usa incorporating or not stormwater infrastructures in the modelling changed the flood volumes by factors 8 to 20 depending on the return period the same flood simulations were also sensitive to the spatial explicitness of soil input data pervious vs impervious moreover based on comparisons with full scale laboratory experiments and the simulation of a storm event in beijing china hao et al 2021 stress the importance of representing bidirectional flow exchanges and initial surface runoff dynamics while accounting for the pressure needed to lift manhole cover only marginally improves the results still a remaining major challenge for such urban flood simulations is the scarcity of data on location and characteristics of stormwater infrastructures bulti and abebe 2020 analysed the necessary level of detail in representing the connections between surface flow and sewer network should each inlet be modelled or does lumping the exchanges at the level of manholes provide sufficient accuracy for the case of a high intensity storm in 2015 in taipei city taiwan jang et al 2018 showed that modelling individual inlets performs considerably better in terms of comparison with field observations of flood extent modelling not only sewer pipes but also gullies which act as buffers between surface and sewer further improves the agreement with field observations for the same 2015 storm and for a milder one which occurred in 1993 jang et al 2019 similar conclusions were obtained by chang et al 2018 by simulating three historical flood events in another district of taipei the extra computational time for inclusion of flow processes in gullies was deemed limited compared to the gain in accuracy martins et al 2018b focused on the influence of the sewer flow model by comparing four different sewer flow models for a case study in bradford uk the authors found an overall good agreement between the model outcomes with differences in estimated damage of the order of 6 in a recent contribution quintana romero leandro 2021 compared seven model structures involving overland flow representation by various combinations of 1d and or 2d models and sewer flow representation either computed using 1d models or being neglected the results of the model structures were evaluated based on data from a 2007 flash flood in the town of baiersdorf germany characterized by a heterogeneous urban density several model structures performed as well as a full 1d 2d dual drainage model and the model outcome uncertainties were found highly spatially variable a lagrangian transport model coupled to a sewer overland flow model 1d 2d dual drainage model was introduced by sämann et al 2019 to compute the transport of solute originating from surcharged sewers and to predict the resulting pollution spreading in streets during an urban pluvial flooding a random walk approach was used for mixing and dispersion calculation the impact of various simplifications in the hydrodynamic model was assessed but no useful simplification could be recommended particularly the authors showed that the flow patterns are better captured by hydrodynamic models than by simplified ones and that a high temporal resolution of the flow field is required to reproduce short duration changes in contaminant paths 3 1 4 validation data the scarcity of available data for model elaboration calibration and validation is another major challenge hampering the development of flood modelling and management models molinari et al 2019 to overcome this considerable efforts were made to retrieve valuable data from unconventional sources such as crowd sourced data to reconstruct hydraulic data from an urban flood event in the town of crotone italy macchione et al 2019a combined amateur videos photographs traditional topographic surveys news reports among others they proposed a methodology to merge various conventional and unconventional sources of information scotti et al 2020 presented another integrated approach for the reconstruction of temporal and spatial patterns of a flood event for the case of hurricane harvey in houston texas usa in 2017 they combined satellite images and markers from social media hydraulic for effectively calibrating and validating the outcomes of their hydraulic model authors showed that merging various data sources helps coping with the high uncertainties affecting each individual source of information moy de vitry et al 2019 used existing surveillance cameras to infer insights on the flood level evolution their image processing technique relies on a deep convolutional neural network trained based on over 1 2000 flooding images the system was deemed cheap versatile scalable and transferable to other sites 3 2 reducing the computational time of urban flood modelling improving the computational performance of urban flood models is of utmost importance for a range of reasons e g bates 2022 first this contributes to handling larger domains at a higher spatial resolution and or over longer time horizons second this is particularly relevant for models used not only in planning phase but also for forecasting and crisis management purposes since in that case model outputs are required in real time various strategies are currently explored to accelerate urban flood calculations the 19 reviewed publications were separated in four groups corresponding to four main acceleration strategies a massive parallelization group 1 an adaptative mesh group 2 the use of a porosity model group 3 and the use of surrogate models and machine learning group 4 see table 5 3 2 1 massive parallelization massive parallelization techniques are one avenue to speed up urban flood calculations the use of graphic processing units gpu is particularly efficient as it enables leveraging thousands of processors within a single device based on a gpu implementation of a hydrodynamic model xing et al 2019 simulated in nearly real time a flood event over a 268 km2 urbanised area at 2 m spatial resolution i e with about 67million computational cells by comparing model outcomes for five different spatial resolutions the authors revealed a high sensitivity of model outcomes due to the inability of coarser resolutions to resolve narrow flow paths narrow rivers small roads and flow paths between buildings hence reducing the connectivity in densely urbanized areas similarly restricting the computation to localized subdomains introduces large simulation errors fernández pato garcía navarro 2021 presented the first gpu implementation of a coupled dual drainage model including overland and sewer flow along with exchanges between both models and pollutant transport both in the sewer network and on the surface this gpu model was applied to real world cases for which it led to speed up factors of the order of 100 compared to a standard cpu computation 3 2 2 adaptive mesh an alternate approach to accelerate urban flood computation consists in using a dynamically adaptive meshing technique enabling the mesh to adapt in space and time as a function of the evolution of flow features hu et al 2018 used the hessian matrix of flow depth and velocity to adapt the mesh every 10 time steps with the algorithm gmsh geuzaine remacle 2009 for a real world case study the method provided accurate results with a computation time reduced by a factor of about 2 3 2 3 porosity models porosity models use a subgrid modelling technique to speed up simulations of overland flow the flow computations are performed on a relatively coarse grid while information on the sub grid scale topography is preserved through additional parameters referred to as porosities guinot soares frazão 2006 mcmillan brasington 2007 sanders et al 2008 these parameters reflect the effects of obstacles on storage in the cells and on flow conveyance between the cells alternate names have also been used for the porosity parameters such as building coverage ratio and conveyance reduction factor chen et al 2012 or area and width reduction factors haltas et al 2016a b porosity models are classified as single or dual porosity depending on the types of considered porosity parameters and as differential or integral depending on their mathematical formulation over the last years major improvements were brought to these models dewals et al 2021 guinot et al 2018 introduced depth dependent porosities as a generalization of the dual integral porosity model which was proposed earlier by guinot et al 2017 to fix erroneous wave celerities arising in the original integral porosity model of sanders et al 2008 to reduce the mesh sensitivity of the porosity models ferrari et al 2019 tested an isotropic single porosity formulation for the fluxes complemented by anisotropic conveyance porosities in the estimation of flow resistance with the same objective viero 2019 implemented a dual porosity model in which the conveyance porosity is not evaluated at the cell interfaces but at the level of a computational cell along the same line an algorithm for the cell based determination of the conveyance porosity for real world urban areas was presented by ferrari and viero 2020 their approach performs well for a single obstacle in a computational cell but not in the presence of multiple obstacles varra et al 2020 introduced a novel local differential porosity model formulation referred to as the binary single porosity model it was derived regardless of the existence of a representative elementary volume as assumed in the derivation of earlier differential porosity models guinot soares frazão 2006 the variety of approaches being currently developed emphasizes the need for further research on modelling of anisotropic conveyance effects in urban flood porosity models costabile et al 2020 systematically compared the outcomes of a single porosity model to those of a standard fully dynamic shallow water model and a simplified zero inertia model unlike previous model benchmarking often restricted to comparisons of flooded extents and flow depths costabile et al 2020 also evaluated the flow velocities and the product of flow depth and velocity which is a determinant for flood impacts the results reveal that a dynamic wave model is necessary in all situations where not only the flood extent needs to be predicted but also the flood impacts both the porosity model and the zero inertia model lead to wrong estimations of the depth velocity product 3 2 4 surrogate models and machine learning many recent studies explored radically different approaches to speed up urban flood computations namely machine learning in a recent review of urban drainage models based on machine learning kwon and kim 2021 point at the extensive use of such models to advance model performance and efficiency machine learning models are trained based on detailed hydrodynamic data mostly water depths and velocities and can then deliver fast predictions of flow patterns over large areas for scenarios slightly departing from the configurations used for the training two types of machine learning approaches can be identified as a function of the origin of data used to train the model first type considers output data from process based numerical calculations performed for a range of input parameters topography boundary conditions etc second type considers the data measured on site and collected from historical events but without any hydraulic calculation for the first type training data are output from hydraulic models a binary logistic regression model embedded in a gis system was presented by feng et al 2020 and applied to a 100 km2 catchment in london ontario canada with reductions in computational time by three orders of magnitude bermúdez et al 2018 tested two computationally efficient surrogate models the first one combines a detailed 1d sewer network model with a gis volume spreading algorithm for overland flow in the second approach a conceptual lumped sewer and flood model is derived based on a blend of data driven and physically based components as well as pre simulated flood maps both approaches provide results of comparable accuracy as a detailed hydraulic model at a fraction of the computational cost speed up factor up to 104 kriging was used by contreras et al 2020 to interpolate flow variables from a database of 49 pre simulated scenarios generated by means of high fidelity hydrological and hydraulic models a critical factor to design the database is the coverage of the entire range of possible storm characteristics kim et al 2019 and kim and han 2020 used a 1d 2d coupled model to produce the training data to learn the relationship between rainfall and overflow and inundation area resulting from manhole overflows the database used by berkhahn et al 2019 and rözer et al 2021 for training and testing of their ann real time water level prediction model was generated with the 2d hydrodynamic model hystem extran 2d he 2d guo et al 2021b used a cellular automate and a hydrodynamic model to train deep convolutional neural networks for predicting flow depth for urban pluvial flooding for the second type training data are historical measured data wu et al 2020 used 14 historical rainfall and flooding records from 2013 to 2016 in zhengzhou city china 11 for training and 3 for validating their machine learning model aiming at predicting flow depth maps the most important parameters for the training are the road and building occupation ratio the soil permeability the grassland and forestland occupation ratios darabi et al 2019 2020 used flood historical database obtained from sari city authority over the period 2015 2017 precipitation slope curve number distance to river distance to channel depth to groundwater land use and elevation were used to train the machine learning model hydraulics data were then transferred to vulnerability maps the authors concluded that distance to channel land use and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination whereas population density quality of buildings and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability the model used by lei et al 2021 was trained using the 295 locations of flooding in the city of seoul korea in the period 2018 2020 as a function of 10 flood affecting factors terrain ruggedness index bed slope bed elevation and topographic wetness index appear to be the dominant factors to predict the inundation locations 4 discussions and conclusion this review provides a synthesis of current knowledge in the understanding and modelling of urban flood processes it is based on journal papers published over the last four years 2018 2021 and it is structured along four lines understanding of urban flood processes stability and evacuation realism and accuracy of computational modelling and speed up of computations the review highlights the maturity of the field nevertheless numerous open questions still to be addressed for improving our understanding and modelling capacity of urban flood flow processes some examples are given below currently available laboratory and field observations miss information on important flow and transport processes flow exchanges between sewer and surface were measured only in idealized settings involving a single street with a single pipe underneath observations of the interactions between a sewer network and a surface street network are still lacking measurements of flow intrusion inside buildings remain also limited while such exchanges alter flow patterns in the streets and danger for pedestrians little is known on the dispersion in a street network of contaminants released by surcharging sewers similar questions exist for the particulate transport of trash urban furniture vehicles and other debris besides laboratory studies have enabled assessing the stability conditions of an isolated pedestrian vehicle or piece of urban furniture verification of these results for real world conditions remain scarce and no information is available on group effects such as the evacuation of a group of pedestrians from a flooded mall or metro station the same type of knowledge gaps exists for groups of floating objects or vehicles likely to clog narrow flow paths or singularities such as crossroads improved methodologies for merging data from various sources pave the way for increasingly accurate representations of small scale topographic features and forcings in computational models such methodologies are instrumental for taking full benefit of extreme high resolution e g sub metric remote sensing data de almeida et al 2018 techniques such as gpu based massive parallelization or machine learning have proved successful for speeding up calculations while theoretical advances are still needed with respect to some modelling concepts such as the incorporation of anisotropic conveyance effects in porosity based urban flood models for the computation of transport processes debris vehicles contaminants existing modelling paradigms e g lagrangian vs eulerian 2d vs 3d still need to be compared among each other and with measured concentration maps to point at the most effective calculation strategies during urban floods usually of short duration collecting flow depth and velocity observations is particularly challenging according to macchione et al 2019a among the ten best documented urban flood events three of them contain no suitable data for validating flow computations and the others include only watermarks the recent proliferation of mobile phones and online video sharing platforms gives access to countless amateur videos le coz et al 2016 kankanamge et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a which are being used in most geophysical sciences urban floods are particularly well documented by such crowd sourced data since they occur in densely populated areas moreover the presence of urban furniture and easily identifiable geometric features of buildings facilitate the estimation of water level and surface flow velocity from image processing algorithms difficulties with retrieving the location and time of the scenes impairs the use of these data for detailed model validation surveillance cameras are another potential source of validation data even if access to recorded data by scientists is hindered by legal barriers for privacy reasons conversely accessing validation data for the sewer component of dual drainage models appears much more intricate anni et al 2020 chang et al 2018 a particular impediment to advances in the science of urban flood modelling is that conclusions of most studies remain genuinely site specific in their formulation major steps forward could be taken by attempting to extract generic knowledge from collections of existing case studies although challenging this may be achieved by designing appropriate metrics for classifying and standardizing the definition of flooding scenarios investigated processes and effects of analysed variables e g model settings finally several of the reviewed studies demonstrate considerable recent efforts for translating the flow modelling results into information and data of direct use for impact assessment and risk communication among others darabi et al 2019 2020 and wang et al 2021 plotted vulnerability and risk maps mejía morales et al 2021 used stability curves for pedestrians to draw danger maps and mei et al 2020 mapped monetary damage for a range of flood frequencies to communicate the computed flow characteristics texture mapping techniques are used for synthesizing realistic 3d images of the urban fabric under various flooding scenarios macchione et al 2019b wang et al 2019 costabile et al 2021 moreover the calculation results are more and more communicated through web services shen et al 2020 heyer et al 2020 nonetheless as recently highlighted by rosenzweig et al 2021 further efforts should be dedicated to bridge the gaps between advances in hydrodynamic modelling and their transfer towards improved studies by water managers and engineering offices declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
