7905,study region two sandy riverbeds of typical arid inland rivers in northwest china one controlled by ecological water diversion and one affected by intermittent flood erosion and sedimentation study focus the infiltration mechanism in the sandy riverbeds of arid inland rivers is undetermined this study simulated the effects of water diversion time and groundwater depth on ecological diversion channels as well as the effects of flood water level and clay layer on the infiltration capacity of flood eroded riverbeds this study provides a scientific basis for rational ecological water diversion strategies and flood disaster prevention new hydrological insights for the region this study found that the water diversion period is very important to the local groundwater and ecosystem for ecological water diversion channels based on the total runoff when decreasing the diversion time the infiltration amount of the channel increased from 0 13 to 0 27 104 m3 km 1 d 1 therefore distributing a fixed amount of water downstream in a short period can not only reduce losses but also increases the amount of infiltration the infiltration capacity of this channel is relatively strong for flood erosion channels of arid inland rivers and the ratio of infiltration to total flood per kilometer of the channel was between 0 38 and 1 41 at different flood levels therefore it is possible to artificially change the flow direction or carry out river silt remediation to infiltrate more flooding underground which can reduce the harm of downstream flooding graphical abstract ga1 keywords arid inland river sandy riverbed hydraulic conductivity riverbed sediment hydrus model infiltration mechanism 1 introduction the lower reaches of arid inland rivers rely on surface water and groundwater for maintenance and the riverbed is the transmission link between rivers and groundwater calver 2001 brunner et al 2017 riverbed infiltration is significant for groundwater recharge batlle aguilar and cook 2012 chen et al 2013 in the lower reaches of arid inland rivers runoff is intermittent and the dry flow period can be relatively long for example in the lower reaches of the heihe river the average dry flow period was 150 days year from 2000 to 2016 hence the impact of intermittent rivers on the production and lives of local people cannot be overlooked jaeger 2021 quantifying riverbed infiltration and its contribution to groundwater recharge under a high sand content and seasonal or intermittent runoff and determining the impact of the variation in riverbed infiltration on regional groundwater recharge can support the rational development and utilization of regional water resources to maintain regional water balance many studies have been carried out on the physical characteristics of riverbeds zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 method of measuring riverbed infiltration goodrich et al 2004 genereux et al 2008 heterogeneity and spatiotemporal variations in hydraulic conductivity parameters wu et al 2013 estimation of the amount of riverbed infiltration and its influencing factors newcomer et al 2016 liu et al 2017 and establishment and simulation of riverbed infiltration models kacimov and obnosov 2019 arid inland rivers typically have sandy or sandy loamy riverbeds studies on riverbed seepage have mostly concentrated on riverbed hydraulic conductivity particularly the saturation infiltration rate simpson and meixner 2012 wu et al 2013 villeneuve et al 2015 both direct and indirect research methods have been used to estimate point scale and regional scale riverbed infiltration recharge goodrich et al 2004 genereux et al 2008 at the point scale these methods include field observations rosenberry and pitlick 2009 drill holes wallace et al 1990 geochemical tracers vanderzalm et al 2011 isotopes kim et al 2020 semwal et al 2020 water chemistry gagne et al 2018 and water heat and solute transport methods shanafield et al 2010 at the regional scale these methods include the water balance approach alsmadi and abdelal 2018 surface geophysical exploration shanafield et al 2020 remote sensing monitoring bhatnagar and jain 2020 groundwater level fluctuation analysis and numerical simulation chenini and mammou 2010 although a variety of methods can be used to estimate riverbed infiltration there are fewer methods available for seasonal rivers seasonal rivers have strong transient flow characteristics and the flow velocity tends to rapidly decrease to zero at the end of a rainstorm event intermittent rivers under human control tend to exhibit similar characteristics thus for seasonal or intermittent rivers double ring infiltration meters zhang and li 2020 continuous monitoring of groundwater fluctuations shentsis and rosenthal 2003 the wet front method dahan et al 2008 temperature monitoring irvine et al 2019 and groundwater tracer methods cook 2015 can be used to measure riverbed infiltration these methods are indirect tools for estimating riverbed infiltration by measuring related parameters excluding the field infiltration test conducted at the river reach scale batlle aguilar and cook 2012 there are no robust methods to directly measure the infiltration fluxes of seasonal and intermittent rivers the factors influencing the infiltration of the riverbed system mainly include the geological conditions of the riverbed river morphology river flow the difference between the water level of the river and the groundwater level water shortage in the unsaturated soil zone and the duration of the discharge time the infiltration of seasonal rivers also depends on the short duration water flow in the river channel as well as factors such as the permeability of the riverbed occurrence conditions of the aquifer and exploitation intensity of groundwater calver 2001 xi et al 2008 rosenberry and healy 2012 head et al 2014 newcomer et al 2016 liu et al 2017 early studies on riverbed infiltration simulation used numerical and analytical models spalding and khaleel 1991 although recent river models can provide a simple assessment of groundwater recharge from river infiltration their applicability is limited welsh et al 2013 some models can simulate water flow in the vadose zone such as hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2006 moodhms hydrogeologic 2006 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2011 however the corresponding calculations are laborious and their application on a regional scale is limited moreover by observing the groundwater level and temperature a heat flow model can be used to calculate the riverbed infiltration rate the vs2dhi yosef et al 2018 model developed by the united states geological survey usgs can be used to solve real time changes in the riverbed infiltration rate numerous mature models have recently been developed such as the hydrus 2d 3d model which has been widely used to study riverbed infiltration at the regional scale šimůnek et al 2016 kacimov and obnosov 2019 it is important to quantify the contribution of riverbed seepage to groundwater recharge chai et al 2021 the quantification of recharge is a significant prerequisite for effective groundwater resource management similarly there is also an urgent need to estimate groundwater recharge and sustainable water production from groundwater aquifers to support sustainable development and utilization of water resources obuobie et al 2012 several methods can be used to estimate groundwater recharge by riverbed infiltration including the water balance maruyama et al 2013 schulz et al 2013 pumping test rao et al 2020 water fluctuation obuobie et al 2012 and numerical simulation methods ghysels et al 2019 min et al 2020 thus some progress has been made in the simulation and quantitative analysis of riverbed infiltration in china and other countries however with the refined demand for water resource management current research has tended to focus on the direct estimation of regional scale riverbed infiltration and recharge through model simulations studies of sandy riverbeds in inland river basins have mostly focused on the measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity simpson and meixner 2012 wu et al 2013 villeneuve et al 2015 spatial variation characteristics wu et al 2013 and factors affecting infiltration head et al 2014 newcomer et al 2016 liu et al 2017 yet the infiltration mechanism of typical sandy riverbeds in inland river basins is not fully discussed especially 1 for the ecological water diversion riverbed the current water diversion mode is most conducive to groundwater restoration and the development of the riparian forest ecosystem and 2 for the flood eroded river channel the influence of different flood water levels on the infiltration is unclear it is uncertain if it is possible to increase the flood travel distance by changing the original river channel thereby increasing the infiltration amount and reducing the harm of the flood to the production and life of downstream residents to solve these problems this study aimed to obtain the physical and hydraulic conduction parameters of the riverbed sedimentary layer through field sampling and laboratory experiments using the hydrus model to simulate the effects of water diversion time groundwater depth flood water level and clay layer on the infiltration capacity of the riverbed the scientific novelty of this study is that it considers the two most common types of sandy riverbeds in inland river basins and through different scenarios the effects of the water diversion period groundwater depth flood water level and clay layer on riverbed infiltration are clearly analyzed therefore more effective ecological water diversion strategies and flood control measures have been proposed this study provides a scientific basis for rational development and utilization of water resources in inland river basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area two sandy riverbeds sand content 90 of typical arid inland rivers in northwest china were selected as research sites in this study fig 1a the first type of riverbed represents rivers that practice ecological water diversion schemes such as the heihe tarim and shiyang rivers the lower reach of the heihe river 96 42 102 04 e 39 45 42 40 n was selected as the representative of the ecological water diversion river which has a large drainage area fig 1b and is replenished by precipitation in mountainous areas and glacial snow meltwater the middle reaches are the main water use areas while the downstream region is affected by ecological water diversion fig s1a and has a width to depth ratio of approximately 400 1 during the long cut off period the downstream riverbed was affected by sandstorm erosion and sediment accumulation of different intensities during the discharge period the riverbed was affected by water erosion and redeposition and the riverbed sedimentary layer was relatively thick therefore the sandy riverbed in the heihe river was affected by ecological water diversion the other type of riverbed is a river that exists widely in the piedmont alluvial proluvial fan area in northwest china and is often damaged by floods in summer as represented by the xitugou watershed in yangguan dunhuang 39 15 40 00 n 93 44 94 11 e fig 1c its supply source is mainly seasonal short duration heavy precipitation in the upstream mountainous area which flows downstream in the form of a flood fig s1b the downstream riverbed is mainly affected by flood erosion and sedimentation forming a morphological feature of a deep narrow and curved riverbed with a clay covered surface the width to depth ratio of the riverbed channel was approximately 22 5 hence this type of riverbed was classified as a flood eroded sandy riverbed these two types of riverbeds are common in arid inland regions and are representative of the inland river basins although both riverbeds are sandy their causes and characteristics differ comparative studies on the infiltration mechanisms of these two types of riverbeds are important for gaining a deep and comprehensive understanding of the recharge contribution of arid inland rivers to regional water resources and regional water balance 2 2 sampling information riverbed samples were collected in july and august 2020 four river sections were selected to excavate the soil profiles of both riverbanks and the center of each section table s1 the depth of each soil profile was between 100 cm and 140 cm and the sampling interval was 20 cm we collected sediment samples at a sampling interval of 20 cm for two reasons first we observed that the physical composition of the sedimentary layer in the riverbed varied vertically at intervals greater than 20 cm second related studies used 20 cm as the sampling interval crosbie et al 2014 a cutting ring was used to determine the saturated soil water content sswc bulk density bd porosity φ and hydraulic conductivity ks an aluminum box was used to determine the initial soil water content iswc and the grain size composition of the soil for each layer three replicate samples were taken to the laboratory to determine the relevant physical properties and infiltration performance 2 3 calculations of the seepage rate and ks the cutting ring samples were brought back to the laboratory and soaked for 24 h to saturate the soil the ks value of each sample was measured using a dik 4012 four point saturation infiltration instrument fig s2a the equation for calculating ks is as follows 1 k s q a t h l where q is the water flux ml a is the cross sectional area of the sample 19 6 cm2 δh is the difference in the water head 6 8 cm l is the length of the sample 5 1 cm and t is time s a hood infiltration instrument was used to measure the ks of the flood channels the instrument adjusted the infiltration pressure by using a markov bottle an infiltration chamber was directly installed on the soil surface and water was passed through the water diversion pipeline the pressure could be supplemented at any time and results were automatically collected and recorded fig s2b compared to other measurement methods the hood infiltration instrument does not disturb the soil the measurement results are closer to the actual hydraulic conductivity and the dispersion of the results is the smallest schwärzel and punzel 2007 li et al 2019 in this study a self made leakage monitoring device was used to accurately quantify the actual infiltration of river water this experimental device was divided into three parts a leakage bucket soft water bag and connecting pipe according to the connector principle the water in the soft water bag enters the leakage bucket under the action of water pressure to perform the infiltration process the leakage bucket was a cylinder with an open bottom inserted into the riverbed to prevent external water from entering the leakage bucket to quantify the seepage rate for the cross sectional area of the leakage bucket the water from the soft water bag was the only source of water in the bucket fig s2c this method has been applied during previous research rosenberry 2008 2 4 hydrus model hydrus 2d is a finite element model that can be used to simulate soil water flow and two dimensional solute movement šimůnek et al 2016 the flow state of the model is a two dimensional saturated unsaturated darcy flow that disregards the influence of air on soil flow movement the flow control equation adopts the richards equation celia et al 1990 the hydrus model is widely used to simulate soil moisture and solute transport šimunek et al 2018 yang et al 2019 er raki et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the hydrus model can flexibly handle various flow boundaries such as constant head and variable head boundaries seepage boundaries atmospheric boundaries and drainage boundaries the flow area itself can be an irregular flow boundary or composed of anisotropic heterogeneous soil through an irregular triangular mesh division of the flow area the governing equations were solved using the galerkin linear finite element method regardless of the saturated or unsaturated conditions time was discretized by an implicit difference the discretized nonlinear governing equations were linearized using an iterative method 2 4 1 basic equation of water movement it is assumed that the influence of meteorological factors can be ignored and that the soil structure is not affected by water movement the basic equation of water movement was numerically solved using the richards equation celia et al 1990 šimůnek et al 2011 2 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h z s where θ is the soil volumetric moisture content m3 m3 h is the soil negative pressure head m k

layer of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion was divided into three layers surface stability and bottom five groundwater level observation points were arranged on the river bank the riverbed width was 200 m fig s3a owing to the obvious vertical difference in the riverbed sediment layer in the flood eroded sandy riverbed it was divided into seven layers according to the sampling interval thick gravel layers with high permeability were observed at the bottom of the riverbed fig s3b 2 4 2 2 hydraulic parameters the measured grain size and bd were used as the input parameters for the hydrus model to generate the initial hydraulic parameters fig 2 for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion a measured water diversion event was subsequently selected to simulate the change in groundwater depth during the water diversion period this was then compared with the corresponding measured change in groundwater depth and the model parameters were constantly adjusted until the model simulation results were in good agreement with the measured results fig 2 the adjusted model parameters are listed in table 1 for the flood eroded sandy riverbed use of the measured ks to adjust the initial hydraulic parameters and the determined hydraulic parameters are listed in table 2 2 4 3 initial and boundary conditions 2 4 3 1 initial conditions for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the initial conditions of the groundwater depth were interpolated in the simulation area according to the groundwater depth scenario the groundwater depth was set to decrease gradually with increasing distance from the river the initial conditions for the flood eroded sandy riverbed were set according to the measured iswc of the riverbed sedimentary layer 2 4 3 2 boundary conditions for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the upper boundary was set as the atmospheric boundary and the river channel was set as the variable head boundary considering the high groundwater level the left right and lower boundaries were set as non flux boundaries fig s3a for the flood eroded sandy riverbed the upper boundary of the model was set as the atmospheric boundary whereas the riverbed was set as the variable head boundary as the groundwater within the riverbed was deeply buried and the simulated results were not affected by the groundwater level the left right and lower boundaries of the model were set as free drainage boundaries fig s3b 2 4 4 simulation scenario setting for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion five groundwater depth observation points were arranged in the riparian zone of the experimental river section for several years the observation results showed that the groundwater depth in this zone was 3 m zhang et al 2018 at the observation points situated 10 m and 30 m from the river channel the groundwater depth varied from 0 2 m to 1 96 m and 1 42 2 81 m respectively at the observation points situated 150 m 300 m and 600 m from the river the groundwater depth varied from 1 22 m to 2 69 m 1 05 m to 2 37 m and 1 33 m to 2 69 m respectively thus three different initial groundwater depth scenarios were set in this study 1 5 m 2 m and 3 m assuming a fixed water diversion the water volume of each diversion would be 5000 104 m3 three different time scenarios were set for water diversion 10 d 15 d and 20 d this study simulated the influence of the water diversion time on river infiltration at different groundwater depths for the flood eroded sandy riverbed the flood duration was fixed at 800 min and three maximum flood level scenarios were set as follows 3 5 m 2 m and 1 m in addition two sedimentary environments were set on the surface of the riverbed a clay layer and a clay free layer hydrus 2d used these conditions to simulate the infiltration of a flood eroded sandy riverbed under different flood levels the difference in infiltration between the three flood levels was then compared and the influence of the clay layer on infiltration was analyzed 2 4 5 model accuracy verification the simulation results of the hydrus model were evaluated using three indices root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r 2 and relative error re the corresponding equations are as follows 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i q i 2 6 r 2 i 1 n q i q p i p i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 7 re i 1 n p i i 1 n q i 1 where p i and q i are the simulated and measured values of the ith sample respectively and n is the number of samples the rmse reflects the average degree of the absolute error between the simulated and measured values the re reflects the relative error between the simulated values and the total measured values and r 2 is the correlation between the measured and simulated values 3 results 3 1 characteristics of physical parameters 3 1 1 sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the bd of the right bank of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion was slightly higher than the bd values of the central and left banks of the riverbed the bd of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion ranged from 1 54 g cm3 to 1 63 g cm3 with an average of 1 56 g cm3 the bd varied considerably below a depth of 120 cm fig 3a the φ value was relatively high in the center of the riverbed and relatively low on the left and right banks average φ was 41 14 the φ value of the deep soil was slightly lower than that of the surface soil fig 3b the highest and lowest iswc values were observed on the left and right riverbed banks respectively in general the iswc gradually increased from the surface layer to the deep layer ranging from 0 34 to 31 35 with an average of 10 85 fig 3c in the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the average proportion of sediment with a grain size of 0 1 mm was 91 9 the grain size of 0 1 0 5 mm accounted for the largest proportion of the river reach scale fig 4a the riverbed sand grading curve for the left middle and right banks of the riverbed showed that the sediment grain size on the right bank was coarser than that on the left bank while the finest sand was in the center of the riverbed fig 4c the reason that the grain size of the right bank is slightly larger than that of the left bank may be that the altitude of the right bank is slightly higher and sand is deposited by wind during the dry flow period when the river water level is low it cannot flow over the right bank so the sand with a larger grain size is deposited here the grain size exhibited no obvious vertical variation the sand content was 90 and only small amounts of silt and clay were observed 3 1 2 flood eroded sandy riverbed the average bd of the flood eroded sandy riverbed was 1 72 g cm3 owing to the gravel at the bottom of the riverbed the bd value was lower in the surface layer and higher in the deep layer the bd increased considerably from the surface layer to a depth of 80 cm whereas it varied slightly below 80 cm fig 3d the φ values of both banks exceeded those at the center of the riverbed and the average φ was 34 93 the φ value exhibited a gradually decreasing trend from 38 to 32 from the surface layer to the deep layer of the riverbed fig 3e laterally the highest iswc was observed at the center of the riverbed vertically the iswc increased from 2 10 in the surface layer to 10 76 in the deep layer with an average of 6 20 fig 3f in the flood eroded sandy riverbed the proportion of sediment with a grain size of 0 1 mm was 78 96 the grain size of the riverbed sediments was mainly distributed in the 1 mm and 0 1 0 25 mm ranges fig 4b the riverbed sand grading curve for the left middle and right banks of the riverbed showed that the sand in the center of the riverbed was coarse while the sand on the right bank was fine fig 4d the sediment layer below 80 cm was dominated by gravel generally clay and silt were observed on the surface of the sediment layer and the grain size gradually increased from the surface layer to the deep layer 3 2 characteristics of hydraulic parameters 3 2 1 sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the sswc ranged from 0 15 cm3 cm3 to 0 19 cm3 cm3 average of 0 17 cm3 cm3 and was lowest on the right bank owing to the special sedimentary environment of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the sswc of this riverbed exhibited fluctuating changes in depth the reasons for such fluctuating changes are deliberated in the discussion section fig 5a the horizontal seepage rate of the sandy riverbed affected by the ecological water diversion was measured using a self made seepage meter compared to other seepage measurement methods the seepage meter has a lower production cost higher accuracy and considers the influences of flow velocity and water level on the infiltration rate the measurement results showed that the seepage rate of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion decreased from the upstream area of the experimental reach to the downstream area with an average seepage rate of 0 03 cm min the seepage rate of the left bank was higher than that of the right bank and center of the riverbed fig s4a the ks values of the sedimentary layers at different depths were measured using a dik 4012 four point saturation infiltration instrument the results showed that the ks of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion exhibited no obvious change characteristics with increasing depth the ks values ranged from 0 93 cm min to 2 51 cm min with an average of 1 57 cm min fig 5b as the ks value measured in the laboratory did not consider the effects of groundwater level velocity river water level and other factors on infiltration the ks value was significantly larger than that measured in the field infiltration experiment 3 2 2 flood eroded sandy riverbed the sswc of the flood eroded sandy riverbed decreased gradually with increasing depth ranging from 0 23 cm3 cm3 to 0 36 cm3 cm3 average of 0 29 cm3 cm3 the sswc in the center of the riverbed was 0 28 cm3 cm3 which was lower than that of both banks fig 5c a hood infiltration instrument was used to determine the ks value in the downstream area of the flood eroded sandy riverbed to compare the difference in the ks value across the river section the measurement points were divided into upper middle and lower segments the ks values were 0 19 cm min 0 18 cm min and 0 16 cm min for the upper middle and lower segments respectively fig s4b these results are related to the weakened effect of flood erosion and enhanced sedimentation from the upper to lower segments whereby the contents of clay and silt in the sedimentary layer gradually increased thus reducing the φ and connectivity of the sedimentary layer and the infiltration rate cheng et al 2019 vertically the ks value of the flood eroded sandy riverbed increased gradually with increasing depth ranging from 0 17 cm min to 0 60 cm min with an average of 0 32 cm min fig 5d 3 3 infiltration simulation 3 3 1 sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion after adjusting the model parameters the measured section flow in the primary water diversion process was used to simulate the change in groundwater depth which was verified by the actual measured change date in the groundwater depth the results showed that the r 2 between the measured groundwater depth and the simulated groundwater depth reached 0 986 the rmse was 0 016 and the re was 0 123 these values indicate that the simulation results were close to the actual data and that the riverbed infiltration simulation under different scenarios could be carried out using these parameters fig 6a the effects of different water diversion times on river infiltration and groundwater recharge differed as mentioned the volume of water diversion was 5000 104 m3 under different groundwater depth scenarios the highest total leakage of the river channel was observed when the water diversion time was set to 10 d this is related to the high water level of the river and that the influence of the pressure head on infiltration was greater than that of other water diversion times the characteristics of vertical leakage were like those of total leakage furthermore the lowest vertical leakage was observed when the water diversion time was 15 d whereas the highest vertical leakage was observed when the water diversion time was 10 d for different water diversion times the amount of lateral infiltration was ranked as 10 d 20 d 15 d the amount of groundwater that recharged the river water was also significantly different at various water diversion times the lowest recharge amount was observed at 10 d followed by that at 15 d and 20 d under different groundwater depth scenarios the difference in recharge was between 0 01 m2 and 0 04 m2 the initial groundwater depth had a significant impact on the river leakage with a decrease in the initial groundwater depth the amounts of total vertical and lateral leakages decreased the initial groundwater depth had a greater influence on leakage than the diversion time when the groundwater depth decreased by 0 1 m the total leakage decreased by 0 98 m2 whereas the groundwater recharge increased by 0 001 m2 table 3 in this study the total length of the test channel was 4000 m through calculations the proportion of leakage in the total runoff within the 4000 m reach varied significantly under the various simulation scenarios under different groundwater depth scenarios when the water diversion times were set to 10 d 15 d and 20 d the leakage total runoff ratio were 0 22 0 20 and 0 21 respectively under the various water diversion times when the initial groundwater depth was 1 5 m 2 m and 3 m the average leakage reached 7 78 104 m3 10 01 104 m3 and 13 40 104 m3 respectively accounting for 0 16 0 20 and 0 27 of the total runoff volume respectively table 3 in this study five observation points were set in the hydrus model 10 m 30 m 150 m 300 m and 600 m away from the river channel the changes in groundwater depth in the riparian zone under different modeling scenarios were analyzed the deeper the initial groundwater depth the greater the groundwater uplift in the riparian zone close to the river channel the variation range of groundwater depth gradually decreased as the water diversion time increased in contrast in the riparian zone farther from the river channel the variation range of groundwater depth increased as the water diversion time increased this is owing to under the same water diversion volume the river s impact on groundwater was mainly concentrated in the riparian zone close to the river channel as the water diversion time reduced the water diversion ended when it affected the riparian zone farther from the river channel under longer water diversion times the impact on the riparian zone close to the river channel was limited whereas the impact on the riparian zone farther from the river channel increased table 4 3 3 2 flood eroded sandy riverbed the field measured ks was verified with the model simulation results the results showed that the rmse re and r 2 values of ks were 0 012 0 015 and 0 994 respectively indicating that the model simulation results were reliable fig 6b fig 7 shows the cumulative lateral and vertical infiltration of the flood eroded sandy riverbed under different flood levels when the maximum flood water level was set to 3 5 m 2 m and 1 m the cumulative infiltration after 800 min reached 58 84 m2 43 52 m2 and 26 57 m2 respectively fig 7c significant differences were observed in the vertical and lateral infiltration capacities of the riverbed under different flood levels when the flood water level increased from 2 m to 3 5 m the increment in vertical infiltration decreased fig 7a whereas the increment in lateral infiltration increased fig 7b for the flood eroded sandy riverbed the overflow area at the bottom of the riverbed was smaller than that on either side of the riverbed which provided external conditions for lateral channel seepage moreover there was a clay blocking layer at the bottom of the riverbed which reduced the amount of vertical infiltration gravel layers were also present on both sides of the riverbed which provided good internal conditions for lateral infiltration in addition the flood eroded sandy riverbed had a short water discharge duration and low groundwater level thus riverbed infiltration increased as it was unaffected by groundwater when the riverbed surface had a clay layer the volume of lateral infiltration accounted for 63 42 67 57 of the total infiltration volume whereas this was 45 86 52 72 when the riverbed surface did not have a clay layer fig 7 as shown in table 5 when the maximum flood water level was 3 5 m in a 1 km river the infiltration volume reached 5 8 104 m3 accounting for 1 9 of the total flood volume in contrast when the maximum flood water levels were 2 m and 1 m infiltration accounted for 4 29 and 7 06 of the total flood volume respectively thus the infiltration volume increased as the flood level increased however the ratio of the infiltration volume to the total flood volume decreased table 5 fig 8 shows the influence of the surface clay layer of the riverbed on cumulative infiltration when the maximum flood levels were 1 m and 2 m the cumulative infiltration of the riverbed without a clay layer increased by 39 93 and 15 30 respectively relative to that with a clay layer fig 8a b when the maximum flood level was 3 5 m the clay layer reduced the amount of infiltration by 8 32 fig 8c in summary the clay layer on the surface of the flood eroded sandy riverbed had a strong blocking effect on riverbed infiltration the blocking effect of the clay layer weakened with an increase in water level the reasons for this phenomenon are as follows 1 when the water level increased the pressure head increased and the infiltration rate of the clay layer increased and 2 with an increase in the water level the lateral infiltration on both banks of the riverbed strengthened which reduced the blocking effect of the clay layer on infiltration to a certain extent 4 discussion the ks value of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion fluctuated with depth thus when the river flows along this channel the riverbed is first eroded by the flowing water and the active layer with a certain thickness of the riverbed surface is washed away when the flow was stable the riverbed was in a stable state hence erosion of the riverbed was weak whereas sedimentation was strong the sediment grain size was mainly affected by the water volume and flow velocity under high flow conditions the sediment grains deposited in the riverbed were coarse whereas they were fine under low flow conditions resulting in an alternating deposition structure of the coarse fine grain deposition layers in the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion thus the sswc and ks values fluctuated irregularly over the vertical section for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion under the same water diversion volume the pressure head and leakage both increased as the water diversion time decreased additionally the leakage volume increased as the initial groundwater level decreased the initial groundwater level had a greater influence on the amount of leakage than the water diversion time under various scenarios of the water diversion period and initial groundwater levels the leakage volume ranged from 0 13 to 0 27 104 m3 km 1 d 1 li et al 2005 used the water balance method to calculate the infiltration rate of the river from shaomaying station to langxin mountain station in the lower reaches of the heihe river to be 0 04 0 1 per kilometer in this study the infiltration rate per kilometer of the lower reaches of the heihe river is 0 04 0 07 which is consistent with previous research results min et al 2020 used the modflow model to simulate the infiltration rate of the lower heihe river channel is 0 18 0 76 per km which is higher than the results obtained in this study this may be because the total amount of runoff and the runoff period are different from those in this study the current water diversion scheme is not the most economical or effective in arid inland regions we found that shortening the water separation period and increasing the water level can increase infiltration and reduce evaporation thereby improving the water resource utilization efficiency in arid areas the ks value of the flood eroded sandy riverbed gradually increased with depth and the sandy riverbed was mainly affected by seasonal flood erosion and deposition in the low coteau area of the inland river floods occur during periods of heavy rainfall in the upstream mountainous areas the midstream area flows through the kumtag desert and is characterized by a gravel layer structure such that floods carry large amounts of sediment into the river channel after years of riverbed erosion the sediment grain size carried by the flood has gradually decreased forming the sedimentary characteristics of large sediment grains in the bottom layer and small sediment grains in the upper layer fig 4b our observations in field surveys also support this characteristic studies have shown that soil texture has a significant impact on infiltration the higher the sand content of the soil the greater the infiltration rate ma et al 2016 the ks value of the bottom layer of the riverbed was higher than that of the surface layer due to the different grain sizes of the sediment deposited in these layers the infiltration capacity was influenced by the clay layer on the riverbed surface which played a significant role in blocking flood infiltration furthermore the infiltration was significantly affected by the initial water content of the riverbed flood duration and peak discharge when flooding occurred riverbed infiltration increased rapidly the higher the flood water level the greater the cumulative infiltration however with the continuous rise in the flood level the increment of cumulative infiltration decreased under different flood water levels the leakage of the flood eroded sandy riverbed per kilometer accounted for 0 38 1 41 of the total runoff a clay layer with a thickness of 0 20 cm was observed on the surface of the flood eroded riverbed a study by doble et al 2012 showed that the ks of the clay layer is as small as 0 1 m d and has a blocking effect on riverbed infiltration zhang et al 2013 when a flood occurs the channel blocking layer will be removed but a new blocking layer will soon form and significantly reduce the infiltration rate of the riverbed chen et al 2013 which mainly occurs in shallow channels and bottom blocking will increase lateral seepage in deep channels in view of the flood erosion of the river we propose that the flood can enter the desert or gobi by artificially changing the flood channel increasing the flood travel distance thereby increasing the infiltration volume and reducing the impact of the flood on the production and life of downstream residents there have been reports in china that the mode of flood interception diversion flood infiltration groundwater overflow groundwater utilization occurs in flood eroded sandy channels chen et al 2017 niu et al 2019 compared to the flood eroded riverbed the simulation results for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion were more accurate because they were verified using the measured groundwater levels although the measured infiltration rate was used to verify the simulated infiltration of the flood eroded sandy riverbed it was limited to the vertical direction during the field investigation the ks value of the riparian zone was not measured in the simulation the sediment grain composition and ks value of the riparian zone were equal to those in the bottom layer of the riverbed which may have led to an increase in lateral seepage moreover the flood sediment content and flow velocity of the flood eroded sandy riverbed were high however the influence of sediment content on the infiltration rate was ignored in the simulation therefore this aspect should be addressed in future research when simulating the infiltration of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion evapotranspiration in the riparian forest during the overflow period was disregarded this is one of the reasons for the reduced simulation accuracy of the riverbed therefore future simulations of groundwater levels should consider the influence of evapotranspiration in riparian forests 5 conclusions in this study the physical and ks parameters of the sedimentary layers of two types of sandy riverbeds in arid inland regions were measured and compared the hydrus 2d model was used to quantitatively simulate the flood infiltration of the flood eroded sandy riverbed and the infiltration of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion in different scenarios the conclusions are as follows the water diversion period is very important to the local groundwater and ecosystem for ecological water diversion channels based on the same total runoff with a decrease in the diversion period the infiltration amount of the channel increased from 0 13 to 0 27 104 m3 km 1 d 1 therefore distributing a fixed amount of water in a short period can not only reduce losses such as evaporation but also increase the amount of infiltration downstream which is beneficial to the recovery of groundwater and ecological benefits for flood erosion channels of arid inland rivers the infiltration capacity of this channel was relatively strong and the ratio of infiltration to total flood per kilometer of the channel was between 0 38 and 1 41 at different flood levels therefore for this type of river it is possible to artificially change the flow direction of the river to gobi and desert or carry out river silt remediation to infiltrate more floods underground which can reduce the harm of floods for downstream residents we believe that there is potential for further improvement in the water resource management strategies for arid inland rivers the current water diversion scheme is not the most economical or effective in arid inland regions the water resource utilization efficiency in arid areas can be improved by rationally distributing the water diversion period and water volume the prevention and control of large scale floods is an arduous task for water resources management in arid areas by changing the direction of rivers and allowing floods to flow into deserts or gobi strong infiltration capacity in arid desert areas can be exerted and flood hazards can be effectively prevented

7905,study region two sandy riverbeds of typical arid inland rivers in northwest china one controlled by ecological water diversion and one affected by intermittent flood erosion and sedimentation study focus the infiltration mechanism in the sandy riverbeds of arid inland rivers is undetermined this study simulated the effects of water diversion time and groundwater depth on ecological diversion channels as well as the effects of flood water level and clay layer on the infiltration capacity of flood eroded riverbeds this study provides a scientific basis for rational ecological water diversion strategies and flood disaster prevention new hydrological insights for the region this study found that the water diversion period is very important to the local groundwater and ecosystem for ecological water diversion channels based on the total runoff when decreasing the diversion time the infiltration amount of the channel increased from 0 13 to 0 27 104 m3 km 1 d 1 therefore distributing a fixed amount of water downstream in a short period can not only reduce losses but also increases the amount of infiltration the infiltration capacity of this channel is relatively strong for flood erosion channels of arid inland rivers and the ratio of infiltration to total flood per kilometer of the channel was between 0 38 and 1 41 at different flood levels therefore it is possible to artificially change the flow direction or carry out river silt remediation to infiltrate more flooding underground which can reduce the harm of downstream flooding graphical abstract ga1 keywords arid inland river sandy riverbed hydraulic conductivity riverbed sediment hydrus model infiltration mechanism 1 introduction the lower reaches of arid inland rivers rely on surface water and groundwater for maintenance and the riverbed is the transmission link between rivers and groundwater calver 2001 brunner et al 2017 riverbed infiltration is significant for groundwater recharge batlle aguilar and cook 2012 chen et al 2013 in the lower reaches of arid inland rivers runoff is intermittent and the dry flow period can be relatively long for example in the lower reaches of the heihe river the average dry flow period was 150 days year from 2000 to 2016 hence the impact of intermittent rivers on the production and lives of local people cannot be overlooked jaeger 2021 quantifying riverbed infiltration and its contribution to groundwater recharge under a high sand content and seasonal or intermittent runoff and determining the impact of the variation in riverbed infiltration on regional groundwater recharge can support the rational development and utilization of regional water resources to maintain regional water balance many studies have been carried out on the physical characteristics of riverbeds zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 method of measuring riverbed infiltration goodrich et al 2004 genereux et al 2008 heterogeneity and spatiotemporal variations in hydraulic conductivity parameters wu et al 2013 estimation of the amount of riverbed infiltration and its influencing factors newcomer et al 2016 liu et al 2017 and establishment and simulation of riverbed infiltration models kacimov and obnosov 2019 arid inland rivers typically have sandy or sandy loamy riverbeds studies on riverbed seepage have mostly concentrated on riverbed hydraulic conductivity particularly the saturation infiltration rate simpson and meixner 2012 wu et al 2013 villeneuve et al 2015 both direct and indirect research methods have been used to estimate point scale and regional scale riverbed infiltration recharge goodrich et al 2004 genereux et al 2008 at the point scale these methods include field observations rosenberry and pitlick 2009 drill holes wallace et al 1990 geochemical tracers vanderzalm et al 2011 isotopes kim et al 2020 semwal et al 2020 water chemistry gagne et al 2018 and water heat and solute transport methods shanafield et al 2010 at the regional scale these methods include the water balance approach alsmadi and abdelal 2018 surface geophysical exploration shanafield et al 2020 remote sensing monitoring bhatnagar and jain 2020 groundwater level fluctuation analysis and numerical simulation chenini and mammou 2010 although a variety of methods can be used to estimate riverbed infiltration there are fewer methods available for seasonal rivers seasonal rivers have strong transient flow characteristics and the flow velocity tends to rapidly decrease to zero at the end of a rainstorm event intermittent rivers under human control tend to exhibit similar characteristics thus for seasonal or intermittent rivers double ring infiltration meters zhang and li 2020 continuous monitoring of groundwater fluctuations shentsis and rosenthal 2003 the wet front method dahan et al 2008 temperature monitoring irvine et al 2019 and groundwater tracer methods cook 2015 can be used to measure riverbed infiltration these methods are indirect tools for estimating riverbed infiltration by measuring related parameters excluding the field infiltration test conducted at the river reach scale batlle aguilar and cook 2012 there are no robust methods to directly measure the infiltration fluxes of seasonal and intermittent rivers the factors influencing the infiltration of the riverbed system mainly include the geological conditions of the riverbed river morphology river flow the difference between the water level of the river and the groundwater level water shortage in the unsaturated soil zone and the duration of the discharge time the infiltration of seasonal rivers also depends on the short duration water flow in the river channel as well as factors such as the permeability of the riverbed occurrence conditions of the aquifer and exploitation intensity of groundwater calver 2001 xi et al 2008 rosenberry and healy 2012 head et al 2014 newcomer et al 2016 liu et al 2017 early studies on riverbed infiltration simulation used numerical and analytical models spalding and khaleel 1991 although recent river models can provide a simple assessment of groundwater recharge from river infiltration their applicability is limited welsh et al 2013 some models can simulate water flow in the vadose zone such as hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2006 moodhms hydrogeologic 2006 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2011 however the corresponding calculations are laborious and their application on a regional scale is limited moreover by observing the groundwater level and temperature a heat flow model can be used to calculate the riverbed infiltration rate the vs2dhi yosef et al 2018 model developed by the united states geological survey usgs can be used to solve real time changes in the riverbed infiltration rate numerous mature models have recently been developed such as the hydrus 2d 3d model which has been widely used to study riverbed infiltration at the regional scale šimůnek et al 2016 kacimov and obnosov 2019 it is important to quantify the contribution of riverbed seepage to groundwater recharge chai et al 2021 the quantification of recharge is a significant prerequisite for effective groundwater resource management similarly there is also an urgent need to estimate groundwater recharge and sustainable water production from groundwater aquifers to support sustainable development and utilization of water resources obuobie et al 2012 several methods can be used to estimate groundwater recharge by riverbed infiltration including the water balance maruyama et al 2013 schulz et al 2013 pumping test rao et al 2020 water fluctuation obuobie et al 2012 and numerical simulation methods ghysels et al 2019 min et al 2020 thus some progress has been made in the simulation and quantitative analysis of riverbed infiltration in china and other countries however with the refined demand for water resource management current research has tended to focus on the direct estimation of regional scale riverbed infiltration and recharge through model simulations studies of sandy riverbeds in inland river basins have mostly focused on the measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity simpson and meixner 2012 wu et al 2013 villeneuve et al 2015 spatial variation characteristics wu et al 2013 and factors affecting infiltration head et al 2014 newcomer et al 2016 liu et al 2017 yet the infiltration mechanism of typical sandy riverbeds in inland river basins is not fully discussed especially 1 for the ecological water diversion riverbed the current water diversion mode is most conducive to groundwater restoration and the development of the riparian forest ecosystem and 2 for the flood eroded river channel the influence of different flood water levels on the infiltration is unclear it is uncertain if it is possible to increase the flood travel distance by changing the original river channel thereby increasing the infiltration amount and reducing the harm of the flood to the production and life of downstream residents to solve these problems this study aimed to obtain the physical and hydraulic conduction parameters of the riverbed sedimentary layer through field sampling and laboratory experiments using the hydrus model to simulate the effects of water diversion time groundwater depth flood water level and clay layer on the infiltration capacity of the riverbed the scientific novelty of this study is that it considers the two most common types of sandy riverbeds in inland river basins and through different scenarios the effects of the water diversion period groundwater depth flood water level and clay layer on riverbed infiltration are clearly analyzed therefore more effective ecological water diversion strategies and flood control measures have been proposed this study provides a scientific basis for rational development and utilization of water resources in inland river basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area two sandy riverbeds sand content 90 of typical arid inland rivers in northwest china were selected as research sites in this study fig 1a the first type of riverbed represents rivers that practice ecological water diversion schemes such as the heihe tarim and shiyang rivers the lower reach of the heihe river 96 42 102 04 e 39 45 42 40 n was selected as the representative of the ecological water diversion river which has a large drainage area fig 1b and is replenished by precipitation in mountainous areas and glacial snow meltwater the middle reaches are the main water use areas while the downstream region is affected by ecological water diversion fig s1a and has a width to depth ratio of approximately 400 1 during the long cut off period the downstream riverbed was affected by sandstorm erosion and sediment accumulation of different intensities during the discharge period the riverbed was affected by water erosion and redeposition and the riverbed sedimentary layer was relatively thick therefore the sandy riverbed in the heihe river was affected by ecological water diversion the other type of riverbed is a river that exists widely in the piedmont alluvial proluvial fan area in northwest china and is often damaged by floods in summer as represented by the xitugou watershed in yangguan dunhuang 39 15 40 00 n 93 44 94 11 e fig 1c its supply source is mainly seasonal short duration heavy precipitation in the upstream mountainous area which flows downstream in the form of a flood fig s1b the downstream riverbed is mainly affected by flood erosion and sedimentation forming a morphological feature of a deep narrow and curved riverbed with a clay covered surface the width to depth ratio of the riverbed channel was approximately 22 5 hence this type of riverbed was classified as a flood eroded sandy riverbed these two types of riverbeds are common in arid inland regions and are representative of the inland river basins although both riverbeds are sandy their causes and characteristics differ comparative studies on the infiltration mechanisms of these two types of riverbeds are important for gaining a deep and comprehensive understanding of the recharge contribution of arid inland rivers to regional water resources and regional water balance 2 2 sampling information riverbed samples were collected in july and august 2020 four river sections were selected to excavate the soil profiles of both riverbanks and the center of each section table s1 the depth of each soil profile was between 100 cm and 140 cm and the sampling interval was 20 cm we collected sediment samples at a sampling interval of 20 cm for two reasons first we observed that the physical composition of the sedimentary layer in the riverbed varied vertically at intervals greater than 20 cm second related studies used 20 cm as the sampling interval crosbie et al 2014 a cutting ring was used to determine the saturated soil water content sswc bulk density bd porosity φ and hydraulic conductivity ks an aluminum box was used to determine the initial soil water content iswc and the grain size composition of the soil for each layer three replicate samples were taken to the laboratory to determine the relevant physical properties and infiltration performance 2 3 calculations of the seepage rate and ks the cutting ring samples were brought back to the laboratory and soaked for 24 h to saturate the soil the ks value of each sample was measured using a dik 4012 four point saturation infiltration instrument fig s2a the equation for calculating ks is as follows 1 k s q a t h l where q is the water flux ml a is the cross sectional area of the sample 19 6 cm2 δh is the difference in the water head 6 8 cm l is the length of the sample 5 1 cm and t is time s a hood infiltration instrument was used to measure the ks of the flood channels the instrument adjusted the infiltration pressure by using a markov bottle an infiltration chamber was directly installed on the soil surface and water was passed through the water diversion pipeline the pressure could be supplemented at any time and results were automatically collected and recorded fig s2b compared to other measurement methods the hood infiltration instrument does not disturb the soil the measurement results are closer to the actual hydraulic conductivity and the dispersion of the results is the smallest schwärzel and punzel 2007 li et al 2019 in this study a self made leakage monitoring device was used to accurately quantify the actual infiltration of river water this experimental device was divided into three parts a leakage bucket soft water bag and connecting pipe according to the connector principle the water in the soft water bag enters the leakage bucket under the action of water pressure to perform the infiltration process the leakage bucket was a cylinder with an open bottom inserted into the riverbed to prevent external water from entering the leakage bucket to quantify the seepage rate for the cross sectional area of the leakage bucket the water from the soft water bag was the only source of water in the bucket fig s2c this method has been applied during previous research rosenberry 2008 2 4 hydrus model hydrus 2d is a finite element model that can be used to simulate soil water flow and two dimensional solute movement šimůnek et al 2016 the flow state of the model is a two dimensional saturated unsaturated darcy flow that disregards the influence of air on soil flow movement the flow control equation adopts the richards equation celia et al 1990 the hydrus model is widely used to simulate soil moisture and solute transport šimunek et al 2018 yang et al 2019 er raki et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the hydrus model can flexibly handle various flow boundaries such as constant head and variable head boundaries seepage boundaries atmospheric boundaries and drainage boundaries the flow area itself can be an irregular flow boundary or composed of anisotropic heterogeneous soil through an irregular triangular mesh division of the flow area the governing equations were solved using the galerkin linear finite element method regardless of the saturated or unsaturated conditions time was discretized by an implicit difference the discretized nonlinear governing equations were linearized using an iterative method 2 4 1 basic equation of water movement it is assumed that the influence of meteorological factors can be ignored and that the soil structure is not affected by water movement the basic equation of water movement was numerically solved using the richards equation celia et al 1990 šimůnek et al 2011 2 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h z s where θ is the soil volumetric moisture content m3 m3 h is the soil negative pressure head m k

layer of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion was divided into three layers surface stability and bottom five groundwater level observation points were arranged on the river bank the riverbed width was 200 m fig s3a owing to the obvious vertical difference in the riverbed sediment layer in the flood eroded sandy riverbed it was divided into seven layers according to the sampling interval thick gravel layers with high permeability were observed at the bottom of the riverbed fig s3b 2 4 2 2 hydraulic parameters the measured grain size and bd were used as the input parameters for the hydrus model to generate the initial hydraulic parameters fig 2 for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion a measured water diversion event was subsequently selected to simulate the change in groundwater depth during the water diversion period this was then compared with the corresponding measured change in groundwater depth and the model parameters were constantly adjusted until the model simulation results were in good agreement with the measured results fig 2 the adjusted model parameters are listed in table 1 for the flood eroded sandy riverbed use of the measured ks to adjust the initial hydraulic parameters and the determined hydraulic parameters are listed in table 2 2 4 3 initial and boundary conditions 2 4 3 1 initial conditions for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the initial conditions of the groundwater depth were interpolated in the simulation area according to the groundwater depth scenario the groundwater depth was set to decrease gradually with increasing distance from the river the initial conditions for the flood eroded sandy riverbed were set according to the measured iswc of the riverbed sedimentary layer 2 4 3 2 boundary conditions for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the upper boundary was set as the atmospheric boundary and the river channel was set as the variable head boundary considering the high groundwater level the left right and lower boundaries were set as non flux boundaries fig s3a for the flood eroded sandy riverbed the upper boundary of the model was set as the atmospheric boundary whereas the riverbed was set as the variable head boundary as the groundwater within the riverbed was deeply buried and the simulated results were not affected by the groundwater level the left right and lower boundaries of the model were set as free drainage boundaries fig s3b 2 4 4 simulation scenario setting for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion five groundwater depth observation points were arranged in the riparian zone of the experimental river section for several years the observation results showed that the groundwater depth in this zone was 3 m zhang et al 2018 at the observation points situated 10 m and 30 m from the river channel the groundwater depth varied from 0 2 m to 1 96 m and 1 42 2 81 m respectively at the observation points situated 150 m 300 m and 600 m from the river the groundwater depth varied from 1 22 m to 2 69 m 1 05 m to 2 37 m and 1 33 m to 2 69 m respectively thus three different initial groundwater depth scenarios were set in this study 1 5 m 2 m and 3 m assuming a fixed water diversion the water volume of each diversion would be 5000 104 m3 three different time scenarios were set for water diversion 10 d 15 d and 20 d this study simulated the influence of the water diversion time on river infiltration at different groundwater depths for the flood eroded sandy riverbed the flood duration was fixed at 800 min and three maximum flood level scenarios were set as follows 3 5 m 2 m and 1 m in addition two sedimentary environments were set on the surface of the riverbed a clay layer and a clay free layer hydrus 2d used these conditions to simulate the infiltration of a flood eroded sandy riverbed under different flood levels the difference in infiltration between the three flood levels was then compared and the influence of the clay layer on infiltration was analyzed 2 4 5 model accuracy verification the simulation results of the hydrus model were evaluated using three indices root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r 2 and relative error re the corresponding equations are as follows 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i q i 2 6 r 2 i 1 n q i q p i p i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 7 re i 1 n p i i 1 n q i 1 where p i and q i are the simulated and measured values of the ith sample respectively and n is the number of samples the rmse reflects the average degree of the absolute error between the simulated and measured values the re reflects the relative error between the simulated values and the total measured values and r 2 is the correlation between the measured and simulated values 3 results 3 1 characteristics of physical parameters 3 1 1 sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the bd of the right bank of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion was slightly higher than the bd values of the central and left banks of the riverbed the bd of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion ranged from 1 54 g cm3 to 1 63 g cm3 with an average of 1 56 g cm3 the bd varied considerably below a depth of 120 cm fig 3a the φ value was relatively high in the center of the riverbed and relatively low on the left and right banks average φ was 41 14 the φ value of the deep soil was slightly lower than that of the surface soil fig 3b the highest and lowest iswc values were observed on the left and right riverbed banks respectively in general the iswc gradually increased from the surface layer to the deep layer ranging from 0 34 to 31 35 with an average of 10 85 fig 3c in the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the average proportion of sediment with a grain size of 0 1 mm was 91 9 the grain size of 0 1 0 5 mm accounted for the largest proportion of the river reach scale fig 4a the riverbed sand grading curve for the left middle and right banks of the riverbed showed that the sediment grain size on the right bank was coarser than that on the left bank while the finest sand was in the center of the riverbed fig 4c the reason that the grain size of the right bank is slightly larger than that of the left bank may be that the altitude of the right bank is slightly higher and sand is deposited by wind during the dry flow period when the river water level is low it cannot flow over the right bank so the sand with a larger grain size is deposited here the grain size exhibited no obvious vertical variation the sand content was 90 and only small amounts of silt and clay were observed 3 1 2 flood eroded sandy riverbed the average bd of the flood eroded sandy riverbed was 1 72 g cm3 owing to the gravel at the bottom of the riverbed the bd value was lower in the surface layer and higher in the deep layer the bd increased considerably from the surface layer to a depth of 80 cm whereas it varied slightly below 80 cm fig 3d the φ values of both banks exceeded those at the center of the riverbed and the average φ was 34 93 the φ value exhibited a gradually decreasing trend from 38 to 32 from the surface layer to the deep layer of the riverbed fig 3e laterally the highest iswc was observed at the center of the riverbed vertically the iswc increased from 2 10 in the surface layer to 10 76 in the deep layer with an average of 6 20 fig 3f in the flood eroded sandy riverbed the proportion of sediment with a grain size of 0 1 mm was 78 96 the grain size of the riverbed sediments was mainly distributed in the 1 mm and 0 1 0 25 mm ranges fig 4b the riverbed sand grading curve for the left middle and right banks of the riverbed showed that the sand in the center of the riverbed was coarse while the sand on the right bank was fine fig 4d the sediment layer below 80 cm was dominated by gravel generally clay and silt were observed on the surface of the sediment layer and the grain size gradually increased from the surface layer to the deep layer 3 2 characteristics of hydraulic parameters 3 2 1 sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the sswc ranged from 0 15 cm3 cm3 to 0 19 cm3 cm3 average of 0 17 cm3 cm3 and was lowest on the right bank owing to the special sedimentary environment of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion the sswc of this riverbed exhibited fluctuating changes in depth the reasons for such fluctuating changes are deliberated in the discussion section fig 5a the horizontal seepage rate of the sandy riverbed affected by the ecological water diversion was measured using a self made seepage meter compared to other seepage measurement methods the seepage meter has a lower production cost higher accuracy and considers the influences of flow velocity and water level on the infiltration rate the measurement results showed that the seepage rate of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion decreased from the upstream area of the experimental reach to the downstream area with an average seepage rate of 0 03 cm min the seepage rate of the left bank was higher than that of the right bank and center of the riverbed fig s4a the ks values of the sedimentary layers at different depths were measured using a dik 4012 four point saturation infiltration instrument the results showed that the ks of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion exhibited no obvious change characteristics with increasing depth the ks values ranged from 0 93 cm min to 2 51 cm min with an average of 1 57 cm min fig 5b as the ks value measured in the laboratory did not consider the effects of groundwater level velocity river water level and other factors on infiltration the ks value was significantly larger than that measured in the field infiltration experiment 3 2 2 flood eroded sandy riverbed the sswc of the flood eroded sandy riverbed decreased gradually with increasing depth ranging from 0 23 cm3 cm3 to 0 36 cm3 cm3 average of 0 29 cm3 cm3 the sswc in the center of the riverbed was 0 28 cm3 cm3 which was lower than that of both banks fig 5c a hood infiltration instrument was used to determine the ks value in the downstream area of the flood eroded sandy riverbed to compare the difference in the ks value across the river section the measurement points were divided into upper middle and lower segments the ks values were 0 19 cm min 0 18 cm min and 0 16 cm min for the upper middle and lower segments respectively fig s4b these results are related to the weakened effect of flood erosion and enhanced sedimentation from the upper to lower segments whereby the contents of clay and silt in the sedimentary layer gradually increased thus reducing the φ and connectivity of the sedimentary layer and the infiltration rate cheng et al 2019 vertically the ks value of the flood eroded sandy riverbed increased gradually with increasing depth ranging from 0 17 cm min to 0 60 cm min with an average of 0 32 cm min fig 5d 3 3 infiltration simulation 3 3 1 sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion after adjusting the model parameters the measured section flow in the primary water diversion process was used to simulate the change in groundwater depth which was verified by the actual measured change date in the groundwater depth the results showed that the r 2 between the measured groundwater depth and the simulated groundwater depth reached 0 986 the rmse was 0 016 and the re was 0 123 these values indicate that the simulation results were close to the actual data and that the riverbed infiltration simulation under different scenarios could be carried out using these parameters fig 6a the effects of different water diversion times on river infiltration and groundwater recharge differed as mentioned the volume of water diversion was 5000 104 m3 under different groundwater depth scenarios the highest total leakage of the river channel was observed when the water diversion time was set to 10 d this is related to the high water level of the river and that the influence of the pressure head on infiltration was greater than that of other water diversion times the characteristics of vertical leakage were like those of total leakage furthermore the lowest vertical leakage was observed when the water diversion time was 15 d whereas the highest vertical leakage was observed when the water diversion time was 10 d for different water diversion times the amount of lateral infiltration was ranked as 10 d 20 d 15 d the amount of groundwater that recharged the river water was also significantly different at various water diversion times the lowest recharge amount was observed at 10 d followed by that at 15 d and 20 d under different groundwater depth scenarios the difference in recharge was between 0 01 m2 and 0 04 m2 the initial groundwater depth had a significant impact on the river leakage with a decrease in the initial groundwater depth the amounts of total vertical and lateral leakages decreased the initial groundwater depth had a greater influence on leakage than the diversion time when the groundwater depth decreased by 0 1 m the total leakage decreased by 0 98 m2 whereas the groundwater recharge increased by 0 001 m2 table 3 in this study the total length of the test channel was 4000 m through calculations the proportion of leakage in the total runoff within the 4000 m reach varied significantly under the various simulation scenarios under different groundwater depth scenarios when the water diversion times were set to 10 d 15 d and 20 d the leakage total runoff ratio were 0 22 0 20 and 0 21 respectively under the various water diversion times when the initial groundwater depth was 1 5 m 2 m and 3 m the average leakage reached 7 78 104 m3 10 01 104 m3 and 13 40 104 m3 respectively accounting for 0 16 0 20 and 0 27 of the total runoff volume respectively table 3 in this study five observation points were set in the hydrus model 10 m 30 m 150 m 300 m and 600 m away from the river channel the changes in groundwater depth in the riparian zone under different modeling scenarios were analyzed the deeper the initial groundwater depth the greater the groundwater uplift in the riparian zone close to the river channel the variation range of groundwater depth gradually decreased as the water diversion time increased in contrast in the riparian zone farther from the river channel the variation range of groundwater depth increased as the water diversion time increased this is owing to under the same water diversion volume the river s impact on groundwater was mainly concentrated in the riparian zone close to the river channel as the water diversion time reduced the water diversion ended when it affected the riparian zone farther from the river channel under longer water diversion times the impact on the riparian zone close to the river channel was limited whereas the impact on the riparian zone farther from the river channel increased table 4 3 3 2 flood eroded sandy riverbed the field measured ks was verified with the model simulation results the results showed that the rmse re and r 2 values of ks were 0 012 0 015 and 0 994 respectively indicating that the model simulation results were reliable fig 6b fig 7 shows the cumulative lateral and vertical infiltration of the flood eroded sandy riverbed under different flood levels when the maximum flood water level was set to 3 5 m 2 m and 1 m the cumulative infiltration after 800 min reached 58 84 m2 43 52 m2 and 26 57 m2 respectively fig 7c significant differences were observed in the vertical and lateral infiltration capacities of the riverbed under different flood levels when the flood water level increased from 2 m to 3 5 m the increment in vertical infiltration decreased fig 7a whereas the increment in lateral infiltration increased fig 7b for the flood eroded sandy riverbed the overflow area at the bottom of the riverbed was smaller than that on either side of the riverbed which provided external conditions for lateral channel seepage moreover there was a clay blocking layer at the bottom of the riverbed which reduced the amount of vertical infiltration gravel layers were also present on both sides of the riverbed which provided good internal conditions for lateral infiltration in addition the flood eroded sandy riverbed had a short water discharge duration and low groundwater level thus riverbed infiltration increased as it was unaffected by groundwater when the riverbed surface had a clay layer the volume of lateral infiltration accounted for 63 42 67 57 of the total infiltration volume whereas this was 45 86 52 72 when the riverbed surface did not have a clay layer fig 7 as shown in table 5 when the maximum flood water level was 3 5 m in a 1 km river the infiltration volume reached 5 8 104 m3 accounting for 1 9 of the total flood volume in contrast when the maximum flood water levels were 2 m and 1 m infiltration accounted for 4 29 and 7 06 of the total flood volume respectively thus the infiltration volume increased as the flood level increased however the ratio of the infiltration volume to the total flood volume decreased table 5 fig 8 shows the influence of the surface clay layer of the riverbed on cumulative infiltration when the maximum flood levels were 1 m and 2 m the cumulative infiltration of the riverbed without a clay layer increased by 39 93 and 15 30 respectively relative to that with a clay layer fig 8a b when the maximum flood level was 3 5 m the clay layer reduced the amount of infiltration by 8 32 fig 8c in summary the clay layer on the surface of the flood eroded sandy riverbed had a strong blocking effect on riverbed infiltration the blocking effect of the clay layer weakened with an increase in water level the reasons for this phenomenon are as follows 1 when the water level increased the pressure head increased and the infiltration rate of the clay layer increased and 2 with an increase in the water level the lateral infiltration on both banks of the riverbed strengthened which reduced the blocking effect of the clay layer on infiltration to a certain extent 4 discussion the ks value of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion fluctuated with depth thus when the river flows along this channel the riverbed is first eroded by the flowing water and the active layer with a certain thickness of the riverbed surface is washed away when the flow was stable the riverbed was in a stable state hence erosion of the riverbed was weak whereas sedimentation was strong the sediment grain size was mainly affected by the water volume and flow velocity under high flow conditions the sediment grains deposited in the riverbed were coarse whereas they were fine under low flow conditions resulting in an alternating deposition structure of the coarse fine grain deposition layers in the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion thus the sswc and ks values fluctuated irregularly over the vertical section for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion under the same water diversion volume the pressure head and leakage both increased as the water diversion time decreased additionally the leakage volume increased as the initial groundwater level decreased the initial groundwater level had a greater influence on the amount of leakage than the water diversion time under various scenarios of the water diversion period and initial groundwater levels the leakage volume ranged from 0 13 to 0 27 104 m3 km 1 d 1 li et al 2005 used the water balance method to calculate the infiltration rate of the river from shaomaying station to langxin mountain station in the lower reaches of the heihe river to be 0 04 0 1 per kilometer in this study the infiltration rate per kilometer of the lower reaches of the heihe river is 0 04 0 07 which is consistent with previous research results min et al 2020 used the modflow model to simulate the infiltration rate of the lower heihe river channel is 0 18 0 76 per km which is higher than the results obtained in this study this may be because the total amount of runoff and the runoff period are different from those in this study the current water diversion scheme is not the most economical or effective in arid inland regions we found that shortening the water separation period and increasing the water level can increase infiltration and reduce evaporation thereby improving the water resource utilization efficiency in arid areas the ks value of the flood eroded sandy riverbed gradually increased with depth and the sandy riverbed was mainly affected by seasonal flood erosion and deposition in the low coteau area of the inland river floods occur during periods of heavy rainfall in the upstream mountainous areas the midstream area flows through the kumtag desert and is characterized by a gravel layer structure such that floods carry large amounts of sediment into the river channel after years of riverbed erosion the sediment grain size carried by the flood has gradually decreased forming the sedimentary characteristics of large sediment grains in the bottom layer and small sediment grains in the upper layer fig 4b our observations in field surveys also support this characteristic studies have shown that soil texture has a significant impact on infiltration the higher the sand content of the soil the greater the infiltration rate ma et al 2016 the ks value of the bottom layer of the riverbed was higher than that of the surface layer due to the different grain sizes of the sediment deposited in these layers the infiltration capacity was influenced by the clay layer on the riverbed surface which played a significant role in blocking flood infiltration furthermore the infiltration was significantly affected by the initial water content of the riverbed flood duration and peak discharge when flooding occurred riverbed infiltration increased rapidly the higher the flood water level the greater the cumulative infiltration however with the continuous rise in the flood level the increment of cumulative infiltration decreased under different flood water levels the leakage of the flood eroded sandy riverbed per kilometer accounted for 0 38 1 41 of the total runoff a clay layer with a thickness of 0 20 cm was observed on the surface of the flood eroded riverbed a study by doble et al 2012 showed that the ks of the clay layer is as small as 0 1 m d and has a blocking effect on riverbed infiltration zhang et al 2013 when a flood occurs the channel blocking layer will be removed but a new blocking layer will soon form and significantly reduce the infiltration rate of the riverbed chen et al 2013 which mainly occurs in shallow channels and bottom blocking will increase lateral seepage in deep channels in view of the flood erosion of the river we propose that the flood can enter the desert or gobi by artificially changing the flood channel increasing the flood travel distance thereby increasing the infiltration volume and reducing the impact of the flood on the production and life of downstream residents there have been reports in china that the mode of flood interception diversion flood infiltration groundwater overflow groundwater utilization occurs in flood eroded sandy channels chen et al 2017 niu et al 2019 compared to the flood eroded riverbed the simulation results for the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion were more accurate because they were verified using the measured groundwater levels although the measured infiltration rate was used to verify the simulated infiltration of the flood eroded sandy riverbed it was limited to the vertical direction during the field investigation the ks value of the riparian zone was not measured in the simulation the sediment grain composition and ks value of the riparian zone were equal to those in the bottom layer of the riverbed which may have led to an increase in lateral seepage moreover the flood sediment content and flow velocity of the flood eroded sandy riverbed were high however the influence of sediment content on the infiltration rate was ignored in the simulation therefore this aspect should be addressed in future research when simulating the infiltration of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion evapotranspiration in the riparian forest during the overflow period was disregarded this is one of the reasons for the reduced simulation accuracy of the riverbed therefore future simulations of groundwater levels should consider the influence of evapotranspiration in riparian forests 5 conclusions in this study the physical and ks parameters of the sedimentary layers of two types of sandy riverbeds in arid inland regions were measured and compared the hydrus 2d model was used to quantitatively simulate the flood infiltration of the flood eroded sandy riverbed and the infiltration of the sandy riverbed affected by ecological water diversion in different scenarios the conclusions are as follows the water diversion period is very important to the local groundwater and ecosystem for ecological water diversion channels based on the same total runoff with a decrease in the diversion period the infiltration amount of the channel increased from 0 13 to 0 27 104 m3 km 1 d 1 therefore distributing a fixed amount of water in a short period can not only reduce losses such as evaporation but also increase the amount of infiltration downstream which is beneficial to the recovery of groundwater and ecological benefits for flood erosion channels of arid inland rivers the infiltration capacity of this channel was relatively strong and the ratio of infiltration to total flood per kilometer of the channel was between 0 38 and 1 41 at different flood levels therefore for this type of river it is possible to artificially change the flow direction of the river to gobi and desert or carry out river silt remediation to infiltrate more floods underground which can reduce the harm of floods for downstream residents we believe that there is potential for further improvement in the water resource management strategies for arid inland rivers the current water diversion scheme is not the most economical or effective in arid inland regions the water resource utilization efficiency in arid areas can be improved by rationally distributing the water diversion period and water volume the prevention and control of large scale floods is an arduous task for water resources management in arid areas by changing the direction of rivers and allowing floods to flow into deserts or gobi strong infiltration capacity in arid desert areas can be exerted and flood hazards can be effectively prevented

7906,study region this study is performed for the volcanic aquifers of semi humid lake tana basin in northwest ethiopia the source region of blue nile basin study focus estimating groundwater recharge at required spatial and temporal scale is a challenge in groundwater management sustainability and pollution studies in this study the physically based wetspass model is applied the recharge by wetspass is validated with estimations by water table fluctuation wtf and chloride mass balance cmb methods evaluating the groundwater recharge estimation mechanism for the volcanic aquifers lying at different topographical setting that represents wide part of the world groundwater aquifers and suggesting more appropriate methods will benefit different similar studies new hydrological insights for the region the mean annual rainfall recharge surface runoff and evapotranspiration are estimated at 1431 mm 315 mm 416 mm and 770 mm respectively the recharge varies from 0 to 57 of the rainfall a high variation is also noted using wtf and cmb methods showing the strong heterogeneous nature of the hydro meteoro logical characteristics of the area wetspass is effective in aquifers where diffuse recharging mechanism is the predominant type and recharge is controlled by rainfall hence it is found less effective in the storage controlled flat floodplain alluvial and fractured rock aquifer areas in these areas the point estimates by the wtf and cmb are effective and can be considered as reliable values graphical abstract ga1 keywords lake tana basin recharge wetspass wtf cmb storage controlled diffuse recharge 1 introduction groundwater recharge is all water that reaches the groundwater aquifer from any direction scanlon et al 2002 in specific terms it is defined as the height of the water column that enters the saturated zone after crossing the vadose zone in a specific period manna et al 2016 understanding recharge processes and its quantification is vital for sustainable management and protection of the groundwater resources ferede et al 2020 healy and cook 2002 uugulu and wanke 2020 however it is one of the most difficult water budget components to be evaluated with acceptable accuracy hornero et al 2016 this is particularly true in areas with wide heterogeneity of geological topographical and hydro climatic conditions thus groundwater managers should take recharge estimations and their uncertainty into account in the management plans hornero et al 2016 as recharge processes significantly vary from area to area there is no guarantee that one method effectively apply for one locality gives reasonable results for another obuobie et al 2012 different methods are developed for recharge estimation however choosing appropriate methods is often challenging important considerations in choosing a technique include space time scales range and reliability of recharge estimates which in turn depend on the goal of the study scanlon et al 2002 for instance groundwater resources assessment of an area may be achieved at a small space time scale but flow and contaminant modeling need quantification of recharge amounts at large spatial as well as temporal scales there is a strong groundwater recharge variability across the ethiopian volcanic rock aquifers alemayehu and kebede 2011 ayenew et al 2008 demlie et al 2008 2007 kebede et al 2005 lake tana basin which is one of the major basins in the ethiopian volcanic plateau has high hydrogeological and topographical variabilities furthermore the area has a climate with long dry winters and short rainy summer seasons hence the groundwater recharge discharge processes are expected to vary highly both spatially and temporally there are a number of recharge estimation methods their effectiveness depend on the recharge mechanism healy and cook 2002 hence understanding and identifying the recharging mechanism of aquifers and the assumptions of different estimations methods is a key to effectively choose among the different techniques scanlon et al 2002 tilahun et al 2009 on fractured aquifers where preferential flow dominates focused recharge is a major recharge mechanism rather than the diffuse recharge water balance models estimate better the diffuse recharge zhu et al 2020 while water point measuring based methods such as water table fluctuation are preferable for focused recharge mechanisms scanlon et al 2002 one of the challenges for the point recharge estimation methods is their incapability to estimate it in a spatially distributed way given the high spatial variability of recharge due to variations in geology topography soil texture land use and meteorological variables it is unwise to extrapolate or regionalize the result by the conventional point recharge estimation techniques tilahun and merkel 2009 in this study a physically based water balance model called wetspass which simulates recharge in a spatially and temporally distributed manner is applied water table fluctuation and chloride mass balance methods have been used to identify the recharge mechanisms to compare and cross validate the result by the wetspass model these methods have been applied in several studies the wetspass model for example in batelaan and de smedt 2007 for dijle demer and nete river catchements in northeast belgium gebreyohannes et al 2013 for geba river basin northern ethiopia graf and przybyłek 2018 for obra river basin poland salem et al 2019 for drava basin hungary ashaolu 2020 for osun river basin nigeria yenehun et al 2020 for upper kliti river basin northwest ethiopia the wtf method have been also applied in several studies for example by sophocleous 1991 for the plain aquifers of central kansas plains usa healy and cook 2002 tested for different alluvial and fracture aquifers of the world moon et al 2004 for aquifers of south korea crosbie et al 2005 for the tomago sand beds near newcastle australia marechal et al 2006 for a small watershed in hyderabad india mikunthan and de silva 2009 for the limeston aquifer of jaffna district nigate et al 2020 for infranz catchment northwest ethiopia similarly the cmb method has also been used for example by allison and hughes 1978 for unconfined aquifer of gambier plain of gambier islands allison 1988 for semi arid areas groundwater aquifers guan et al 2010 in the mount lofty ranges a coastal hilly area in south australia somaratne and smettem 2014 for karst aquifers in southern australia uugulu and wanke 2020 for different rainfall gradients of tsumeb waterberg and kuzikus regions of nambia many hydrological models for different areas small catchment scale to large basins are developed for estimating groundwater recharge however evaluation of the methods with point estimations based on direct water level measurement wtf and chemical tracer cmb may give a good insight for future recharge estimation techniques for similar aquifer types wherever they are located in the world evaluating the groundwater recharge estimation mechanism for the volcanic aquifer lying at different topographical setting that represents vast major part of the world groundwater aquifers and able to suggest more appropriate methods will benefit different similar studies this study can be seen as a dual purpose evaluating the physical based hydrological model and so other similar models and giving spatial recharge rate map for the important basin in general the specific objectives of this study are 1 to determine groundwater recharge of the lake tana basin in a spatially distributed way 2 to identify controlling factors for the spatial variability of the recharge in the basin 3 to compare and evaluate the recharge estimation methods 4 to evaluate the effect of land use change over the hydrology of lake tana basin and 5 to determine the spatial and seasonal variation of runoff and evapotranspiration in the basin 2 study area location geology and hydrogeology the lake tana basin fig 1 consists of the lake tana water body which is the largest natural lake in ethiopia it is the source and head of the upper blue nile basin which is the major tributary to the nile basin the nile basin is shared by eleven riparian countries and is the lifeline for more than 238 million people living in the basin dile et al 2018 lake tana basin has a total drainage area of approximately 15 077 km2 of which the lake covers about 3077 km2 it is a shallow lake which is situated in the northwestern ethiopian highlands and receives flow from more than 40 rivers dessie et al 2015 2014 rientjes et al 2011 wale et al 2009 the lake tana basin is perched on a topographic high which is within an overall configuration of an uplifted dome that was active during the tertiary volcanic events the lake tana basin was formed by the junction of three grabens chorowicz et al 1998 it acquired its present form through damming by quaternary lava flow aged to 10 000 years on its southern part jepsen and athearn 1961 stratified tertiary volcanic rock piles in northwestern ethiopia overlie mesozoic sedimentary rock stratigraphical sequence chorowicz et al 1998 they have an average thickness of 1 1 5 km jepsen and athearn 1961 minucci 1938 and covers a significant area of the basin fig 2 quaternary basalt covers most of the southern part of the tana basin jepsen and athearn 1961 sedimentary deposits such as the pliocene chilga sediment and recent alluvio lacustrine sediments on the extensive floodplains of the northern and eastern catchments are also among major lithological coverages fig 2 the complex nature of the aquifers owing mainly to multi stage volcanism at different volcanic centers and hence the presence of different volcanic rock types with complex geometrical setting in the ethiopian volcanic plateau has led to a strong spatial groundwater potential and recharge variability alemayehu and kebede 2011 ayenew et al 2008 demlie et al 2008 2007 kebede et al 2005 the groundwater level for aquifers lying at different topography and geology in the highlands of the lake tana basin responds differently to the rainfall and has a different recharging mechanism yenehun et al 2020 3 data and methods 3 1 wetspass model for this study the wetspass model written in python wetspass m is applied the wetspass an acronym for water and energy transfer in soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state was first developed by batelaan and de smedt 2001 and later modified by batelaan and de smedt 2007 it is a numerical model to simulate long term average spatial distributions of hydrological parameters and processes at a basin scale in quasi steady state it means the model is restricted to temporal variations only at the seasonal or monthly time scale that means years of seasonal or monthly time series data are averaged into single seasons or months the model subdivides the precipitation into the runoff to refer only to surface component of the river flow in this paper evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge and estimates long term seasonal values as distributed spatial maps 1 p s et r where p is precipitation l s is runoff l et is evapotranspiration l and r is groundwater recharge l 2 s f 1 p n where f1 is a runoff factor that depends on land use and vegetation characteristics soil texture and slope pn is the net precipitation reaching the ground surface total precipitation minus interception by the plant canopy 3 et f 2 ep where f2 is an evapotranspiration factor which depends on land use and vegetation characteristics and soil texture and ep is the potential evaporation of open water l groundwater recharge is estimated as the closure term of eq 1 the wetspass m model calculates each hydrological term at pixel scale by subdividing each pixel into open water impervious surface area bare soil and vegetated area percentage values of these subdivisions of a pixel are assigned for all possible land use classes in the parameter table of the model however some percentage values have been modified based on local expert judgment in this study the model is developed at 90 m x 90 m grid resolution all the nine input parameter grid maps are resampled to the same grid size the model area is equally meshed and has 1824 columns and 2223 rows wetspass has parameter tables as an input besides the grid maps some land use parameter values and the number of rainy days are modified into local contexts based on measured data and our expert knowledge whereas the default values of soil related parameters have been kept in the model parameter table each land use type has given impervious bare land vegetation and open water percentages in the default parameter table of the wetspass model the vegetation area coverage for the bush and shrubland is 100 this is based on the observation of the land use class type in the temperate zone the netherlands and belgium batelaan and de smedt 2001 however the bush and shrubland land use type in the ethiopian tropics context is different the vegetation is sometimes sparsely distributed and is with some bare land component during the field verification on the land use type estimation on sample parcels of land on using simple areal measurement and visual observation has been made and came up with about 10 is bare land and the rest 90 is consisting of vegetation similar adjustments have been made by gebreyohannes et al 2013 during their application of the model for geba catchment in northern ethiopia similarly the sub afro alpine vegetation land use type found in our area consisting of about 0 3 of the total area coverage is not present in the default land use classes of the wetspass model however we made an equivalent with wet meadow land use type and following a similar procedure we modified the land use percentage to 80 vegetation and 20 bare land it was 100 vegetation for wet meadow land cover type in the model parameter table furthermore the root depth for forest land use is changed from 2 m to 5 5 m because eucalyptus the dominant forest tree in the area is deep rooted a similar modification was made by yenehun et al 2020 for the highland part of the gilgel abay catchment the developed wetspass model is calibrated manually by adjusting the global model parameters such as rainfall intensity soil moisture alfa coefficient α lp coefficient a calibration parameter for adjusting the potential evapotranspiration depending on the soil moisture interception parameter a and runoff delay factor x in the calibration process the goodness of fit between the simulated and measured runoff for major rivers was being checked and has been used for further model optimization the wetspass gives the surface runoff and recharge rates as an output whereas the measured stream flow is the total discharge amount including both surface runoff and baseflow due to this fact for the calibration the measured total river flow has been compared with the sum of the simulated surface runoff and groundwater recharge assuming the baseflow is equal to the recharge furthermore the point recharge values determined by the wtf method and extracted recharge of the wetspass spatial map are compared thereby validating the result for model calibration the recent land use land use 2014 fig 4c has been used after the model is calibrated to the optimal possible using this land use the model is run for land uses 1986 and 2000 fig 4a and b hence the effect of land use change on the seasonal water balance terms has been evaluated 3 1 1 data for wetspass model meteorological data consisting of rainfall temperature minimum maximum average relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed and gis spatial maps including land use soil texture elevation slope angle and groundwater level have been used for the wetspass model the meteorological data were collected from the ethiopian national meteorological agency nma bahir dar branch and simple meteorological stations measuring only rainfall and temperature which are established by the institutional university cooperation with bahir dar university iuc bdu project funded by the flemish inter university council university cooperation for development vlir uos the wetspass model uses the long term average raster grid maps of rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet mean temperature and wind speed batelaan and de smedt 2007 2001 the wetspass model calculates the water balance of an area at a relatively coarse time scale per month to the finest however for semi humid tropical regions where most of the months are dry winter applying the model at the seasonal time scale is preferable hence preparation of these data for summer and winter is done the wet summer consists of months from june to september and the dry winter from october to may gebreyohannes et al 2013 worked similarly for their application of the method at the geba catchment in northern ethiopia the long term seasonal average point rainfall amount is prepared from 50 meteorological stations distributed mainly from the basin and a few from the surroundings fig 3a 42 of the stations were from nma and the remaining 8 were those established by the iuc bdu project the daily data from those 42 stations from 2012 to 2016 were summed and averaged to mean monthly however the data availability limited to take similar period data for all stations as a matter of fact for six stations such as arb gebiya 2014 2016 aykel 2010 2015 chimba 2009 2013 dengel ber 2012 2013 enjibara 2005 2014 sekela 2012 2014 and shawura 2011 2015 different period data sets have been used the data from recently established bdu iuc sponsored stations were short term ones comprising only two years data 2017 and 2018 the reason why such different period rainfall data used for interpolation is in order to address the high spatial rainfall variation and to have more realistic rainfall raster map fig 3b actually there is inter annual rainfall temporal variations at some stations reaching up to 100 150 mm however compared to the spatial variations these temporal variations are smaller and would not bring significant change with results and conclusions of this research output the areal rainfall amount maps for both summer and winter are produced through the kriging interpolation since the number of input stations was relatively high and appropriate for this interpolation technique mean annual temperature raster maps for both the summer and winter seasons are prepared from 30 stations using the daily data from 2012 to 2016 except from nma stations arb gebiya 2014 2016 aykel 2010 2015 dengel ber 2012 2013 sekela 2012 2014 shawura 2011 2015 and rib bridge piezo 2017 2018 rib dam piezo 2017 2018 and l megech piezo 2017 2018 from bdu iuc inverse distance weighting idw method has been used as an interpolation technique similarly idw is applied for windspeed using data from only 7 meteorological stations fig 3a the temporal variation for temperature and windspeed is small but the spatial variation is significant which could be due to high elevation variation of the study area for the potential evapotranspiration the penman monteith method modified by allen et al 1998 is applied to calculate point pet values at 7 stations fig 3a the daily minimum and maximum temperature windspeed relative humidity and sunshine hours from 2012 to 2016 have been used to calculate the daily pet values however for two stations aykel 2010 2015 and shawura 2011 2015 have been considered due to unavailability of complete data for these stations during 2016 these daily values are changed into mean seasonal for the spatial interpolation idw is applied and maps for both summer and winter are produced the mean annual pet map is presented in fig 3c the groundwater depth grid map is needed in the wetspass model primarily to calculate evapotranspiration from the groundwater and for delineation of wetlands so that water balance calculations include seepage fluxes batelaan and de smedt 2007 gebreyohannes et al 2013 the groundwater level grid maps for both summer and winter seasons are prepared using time series groundwater level data collected for this study first an average depth to water table raster map by classifying the area into high middle and low elevations is prepared using our groundwater monitoring points then this raster map consisting of three different depth to water table raster values is subtracted from the dem of the area to obtain the hydraulic head raster ascii map which is the input of the wetspass model a similar method is followed for both summer and winter furthermore the wetspass model is calibrated using river flow data measured at different major rivers of the basin mean annual river discharge data measured at seven main rivers fig 1b in the years 2012 2016 have been taken and used to calibrate and validate the model the rainfall has high spatial variation with minimum and maximum mean annual of 1079 mm and 2156 mm respectively with a standard deviation of 216 mm the rainfall is generally higher in the southern and lower in the northern parts of the study basin fig 3b the lower is recorded in the flat floodplain of the northern megech catchment and highest at the southern highlands figs 1 and 3a b there is a poor correlation between rainfall and topographical elevation similar to what was reported by dessie et al 2014 the maximum and minimum potential evapotranspiration are 1633 mm and 1193 mm respectively and with a mean of 1478 mm and a standard deviation of 70 mm the higher values on the northwestern and lower towards the south and eastern highlands fig 3c there is no generally a good correlation between elevation and pet values the relatively few numbers of meteorological stations for pet interpolation is one of the limiting factors in this study gis spatial maps are taken from different sources and adapted according to the model requirement of the wetspass model the historical land use maps were prepared by the amhara design and supervision water works enterprise adswe adswe 2015a they had prepared land use maps for the years 1986 2000 and 2014 using satellite images spot and landsat and google earth as well as ground truthing each land use type coverage and change of the classification periods are presented table 1 the coding number assigned for land use types in the wetspass model is given for each class so that the model can read and related with land use parameter table code matching between the land use classes and the model parameter tables has been made the soil map of the tana basin used for the modeling is prepared by adswe adswe 2015b it was prepared through a detailed field survey sampling and analysis aided by satellite image information the soils of the basin were identified and classified based on soil genesis morphological and surface characteristics according to fao 1998 2006 soil map of the world the results of this soil resource assessment reveal that twelve major agricultural soil types are present in the study area however wetspass needs textural soil classes textural classes have been given for most of the 101 mapping units but for a few of the mapping pixels the textural class column was found blank in the attribute table of the soil map and thus we have filled it based on the association of major soil type and common texture in the other mapping units we have also used our expertize area knowledge in filling these gaps finally codes for each of the seven textural soil classes fig 5a are assigned as per in the wetspass model a digital elevation model dem with 20 m resolution is found from the global land cover facility http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp after filling the possible holes resampling to 90 m was done and the final raster map for elevation has been prepared fig 5b similarly the slope angle is extracted in arcgis 10 3 from the dem and resampled to 90 m resolution fig 5c 3 2 water table fluctuation wtf and chloride mass balance cmb methods the wtf method is among the most widely used techniques for groundwater estimation of aquifers healy and cook 2002 the method uses the following formula to calculate recharge 4 recharge sy h t where h is the head change comparing before and after the rainfall season sy is the specific yield and t is the time interval for the recharge period according to delin et al 2007 and healy and cook 2002 for the application of the wtf method the following assumptions should be satisfied 1 sharp water level rises and declines in response to only groundwater recharge and discharge 2 the aquifer system needs to be unconfined with shallow water level 3 the specific yield should be known and constant hence the monitoring well hydrographs are evaluated and only those which are more or less in line with these assumptions are considered for the point recharge calculation of this study similar to the suggestion of healy and cook 2002 the graphical method is applied to extrapolate the recession of the pre recharge water level to the recharge period so that the water level fluctuation is accurately considered the main source of uncertainty for the application of the method is the possible errors in the estimation of the specific yield healy and cook 2002 yenehun et al 2020 in this study both literature from johnson 1967 and an empirical formula developed by beretta and stevenazzi 2018 have been applied beretta and stevenazzi 2018 developed a relationship between sy and hydraulic conductivity k hence using the formula sy values for monitoring wells were determined using the k values analyzed from our single well pumping and slug test results a test on 31 hand dug wells were successfully executed and analyzed similar to wtf the chloride mass balance cmb method is a widely applied technique for estimating recharge somaratne and smettem 2014 the main concept in the method is that the increase in the concentration of chloride in the groundwater compared to the rainwater is due to evapotranspiration in the vadose zone during infiltrating percolating allison and hughes 1978 allison 1988 guan et al 2010 somaratne and smettem 2014 it means chloride anion is a conservative ion and its concentration increment during its movement in the vadose zone is merely in response to evapotranspiration mathematically groundwater recharge gwr is calculated in the following way 5 gwr pe cl p cl gw where gwr is groundwater recharge clp is chloride concentration in precipitation clgw is chloride concentration in groundwater pe is effective precipitation which is the total precipitation minus runoff amount of the period in reference to the similar study done by gebru and tesfahunegn 2019 and the hydrogeological nature of this study the applied cmb method assumes 1 the only source for chloride concentration for the groundwater in the aquifers is the chloride from the atmosphere 2 there is negligible source of extra chloride from fertilizers and pesticides in the area 3 the possible long term chloride concentration in the rainfall is not take into account the short term concentration is assumed to represent the long term 4 chloride ion is assumed geochemically inactive with soil medium there is neither sinks nor precipitation of the chloride ion 5 there is no transport of chloride ion with evapotranspiration water 6 there is no storage of chloride in the vadose zone furthermore the method is more effective in estimating diffuse recharge however inappropriate when focused recharge components recharge from discrete locations are prevalent in the area somaratne and smettem 2014 in general the geological and hydrogeological features of this study area seem to be favorable for diffuse recharge as a dominant recharging mechanism making the technique appropriate except the additional preferential recharge in fractured basaltic aquifer in this study the recharge calculation using the cmb has been made by subdividing the basin into southern eastern northern and western catchments hence the average chloride concentration in the analyzed groundwater and rainfall sampled in the specific sub area is considered these subdivisions are based on similar runoff characteristics and runoff coefficients in the four distinguished catchments dessie et al 2015 the mean annual rainfall within the respective areas and mean annual runoff coefficient estimated by dessie et al 2015 separately for the four sub areas are considered for the effective precipitation calculation 3 2 1 data for wtf and cmb methods water level data were being collected from may 2017 to june 2019 using 65 shallow hand dug and piezometer wells using community based manual daily measurement and automatic measuring sensors at every half an hour interval we trained the local people mostly the well owners and sometimes their neighbors in cases where the owners are illiterate afterward we supplied them with a measuring meter and a rope tied with a steel rod having a length of about half a meter every morning before fetching water they insert this rope tied with the steel rod into the well until it reaches some depth below the water level and then immediately get it out and measure the depth from the head of the well to the tip of the moist surface on the metal plate 52 of the monitoring wells were large diameter hand dug wells and had been measured manually using such simple equipment whereas the other 13 wells were being monitored using automatic data loggers these 13 wells were both shallow piezometers and deep wells 9 shallow piezometers and 4 shallow borehole wells the measuring time interval for the manual readings was daily and for the automatic logging it was every half an hour some of the hand dug wells are active water supplying wells where the owners fetch water for domestic and or backyard irrigation purposes these monitoring wells are well distributed over the studied basin and representing the various geological and topographical settings the depth of these shallow wells range from 5 m to 25 m the seasonal recharge values calculated for 2017 2018 and some for 2019 are averaged out many rises and declines within the overall recharging season are not considered only the seasonal highest rise and extrapolated antecedent decline during the highest rise using the graphical technique has been taken into account as a result the calculated recharge is the total recharge that joined the groundwater the specific yield was values estimated both by using johnson 1967 and beretta and stevenazzi 2018 are highly variable depending on primarily geology and degree of weathering hydrogeologically the shallow monitoring wells are placed on four hydrogeological units weathered basaltic regolith pyroclastic rocks fractured quaternary basalt with intermediate weathering grade and alluvio lacustrine formations the quaternary basalt was found with the highest sy value ranging from 0 08 to 0 1 while for the pyroclastic and alluvio lacustrine deposits values as low as 0 02 and as high as 0 074 were found the weathered basaltic regolith has a specific yield ranging from 0 04 to 0 08 water sampling for chemical analysis of the groundwater had been undertaken from 2016 to 2019 water samples for chemical analysis were collected in clean polyethene bottles and the bottles were rinsed three times with the sample water before being filled the rainwater samples were collected at raised heights 1 6 2 m above the ground to prevent contamination of samples from ground dust to prevent sample water evaporation the collectors had been closed immediately after the rain event had finished then the rainwater samples were taken from these collectors to polyethylene container bottles and treated like the groundwater samples the groundwater sampling sites were distributed throughout the study area representing the different aquifer types and topographical settings considering geology and topography well distributed samples from fractured basalt pyroclastic material basalt regolith and alluvio lacustrine shallow aquifers have been collected and analyzed similarly rainfall samples had been collected in similar periods at the lower middle and upper topography of the basin so that possible topographical influences on the rainfall water chemistry are taken into consideration in total about 255 groundwater samples and 25 rainfall samples have been collected and analyzed at ghent university department of geology laboratory of applied geology and hydrogeology however among the 255 samples 138 are on shallow groundwater where the chemistry is not much evolved due to long rock water interaction and those which are pollution free are selected for the calculation these 255 samples are those sampled and analyzed for the hydrochemical characterization of the basin groundwater in other words it includes those sampled from the deep wells deep groundwater which is expected to have undergone significant geochemical evolution and supposed to many years of water mixing which is with quite different time with the sampled rainfall water as a result those sampled from the deep wells were excluded from the cmb calculation in addition the possibility of chloride ion increment due to pollution has been taken into acount few samples from the shallow groundwater with relatively higher chloride concentration and are inline correlated with the concentration of nitrate and or sulfate ions are also omitted from use in the calculation as they might consist of some pollution finally it is only 138 groundwater samples fig 7 that are from shallow groundwater and with insignificant pollution additives are considered in the estimation of the recharge the number of groundwater samples for each sub area and the concentration of chloride range and mean values are shown in table 2 the number of samples for northern and western catchments is small compared to the eastern and southern the mean concentration values for the formers are a bit higher than the latter ones table 2 4 result and discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variation of groundwater recharge and other water balance components the annual groundwater recharge calculates over the period 2012 2016 using the calibrated wetspass model ranges from 0 mm to 1085 mm fig 8a and has a mean value of 315 mm 22 of rainfall amount recharge is assumed 0 mm at water bodies and wetlands in the wetspass model hence recharge is 0 mm at lake tana and a dam reservoir in the gilgel abay catchment and wetlands in the lower reaches of rib river catchment figs 4c and 8a no recharge at water body is the general assumption of the wetspass model fortunately this assumption is in line with previous studies e g kebede et al 2006 mamo 2015 smec 2008 which had concluded that there is insignificant percolation beneath the lake floor higher recharge is estimated on the southern gilgel abay and eastern gumara river catchments figs 1b and 7a and lower on the northern part of the lake tana basin this is mainly due to the lower rainfall amount in the northern catchments compared to southern catchments figs 3b and 8a apart from the rainfall the spatial distribution of the recharge seems highly controlled by the slope angle followed by the soil type and the land use type forest land covering only 1 8 has high recharge mean annual of 542 mm cultivated land and water body consisting of about 49 and 21 of the total areal coverage have annual mean recharge values of 370 mm and 0 mm respectively dominating over the total average value clay soil type covering about 77 of the total basin area has a mean annual value of about 276 mm the lowest amount estimated compared to all other soil types the major recharge is taking place during the summer season while only a small amount recharges during the winter about 237 mm is recharged in the summer and 78 mm in the winter seasons the mean annual recharge is about 22 of the total mean basin precipitation the mean annual runoff for the whole basin is about 416 mm accounting for about 29 of the average precipitation about 92 of the runoff is taking place during the summer season while the remaining is taking place during the long winter season relatively higher runoff is observed in the southern and eastern basins and lower runoff has been noted in the northern and northeastern rib river catchments fig 8c this is in line with the study by dessie et al 2015 in some areas e g in northern and northeastern low runoff values has been observed on the cultivated land and clay soil types where a high runoff coefficient is expected figs 4c 5a and 8c this is due to the relatively low rainfall amount on these parts of the lake tana basin fig 3b this shows that compared to the rainfall the soil type and the land use have less influence over the runoff the rainfall amount is highly controlling the spatial distribution of runoff figs 3b and 8c the zonal statistics for the land use and soil classes types show a high variation of runoff over the single class types for example for clay soil with cultivated land cover type the runoff ranges from 212 mm to 1216 mm 15 84 of mean rainfall and with an average of 485 mm accounting for about 34 of the rainfall this variation is found mainly due to the variation in the rainfall amount which is varying from 1097 mm to 2155 mm for the aftermentioned soil and land use class combination however it does not mean that the other runoff controlling variables such as the slope are not playing a significant role for such variations the evapotranspiration of the lake tana basin is mainly the sum of the direct evaporation from the lake and wetland and evapotranspiration over the other land cover types the mean evaporation over the lake is about 1485 mm in the wetspass model the penman method is used to estimate the open water evaporation batelaan et al 2007 the average total evapotranspiration over the basin is 770 mm which is 53 of the mean basin precipitation about 56 of total evapotranspiration is happening during summer and the other 44 occurs during winter the mean evapotranspiration of the basin is about 52 of the mean potential evapotranspiration the spatial distribution of the evapotranspiration over the basin is highly controlled by the rainfall and the land cover types relative to the other physical and meteorological variables figs 3b 4c and 8b it is higher over the lake and wetlands because it is open water where there is no limitation of water availability and evaporation is equal to the potential evaporation capability of the air the variation over the lake fig 8b is due to the variation of the potential evaporation fig 3b and c next to the water body and wetlands grassland forest bush and shrubland cover types have high evapotranspiration values the direct lake water evaporation is compared with other studies estimated by different methods table 3 the result is very close to that of kebede et al 2006 and chebud and melesse 2009 which both used the similar penman method table 3 however it is lower than the value estimated by dessie et al 2015 which used recent data from six stations this could be due to the application of different period data from 2012 to 2013 while it is from 2012 2016 in this study or the time scale applied seasonal versus daily for the calculation or it might be due to the method they used table 3 time scale affects evaporation calculations which are higher for fine time scales e g daily and relatively lower for coarser time scales e g seasonal or monthly bakundukize et al 2011 yenehun et al 2020 4 1 1 model verification the developed model is verified using two ways first the mean annual total river discharge using the daily time scale data of river discharge of 2012 2016 at seven major rivers is compared with the corresponding wetspass model results fig 9 part of these data annual mean of 2012 2013 have been used for the calibration of the model the river discharge amount for these major perennial rivers is the total flow amount comprising both surface and baseflow however the wetspass model calculates the runoff only the surface runoff but not the total discharge hence to estimate the total river flow at the catchment outlets of each river we applied a similar technique that gebreyohannes et al 2013 had followed based on groundwater balance in the aquifers the long term average annual groundwater drainage and possible abstractions are equal to the long term average annual recharge given the river gauging stations are usually at the groundwater discharge zones on the floodplain the flow measurements are assumed to catch the baseflow component except for a very small amount that may pass through deep percolations besides the groundwater abstractions using different shallow and deep wells can be assumed small compared to natural drainage and recharge as there is no large development of the groundwater in the basin using arcgis 10 3 tools both annual runoff and groundwater recharge outputs of the wetspass model are accumulated at the river outlets finally the accumulated raster maps of runoff and recharge for each major catchment are summed up to produce the spatial total river discharge map the total river discharges estimated in this study and those observed in the measurements 2012 2016 are compared fig 9 the overall coefficient of determination r2 between the simulated and the observed river discharge values of the different rivers is about 80 however for rib dirma and megech river catchments the simulation by wetspass is higher compared to the observation fig 9 this could be due to significant deep percolation of the groundwater that is not caught by the river flow measurements i e the baseflow is far less than the groundwater recharge the model is best simulated for gilgel abay gumara gelda and gibara rivers fig 9 the reason for these can be associated to the hydrogeological nature of the catchments for gumara and gilgel abay this could be due to the capturing of the baseflow in the flow measurements as most of the groundwater discharges through different springs in the lower reach of the rivers similarly smec 2008 and later dessie et al 2015 2014 came up with the conclusion that there is significant groundwater contribution for gilgel abay and gumara rivers flow while only little for megech and rib furthermore setegn et al 2008 had estimated the groundwater as baseflow contribution of the whole basin to be 50 of the total river inflow to the lake a similar geological nature also appears for gelda river the highly fractured quaternary basalt that might cause a relatively high baseflow that the river measuring station could have captured however the geological nature of gibara river is different the reason why there is good correlation between observed river discharge and sum of simulated recharge and surface runoff might be due to limited deep percolations that could pass underground at the river measuring station with only shallow aquifers that are recharged and discharge immediately to the nearby small stream tributaries in general it should be noted that the wetspass model applied is quasi steady state and uses long term average seasonal rainfall whereas in reality the rainfall characteristics intensity frequency and duration vary within fine time scales this is limiting the effectiveness of the model in simulating runoff the second way that the developed wetspass model verification made is through its performance in estimating groundwater recharge the point recharge estimated using the wtf method has been used to compare the model performance at those points the extracted recharge values of the model were correlated against the wtf results calculated at 65 monitoring stations fig 10a the overall correlation was fair with a coefficient of determination r2 35 however yenehun et al 2020 evaluated the performance of the wetspass model in estimating recharge at a small catchment in the upper gilgel abay river catchment and found that the technique is less effective at storage controlled flat floodplain areas and at aquifers where focused recharge through rock fractures is an important recharging mechanism therefore we excluded wtf results estimated at aquifers on those topographies and then the correlation coefficient r2 is found to be 84 fig 10c when only two wells located at storage controlled floodplain aquifer named dtw2 and at exceptionally highly fractured aquifer called sarwuha w1 fig 6 are excluded the r2 raised to 71 fig 10b hence the wetspass method is found effective in estimating the groundwater recharge in most parts of the study basin however at the flat floodplain alluvial aquifer and fractured rock aquifers where the hard rock is exposed to the surface water balance techniques such as the wetspass are found less effective the interannual variations of the rainfall and evapotranspiration though small compared to spatial variation as mentioned earlier would have its own impact in comparing the results by the wetspass and wtf methods the wtf is estimated using recently measured water level data while the wetspass includes earlier period meteorological data 4 2 effect of land use change on groundwater recharge and other water balance components the effect of land use change on groundwater recharge runoff and evapotranspiration has been assessed in this study this assessment has been made using the same long term average meteorological data that have been used in the wetspass model and hence possible variation due to temporal increasing or decreasing of the meteorological variables have not been taken into consideration the value of water balance terms changes with land use changes there is a decrease in recharge by 13 mm or 195 9 106 m3 in the years 1986 2014 table 4 in the lake tana basin this is about 4 of the mean annual recharge estimated with the applied wetspass model this is inline with the increase of cultivated land area from 36 7 to 49 mainly from grass bush and shrub and forest lands similarly there is an increase of runoff but it is only by 4 mm or 60 3 106 m3 in the 28 years about 1 of the total mean runoff similarly the evapotranspiration shows an increment by 9 mm or 135 6 106 m3 in these 28 years about 1 2 of the total mean annual aet the trend is in line with the studies by abate et al 2017 enku et al 2014 gebremicael et al 2013 hurni et al 2005 tesemma et al 2010 and woldesenbet et al 2017 which showed the shifting of the river discharge more to overland flow mechanism in the last four to five decades in the upper blue nile basin however the rate of hydrological change found in this study is relatively small compared to the rate of land use change this reinforces the idea that the land use is not the primary important controlling factor compared to rainfall amount discussed above in detail similarly birhanu et al 2019 found a negligible change of the water balance components for gumara catchment for the land use change of 1986 2015 using hbv model gashaw et al 2018 had also evaluated the effect of changing land use on the hydrology of andassa catchment neighboring small catchment south of lake tana basin over the same period 1986 2015 using swat model compared to this study they found a similar amount of reduction in baseflow supposed to be equivalent to groundwater recharge but a bit more runoff increment 4 3 groundwater recharge estimation using wtf and cmb methods the mean annual groundwater recharge using the wtf ranges from 125 mm to 778 mm accounting for about 9 54 of the mean basin rainfall in general the southern and eastern gumara river catchment part of the lake tana basin has higher recharge than the northern part fig 11 this is also similar to the result of the wetspass model fig 8a it has an overall basin average of 369 mm 26 of the rainfall which is a bit higher than the mean average estimated by the wetspass model 22 this could be due to the ability of the wtf method to capture the focused recharge through rock fractures and or lateral groundwater flow besides the diffuse recharge from the direct precipitation that yenehun et al 2020 had thoroughly discussed the spatial variation of recharge depends on topography and geology in steep sloping topography aquifers where low recharge is expected higher recharge values by wtf compared to wetspass is estimated figs 5c and 11 this is due to the additional recharge from the upstream area by lateral groundwater flow in addition to the diffuse recharge from the direct rainfall furthermore on the flat floodplain areas the recharge estimated by the wtf is small this is due to the limitation of the aquifer storage it means the aquifer is more or less fully recharged in the early to middle of the recharge period usually end of july to mid august but the model keeps on adding the recharge as there is unlimited aquifer storage in general the wetspass method is less effective in the fractured aquifers where focused recharge is the important recharging mechanism and on flat floodplain alluvio lacustrine aquifer areas where storage limits further recharge in addition it performs less in steeply sloping aquifers where fast groundwater flow accumulates additional recharge through lateral groundwater flow in general the values estimated by wetspass is over estimated in the storage controlled floodplain aquifer as it assumes infinite aquifer storage hence using physical hydrological models like wetspass models for similar aquifers is not recommended rather methods like wtf and cmb are the best alternatives similarly on fractured aquifers where major recharge is happening through open fractures preferential recharge wetspass underestimates recharge while wtf which is based on the real water level measurement estimates best similar to wetspass and wtf methods the recharge calculation using the cmb method shows strong spatial variability the groundwater recharge in the southern and eastern catchments is higher than in the northern and western catchments the mean annual recharge by the cmb method is about 346 mm 24 of the rainfall the spatial distribution is more or less similar to the spatial distribution map simulated by wetspass fig 8a and the point recharge distribution of the wtf method fig 11 the mean annual groundwater recharge values using the cmb method ranges from 164 mm to 404 mm the relatively smaller range for cmb is due to the consideration of average values in the four distinguished zones rather than at 138 groundwater sampling points otherwise the range of values would have been higher given the wider range of chloride values 0 3 12 5 mg l of the groundwater samples table 2 the heterogeneity in recharge processes and recharge rates over the basin is well notified by the higher range of values by the wetspass and wtf methods generally recharge in the eastern and southern catchments is higher than in the northern catchments table 5 primarily due to higher rainfall and favorable geology highly fractured quaternary basalt fig 2 the recharge by the cmb in the northern and somewhat in the western part is much smaller compared to the values by the other two methods table 5 this could be due to some recharge from the river water which elevates the chloride concentration of the groundwater which hence decreases the recharge value according to eq 5 the chloride concentration in the river water is higher due to exposure to open water evaporation before infiltration and percolation to the groundwater zone significant amount of groundwater recahrge by river water is observed in the megech catchment the main river catchment of northern area from about 356 51 106 m3 total mean annual river discharge recorded at the upper river measuring at the foothill of the catchment station in period 2012 2016 about 107 91 106 m3 is lost or not recorded by the downstream measuring station this water amount might mainly be recharge the groundwater in the flood aquifers this supports the above hypothesis of river water recharges groundwater in this part of the lake tana basin besides it might be also due to the small number of samples that results much uncertainities and as well as lack of time series chloride data contray to its need this aspect is throughly discussed by aishlin and mcnamara 2011 in general aishlin and mcnamara 2011 noted the necessity of more years of chloride measurement so as to decrease the effect of stored chloride in the vadose zone in the pre recharge period however our groundwater samples are only one time and such an effect might be included in the observed cmb results tekleab et al 2014 using stable isotope concluded that the rainfall source is different for the region where this study area is located i e both from freshwater and seawater the atlantic indian ocean congo basin upper white nile and the sudd swamps are the potential moisture sources during the main rainy summer season while the indian arabian and mediterranean sea moisture are during little rain spring and dry winter seasons this shows the chloride concentration of the rainwater is temporally highly variable in this study our rainwater sampling was not so frequent to address such possible variations however we have looked strong variations of chloride concentration higher during may june and low during the high rainy season july august this might have its own effect on the calculated recharge values and for the disparity with other methods for northern and western catchments table 5 5 conclusion the physically based water balance model wetspass has effectively been applied to simulate the water balance components of lake tana basin containing the largest lake of ethiopia the model simulates the mean annual major river inflows with a coefficient of determination r2 of 80 the model better simulated flows for some of catchments than for the other catchments where deep percolation might conceal the base flow from measurement by the gauging stations on the other hand the wetspass model applied is a quasi steady state that used long term average seasonal rainfall amounts though the rainfall characteristics vary within fine time scales this might limit the effectiveness of the model in simulating runoff amounts the annual groundwater recharge using wetspass ranges from 0 of rainfall at the water bodies where infiltration is impossible to 57 in the flat silty loam and bushland cover type it has a mean annual value of 315 mm 22 of the precipitation amount of which 237 mm is recharged in summer and the other 78 mm in the winter season similarly the wtf and cmb methods have also shown strong spatial variability with higher recharge values in the southern and eastern catchments and lower in the northern and partly in the western parts primarily due to rainfall distribution and geology there is good correlation between point recharge values by the wtf and extracted recharge from the wetspass spatial maps however there is a high disparity on wells located on the storage controlled flat floodplains and focused recharge affected fractured rock aquifers hence though water balance models estimate recharge at fine spatial scales that help for water management in specific areas its capacity is limited for aquifers where only diffuse recharge is the main recharging mechanism and for those aquifers that are not fully saturated early in the recharge period the mean annual runoff for the whole basin is about 416 mm 29 of the average precipitation and evapotranspiration is about 770 mm which is 53 of the mean basin precipitation the precipitation amount is highly controlling the spatial distribution of the runoff more than the land use and soil the mean evaporation over the lake is about 1485 mm the spatial distribution of the evapotranspiration over the basin is highly controlled by the rainfall and the land cover types the hydrology of the basin has not much changed in the last three decades though cultivated land has expanded significantly many hydrological models for different areas small catchment scale to large basins are developed and used for estimating groundwater recharge and other water balance components however evaluation of the methods with point estimations based on direct water level measurement wtf and chemical tracer cmb gives a good insight for future recharge estimation techniques for similar aquifer types wherever they are located in the world in this study identifying topographical and geological characteristics and thus the appropriate recharge mechanisms have found an important factor and starting point in selecting recharge estimation methods the study also pointed out that the common approach that is being implemented i e calculating recharge by a multitude of methods and averaging out the results of the different methods is found unreliable rather selecting an appropriate one or few technique s and considering that as the optimal result is recommended credit authorship contribution statement alemu yenehun conceptualization investigation formal analysis writing original draft mekete desssie project administration

7906,study region this study is performed for the volcanic aquifers of semi humid lake tana basin in northwest ethiopia the source region of blue nile basin study focus estimating groundwater recharge at required spatial and temporal scale is a challenge in groundwater management sustainability and pollution studies in this study the physically based wetspass model is applied the recharge by wetspass is validated with estimations by water table fluctuation wtf and chloride mass balance cmb methods evaluating the groundwater recharge estimation mechanism for the volcanic aquifers lying at different topographical setting that represents wide part of the world groundwater aquifers and suggesting more appropriate methods will benefit different similar studies new hydrological insights for the region the mean annual rainfall recharge surface runoff and evapotranspiration are estimated at 1431 mm 315 mm 416 mm and 770 mm respectively the recharge varies from 0 to 57 of the rainfall a high variation is also noted using wtf and cmb methods showing the strong heterogeneous nature of the hydro meteoro logical characteristics of the area wetspass is effective in aquifers where diffuse recharging mechanism is the predominant type and recharge is controlled by rainfall hence it is found less effective in the storage controlled flat floodplain alluvial and fractured rock aquifer areas in these areas the point estimates by the wtf and cmb are effective and can be considered as reliable values graphical abstract ga1 keywords lake tana basin recharge wetspass wtf cmb storage controlled diffuse recharge 1 introduction groundwater recharge is all water that reaches the groundwater aquifer from any direction scanlon et al 2002 in specific terms it is defined as the height of the water column that enters the saturated zone after crossing the vadose zone in a specific period manna et al 2016 understanding recharge processes and its quantification is vital for sustainable management and protection of the groundwater resources ferede et al 2020 healy and cook 2002 uugulu and wanke 2020 however it is one of the most difficult water budget components to be evaluated with acceptable accuracy hornero et al 2016 this is particularly true in areas with wide heterogeneity of geological topographical and hydro climatic conditions thus groundwater managers should take recharge estimations and their uncertainty into account in the management plans hornero et al 2016 as recharge processes significantly vary from area to area there is no guarantee that one method effectively apply for one locality gives reasonable results for another obuobie et al 2012 different methods are developed for recharge estimation however choosing appropriate methods is often challenging important considerations in choosing a technique include space time scales range and reliability of recharge estimates which in turn depend on the goal of the study scanlon et al 2002 for instance groundwater resources assessment of an area may be achieved at a small space time scale but flow and contaminant modeling need quantification of recharge amounts at large spatial as well as temporal scales there is a strong groundwater recharge variability across the ethiopian volcanic rock aquifers alemayehu and kebede 2011 ayenew et al 2008 demlie et al 2008 2007 kebede et al 2005 lake tana basin which is one of the major basins in the ethiopian volcanic plateau has high hydrogeological and topographical variabilities furthermore the area has a climate with long dry winters and short rainy summer seasons hence the groundwater recharge discharge processes are expected to vary highly both spatially and temporally there are a number of recharge estimation methods their effectiveness depend on the recharge mechanism healy and cook 2002 hence understanding and identifying the recharging mechanism of aquifers and the assumptions of different estimations methods is a key to effectively choose among the different techniques scanlon et al 2002 tilahun et al 2009 on fractured aquifers where preferential flow dominates focused recharge is a major recharge mechanism rather than the diffuse recharge water balance models estimate better the diffuse recharge zhu et al 2020 while water point measuring based methods such as water table fluctuation are preferable for focused recharge mechanisms scanlon et al 2002 one of the challenges for the point recharge estimation methods is their incapability to estimate it in a spatially distributed way given the high spatial variability of recharge due to variations in geology topography soil texture land use and meteorological variables it is unwise to extrapolate or regionalize the result by the conventional point recharge estimation techniques tilahun and merkel 2009 in this study a physically based water balance model called wetspass which simulates recharge in a spatially and temporally distributed manner is applied water table fluctuation and chloride mass balance methods have been used to identify the recharge mechanisms to compare and cross validate the result by the wetspass model these methods have been applied in several studies the wetspass model for example in batelaan and de smedt 2007 for dijle demer and nete river catchements in northeast belgium gebreyohannes et al 2013 for geba river basin northern ethiopia graf and przybyłek 2018 for obra river basin poland salem et al 2019 for drava basin hungary ashaolu 2020 for osun river basin nigeria yenehun et al 2020 for upper kliti river basin northwest ethiopia the wtf method have been also applied in several studies for example by sophocleous 1991 for the plain aquifers of central kansas plains usa healy and cook 2002 tested for different alluvial and fracture aquifers of the world moon et al 2004 for aquifers of south korea crosbie et al 2005 for the tomago sand beds near newcastle australia marechal et al 2006 for a small watershed in hyderabad india mikunthan and de silva 2009 for the limeston aquifer of jaffna district nigate et al 2020 for infranz catchment northwest ethiopia similarly the cmb method has also been used for example by allison and hughes 1978 for unconfined aquifer of gambier plain of gambier islands allison 1988 for semi arid areas groundwater aquifers guan et al 2010 in the mount lofty ranges a coastal hilly area in south australia somaratne and smettem 2014 for karst aquifers in southern australia uugulu and wanke 2020 for different rainfall gradients of tsumeb waterberg and kuzikus regions of nambia many hydrological models for different areas small catchment scale to large basins are developed for estimating groundwater recharge however evaluation of the methods with point estimations based on direct water level measurement wtf and chemical tracer cmb may give a good insight for future recharge estimation techniques for similar aquifer types wherever they are located in the world evaluating the groundwater recharge estimation mechanism for the volcanic aquifer lying at different topographical setting that represents vast major part of the world groundwater aquifers and able to suggest more appropriate methods will benefit different similar studies this study can be seen as a dual purpose evaluating the physical based hydrological model and so other similar models and giving spatial recharge rate map for the important basin in general the specific objectives of this study are 1 to determine groundwater recharge of the lake tana basin in a spatially distributed way 2 to identify controlling factors for the spatial variability of the recharge in the basin 3 to compare and evaluate the recharge estimation methods 4 to evaluate the effect of land use change over the hydrology of lake tana basin and 5 to determine the spatial and seasonal variation of runoff and evapotranspiration in the basin 2 study area location geology and hydrogeology the lake tana basin fig 1 consists of the lake tana water body which is the largest natural lake in ethiopia it is the source and head of the upper blue nile basin which is the major tributary to the nile basin the nile basin is shared by eleven riparian countries and is the lifeline for more than 238 million people living in the basin dile et al 2018 lake tana basin has a total drainage area of approximately 15 077 km2 of which the lake covers about 3077 km2 it is a shallow lake which is situated in the northwestern ethiopian highlands and receives flow from more than 40 rivers dessie et al 2015 2014 rientjes et al 2011 wale et al 2009 the lake tana basin is perched on a topographic high which is within an overall configuration of an uplifted dome that was active during the tertiary volcanic events the lake tana basin was formed by the junction of three grabens chorowicz et al 1998 it acquired its present form through damming by quaternary lava flow aged to 10 000 years on its southern part jepsen and athearn 1961 stratified tertiary volcanic rock piles in northwestern ethiopia overlie mesozoic sedimentary rock stratigraphical sequence chorowicz et al 1998 they have an average thickness of 1 1 5 km jepsen and athearn 1961 minucci 1938 and covers a significant area of the basin fig 2 quaternary basalt covers most of the southern part of the tana basin jepsen and athearn 1961 sedimentary deposits such as the pliocene chilga sediment and recent alluvio lacustrine sediments on the extensive floodplains of the northern and eastern catchments are also among major lithological coverages fig 2 the complex nature of the aquifers owing mainly to multi stage volcanism at different volcanic centers and hence the presence of different volcanic rock types with complex geometrical setting in the ethiopian volcanic plateau has led to a strong spatial groundwater potential and recharge variability alemayehu and kebede 2011 ayenew et al 2008 demlie et al 2008 2007 kebede et al 2005 the groundwater level for aquifers lying at different topography and geology in the highlands of the lake tana basin responds differently to the rainfall and has a different recharging mechanism yenehun et al 2020 3 data and methods 3 1 wetspass model for this study the wetspass model written in python wetspass m is applied the wetspass an acronym for water and energy transfer in soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state was first developed by batelaan and de smedt 2001 and later modified by batelaan and de smedt 2007 it is a numerical model to simulate long term average spatial distributions of hydrological parameters and processes at a basin scale in quasi steady state it means the model is restricted to temporal variations only at the seasonal or monthly time scale that means years of seasonal or monthly time series data are averaged into single seasons or months the model subdivides the precipitation into the runoff to refer only to surface component of the river flow in this paper evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge and estimates long term seasonal values as distributed spatial maps 1 p s et r where p is precipitation l s is runoff l et is evapotranspiration l and r is groundwater recharge l 2 s f 1 p n where f1 is a runoff factor that depends on land use and vegetation characteristics soil texture and slope pn is the net precipitation reaching the ground surface total precipitation minus interception by the plant canopy 3 et f 2 ep where f2 is an evapotranspiration factor which depends on land use and vegetation characteristics and soil texture and ep is the potential evaporation of open water l groundwater recharge is estimated as the closure term of eq 1 the wetspass m model calculates each hydrological term at pixel scale by subdividing each pixel into open water impervious surface area bare soil and vegetated area percentage values of these subdivisions of a pixel are assigned for all possible land use classes in the parameter table of the model however some percentage values have been modified based on local expert judgment in this study the model is developed at 90 m x 90 m grid resolution all the nine input parameter grid maps are resampled to the same grid size the model area is equally meshed and has 1824 columns and 2223 rows wetspass has parameter tables as an input besides the grid maps some land use parameter values and the number of rainy days are modified into local contexts based on measured data and our expert knowledge whereas the default values of soil related parameters have been kept in the model parameter table each land use type has given impervious bare land vegetation and open water percentages in the default parameter table of the wetspass model the vegetation area coverage for the bush and shrubland is 100 this is based on the observation of the land use class type in the temperate zone the netherlands and belgium batelaan and de smedt 2001 however the bush and shrubland land use type in the ethiopian tropics context is different the vegetation is sometimes sparsely distributed and is with some bare land component during the field verification on the land use type estimation on sample parcels of land on using simple areal measurement and visual observation has been made and came up with about 10 is bare land and the rest 90 is consisting of vegetation similar adjustments have been made by gebreyohannes et al 2013 during their application of the model for geba catchment in northern ethiopia similarly the sub afro alpine vegetation land use type found in our area consisting of about 0 3 of the total area coverage is not present in the default land use classes of the wetspass model however we made an equivalent with wet meadow land use type and following a similar procedure we modified the land use percentage to 80 vegetation and 20 bare land it was 100 vegetation for wet meadow land cover type in the model parameter table furthermore the root depth for forest land use is changed from 2 m to 5 5 m because eucalyptus the dominant forest tree in the area is deep rooted a similar modification was made by yenehun et al 2020 for the highland part of the gilgel abay catchment the developed wetspass model is calibrated manually by adjusting the global model parameters such as rainfall intensity soil moisture alfa coefficient α lp coefficient a calibration parameter for adjusting the potential evapotranspiration depending on the soil moisture interception parameter a and runoff delay factor x in the calibration process the goodness of fit between the simulated and measured runoff for major rivers was being checked and has been used for further model optimization the wetspass gives the surface runoff and recharge rates as an output whereas the measured stream flow is the total discharge amount including both surface runoff and baseflow due to this fact for the calibration the measured total river flow has been compared with the sum of the simulated surface runoff and groundwater recharge assuming the baseflow is equal to the recharge furthermore the point recharge values determined by the wtf method and extracted recharge of the wetspass spatial map are compared thereby validating the result for model calibration the recent land use land use 2014 fig 4c has been used after the model is calibrated to the optimal possible using this land use the model is run for land uses 1986 and 2000 fig 4a and b hence the effect of land use change on the seasonal water balance terms has been evaluated 3 1 1 data for wetspass model meteorological data consisting of rainfall temperature minimum maximum average relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed and gis spatial maps including land use soil texture elevation slope angle and groundwater level have been used for the wetspass model the meteorological data were collected from the ethiopian national meteorological agency nma bahir dar branch and simple meteorological stations measuring only rainfall and temperature which are established by the institutional university cooperation with bahir dar university iuc bdu project funded by the flemish inter university council university cooperation for development vlir uos the wetspass model uses the long term average raster grid maps of rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet mean temperature and wind speed batelaan and de smedt 2007 2001 the wetspass model calculates the water balance of an area at a relatively coarse time scale per month to the finest however for semi humid tropical regions where most of the months are dry winter applying the model at the seasonal time scale is preferable hence preparation of these data for summer and winter is done the wet summer consists of months from june to september and the dry winter from october to may gebreyohannes et al 2013 worked similarly for their application of the method at the geba catchment in northern ethiopia the long term seasonal average point rainfall amount is prepared from 50 meteorological stations distributed mainly from the basin and a few from the surroundings fig 3a 42 of the stations were from nma and the remaining 8 were those established by the iuc bdu project the daily data from those 42 stations from 2012 to 2016 were summed and averaged to mean monthly however the data availability limited to take similar period data for all stations as a matter of fact for six stations such as arb gebiya 2014 2016 aykel 2010 2015 chimba 2009 2013 dengel ber 2012 2013 enjibara 2005 2014 sekela 2012 2014 and shawura 2011 2015 different period data sets have been used the data from recently established bdu iuc sponsored stations were short term ones comprising only two years data 2017 and 2018 the reason why such different period rainfall data used for interpolation is in order to address the high spatial rainfall variation and to have more realistic rainfall raster map fig 3b actually there is inter annual rainfall temporal variations at some stations reaching up to 100 150 mm however compared to the spatial variations these temporal variations are smaller and would not bring significant change with results and conclusions of this research output the areal rainfall amount maps for both summer and winter are produced through the kriging interpolation since the number of input stations was relatively high and appropriate for this interpolation technique mean annual temperature raster maps for both the summer and winter seasons are prepared from 30 stations using the daily data from 2012 to 2016 except from nma stations arb gebiya 2014 2016 aykel 2010 2015 dengel ber 2012 2013 sekela 2012 2014 shawura 2011 2015 and rib bridge piezo 2017 2018 rib dam piezo 2017 2018 and l megech piezo 2017 2018 from bdu iuc inverse distance weighting idw method has been used as an interpolation technique similarly idw is applied for windspeed using data from only 7 meteorological stations fig 3a the temporal variation for temperature and windspeed is small but the spatial variation is significant which could be due to high elevation variation of the study area for the potential evapotranspiration the penman monteith method modified by allen et al 1998 is applied to calculate point pet values at 7 stations fig 3a the daily minimum and maximum temperature windspeed relative humidity and sunshine hours from 2012 to 2016 have been used to calculate the daily pet values however for two stations aykel 2010 2015 and shawura 2011 2015 have been considered due to unavailability of complete data for these stations during 2016 these daily values are changed into mean seasonal for the spatial interpolation idw is applied and maps for both summer and winter are produced the mean annual pet map is presented in fig 3c the groundwater depth grid map is needed in the wetspass model primarily to calculate evapotranspiration from the groundwater and for delineation of wetlands so that water balance calculations include seepage fluxes batelaan and de smedt 2007 gebreyohannes et al 2013 the groundwater level grid maps for both summer and winter seasons are prepared using time series groundwater level data collected for this study first an average depth to water table raster map by classifying the area into high middle and low elevations is prepared using our groundwater monitoring points then this raster map consisting of three different depth to water table raster values is subtracted from the dem of the area to obtain the hydraulic head raster ascii map which is the input of the wetspass model a similar method is followed for both summer and winter furthermore the wetspass model is calibrated using river flow data measured at different major rivers of the basin mean annual river discharge data measured at seven main rivers fig 1b in the years 2012 2016 have been taken and used to calibrate and validate the model the rainfall has high spatial variation with minimum and maximum mean annual of 1079 mm and 2156 mm respectively with a standard deviation of 216 mm the rainfall is generally higher in the southern and lower in the northern parts of the study basin fig 3b the lower is recorded in the flat floodplain of the northern megech catchment and highest at the southern highlands figs 1 and 3a b there is a poor correlation between rainfall and topographical elevation similar to what was reported by dessie et al 2014 the maximum and minimum potential evapotranspiration are 1633 mm and 1193 mm respectively and with a mean of 1478 mm and a standard deviation of 70 mm the higher values on the northwestern and lower towards the south and eastern highlands fig 3c there is no generally a good correlation between elevation and pet values the relatively few numbers of meteorological stations for pet interpolation is one of the limiting factors in this study gis spatial maps are taken from different sources and adapted according to the model requirement of the wetspass model the historical land use maps were prepared by the amhara design and supervision water works enterprise adswe adswe 2015a they had prepared land use maps for the years 1986 2000 and 2014 using satellite images spot and landsat and google earth as well as ground truthing each land use type coverage and change of the classification periods are presented table 1 the coding number assigned for land use types in the wetspass model is given for each class so that the model can read and related with land use parameter table code matching between the land use classes and the model parameter tables has been made the soil map of the tana basin used for the modeling is prepared by adswe adswe 2015b it was prepared through a detailed field survey sampling and analysis aided by satellite image information the soils of the basin were identified and classified based on soil genesis morphological and surface characteristics according to fao 1998 2006 soil map of the world the results of this soil resource assessment reveal that twelve major agricultural soil types are present in the study area however wetspass needs textural soil classes textural classes have been given for most of the 101 mapping units but for a few of the mapping pixels the textural class column was found blank in the attribute table of the soil map and thus we have filled it based on the association of major soil type and common texture in the other mapping units we have also used our expertize area knowledge in filling these gaps finally codes for each of the seven textural soil classes fig 5a are assigned as per in the wetspass model a digital elevation model dem with 20 m resolution is found from the global land cover facility http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp after filling the possible holes resampling to 90 m was done and the final raster map for elevation has been prepared fig 5b similarly the slope angle is extracted in arcgis 10 3 from the dem and resampled to 90 m resolution fig 5c 3 2 water table fluctuation wtf and chloride mass balance cmb methods the wtf method is among the most widely used techniques for groundwater estimation of aquifers healy and cook 2002 the method uses the following formula to calculate recharge 4 recharge sy h t where h is the head change comparing before and after the rainfall season sy is the specific yield and t is the time interval for the recharge period according to delin et al 2007 and healy and cook 2002 for the application of the wtf method the following assumptions should be satisfied 1 sharp water level rises and declines in response to only groundwater recharge and discharge 2 the aquifer system needs to be unconfined with shallow water level 3 the specific yield should be known and constant hence the monitoring well hydrographs are evaluated and only those which are more or less in line with these assumptions are considered for the point recharge calculation of this study similar to the suggestion of healy and cook 2002 the graphical method is applied to extrapolate the recession of the pre recharge water level to the recharge period so that the water level fluctuation is accurately considered the main source of uncertainty for the application of the method is the possible errors in the estimation of the specific yield healy and cook 2002 yenehun et al 2020 in this study both literature from johnson 1967 and an empirical formula developed by beretta and stevenazzi 2018 have been applied beretta and stevenazzi 2018 developed a relationship between sy and hydraulic conductivity k hence using the formula sy values for monitoring wells were determined using the k values analyzed from our single well pumping and slug test results a test on 31 hand dug wells were successfully executed and analyzed similar to wtf the chloride mass balance cmb method is a widely applied technique for estimating recharge somaratne and smettem 2014 the main concept in the method is that the increase in the concentration of chloride in the groundwater compared to the rainwater is due to evapotranspiration in the vadose zone during infiltrating percolating allison and hughes 1978 allison 1988 guan et al 2010 somaratne and smettem 2014 it means chloride anion is a conservative ion and its concentration increment during its movement in the vadose zone is merely in response to evapotranspiration mathematically groundwater recharge gwr is calculated in the following way 5 gwr pe cl p cl gw where gwr is groundwater recharge clp is chloride concentration in precipitation clgw is chloride concentration in groundwater pe is effective precipitation which is the total precipitation minus runoff amount of the period in reference to the similar study done by gebru and tesfahunegn 2019 and the hydrogeological nature of this study the applied cmb method assumes 1 the only source for chloride concentration for the groundwater in the aquifers is the chloride from the atmosphere 2 there is negligible source of extra chloride from fertilizers and pesticides in the area 3 the possible long term chloride concentration in the rainfall is not take into account the short term concentration is assumed to represent the long term 4 chloride ion is assumed geochemically inactive with soil medium there is neither sinks nor precipitation of the chloride ion 5 there is no transport of chloride ion with evapotranspiration water 6 there is no storage of chloride in the vadose zone furthermore the method is more effective in estimating diffuse recharge however inappropriate when focused recharge components recharge from discrete locations are prevalent in the area somaratne and smettem 2014 in general the geological and hydrogeological features of this study area seem to be favorable for diffuse recharge as a dominant recharging mechanism making the technique appropriate except the additional preferential recharge in fractured basaltic aquifer in this study the recharge calculation using the cmb has been made by subdividing the basin into southern eastern northern and western catchments hence the average chloride concentration in the analyzed groundwater and rainfall sampled in the specific sub area is considered these subdivisions are based on similar runoff characteristics and runoff coefficients in the four distinguished catchments dessie et al 2015 the mean annual rainfall within the respective areas and mean annual runoff coefficient estimated by dessie et al 2015 separately for the four sub areas are considered for the effective precipitation calculation 3 2 1 data for wtf and cmb methods water level data were being collected from may 2017 to june 2019 using 65 shallow hand dug and piezometer wells using community based manual daily measurement and automatic measuring sensors at every half an hour interval we trained the local people mostly the well owners and sometimes their neighbors in cases where the owners are illiterate afterward we supplied them with a measuring meter and a rope tied with a steel rod having a length of about half a meter every morning before fetching water they insert this rope tied with the steel rod into the well until it reaches some depth below the water level and then immediately get it out and measure the depth from the head of the well to the tip of the moist surface on the metal plate 52 of the monitoring wells were large diameter hand dug wells and had been measured manually using such simple equipment whereas the other 13 wells were being monitored using automatic data loggers these 13 wells were both shallow piezometers and deep wells 9 shallow piezometers and 4 shallow borehole wells the measuring time interval for the manual readings was daily and for the automatic logging it was every half an hour some of the hand dug wells are active water supplying wells where the owners fetch water for domestic and or backyard irrigation purposes these monitoring wells are well distributed over the studied basin and representing the various geological and topographical settings the depth of these shallow wells range from 5 m to 25 m the seasonal recharge values calculated for 2017 2018 and some for 2019 are averaged out many rises and declines within the overall recharging season are not considered only the seasonal highest rise and extrapolated antecedent decline during the highest rise using the graphical technique has been taken into account as a result the calculated recharge is the total recharge that joined the groundwater the specific yield was values estimated both by using johnson 1967 and beretta and stevenazzi 2018 are highly variable depending on primarily geology and degree of weathering hydrogeologically the shallow monitoring wells are placed on four hydrogeological units weathered basaltic regolith pyroclastic rocks fractured quaternary basalt with intermediate weathering grade and alluvio lacustrine formations the quaternary basalt was found with the highest sy value ranging from 0 08 to 0 1 while for the pyroclastic and alluvio lacustrine deposits values as low as 0 02 and as high as 0 074 were found the weathered basaltic regolith has a specific yield ranging from 0 04 to 0 08 water sampling for chemical analysis of the groundwater had been undertaken from 2016 to 2019 water samples for chemical analysis were collected in clean polyethene bottles and the bottles were rinsed three times with the sample water before being filled the rainwater samples were collected at raised heights 1 6 2 m above the ground to prevent contamination of samples from ground dust to prevent sample water evaporation the collectors had been closed immediately after the rain event had finished then the rainwater samples were taken from these collectors to polyethylene container bottles and treated like the groundwater samples the groundwater sampling sites were distributed throughout the study area representing the different aquifer types and topographical settings considering geology and topography well distributed samples from fractured basalt pyroclastic material basalt regolith and alluvio lacustrine shallow aquifers have been collected and analyzed similarly rainfall samples had been collected in similar periods at the lower middle and upper topography of the basin so that possible topographical influences on the rainfall water chemistry are taken into consideration in total about 255 groundwater samples and 25 rainfall samples have been collected and analyzed at ghent university department of geology laboratory of applied geology and hydrogeology however among the 255 samples 138 are on shallow groundwater where the chemistry is not much evolved due to long rock water interaction and those which are pollution free are selected for the calculation these 255 samples are those sampled and analyzed for the hydrochemical characterization of the basin groundwater in other words it includes those sampled from the deep wells deep groundwater which is expected to have undergone significant geochemical evolution and supposed to many years of water mixing which is with quite different time with the sampled rainfall water as a result those sampled from the deep wells were excluded from the cmb calculation in addition the possibility of chloride ion increment due to pollution has been taken into acount few samples from the shallow groundwater with relatively higher chloride concentration and are inline correlated with the concentration of nitrate and or sulfate ions are also omitted from use in the calculation as they might consist of some pollution finally it is only 138 groundwater samples fig 7 that are from shallow groundwater and with insignificant pollution additives are considered in the estimation of the recharge the number of groundwater samples for each sub area and the concentration of chloride range and mean values are shown in table 2 the number of samples for northern and western catchments is small compared to the eastern and southern the mean concentration values for the formers are a bit higher than the latter ones table 2 4 result and discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variation of groundwater recharge and other water balance components the annual groundwater recharge calculates over the period 2012 2016 using the calibrated wetspass model ranges from 0 mm to 1085 mm fig 8a and has a mean value of 315 mm 22 of rainfall amount recharge is assumed 0 mm at water bodies and wetlands in the wetspass model hence recharge is 0 mm at lake tana and a dam reservoir in the gilgel abay catchment and wetlands in the lower reaches of rib river catchment figs 4c and 8a no recharge at water body is the general assumption of the wetspass model fortunately this assumption is in line with previous studies e g kebede et al 2006 mamo 2015 smec 2008 which had concluded that there is insignificant percolation beneath the lake floor higher recharge is estimated on the southern gilgel abay and eastern gumara river catchments figs 1b and 7a and lower on the northern part of the lake tana basin this is mainly due to the lower rainfall amount in the northern catchments compared to southern catchments figs 3b and 8a apart from the rainfall the spatial distribution of the recharge seems highly controlled by the slope angle followed by the soil type and the land use type forest land covering only 1 8 has high recharge mean annual of 542 mm cultivated land and water body consisting of about 49 and 21 of the total areal coverage have annual mean recharge values of 370 mm and 0 mm respectively dominating over the total average value clay soil type covering about 77 of the total basin area has a mean annual value of about 276 mm the lowest amount estimated compared to all other soil types the major recharge is taking place during the summer season while only a small amount recharges during the winter about 237 mm is recharged in the summer and 78 mm in the winter seasons the mean annual recharge is about 22 of the total mean basin precipitation the mean annual runoff for the whole basin is about 416 mm accounting for about 29 of the average precipitation about 92 of the runoff is taking place during the summer season while the remaining is taking place during the long winter season relatively higher runoff is observed in the southern and eastern basins and lower runoff has been noted in the northern and northeastern rib river catchments fig 8c this is in line with the study by dessie et al 2015 in some areas e g in northern and northeastern low runoff values has been observed on the cultivated land and clay soil types where a high runoff coefficient is expected figs 4c 5a and 8c this is due to the relatively low rainfall amount on these parts of the lake tana basin fig 3b this shows that compared to the rainfall the soil type and the land use have less influence over the runoff the rainfall amount is highly controlling the spatial distribution of runoff figs 3b and 8c the zonal statistics for the land use and soil classes types show a high variation of runoff over the single class types for example for clay soil with cultivated land cover type the runoff ranges from 212 mm to 1216 mm 15 84 of mean rainfall and with an average of 485 mm accounting for about 34 of the rainfall this variation is found mainly due to the variation in the rainfall amount which is varying from 1097 mm to 2155 mm for the aftermentioned soil and land use class combination however it does not mean that the other runoff controlling variables such as the slope are not playing a significant role for such variations the evapotranspiration of the lake tana basin is mainly the sum of the direct evaporation from the lake and wetland and evapotranspiration over the other land cover types the mean evaporation over the lake is about 1485 mm in the wetspass model the penman method is used to estimate the open water evaporation batelaan et al 2007 the average total evapotranspiration over the basin is 770 mm which is 53 of the mean basin precipitation about 56 of total evapotranspiration is happening during summer and the other 44 occurs during winter the mean evapotranspiration of the basin is about 52 of the mean potential evapotranspiration the spatial distribution of the evapotranspiration over the basin is highly controlled by the rainfall and the land cover types relative to the other physical and meteorological variables figs 3b 4c and 8b it is higher over the lake and wetlands because it is open water where there is no limitation of water availability and evaporation is equal to the potential evaporation capability of the air the variation over the lake fig 8b is due to the variation of the potential evaporation fig 3b and c next to the water body and wetlands grassland forest bush and shrubland cover types have high evapotranspiration values the direct lake water evaporation is compared with other studies estimated by different methods table 3 the result is very close to that of kebede et al 2006 and chebud and melesse 2009 which both used the similar penman method table 3 however it is lower than the value estimated by dessie et al 2015 which used recent data from six stations this could be due to the application of different period data from 2012 to 2013 while it is from 2012 2016 in this study or the time scale applied seasonal versus daily for the calculation or it might be due to the method they used table 3 time scale affects evaporation calculations which are higher for fine time scales e g daily and relatively lower for coarser time scales e g seasonal or monthly bakundukize et al 2011 yenehun et al 2020 4 1 1 model verification the developed model is verified using two ways first the mean annual total river discharge using the daily time scale data of river discharge of 2012 2016 at seven major rivers is compared with the corresponding wetspass model results fig 9 part of these data annual mean of 2012 2013 have been used for the calibration of the model the river discharge amount for these major perennial rivers is the total flow amount comprising both surface and baseflow however the wetspass model calculates the runoff only the surface runoff but not the total discharge hence to estimate the total river flow at the catchment outlets of each river we applied a similar technique that gebreyohannes et al 2013 had followed based on groundwater balance in the aquifers the long term average annual groundwater drainage and possible abstractions are equal to the long term average annual recharge given the river gauging stations are usually at the groundwater discharge zones on the floodplain the flow measurements are assumed to catch the baseflow component except for a very small amount that may pass through deep percolations besides the groundwater abstractions using different shallow and deep wells can be assumed small compared to natural drainage and recharge as there is no large development of the groundwater in the basin using arcgis 10 3 tools both annual runoff and groundwater recharge outputs of the wetspass model are accumulated at the river outlets finally the accumulated raster maps of runoff and recharge for each major catchment are summed up to produce the spatial total river discharge map the total river discharges estimated in this study and those observed in the measurements 2012 2016 are compared fig 9 the overall coefficient of determination r2 between the simulated and the observed river discharge values of the different rivers is about 80 however for rib dirma and megech river catchments the simulation by wetspass is higher compared to the observation fig 9 this could be due to significant deep percolation of the groundwater that is not caught by the river flow measurements i e the baseflow is far less than the groundwater recharge the model is best simulated for gilgel abay gumara gelda and gibara rivers fig 9 the reason for these can be associated to the hydrogeological nature of the catchments for gumara and gilgel abay this could be due to the capturing of the baseflow in the flow measurements as most of the groundwater discharges through different springs in the lower reach of the rivers similarly smec 2008 and later dessie et al 2015 2014 came up with the conclusion that there is significant groundwater contribution for gilgel abay and gumara rivers flow while only little for megech and rib furthermore setegn et al 2008 had estimated the groundwater as baseflow contribution of the whole basin to be 50 of the total river inflow to the lake a similar geological nature also appears for gelda river the highly fractured quaternary basalt that might cause a relatively high baseflow that the river measuring station could have captured however the geological nature of gibara river is different the reason why there is good correlation between observed river discharge and sum of simulated recharge and surface runoff might be due to limited deep percolations that could pass underground at the river measuring station with only shallow aquifers that are recharged and discharge immediately to the nearby small stream tributaries in general it should be noted that the wetspass model applied is quasi steady state and uses long term average seasonal rainfall whereas in reality the rainfall characteristics intensity frequency and duration vary within fine time scales this is limiting the effectiveness of the model in simulating runoff the second way that the developed wetspass model verification made is through its performance in estimating groundwater recharge the point recharge estimated using the wtf method has been used to compare the model performance at those points the extracted recharge values of the model were correlated against the wtf results calculated at 65 monitoring stations fig 10a the overall correlation was fair with a coefficient of determination r2 35 however yenehun et al 2020 evaluated the performance of the wetspass model in estimating recharge at a small catchment in the upper gilgel abay river catchment and found that the technique is less effective at storage controlled flat floodplain areas and at aquifers where focused recharge through rock fractures is an important recharging mechanism therefore we excluded wtf results estimated at aquifers on those topographies and then the correlation coefficient r2 is found to be 84 fig 10c when only two wells located at storage controlled floodplain aquifer named dtw2 and at exceptionally highly fractured aquifer called sarwuha w1 fig 6 are excluded the r2 raised to 71 fig 10b hence the wetspass method is found effective in estimating the groundwater recharge in most parts of the study basin however at the flat floodplain alluvial aquifer and fractured rock aquifers where the hard rock is exposed to the surface water balance techniques such as the wetspass are found less effective the interannual variations of the rainfall and evapotranspiration though small compared to spatial variation as mentioned earlier would have its own impact in comparing the results by the wetspass and wtf methods the wtf is estimated using recently measured water level data while the wetspass includes earlier period meteorological data 4 2 effect of land use change on groundwater recharge and other water balance components the effect of land use change on groundwater recharge runoff and evapotranspiration has been assessed in this study this assessment has been made using the same long term average meteorological data that have been used in the wetspass model and hence possible variation due to temporal increasing or decreasing of the meteorological variables have not been taken into consideration the value of water balance terms changes with land use changes there is a decrease in recharge by 13 mm or 195 9 106 m3 in the years 1986 2014 table 4 in the lake tana basin this is about 4 of the mean annual recharge estimated with the applied wetspass model this is inline with the increase of cultivated land area from 36 7 to 49 mainly from grass bush and shrub and forest lands similarly there is an increase of runoff but it is only by 4 mm or 60 3 106 m3 in the 28 years about 1 of the total mean runoff similarly the evapotranspiration shows an increment by 9 mm or 135 6 106 m3 in these 28 years about 1 2 of the total mean annual aet the trend is in line with the studies by abate et al 2017 enku et al 2014 gebremicael et al 2013 hurni et al 2005 tesemma et al 2010 and woldesenbet et al 2017 which showed the shifting of the river discharge more to overland flow mechanism in the last four to five decades in the upper blue nile basin however the rate of hydrological change found in this study is relatively small compared to the rate of land use change this reinforces the idea that the land use is not the primary important controlling factor compared to rainfall amount discussed above in detail similarly birhanu et al 2019 found a negligible change of the water balance components for gumara catchment for the land use change of 1986 2015 using hbv model gashaw et al 2018 had also evaluated the effect of changing land use on the hydrology of andassa catchment neighboring small catchment south of lake tana basin over the same period 1986 2015 using swat model compared to this study they found a similar amount of reduction in baseflow supposed to be equivalent to groundwater recharge but a bit more runoff increment 4 3 groundwater recharge estimation using wtf and cmb methods the mean annual groundwater recharge using the wtf ranges from 125 mm to 778 mm accounting for about 9 54 of the mean basin rainfall in general the southern and eastern gumara river catchment part of the lake tana basin has higher recharge than the northern part fig 11 this is also similar to the result of the wetspass model fig 8a it has an overall basin average of 369 mm 26 of the rainfall which is a bit higher than the mean average estimated by the wetspass model 22 this could be due to the ability of the wtf method to capture the focused recharge through rock fractures and or lateral groundwater flow besides the diffuse recharge from the direct precipitation that yenehun et al 2020 had thoroughly discussed the spatial variation of recharge depends on topography and geology in steep sloping topography aquifers where low recharge is expected higher recharge values by wtf compared to wetspass is estimated figs 5c and 11 this is due to the additional recharge from the upstream area by lateral groundwater flow in addition to the diffuse recharge from the direct rainfall furthermore on the flat floodplain areas the recharge estimated by the wtf is small this is due to the limitation of the aquifer storage it means the aquifer is more or less fully recharged in the early to middle of the recharge period usually end of july to mid august but the model keeps on adding the recharge as there is unlimited aquifer storage in general the wetspass method is less effective in the fractured aquifers where focused recharge is the important recharging mechanism and on flat floodplain alluvio lacustrine aquifer areas where storage limits further recharge in addition it performs less in steeply sloping aquifers where fast groundwater flow accumulates additional recharge through lateral groundwater flow in general the values estimated by wetspass is over estimated in the storage controlled floodplain aquifer as it assumes infinite aquifer storage hence using physical hydrological models like wetspass models for similar aquifers is not recommended rather methods like wtf and cmb are the best alternatives similarly on fractured aquifers where major recharge is happening through open fractures preferential recharge wetspass underestimates recharge while wtf which is based on the real water level measurement estimates best similar to wetspass and wtf methods the recharge calculation using the cmb method shows strong spatial variability the groundwater recharge in the southern and eastern catchments is higher than in the northern and western catchments the mean annual recharge by the cmb method is about 346 mm 24 of the rainfall the spatial distribution is more or less similar to the spatial distribution map simulated by wetspass fig 8a and the point recharge distribution of the wtf method fig 11 the mean annual groundwater recharge values using the cmb method ranges from 164 mm to 404 mm the relatively smaller range for cmb is due to the consideration of average values in the four distinguished zones rather than at 138 groundwater sampling points otherwise the range of values would have been higher given the wider range of chloride values 0 3 12 5 mg l of the groundwater samples table 2 the heterogeneity in recharge processes and recharge rates over the basin is well notified by the higher range of values by the wetspass and wtf methods generally recharge in the eastern and southern catchments is higher than in the northern catchments table 5 primarily due to higher rainfall and favorable geology highly fractured quaternary basalt fig 2 the recharge by the cmb in the northern and somewhat in the western part is much smaller compared to the values by the other two methods table 5 this could be due to some recharge from the river water which elevates the chloride concentration of the groundwater which hence decreases the recharge value according to eq 5 the chloride concentration in the river water is higher due to exposure to open water evaporation before infiltration and percolation to the groundwater zone significant amount of groundwater recahrge by river water is observed in the megech catchment the main river catchment of northern area from about 356 51 106 m3 total mean annual river discharge recorded at the upper river measuring at the foothill of the catchment station in period 2012 2016 about 107 91 106 m3 is lost or not recorded by the downstream measuring station this water amount might mainly be recharge the groundwater in the flood aquifers this supports the above hypothesis of river water recharges groundwater in this part of the lake tana basin besides it might be also due to the small number of samples that results much uncertainities and as well as lack of time series chloride data contray to its need this aspect is throughly discussed by aishlin and mcnamara 2011 in general aishlin and mcnamara 2011 noted the necessity of more years of chloride measurement so as to decrease the effect of stored chloride in the vadose zone in the pre recharge period however our groundwater samples are only one time and such an effect might be included in the observed cmb results tekleab et al 2014 using stable isotope concluded that the rainfall source is different for the region where this study area is located i e both from freshwater and seawater the atlantic indian ocean congo basin upper white nile and the sudd swamps are the potential moisture sources during the main rainy summer season while the indian arabian and mediterranean sea moisture are during little rain spring and dry winter seasons this shows the chloride concentration of the rainwater is temporally highly variable in this study our rainwater sampling was not so frequent to address such possible variations however we have looked strong variations of chloride concentration higher during may june and low during the high rainy season july august this might have its own effect on the calculated recharge values and for the disparity with other methods for northern and western catchments table 5 5 conclusion the physically based water balance model wetspass has effectively been applied to simulate the water balance components of lake tana basin containing the largest lake of ethiopia the model simulates the mean annual major river inflows with a coefficient of determination r2 of 80 the model better simulated flows for some of catchments than for the other catchments where deep percolation might conceal the base flow from measurement by the gauging stations on the other hand the wetspass model applied is a quasi steady state that used long term average seasonal rainfall amounts though the rainfall characteristics vary within fine time scales this might limit the effectiveness of the model in simulating runoff amounts the annual groundwater recharge using wetspass ranges from 0 of rainfall at the water bodies where infiltration is impossible to 57 in the flat silty loam and bushland cover type it has a mean annual value of 315 mm 22 of the precipitation amount of which 237 mm is recharged in summer and the other 78 mm in the winter season similarly the wtf and cmb methods have also shown strong spatial variability with higher recharge values in the southern and eastern catchments and lower in the northern and partly in the western parts primarily due to rainfall distribution and geology there is good correlation between point recharge values by the wtf and extracted recharge from the wetspass spatial maps however there is a high disparity on wells located on the storage controlled flat floodplains and focused recharge affected fractured rock aquifers hence though water balance models estimate recharge at fine spatial scales that help for water management in specific areas its capacity is limited for aquifers where only diffuse recharge is the main recharging mechanism and for those aquifers that are not fully saturated early in the recharge period the mean annual runoff for the whole basin is about 416 mm 29 of the average precipitation and evapotranspiration is about 770 mm which is 53 of the mean basin precipitation the precipitation amount is highly controlling the spatial distribution of the runoff more than the land use and soil the mean evaporation over the lake is about 1485 mm the spatial distribution of the evapotranspiration over the basin is highly controlled by the rainfall and the land cover types the hydrology of the basin has not much changed in the last three decades though cultivated land has expanded significantly many hydrological models for different areas small catchment scale to large basins are developed and used for estimating groundwater recharge and other water balance components however evaluation of the methods with point estimations based on direct water level measurement wtf and chemical tracer cmb gives a good insight for future recharge estimation techniques for similar aquifer types wherever they are located in the world in this study identifying topographical and geological characteristics and thus the appropriate recharge mechanisms have found an important factor and starting point in selecting recharge estimation methods the study also pointed out that the common approach that is being implemented i e calculating recharge by a multitude of methods and averaging out the results of the different methods is found unreliable rather selecting an appropriate one or few technique s and considering that as the optimal result is recommended credit authorship contribution statement alemu yenehun conceptualization investigation formal analysis writing original draft mekete desssie project administration

mani 2019 with domestic and industrial water needs simultaneously intensifying agricultural systems must use water more efficiently e g tn h2o task force 2018 additionally enhanced weather variability manifesting as higher temperatures altered rainfall patterns longer more frequent wet dry cycles and more extreme rainfall events will further stress existing water stores while degrading soil quality through changes in structure and organic matter stocks cruse 2016 in conjunction increasing water demands and weather variability raise a practical concern of how existing crops and agricultural systems will fare in terms of sustained productivity under altered conditions current projections for crop yields over the next few decades are less than promising if a business as usual approach is maintained a decrease in corn and soybean yields ranging from 8 to 17 can be expected for every degree celsius increase in the average growing season temperature lobell and asner 2003 to assess how well crops are functioning under changing conditions the efficiency at which they use available water can be evaluated water use efficiency wue according to the united nations food agriculture organization is the grain production or yield per unit of water used for evapotranspiration e g dewit 1958 sadras et al 2007 sinclair et al 1984 it is similar in principle to crop water productivity which quantifies the value gained per amount of water used with the value being defined by the stakeholder wesseling and feddes 2006 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 while the definition for wue offers a good physiological assessment of how well individual crops are functioning it does not capture the state of the soil water crop management system since wue does not consider all water used or lost from the system due to landscape characteristics and management dietzel et al 2016 the amount of available water in agricultural systems is not only a function of evapotranspiration but also of runoff and drainage the system water use efficiency swue dietzel et al 2016 considers the additional losses of water and is described as the following 1 swue yield evapotranspiration runoff drainage the term efficiency implies that the components of a soil water crop management system can be manipulated to improve functioning hatfield et al 2001 the success of a manipulation depends on not only the type of change and the implementation period but also the existing soil conditions which regulate the transport and retention of water for plant growth blanco canqui and francis 2016 hazarika et al 2009

katerji and mastrorilli 2009 pinheiro et al 2019 yang et al 2016 understanding how soil properties interface with management practices via estimations of swue variability will improve understanding of how we farm in terms of crop choices and associated practices under a changing climate the premise of this study is that the variability in swue across a watershed can reflect the combined effects of soil properties management and climate on the functioning of a soil water crop management system something that is not possible with wue this study examines the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of both wue and swue in the obion river watershed in northwest tennessee fig 1 which can be considered as representative of watersheds in the lower mississippi river basin with loess derived soils

national agriculture statistics survey nass 2018 for isolating the effects of soil properties on swue 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodological overview to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of wue and swue in the obion watershed a geospatial examination was conducted to identify and group various landscapes based on similar hydrologic responses from these areas representative hillslopes were selected continuous simulations from 1980 to 2050 were performed for each representative hillslope using the water erosion prediction project model wepp to quantify time series for crop yields water budgets wue and swue water budgets were quantified by subtracting the losses of runoff drainage and evapotranspiration from precipitation totals during each growing season irrigation was not considered in this study wue was quantified as yield divided by evapotranspiration while swue was determined as yield over the sum of evapotranspiration drainage and runoff eq 1 the values for hillslopes with similar hydrologic responses were pooled and compared in terms of trends and magnitude changes to assess temporal and spatial variability across the watershed 2 2 focus watershed the obion river watershed fig 1 is a 6400 km2 system that is tributary to the lower mississippi river the watershed is part of two major land resource areas mlras namely the southern mississippi valley loess region mlra 134 and the southern mississippi river alluvium mlra 131 a region both mlras extend from the missouri bootheel along the lower mississippi river to the gulf of mexico usda scs 1981 the upper reaches of the obion watershed are in mlra 134 the topography transitions moving west from the headwaters as rolling hills segue to thickening loess plains and then bluff hills the highest gradient in the eastern and central parts of the watershed is 18 but over 80 of the hillslopes in these parts of the watershed are less than 5 the western part of the watershed is in mlra 131 a on the mississippi river alluvial plain this area is extremely flat with slopes less than 1 and covered with wooded swampland and oxbow lakes the soils in the eastern part of the obion are loess derived from at least five different periods moving west the loess thickens to about 20 m deep and is comprised of silty loam and silty clay soils the soils of the mississippi river alluvial plain are clayey with relatively high organic matter 2 the most influential soil feature in the watershed is the presence of a fragipan layer at depth e g ghaneeizad et al 2018 lindbo et al 1995 the fragipan soils exist predominantly in mlra 134 and approximately 30 of the watershed contains a fragipan layer within the top 2 m of the soil profile bockheim and hartemink 2013 in most locations the fragipan layer is below historical tillage depths typically 30 cm and is therefore intact buntley et al 1977 this subsurface water and root restricting horizon influences the effective moisture capacity of the overlying soil column dictates how much water can be held before runoff is observed and regulates groundwater recharge lindbo et al 1995 land use in the obion is mostly agricultural 68 2 and the watershed has the highest percentage of row crop production in tennessee the primary commodity crops include corn soybean and cotton in general there are two major 2 year rotations corn soybean and cotton soybean the watershed is 80 90 continuous no till and some fields have winter wheat planted as a cover or double crop nass 2017 surface drainage is more prevalent but subsurface tile drains cover 15 of the row crop land in the watershed jaynes and james 2007 nass 2017 mostly in the non fragipan bottomlands of the watershed ashley 1910 the annual average precipitation in the watershed over the last 40 years is about 1300 mm hanson and weltzin 2000 most of the rain occurs in the spring and winter although heavy convective thunderstorms can occur in the summer keim 1996 li et al 2013 the annual average temperature is 15 oc with an average growing season temperature of 23 oc soulé 1998 there is an east west gradient of temperature and precipitation which is controlled by elevation precipitation increases and temperature decreases as the elevation increases moving east away from the mississippi river tennessee climatological service 2009 during the summer higher temperatures and lower rainfall result in evapotranspiration being the dominant parameter in the hydrologic cycle 2 3 hydrologic response classes hrcs the areas with similar hydrologic responses fit into three hrcs table 1 hrc i is characterized by clay and organic rich soils on flat slopes i e less than 1 these areas are along the western edge of the watershed on the mississippi river alluvial plain they experience high evapotranspiration due to relatively higher temperatures and standing water from low gradient low infiltrating soils in the remainder of the watershed the landscape becomes more energetic translating to higher runoff compared to the western alluvial plain the loess soils have higher infiltration rates if there is no fragipan layer at depth when a fragipan layer is present clay contents at depth can reach 30 which severely retard percolation and promote more runoff hrc ii is characterized by moderate slopes i e 1 6 and silt loam soils with a fragipan layer producing low infiltration high runoff and high evapotranspiration hrc iii is characterized by moderate slopes and silt loam soils with no fragipan layer translating to moderate infiltration and evapotranspiration but low runoff 2 4 weather scenarios to develop potential future weather scenarios for this study the twenty models of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were reviewed cmip5

the atmosphere by 2100 a statistically downscaled climate dataset was obtained from multivariate adaptive constructed analogs 2016 at the finest available spatial resolution of 6 km x 6 km which was reprocessed at a 1 km scale ghaneeizad et al 2018 the data were verified against measured daily meteorological data from daymet thornton et al 2016 2 5 the water erosion prediction project model wepp is an established distributed parameter process based hydrologic and erosion model flanagan et al 1995 that works at both the hillslope and small watershed scales e g papanicolaou and abaci 2008 it was chosen in part because wepp can incorporate fine scale spatial heterogeneity in terms of soil parameters and topography affecting how water moves on and through hillslopes something that larger lumped models cannot do e g abaci and papanicolaou 2009 hydrologically wepp initially calculates infiltration using the green ampt mein larson model followed by runoff which is based on hortonian flow and quantified with a kinematic wave model the evapotranspiration component uses the priestley and taylor 1972 method which is a function of saturated vapor pressure psychrometric constant and daily net solar radiation the crop growth model is based on phenological crop development it considers daily accumulated heat units harvest indices and montieth s approach for determining potential biomass montieth 1977 as well as water and temperature stress adjustments the input data for this study include topography from state obtained lidar measurements tennessee department of finance and administration 2018 soil properties from ssurgo i e soil survey geographic database natural resources conservation service 2018 and land use crop rotations from the national land cover database and the usda nass cropscape nass 2019 the statistically downscaled temperature and precipitation data from the climate models were also used as input and the markov chain climate generator cligen provided wind and solar radiation data to complete the wepp climate input file cligen uses existing distributions of local weather parameters to generate a complete climate file but it may be considered as a limitation as it assumes stationary weather trends wepp also has a detailed agricultural management database and sub routine that incorporates specific timelines for planting tillage fertilizer and harvest operations abaci and papanicolaou 2009 as well as surface and subsurface drainage savabi 1993 for the corn soybean and cotton soybean rotations planting and harvesting dates crop parameters

representative hillslopes using the weather data from each climate model additionally both the 2 year corn soybean and 2 year cotton soybean rotation were run for each hillslope regardless of the actual rotation practiced on that specific hillslope each rotation was run twice starting first with corn cotton and then starting with soybean this was done so that an annually continuous times series for each crop system could be developed calibration and validation followed the methods in abaci and papanicolaou 2009 and freudenberg 2017 wepp requires a period of at least 25 years to provide stabilized steady state hydrologic values which is a prerequisite for the continuous mode i e mode where a series of events is simulated over a period and not a singular event papanicolaou and abaci 2008 the period of 1980 2005 was used for model calibration calibration parameters included effective hydraulic conductivity planting date biomass energy ratio growing degree days and harvest index wepp simulations from 2006 to 2015 were used for validation the performance of the model was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency and comparing the simulated crop yields at the representative hillslopes with the measured yields from nass the average standard deviation of the efficiency values for the representative hillslopes for each crop during calibration are as follows corn 0 69 0 18 soybean 0 83 0 09 cotton 0 80 0 14 the efficiency values during the validation period are the following 0 42 0 22 soybean 0 66 0 19 cotton 0 89 0 03 3 results 3 1 annual temperature and

dropped by 5 mw p 0 001 the yields for hrc ii were higher than the yields of the other two classes for corn this difference was small 6 kw p 0 018 while for cotton and soybean the differences were 10 and 24 higher respectively kw p 0 001 however the shewhart control limits in fig 3 revealed that despite having a lower relative decrease the drops in corn yields were farther outside the normal variance there were six drops below the lower control limit in the last 25 years of the simulation period for the three hrcs 3 4 water budgets the whole watershed stored on average 6 58 2 77 mm of water in the soil column per growing season under corn while under soybean it stored 25 2 31 0 mm but with higher variability the watershed under cotton lost water at 43 5 16 5 mm per growing season evapotranspiration was the largest water loss and was moderately correlated with both temperature and precipitation pcc p 0 01 for corn it consumed 70 97 of the growing season precipitation while for soybean and cotton the consumption was from 69 to 94 and from 70 to 113 respectively the growing season totals of runoff and natural drainage for all crop types were from 6 to 31 and less than 10 respectively of the precipitation total runoff drainage and soil moisture were all positively and strongly correlated with precipitation pcc p 0 001 hrc i and hrc ii tended to have similar values in terms of runoff and evapotranspiration mw p 0 076 hrc iii experienced at least 14 less evapotranspiration and 60 less runoff than the other two hrcs mw p 0 001 in total hrc iii lost 24 less water than the other classes which was attributed to having loess soils with no fragipan the average net water budget per growing season between 2016 and 2050 under corn for hrc i ii and iii were 54 22 mm 41 18 mm 75 31 mm respectively fig 4 under soybean the net balances per growing season were 37 35 mm for hrc i 14 33 mm for hrc ii and 86 36 mm for hrc iii with cotton the net balance for hrc i was 116 25 mm and for hrc ii was 105 25 mm while for hrc iii the net balance was 44 30 mm thus hrc iii was the only hrc to store water in the soil during the growing season 3 5 wue and swue the wue values under corn averaged 16 43 1 76 kg ha mm from 2016 to 2050 across all representative hillslopes the average wue values were lower for soybean 3 94 0 83 kg ha mm and cotton 4 92 0 62 kg ha mm because corn systems produced higher amounts of biomass hussain et al 2019 the corresponding swue values under the different crops were significantly lower mw p 0 001 because swue considered the additional water losses to runoff and drainage the swue values under corn averaged 13 53 1 80 kg ha mm with the averages under soybean and cotton being 3 28 0 74 and 4 05 0 63 kg ha mm respectively the maximum differences between the cumulative distribution curves of corn and cotton were 0 61 and 0 60 while for soybean it was 0 29 fig 5 the distance between the curves reflected the difference between the wue and swue values and hence the degree to which runoff and drainage dictated the available water for the system the swue values under corn and soybean decreased from 2016 to 2050 by approximately 10 and 20 respectively fig 6 while under cotton the values remained constant throughout the projected period in hrc i and ii the swue values under corn were considered similar ks p 0 967 while the values for hrc iii were significantly higher ks p 0 001 under soybean hrc ii had the highest swue values but they were not significantly different from the hrc iii values ks p 0 094 finally under cotton the hrc iii values were significantly higher than the other hrcs as with corn ks p 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 temperature precipitation and yield temperature and precipitation are two climatic factors that control yield gaps along with crop physiology for each crop both temperature and precipitation have significant moderate to strong correlations with yield pcc p 0 043 temperature has a stronger correlation with corn and soybean yields while precipitation has a stronger correlation with cotton yields although the average growing season temperature in the watershed increases only 7 by 2050 from 23 74 to 25 45 oc it is meaningful for soybeans and corn crops are often modeled using an optimal temperature at which their growth rate is a maximum hatfield and prueger 2015 as temperatures become warmer or cooler production decreases by a fraction relative to the difference from the optimal temperature for corn and soybean the optimum is near 25 oc hence their stronger correlation with temperature while for cotton the optimum is near 27 oc e g shaw 1983 table 2 presently average temperatures in the obion are above 25 oc mostly during july and august fig 7a by 2050 the length of time that temperatures rise above the 25 oc optimum extends by 3 weeks in early june and 3 weeks in august september with the additional 6 weeks of potential heat stress there will be higher water use by the crops the average amounts of water used by the crops in the obion which are based on evapotranspiration are 443 51 mm for corn 432 48 mm for soybean and 485 66 mm for cotton per growing season the growing season precipitation amounts drop 54 mm by 2050 and will average 495 80 mm for hrc i 521 84 mm for hrc ii and 523 92 mm for hrc iii thus evapotranspiration will exceed precipitation at times especially with cotton this decrease in precipitation is driven by lower rainfall in august fig 7b which drops from an average of 81 65 mm mw p 0 05 in conjunction with the precipitation decrease the dry periods between rain events are expected to prolong as the rainfall will be delivered in fewer events panagopoulos et al 2015 tennessee climatological service 2010 the lengths of the dry periods increase from 8 9 to 9 9 days mw p 0 05 thus intensifying the water stress on the crops for perspective a plant transpiring at the rate of 6 mm per day will start showing stress symptoms after four days without rainfall kimball et al 2016 a higher likelihood for extreme amounts of rainfall i e 25 mm has also been projected gustafson et al 2016 wiebe et al 2015 from 1980 2015 the number of days with rainfall amounts above 25 mm was 9 77 0 40 d yr during the projected period the number of days increases significantly mw p 0 001 to 10 4 0 5 d yr the increase in extreme events means more rain will transform to runoff and not infiltrate resulting from the higher temperatures shifting rainfall patterns longer wet dry cycles and more extreme rainfall events yields are projected to decrease for corn and soybean by 20 and 35 by 2050 which are in accordance with other studies lobell and asner 2003 panagopoulos et al 2015 corn and soybean yields have been found to be sensitive to short term 1 3 month meteorological droughts during critical development stages in july and august respectively e g zipper et al 2016 this may explain why soybean yields are projected to decline more in the obion due to the projected decreasing precipitation in august fig 7b potential management options that counter the effects of the warmer temperatures include planting drought tolerant cultivars irrigation which is still largely under developed in west tennessee grant et al 2017 haghverdi et al 2019 and shifting the growing season earlier as temperatures become suitable for planting above 10 oc nearly 2 weeks sooner one caveat here is that this study does not consider genetic modifications or crop acclimation changes additionally this study maintains a business as usual approach as management practices are not altered in the future scenarios for example irrigation was kept at its modest level and planting harvesting dates remained similar 4 2 wue and swue comparison with other studies the comparison of wue values with other published values is facilitated by multiple recent meta analyses e g hatfield et al 2001 mbava et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 measurements of wue for corn range from 2 to 40 kg ha mm in 10 different countries with a large coefficient of variation cv 0 38 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 rainfed corn in the central u s has wue values ranging from 3 to 24 kg ha mm mekonnen et al 2020 norwood 1999 varvel 1994 while irrigated corn has higher wue values from 9 to 30 kg ha mm due to the higher yields eck and winter 1992 grassini et al 2011 howell et al 1998 tolk et al 1998 additionally rotating corn with other crops increased wue from 25 4 kg ha mm to 27 3 kg ha mm hussain et al 2019 as did increasing fertilizer rates which raised wue values from 9 to 23 kg ha mm across china lu et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 rainfed soybeans in nebraska and kansas have higher wue values 2 0 8 2 kg ha mm than in the obion because of similar yields from half as much rainfall varvel 1995 mekonnen et al 2020 norwood 1999 in michigan rainfed soybeans have wue values averaging 6 95 0 96 kg ha mm due to relatively high yields averaging 3 14 0 44 mg ha hussain et al 2019 which is near the maximum yields seen in obion irrigated soybeans have even higher wue values from 4 to 12 kg ha mm grassini et al 2015 mekonnen et al 2020 average wue values for cotton range from 1 4 to 3 3 kg ha mm in nine countries with the variability attributed to climate and management namely irrigation fertilizer tillage practices zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in warm and wet climates like brazil wue values for cotton reach 6 kg ha mm da silva et al 2016 while in warm and dry climates like australia wue values range from 1 3 to 4 2 kg ha mm constable and bange 2015 in arid regions such as arizona and syria wue values are from 1 2 to 1 5 kg ha mm thorp et al 2020 and 1 9 5 3 kg ha mm evett and tolk 2009 farahani et al 2009 respectively on the other hand swue values are sparse in the existing literature studies in iowa by dietzel et al 2016 and marrs 2017 provide swue values for corn between 7 3 and 25 kg ha mm with a mean of 15 5 kg ha mm for soybean these studies provide a range from 1 7 to 6 8 kg ha mm with a mean of 4 8 kg ha mm the iowa values are higher than those in the obion because yields are 30 higher and rainfall is 30 lower in iowa comparatively to tennessee hamilton et al 2015 nass 2018 alternatively swue values for irrigated corn in bushland tx howell 2001 are 9 1 15 3 kg ha mm regarding cotton there are no swue values reported in the literature freudenberg 2017 4 3 wue and swue comparison with each other wue for corn and soybean are correlated with yield and temperature while swue is predominantly correlated with runoff see appendix for corn the swue values are also correlated with precipitation and evapotranspiration the wue and swue values for soybean appear less affected by hydrology which highlight the crop s low drought sensitivity mbava et al 2020 regarding cotton wue is most related with precipitation and swue is most correlated with runoff which is affected by soil structure and infiltration capacity when comparing wue and swue for the different crops there are greater distances between the cumulative distribution functions of corn and cotton than of soybean the further distances between the lines translate to a stronger influence from runoff for corn and cotton additionally corn has been seen to be more sensitive to spatially variable parameters like in this case runoff sadler and camp 1986 sadler et al 2000 values of swue tend to be more correlated with runoff followed by precipitation and evapotranspiration this result is unexpected considering losses due to evapotranspiration are 5 times greater than the losses of runoff one possible explanation is that as growing season precipitation increases yield becomes less water limited dietzel et al 2016 yet further increases in growing season precipitation result in continuously more runoff and hence a decrease in swue as the system loses more water dietzel et al 2016 4 4 comparison of swue across hrcs in places like the obion wue values may deviate more over time from present values as the increase in temperature seems to be the most prominent outcome of climate change while within and across sites swue is more likely to vary because of its correlation with runoff a more spatially variable term table 3 runoff has a cv of 71 across the watershed while temperature evapotranspiration and yield have cvs 25 thus swue is a more useful index to describe differences in agricultural systems across landscapes to explain its relatively higher spatial variability across the watershed table 3 specific site parameters namely soil features and topography must be considered hatfield et al 2001 the cumulative distribution functions of the swue values fig 8 reflect the different soil slope combinations in the obion and the spatial differences in swue values for corn hrc iii hillslopes have significantly higher swue values while the values for hrcs i and ii are considered similar for soybeans the hrc ii hillslopes have the highest swue values but they are not significantly different from the hrc iii values finally for cotton the hrc iii values are significantly higher like they were with corn the low gradient hillslopes in hrc i have high water losses in terms of runoff and evapotranspiration most probably from the low infiltration capacity of the high clay high organic soils leaving standing water at the surface serrano 2015 yang et al 2017 wue tends to correlate negatively with clay content and soil bulk density mbava et al 2020 hrc ii hillslopes have moderate gradients with silt loam soils and a fragipan layer at depth the restrictive layer will keep water in the root zone leading to high evapotranspiration as well as lead more readily to runoff production rhoton and romkens 1998 the hrc iii hillslopes have intermediate slopes and loess soils with no fragipan layer thus the soils have sufficient pore spacing and high water holding capacity which translate to less water losses and higher swues barker et al 2005 rawls et al 1982 zipper et al 2015 clayey soils like those in hrc i or in the fragipan layers of hrc ii have less available pore space to hold water lindbo et al 1995 water holding capacity of different soils has been assumed to be central in the spatial variability of hydrologic parameters yields and water use in the lower mississippi river basin and southeast grant et al 2017 haghverdi et al 2019 sadler et al 2000 zipper et al 2016 the inherent spatial variability of soil parameters like water holding capacity can be due to several factors western and blöschl 1999 making it difficult to identify its true connection here with wue swue garcia et al 2010 nonetheless the soil types with higher water content can supply adequate moisture to plants during times when rainfall does not occur the average swue value from 2016 to 2050 for corn for the hrc iii hillslopes is 13 and 19 higher than the corresponding values from the hrc i and hrc ii hillslopes this spatial variability is higher than the 11 temporal change of swue for corn during the same period this pattern holds true for the most part for soybean and cotton for soybean the hrc iii hillslopes have 25 higher and similar swue values than the swue values for hrc i and ii hillslopes respectively the temporal change averaged 20 finally for cotton the hrc iii hillslopes have 19 and 16 higher swue values than the swue values for hrc i and ii hillslopes respectively and here the temporal change averaged 4 thus the average spatial variability was greater than the average temporal variability in all but one case 5 conclusions in agricultural systems swue is an index that provides a truer glimpse than wue as to how a soil water crop management system is functioning as it considers not only evapotranspiration but also runoff and drainage dietzel et al 2016 yet very few studies consider how swue or wue values may differ spatially for informing sustainable management across heterogenous landscapes hatfield et al 2001 the novelty of this study is that it examines the importance of considering the spatial heterogeneity in landscape properties i e different soil slope combinations and its influence on wue and swue within a representative watershed of the lower mississippi river basin in summary landscapes with different hydrologic responses in the obion watershed were characterized as the following groups hrc i with high clay high organic matter soils hrc ii with moderate slopes loess soils and a fragipan layer at depth and hrc iii with moderate slopes loess soils but no fragipan layer the swue values for representative hillslopes in each hrc were pooled and compared in terms of overall trends and magnitude changes to assess the temporal and spatial variability across the watershed the swue values were projected until 2050 to understand how the current cropping systems will fare in the future under increased weather variability a 1 7 oc change in growing season temperature from 2016 to 2050 and a simultaneous decrease in august precipitation totals are expected to cause short term meteorological droughts in the obion watershed these changes result in corn and soybean yields decreasing significantly by 20 and 35 respectively while cotton yields decrease by 5 in turn swue values decrease however the average spatial variability was greater than the average temporal variability the spatial variability of swue values under corn was 11 while under soybean and cotton the swue values varied spatially by 25 and 16 respectively soil types with higher water holding capacity are generally more conducive to high productivity because they can store moisture which plants use during times of insufficient rainfall e g zipper et al 2015 the hrc iii hillslopes have loess derived silty loam soils with no fragipan which allows them to hold sufficient water clayey soils like those in hrc i or in the fragipan layers of hrc ii limit water storage and root proliferation now this study kept a business as usual approach in terms of management to isolate the role of soil spatial heterogeneity the timeline of management operations e g irrigation planting harvesting times fertilizer applications was not changed to see which practices may counter the effects of more variable climate on swue this is an activity that can be explored in future studies nonetheless agricultural practices must become more efficient in terms of water use and this study highlighted a need to consider specific soil geomorphological characteristics when choosing management practices to improve agriculture s efficiency of water use tomer and schilling 2009 locke et al 2010 these factors have not been considered before across different spatial scales and can impact the variability of water use and storage in a watershed increasing irrigation and fertilizer rates can be effective for reducing drought sensitivity and improving yields e g grassini et al 2011 zheng et al 2020 but in places that use broadcast methods like center pivots much water can be wasted grant et al 2017 irrigation and fertilizer methods must be based on specific soil types and use variable rate strategies haghverdi et al 2019 rovira más et al 2003 alternatively any practice that positively alters the condition or structure of soil can improve swue hatfield et al 2001 for example in sandy soils practices that build organic matter would be more useful while in clay soils practices that increase soil structure and pore spaces may be better choices gharahassanlou 2017 conservation tillage helps reduce soil compaction to increase infiltration and plant available moisture in the soil delgado et al 2013 additionally the residue remaining on the soil surface adds organic matter which builds soil aggregates and increases pore spaces for water to reside e g mooney and morris 2008 cover crops i e green manure animal manure and other organic amendments not only improve soil biology but also improve water infiltration delgado et al 2013 as do rotating crops wezel et al 2016 in summary these practices enhance infiltration and water storage in the soil which in turn reduce runoff and standing water lost through evapotranspiration and in turn increase swue funding funding for this study was provided by the u s department of agriculture through the following

7907,study region the obion river watershed tennessee is representative of lower mississippi river watersheds with loess soils and a fragipan layer study focus spatial and temporal heterogeneity of water use efficiency wue and system wue swue are examined under different landscapes unlike wue swue considers runoff better reflecting coupled soil management climate effects on an agricultural system representative hillslopes grouped in hydrologic response classes hrcs were modeled from 1980 to 2050 using the water erosion prediction project to quantify yields water budgets and wue swue hrc i is flat with clayey soils low infiltration and high evapotranspiration hrc ii has moderate slopes silty soils and fragipan layers causing low infiltration and high runoff hrc iii is similar but with no fragipan producing moderate infiltration and low runoff new hydrological insights hrc iii experiences 60 less runoff than the other hrcs due to loess soils with no fragipan it is the only hrc to store water during the growing season clay soils in hrc i and fragipan layers in hrc ii have less capacity to hold water swue is a more useful index than wue to describe differences in water holding capacity and ultimately yield across agricultural landscapes swue varies spatially from its correlation with runoff which has a coefficient of variation cv of 71 across the watershed evapotranspiration has a cv 16 temporally swue decreases 10 by 2050 but its spatial variability reaches 25 keywords system water use efficiency landscape heterogeneity obion river tn lower mississippi river fragipan water holding capacity 1 introduction agriculture currently consumes 70 of all freshwater withdrawals worldwide and by 2050 is expected to increase its consumption by 20 chaubey and mani 2019 with domestic and industrial water needs simultaneously intensifying agricultural systems must use water more efficiently e g tn h2o task force 2018 additionally enhanced weather variability manifesting as higher temperatures altered rainfall patterns longer more frequent wet dry cycles and more extreme rainfall events will further stress existing water stores while degrading soil quality through changes in structure and organic matter stocks cruse 2016 in conjunction increasing water demands and weather variability raise a practical concern of how existing crops and agricultural systems will fare in terms of sustained productivity under altered conditions current projections for crop yields over the next few decades are less than promising if a business as usual approach is maintained a decrease in corn and soybean yields ranging from 8 to 17 can be expected for every degree celsius increase in the average growing season temperature lobell and asner 2003 to assess how well crops are functioning under changing conditions the efficiency at which they use available water can be evaluated water use efficiency wue according to the united nations food agriculture organization is the grain production or yield per unit of water used for evapotranspiration e g dewit 1958 sadras et al 2007 sinclair et al 1984 it is similar in principle to crop water productivity which quantifies the value gained per amount of water used with the value being defined by the stakeholder wesseling and feddes 2006 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 while the definition for wue offers a good physiological assessment of how well individual crops are functioning it does not capture the state of the soil water crop management system since wue does not consider all water used or lost from the system due to landscape characteristics and management dietzel et al 2016 the amount of available water in agricultural systems is not only a function of evapotranspiration but also of runoff and drainage the system water use efficiency swue dietzel et al 2016 considers the additional losses of water and is described as the following 1 swue yield evapotranspiration runoff drainage the term efficiency implies that the components of a soil water crop management system can be manipulated to improve functioning hatfield et al 2001 the success of a manipulation depends on not only the type of change and the implementation period but also the existing soil conditions which regulate the transport and retention of water for plant growth blanco canqui and francis 2016 hazarika et al 2009 rhoton 2000 any practice that positively alters a soil s structure or organic matter content e g conservation tillage cover crops organic amendments can improve swue hatfield et al 2001 past studies have examined temporal changes in wue for a single crop or field resulting from variations in management or weather e g dietzel et al 2016 grassini et al 2011 grassini et al 2015 hussain et al 2019 lu et al 2016 marrs 2017 nelson et al 2018 wang et al 2018 few studies consider swue or how it varies across soil types superimposed with similar or dissimilar management practices hatfield et al 2001 katerji and mastrorilli 2009 pinheiro et al 2019 yang et al 2016 understanding how soil properties interface with management practices via estimations of swue variability will improve understanding of how we farm in terms of crop choices and associated practices under a changing climate the premise of this study is that the variability in swue across a watershed can reflect the combined effects of soil properties management and climate on the functioning of a soil water crop management system something that is not possible with wue this study examines the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of both wue and swue in the obion river watershed in northwest tennessee fig 1 which can be considered as representative of watersheds in the lower mississippi river basin with loess derived soils underlined with a fragipan layer grant et al 2017 locke et al 2010 the obion watershed exhibits a gradient of soil conditions but has similar climate and management e g the watershed is 80 90 no till national agriculture statistics survey nass 2018 for isolating the effects of soil properties on swue 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodological overview to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of wue and swue in the obion watershed a geospatial examination was conducted to identify and group various landscapes based on similar hydrologic responses from these areas representative hillslopes were selected continuous simulations from 1980 to 2050 were performed for each representative hillslope using the water erosion prediction project model wepp to quantify time series for crop yields water budgets wue and swue water budgets were quantified by subtracting the losses of runoff drainage and evapotranspiration from precipitation totals during each growing season irrigation was not considered in this study wue was quantified as yield divided by evapotranspiration while swue was determined as yield over the sum of evapotranspiration drainage and runoff eq 1 the values for hillslopes with similar hydrologic responses were pooled and compared in terms of trends and magnitude changes to assess temporal and spatial variability across the watershed 2 2 focus watershed the obion river watershed fig 1 is a 6400 km2 system that is tributary to the lower mississippi river the watershed is part of two major land resource areas mlras namely the southern mississippi valley loess region mlra 134 and the southern mississippi river alluvium mlra 131 a region both mlras extend from the missouri bootheel along the lower mississippi river to the gulf of mexico usda scs 1981 the upper reaches of the obion watershed are in mlra 134 the topography transitions moving west from the headwaters as rolling hills segue to thickening loess plains and then bluff hills the highest gradient in the eastern and central parts of the watershed is 18 but over 80 of the hillslopes in these parts of the watershed are less than 5 the western part of the watershed is in mlra 131 a on the mississippi river alluvial plain this area is extremely flat with slopes less than 1 and covered with wooded swampland and oxbow lakes the soils in the eastern part of the obion are loess derived from at least five different periods moving west the loess thickens to about 20 m deep and is comprised of silty loam and silty clay soils the soils of the mississippi river alluvial plain are clayey with relatively high organic matter 2 the most influential soil feature in the watershed is the presence of a fragipan layer at depth e g ghaneeizad et al 2018 lindbo et al 1995 the fragipan soils exist predominantly in mlra 134 and approximately 30 of the watershed contains a fragipan layer within the top 2 m of the soil profile bockheim and hartemink 2013 in most locations the fragipan layer is below historical tillage depths typically 30 cm and is therefore intact buntley et al 1977 this subsurface water and root restricting horizon influences the effective moisture capacity of the overlying soil column dictates how much water can be held before runoff is observed and regulates groundwater recharge lindbo et al 1995 land use in the obion is mostly agricultural 68 2 and the watershed has the highest percentage of row crop production in tennessee the primary commodity crops include corn soybean and cotton in general there are two major 2 year rotations corn soybean and cotton soybean the watershed is 80 90 continuous no till and some fields have winter wheat planted as a cover or double crop nass 2017 surface drainage is more prevalent but subsurface tile drains cover 15 of the row crop land in the watershed jaynes and james 2007 nass 2017 mostly in the non fragipan bottomlands of the watershed ashley 1910 the annual average precipitation in the watershed over the last 40 years is about 1300 mm hanson and weltzin 2000 most of the rain occurs in the spring and winter although heavy convective thunderstorms can occur in the summer keim 1996 li et al 2013 the annual average temperature is 15 oc with an average growing season temperature of 23 oc soulé 1998 there is an east west gradient of temperature and precipitation which is controlled by elevation precipitation increases and temperature decreases as the elevation increases moving east away from the mississippi river tennessee climatological service 2009 during the summer higher temperatures and lower rainfall result in evapotranspiration being the dominant parameter in the hydrologic cycle 2 3 hydrologic response classes hrcs the areas with similar hydrologic responses fit into three hrcs table 1 hrc i is characterized by clay and organic rich soils on flat slopes i e less than 1 these areas are along the western edge of the watershed on the mississippi river alluvial plain they experience high evapotranspiration due to relatively higher temperatures and standing water from low gradient low infiltrating soils in the remainder of the watershed the landscape becomes more energetic translating to higher runoff compared to the western alluvial plain the loess soils have higher infiltration rates if there is no fragipan layer at depth when a fragipan layer is present clay contents at depth can reach 30 which severely retard percolation and promote more runoff hrc ii is characterized by moderate slopes i e 1 6 and silt loam soils with a fragipan layer producing low infiltration high runoff and high evapotranspiration hrc iii is characterized by moderate slopes and silt loam soils with no fragipan layer translating to moderate infiltration and evapotranspiration but low runoff 2 4 weather scenarios to develop potential future weather scenarios for this study the twenty models of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were reviewed cmip5 provides hindcasted and forecasted climate simulations from 1850 to 2205 using atmosphere ocean global climate models coupled with earth system models taylor et al 2012 four models were selected that capture the range of conditions in tennessee and exhibit low bias i e 10 deviation between hindcasted estimates and corresponding measured values gustafson et al 2016 sheffield et al 2013 the models

institut pierre simon laplace model ipsl cm5a mr and the miroc esm chem model which is jointly developed by the japanese agency for marine earth science and technology the university of tokyo and national institute for environmental studies with each model daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures humidity and shortwave radiation were obtained for a single representative

the atmosphere by 2100 a statistically downscaled climate dataset was obtained from multivariate adaptive constructed analogs 2016 at the finest available spatial resolution of 6 km x 6 km which was reprocessed at a 1 km scale ghaneeizad et al 2018 the data were verified against measured daily meteorological data from daymet thornton et al 2016 2 5 the water erosion prediction project model wepp is an established distributed parameter process based hydrologic and erosion model flanagan et al 1995 that works at both the hillslope and small watershed scales e g papanicolaou and abaci 2008 it was chosen in part because wepp can incorporate fine scale spatial heterogeneity in terms of soil parameters and topography affecting how water moves on and through hillslopes something that larger lumped models cannot do e g abaci and papanicolaou 2009 hydrologically wepp initially calculates infiltration using the green ampt mein larson model followed by runoff which is based on hortonian flow and quantified with a kinematic wave model the evapotranspiration component uses the priestley and taylor 1972 method which is a function of saturated vapor pressure psychrometric constant and daily net solar radiation the crop growth model is based on phenological crop development it considers daily accumulated heat units harvest indices and montieth s approach for determining potential biomass montieth 1977 as well as water and temperature stress adjustments the input data for this study include topography from state obtained lidar measurements tennessee department of finance and administration 2018 soil properties from ssurgo i e soil survey geographic database natural resources conservation service 2018 and land use crop rotations from the national land cover database and the usda nass cropscape nass 2019 the statistically downscaled temperature and precipitation data from the climate models were also used as input and the markov chain climate generator cligen provided wind and solar radiation data to complete the wepp climate input file cligen uses existing distributions of local weather parameters to generate a complete climate file but it may be considered as a limitation as it assumes stationary weather trends wepp also has a detailed agricultural management database and sub routine that incorporates specific timelines for planting tillage fertilizer and harvest operations abaci and papanicolaou 2009 as well as surface and subsurface drainage savabi 1993 for the corn soybean and cotton soybean rotations planting and harvesting dates crop parameters and management timelines were determined through consultation with university of tennessee extension and associated literature table 2 flinchum et al 2013 main 2012 mcclure and cannon 2016 mcclure et al 2016 raper 2014 robinson 2004 thompson et al 2006 2 6 wepp simulations calibration validation wepp was run in the continuous simulation mode from 1980 to 2050 at a daily timestep for hrc representative hillslopes using the weather data from each climate model additionally both the 2 year corn soybean and 2 year cotton soybean rotation were run for each hillslope regardless of the actual rotation practiced on that specific hillslope each rotation was run twice starting first with corn cotton and then starting with soybean this was done so that an annually continuous times series for each crop system could be developed calibration and validation followed the methods in abaci and papanicolaou 2009 and freudenberg 2017 wepp requires a period of at least 25 years to provide stabilized steady state hydrologic values which is a prerequisite for the continuous mode i e mode where a series of events is simulated over a period and not a singular event papanicolaou and abaci 2008 the period of 1980 2005 was used for model calibration calibration parameters included effective hydraulic conductivity planting date biomass energy ratio growing degree days and harvest index wepp simulations from 2006 to 2015 were used for validation the performance of the model was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency and comparing the simulated crop yields at the representative hillslopes with the measured yields from nass the average standard deviation of the efficiency values for the representative hillslopes for each crop during calibration are as follows corn 0 69 0 18 soybean 0 83 0 09 cotton 0 80 0 14 the efficiency values during the validation period are the following 0 42 0 22 soybean 0 66 0 19 cotton 0 89 0 03 3 results 3 1 annual temperature and precipitation from 1980 2015 the average annual daily temperatures of the four climate models range from 14 97 oc to 15 17 oc this range compares well with the measured average of 15 00 0 38 oc similarly the annual precipitation totals which range from 1239 to 1318 mm compare well with the measured average of 1299 208 mm the measured and modeled datasets for both precipitation and temperature have similar mean variances kruskal wallis tests kw precipitation p 0 67 temperature p 0 83 and their cumulative distribution functions are not significantly different kolmogorov smirnov tests ks precipitation p 0 64 temperature p 0 15 these comparisons display the low bias of the model datasets e g sheffield et al 2013 the simulation results from 2016 to 2050 show an increase of 1 71 oc which agrees with predictions from the intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 and other regional studies gustafson et al 2016 panagopoulos et al 2015 wiebe et al 2015 there is no significant change in annual precipitation totals over time ks p 0 40 that would ultimately affect water storage in the soil column this supports a previous study ghaneeizad et al 2018 where annual water budgets in the obion from 1980 to 2050 at a 1 km2 grid scale using the variable infiltration capacity model did not change significantly due to sufficient precipitation 3 2 growing season temperature and precipitation annual time scales may be too broad to capture the effects of an increasingly variable climate on agricultural systems shifting weather patterns within growing seasons i e april to october may cause short term droughts intensified by other water demands zipper et al 2016 from 2016 2050 average temperatures during the growing season increased from 23 74 oc to 25 45 oc fig 2a it was not a steady increase though after 2025 the rate of increase 0 097 oc yr nearly doubled that of the preceding decade 0 055 oc yr similarly growing season precipitation totals for the obion decreased by 54 mm during this period with most of the decrease occurring after 2030 fig 2b spatially hrc ii and hrc iii values and patterns of growing season temperature and precipitation were nearly identical as the two classes overlap spatially the temperatures for hrc i were significantly higher ks p 0 001 while the precipitation totals were significantly lower than the other two classes ks p 0 017 3 3 crop yields for each crop yields decreased from 2016 to 2050 fig 3 following a similar stepped pattern as the growing season weather since yield was a function of both temperature pearson correlation coefficient pcc corn 0 864 soybean 0 652 cotton 0 386 and precipitation pcc corn 0 560 soybean 0 439 cotton 0 516 from 2016 2030 corn and soybean yields decreased 9 and 18 respectively while cotton yields increased by 5 mann whitney tests mw p 0 001 from 2030 to 2050 corn and soybean yields experienced another stepped decrease 11 and 17 respectively while cotton yields dropped by 5 mw p 0 001 the yields for hrc ii were higher than the yields of the other two classes for corn this difference was small 6 kw p 0 018 while for cotton and soybean the differences were 10 and 24 higher respectively kw p 0 001 however the shewhart control limits in fig 3 revealed that despite having a lower relative decrease the drops in corn yields were farther outside the normal variance there were six drops below the lower control limit in the last 25 years of the simulation period for the three hrcs 3 4 water budgets the whole watershed stored on average 6 58 2 77 mm of water in the soil column per growing season under corn while under soybean it stored 25 2 31 0 mm but with higher variability the watershed under cotton lost water at 43 5 16 5 mm per growing season evapotranspiration was the largest water loss and was moderately correlated with both temperature and precipitation pcc p 0 01 for corn it consumed 70 97 of the growing season precipitation while for soybean and cotton the consumption was from 69 to 94 and from 70 to 113 respectively the growing season totals of runoff and natural drainage for all crop types were from 6 to 31 and less than 10 respectively of the precipitation total runoff drainage and soil moisture were all positively and strongly correlated with precipitation pcc p 0 001 hrc i and hrc ii tended to have similar values in terms of runoff and evapotranspiration mw p 0 076 hrc iii experienced at least 14 less evapotranspiration and 60 less runoff than the other two hrcs mw p 0 001 in total hrc iii lost 24 less water than the other classes which was attributed to having loess soils with no fragipan the average net water budget per growing season between 2016 and 2050 under corn for hrc i ii and iii were 54 22 mm 41 18 mm 75 31 mm respectively fig 4 under soybean the net balances per growing season were 37 35 mm for hrc i 14 33 mm for hrc ii and 86 36 mm for hrc iii with cotton the net balance for hrc i was 116 25 mm and for hrc ii was 105 25 mm while for hrc iii the net balance was 44 30 mm thus hrc iii was the only hrc to store water in the soil during the growing season 3 5 wue and swue the wue values under corn averaged 16 43 1 76 kg ha mm from 2016 to 2050 across all representative hillslopes the average wue values were lower for soybean 3 94 0 83 kg ha mm and cotton 4 92 0 62 kg ha mm because corn systems produced higher amounts of biomass hussain et al 2019 the corresponding swue values under the different crops were significantly lower mw p 0 001 because swue considered the additional water losses to runoff and drainage the swue values under corn averaged 13 53 1 80 kg ha mm with the averages under soybean and cotton being 3 28 0 74 and 4 05 0 63 kg ha mm respectively the maximum differences between the cumulative distribution curves of corn and cotton were 0 61 and 0 60 while for soybean it was 0 29 fig 5 the distance between the curves reflected the difference between the wue and swue values and hence the degree to which runoff and drainage dictated the available water for the system the swue values under corn and soybean decreased from 2016 to 2050 by approximately 10 and 20 respectively fig 6 while under cotton the values remained constant throughout the projected period in hrc i and ii the swue values under corn were considered similar ks p 0 967 while the values for hrc iii were significantly higher ks p 0 001 under soybean hrc ii had the highest swue values but they were not significantly different from the hrc iii values ks p 0 094 finally under cotton the hrc iii values were significantly higher than the other hrcs as with corn ks p 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 temperature precipitation and yield temperature and precipitation are two climatic factors that control yield gaps along with crop physiology for each crop both temperature and precipitation have significant moderate to strong correlations with yield pcc p 0 043 temperature has a stronger correlation with corn and soybean yields while precipitation has a stronger correlation with cotton yields although the average growing season temperature in the watershed increases only 7 by 2050 from 23 74 to 25 45 oc it is meaningful for soybeans and corn crops are often modeled using an optimal temperature at which their growth rate is a maximum hatfield and prueger 2015 as temperatures become warmer or cooler production decreases by a fraction relative to the difference from the optimal temperature for corn and soybean the optimum is near 25 oc hence their stronger correlation with temperature while for cotton the optimum is near 27 oc e g shaw 1983 table 2 presently average temperatures in the obion are above 25 oc mostly during july and august fig 7a by 2050 the length of time that temperatures rise above the 25 oc optimum extends by 3 weeks in early june and 3 weeks in august september with the additional 6 weeks of potential heat stress there will be higher water use by the crops the average amounts of water used by the crops in the obion which are based on evapotranspiration are 443 51 mm for corn 432 48 mm for soybean and 485 66 mm for cotton per growing season the growing season precipitation amounts drop 54 mm by 2050 and will average 495 80 mm for hrc i 521 84 mm for hrc ii and 523 92 mm for hrc iii thus evapotranspiration will exceed precipitation at times especially with cotton this decrease in precipitation is driven by lower rainfall in august fig 7b which drops from an average of 81 65 mm mw p 0 05 in conjunction with the precipitation decrease the dry periods between rain events are expected to prolong as the rainfall will be delivered in fewer events panagopoulos et al 2015 tennessee climatological service 2010 the lengths of the dry periods increase from 8 9 to 9 9 days mw p 0 05 thus intensifying the water stress on the crops for perspective a plant transpiring at the rate of 6 mm per day will start showing stress symptoms after four days without rainfall kimball et al 2016 a higher likelihood for extreme amounts of rainfall i e 25 mm has also been projected gustafson et al 2016 wiebe et al 2015 from 1980 2015 the number of days with rainfall amounts above 25 mm was 9 77 0 40 d yr during the projected period the number of days increases significantly mw p 0 001 to 10 4 0 5 d yr the increase in extreme events means more rain will transform to runoff and not infiltrate resulting from the higher temperatures shifting rainfall patterns longer wet dry cycles and more extreme rainfall events yields are projected to decrease for corn and soybean by 20 and 35 by 2050 which are in accordance with other studies lobell and asner 2003 panagopoulos et al 2015 corn and soybean yields have been found to be sensitive to short term 1 3 month meteorological droughts during critical development stages in july and august respectively e g zipper et al 2016 this may explain why soybean yields are projected to decline more in the obion due to the projected decreasing precipitation in august fig 7b potential management options that counter the effects of the warmer temperatures include planting drought tolerant cultivars irrigation which is still largely under developed in west tennessee grant et al 2017 haghverdi et al 2019 and shifting the growing season earlier as temperatures become suitable for planting above 10 oc nearly 2 weeks sooner one caveat here is that this study does not consider genetic modifications or crop acclimation changes additionally this study maintains a business as usual approach as management practices are not altered in the future scenarios for example irrigation was kept at its modest level and planting harvesting dates remained similar 4 2 wue and swue comparison with other studies the comparison of wue values with other published values is facilitated by multiple recent meta analyses e g hatfield et al 2001 mbava et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 measurements of wue for corn range from 2 to 40 kg ha mm in 10 different countries with a large coefficient of variation cv 0 38 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 rainfed corn in the central u s has wue values ranging from 3 to 24 kg ha mm mekonnen et al 2020 norwood 1999 varvel 1994 while irrigated corn has higher wue values from 9 to 30 kg ha mm due to the higher yields eck and winter 1992 grassini et al 2011 howell et al 1998 tolk et al 1998 additionally rotating corn with other crops increased wue from 25 4 kg ha mm to 27 3 kg ha mm hussain et al 2019 as did increasing fertilizer rates which raised wue values from 9 to 23 kg ha mm across china lu et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 rainfed soybeans in nebraska and kansas have higher wue values 2 0 8 2 kg ha mm than in the obion because of similar yields from half as much rainfall varvel 1995 mekonnen et al 2020 norwood 1999 in michigan rainfed soybeans have wue values averaging 6 95 0 96 kg ha mm due to relatively high yields averaging 3 14 0 44 mg ha hussain et al 2019 which is near the maximum yields seen in obion irrigated soybeans have even higher wue values from 4 to 12 kg ha mm grassini et al 2015 mekonnen et al 2020 average wue values for cotton range from 1 4 to 3 3 kg ha mm in nine countries with the variability attributed to climate and management namely irrigation fertilizer tillage practices zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in warm and wet climates like brazil wue values for cotton reach 6 kg ha mm da silva et al 2016 while in warm and dry climates like australia wue values range from 1 3 to 4 2 kg ha mm constable and bange 2015 in arid regions such as arizona and syria wue values are from 1 2 to 1 5 kg ha mm thorp et al 2020 and 1 9 5 3 kg ha mm evett and tolk 2009 farahani et al 2009 respectively on the other hand swue values are sparse in the existing literature studies in iowa by dietzel et al 2016 and marrs 2017 provide swue values for corn between 7 3 and 25 kg ha mm with a mean of 15 5 kg ha mm for soybean these studies provide a range from 1 7 to 6 8 kg ha mm with a mean of 4 8 kg ha mm the iowa values are higher than those in the obion because yields are 30 higher and rainfall is 30 lower in iowa comparatively to tennessee hamilton et al 2015 nass 2018 alternatively swue values for irrigated corn in bushland tx howell 2001 are 9 1 15 3 kg ha mm regarding cotton there are no swue values reported in the literature freudenberg 2017 4 3 wue and swue comparison with each other wue for corn and soybean are correlated with yield and temperature while swue is predominantly correlated with runoff see appendix for corn the swue values are also correlated with precipitation and evapotranspiration the wue and swue values for soybean appear less affected by hydrology which highlight the crop s low drought sensitivity mbava et al 2020 regarding cotton wue is most related with precipitation and swue is most correlated with runoff which is affected by soil structure and infiltration capacity when comparing wue and swue for the different crops there are greater distances between the cumulative distribution functions of corn and cotton than of soybean the further distances between the lines translate to a stronger influence from runoff for corn and cotton additionally corn has been seen to be more sensitive to spatially variable parameters like in this case runoff sadler and camp 1986 sadler et al 2000 values of swue tend to be more correlated with runoff followed by precipitation and evapotranspiration this result is unexpected considering losses due to evapotranspiration are 5 times greater than the losses of runoff one possible explanation is that as growing season precipitation increases yield becomes less water limited dietzel et al 2016 yet further increases in growing season precipitation result in continuously more runoff and hence a decrease in swue as the system loses more water dietzel et al 2016 4 4 comparison of swue across hrcs in places like the obion wue values may deviate more over time from present values as the increase in temperature seems to be the most prominent outcome of climate change while within and across sites swue is more likely to vary because of its correlation with runoff a more spatially variable term table 3 runoff has a cv of 71 across the watershed while temperature evapotranspiration and yield have cvs 25 thus swue is a more useful index to describe differences in agricultural systems across landscapes to explain its relatively higher spatial variability across the watershed table 3 specific site parameters namely soil features and topography must be considered hatfield et al 2001 the cumulative distribution functions of the swue values fig 8 reflect the different soil slope combinations in the obion and the spatial differences in swue values for corn hrc iii hillslopes have significantly higher swue values while the values for hrcs i and ii are considered similar for soybeans the hrc ii hillslopes have the highest swue values but they are not significantly different from the hrc iii values finally for cotton the hrc iii values are significantly higher like they were with corn the low gradient hillslopes in hrc i have high water losses in terms of runoff and evapotranspiration most probably from the low infiltration capacity of the high clay high organic soils leaving standing water at the surface serrano 2015 yang et al 2017 wue tends to correlate negatively with clay content and soil bulk density mbava et al 2020 hrc ii hillslopes have moderate gradients with silt loam soils and a fragipan layer at depth the restrictive layer will keep water in the root zone leading to high evapotranspiration as well as lead more readily to runoff production rhoton and romkens 1998 the hrc iii hillslopes have intermediate slopes and loess soils with no fragipan layer thus the soils have sufficient pore spacing and high water holding capacity which translate to less water losses and higher swues barker et al 2005 rawls et al 1982 zipper et al 2015 clayey soils like those in hrc i or in the fragipan layers of hrc ii have less available pore space to hold water lindbo et al 1995 water holding capacity of different soils has been assumed to be central in the spatial variability of hydrologic parameters yields and water use in the lower mississippi river basin and southeast grant et al 2017 haghverdi et al 2019 sadler et al 2000 zipper et al 2016 the inherent spatial variability of soil parameters like water holding capacity can be due to several factors western and blöschl 1999 making it difficult to identify its true connection here with wue swue garcia et al 2010 nonetheless the soil types with higher water content can supply adequate moisture to plants during times when rainfall does not occur the average swue value from 2016 to 2050 for corn for the hrc iii hillslopes is 13 and 19 higher than the corresponding values from the hrc i and hrc ii hillslopes this spatial variability is higher than the 11 temporal change of swue for corn during the same period this pattern holds true for the most part for soybean and cotton for soybean the hrc iii hillslopes have 25 higher and similar swue values than the swue values for hrc i and ii hillslopes respectively the temporal change averaged 20 finally for cotton the hrc iii hillslopes have 19 and 16 higher swue values than the swue values for hrc i and ii hillslopes respectively and here the temporal change averaged 4 thus the average spatial variability was greater than the average temporal variability in all but one case 5 conclusions in agricultural systems swue is an index that provides a truer glimpse than wue as to how a soil water crop management system is functioning as it considers not only evapotranspiration but also runoff and drainage dietzel et al 2016 yet very few studies consider how swue or wue values may differ spatially for informing sustainable management across heterogenous landscapes hatfield et al 2001 the novelty of this study is that it examines the importance of considering the spatial heterogeneity in landscape properties i e different soil slope combinations and its influence on wue and swue within a representative watershed of the lower mississippi river basin in summary landscapes with different hydrologic responses in the obion watershed were characterized as the following groups hrc i with high clay high organic matter soils hrc ii with moderate slopes loess soils and a fragipan layer at depth and hrc iii with moderate slopes loess soils but no fragipan layer the swue values for representative hillslopes in each hrc were pooled and compared in terms of overall trends and magnitude changes to assess the temporal and spatial variability across the watershed the swue values were projected until 2050 to understand how the current cropping systems will fare in the future under increased weather variability a 1 7 oc change in growing season temperature from 2016 to 2050 and a simultaneous decrease in august precipitation totals are expected to cause short term meteorological droughts in the obion watershed these changes result in corn and soybean yields decreasing significantly by 20 and 35 respectively while cotton yields decrease by 5 in turn swue values decrease however the average spatial variability was greater than the average temporal variability the spatial variability of swue values under corn was 11 while under soybean and cotton the swue values varied spatially by 25 and 16 respectively soil types with higher water holding capacity are generally more conducive to high productivity because they can store moisture which plants use during times of insufficient rainfall e g zipper et al 2015 the hrc iii hillslopes have loess derived silty loam soils with no fragipan which allows them to hold sufficient water clayey soils like those in hrc i or in the fragipan layers of hrc ii limit water storage and root proliferation now this study kept a business as usual approach in terms of management to isolate the role of soil spatial heterogeneity the timeline of management operations e g irrigation planting harvesting times fertilizer applications was not changed to see which practices may counter the effects of more variable climate on swue this is an activity that can be explored in future studies nonetheless agricultural practices must become more efficient in terms of water use and this study highlighted a need to consider specific soil geomorphological characteristics when choosing management practices to improve agriculture s efficiency of water use tomer and schilling 2009 locke et al 2010 these factors have not been considered before across different spatial scales and can impact the variability of water use and storage in a watershed increasing irrigation and fertilizer rates can be effective for reducing drought sensitivity and improving yields e g grassini et al 2011 zheng et al 2020 but in places that use broadcast methods like center pivots much water can be wasted grant et al 2017 irrigation and fertilizer methods must be based on specific soil types and use variable rate strategies haghverdi et al 2019 rovira más et al 2003 alternatively any practice that positively alters the condition or structure of soil can improve swue hatfield et al 2001 for example in sandy soils practices that build organic matter would be more useful while in clay soils practices that increase soil structure and pore spaces may be better choices gharahassanlou 2017 conservation tillage helps reduce soil compaction to increase infiltration and plant available moisture in the soil delgado et al 2013 additionally the residue remaining on the soil surface adds organic matter which builds soil aggregates and increases pore spaces for water to reside e g mooney and morris 2008 cover crops i e green manure animal manure and other organic amendments not only improve soil biology but also improve water infiltration delgado et al 2013 as do rotating crops wezel et al 2016 in summary these practices enhance infiltration and water storage in the soil which in turn reduce runoff and standing water lost through evapotranspiration and in turn increase swue funding funding for this study was provided by the u s department of agriculture through the following

7908,study region yellow river basin china study focus the rainfall runoff modeling performance of data driven models ddm in the yellow river basin yrb at a large scale is unclear such that the ddm research in the yrb lacks essential reference which can be critical for model development research understanding the advantages and disadvantages of ddms by comparing them to process based models pbm helps model selection in practice especially when benchmarking is performed at large scales we benchmarked three ddms namely svm lstm and cnn lstm and a pbm namely the xinanjiang xaj model across 54 basins of the yrb factors affecting ddm performance are identified and the sensitivity of pbm to these factors is also discussed new hydrological insights for the region ddm performs the best in the upper reaches the worst in the middle reaches pbm demonstrates a wider applicability when calibration data is limited whereas ddm generally outperforms pbm for areas where data limitation is not a problem the most important catchment attribute affecting pbm and ddm is a high frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 however ddm is more vulnerable to this factor in addition ddm performance depends heavily on the introduced lagged streamflow when data is insufficient we conclude that the rainfall runoff modeling relationship in catchments with high drought frequencies is more complex resulting in ddm requiring more data but pbm is less affected by these factors indicating that pbm has better applicability in the case of limited data keywords rainfall runoff modeling benchmarking cnn lstm lstm xaj yellow river basin data availability the catchment attributes and meteorological data are obtained from hao et al 2021 which is publicly available via https zenodo org record 5729444 ddm codes will be made public via https github com haozhen315 benchmarking data driven rainfall runoff modeling across 54 catchments in the yellow river basin 1 introduction the yellow river is the second longest river in china it flows through arid semi arid and sub humid regions the yellow river nourishes 9 of china s population 107 million piao et al 2010 surface water is a critical natural resource for the yellow river basin yrb groundwater resources account for only 10 3 of the total water resources in yrb indicating the importance of surface water numerous dams and reservoirs have been built in the yrb for water resource management since the 21st century rainfall runoff modeling concerns estimating the future streamflow based on the available observations beven 2011 it helps decision making related to flood protection water resource planning and mitigation of pollution transforming rainfall to runoff is an extraordinarily complex process and cannot be well expressed in mathematical forms flury et al 1994 zehe and flühler 2001 weiler and naef 2003 kim et al 2006 blume et al 2009 the traditional methods process based models pbm have structures that are predefined by prior knowledge and have fewer degrees of freedom by contrast data driven models ddm treat the catchments as black boxes models are calibrated based on the observations of historical climate and streamflow data for ddm the internal process of water movement is ignored beven 2011 ddm has the flexibility to describe highly complex relationships while a predefined model structure often restricts pbm shen et al 2018 benchmarking rainfall runoff modeling is critical for hydrologic research uncertainty exists in all aspects of hydrologic simulations from data to model structure and parameterization benchmarking a model across a large number of catchments helps model selections and future model developments lane et al 2019 in addition evaluating models across multiple watersheds reduces the randomness of the model evaluation however current large scale benchmarking focusing on ddm covers only a few areas harrigan et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 lane et al 2019 feng et al 2020 the rainfall runoff modeling performance of ddms in yrb at a large scale is still unclear deep learning based sequence modeling methods such as long short term memory lstm have recently been used in streamflow forecasting simulation kratzert et al 2018 feng et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 gauch et al 2021 lees et al 2021 rainfall runoff modeling typically deals with time series data including forcing and streamflow observations recurrent neural networks rumelhart et al 1986 including the lstm are neural networks with a typical structure that are suitable for processing sequential data rnn s mechanism of parameter sharing between different time steps makes it suitable for rainfall runoff modeling since some storage effects such as the soil moisture content and snow accumulation need to be modeled in rainfall runoff modeling bergstroem 1975 martinec 1975 winstral and marks 2002 recurrent neural networks can also scale to much longer sequences than networks without sequence based specialization goodfellow et al 2016 deep learning models can learn complex nonlinear relationships from a large amount of data compared to pbm they are less prone to structural error shen et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 explored the performance of lstm on rainfall runoff modeling the model was trained at both regional scale and catchment scale across 241 catchments of the contiguous u s kratzert et al 2019a 2019b further built a regional lstm model by adding catchment specific attributes to the model inputs allowing the trained model to better respond to different watershed conditions kratzert et al 2019a 2019b also examined the ability of lstm to generalize from gauged basins to ungauged ones feng et al 2020 used recent streamflow observations to improve the modeling performance of lstm chadalawada et al 2020 and herath et al 2021 built a flexible modeling framework applying machine learning methods genetic programming to search the model space and infer suitable model configurations for conceptual hydrological models gauch et al 2021 recently proposed the multi time scale lstm that simultaneously simulates multiple timescales deep learning methods have also been used in uncertainty estimation for rainfall runoff modeling klotz et al 2021 the different aspects of pbm have been extensively studied by the hydrologic community but there are still many questions that need to be answered regarding ddm the applicability of ddm to large areas in yrb needs to be studied the main factors influencing the performance of ddm need to be identified the adaptability of ddm to catchments with different characteristics such as varying streamflow seasonality and climatic conditions need to be discussed the dependence of ddm on calibration data such as the data volume needs to be compared to pbm the ddm dependence on model inputs needs to be explored through experiments e g ddm can be very dependent on certain types of input variables in this research we benchmark daily rainfall runoff modeling of three ddms namely svm lstm and cnn lstm and a pbm the xinanjiang xaj model across 54 catchments in the yrb the 54 catchments are selected out of 102 catchments of yrb without large dams or reservoirs built in hao et al 2021 based on the well known grand dataset lehner et al 2011 this research centers around three core aspects regarding ddms large scale benchmarking in yrb dependence on calibration data and the impacts of different catchment attributes on the model performance the xaj model is also benchmarked across the same 54 catchments to provide a comparison such that the different aspects of ddms can be better understood as a side problem we investigate how cnn can help improve the performance of lstm in rainfall runoff modeling especially in cases with limited data since the average length of data used in this study is less than 6 years research on the application of convolutional neural networks in the field of hydrological modeling is scarce although time series data such as 1 d grid data are particularly suitable for convolutional neural networks to process feng et al 2020 applied convolutional neural networks for extracting features from streamflow and then fed the extracted features to lstm together with the meteorological input feng et al 2020 concluded that convolutional networks could reduce the overfitting problem of lstm however it remains to be answered whether the same overfitting effect can be alleviated by simplifying the lstm and whether cnn can effectively extract features from climate variables in addition to lagged streamflow we discuss these issues through experiments on the yrb data and camels u s dataset addor et al 2017 specifically we demonstrate the following 1 cnn significantly improves the modeling performance given limited data even with only one convolutional layer however the same effect cannot be achieved by reducing the hidden unit dimension of the lstm 2 within a specific range stacking convolutional layers improves rainfall runoff modeling but further increases the number of convolutional layers will not yield much 3 adding pooling layers is not as good as replacing the pooling layer with convolutional layers suggesting that the permutation invariant mechanism of convolutional networks does not benefit rainfall runoff modeling the main findings and contributions of this research can be summarized as follows 1 ddms have the best performance in the upper reaches of yrb while modeling in the middle reaches is challenging part of the lower reaches catchments can have good simulation results 2 cnn only works when the calibration data is limited experiments on some of the catchments of yrb it doesn t help when the data is abundant experiments on the camels data set 3 xaj generally performs better than cnn lstm when calibration data is limited though introducing cnn can help alleviate the overfitting problem of lstm 4 given enough calibration data cnn lstm generally outperforms xaj 5 relationships between the modeling performance and more than 120 catchment attributes are quantified based on the recently proposed ccam dataset hao et al 2021 both cnn lstm and xaj are affected by a high frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 but not the streamflow normalized by catchment area however cnn lstm suffers more indicating that pbm has a wider applicability in practice 6 the performance of ddms heavily relies on the introduced lagged streamflow input which can partly explain why lstm and cnn lstm do not perform well in catchments with high frequency of dry days in which cases the streamflow autocorrelation is weak we conclude that the performance of ddm is highly dependent on the introduced lagged streamflow input when the calibration data is limited for basins with a high frequency of dry days learning the rainfall runoff relationships can be more complex and requires more data however pbm performance is less affected by these factors to understand this phenomenon we decompose the rainfall runoff modeling for both pbm and ddm into two parts namely physical priors general laws and regional adaptation adapt to different catchments given enough data ddm learns better regional adaptation relationships than pbm however given pbm is less affected by the data volume and the catchment attributes due to the built in physical priors pbm has wider applicability in practice in section 2 we introduce the dataset used in this research namely the ccam and the camels dataset the camels dataset is used only for evaluating the cnn lstm performance given enough data in section 3 we introduce the ddm modeling methods namely the lstm and the cnn lstm the cnn lstm model introduces convolutional filters to improve the performance of lstm in addition two neural network interpretation methods deeplift and integrated gradients are used to assess ddms dependence on the introduced lagged streamflow input in section 4 we present the results and findings in section 5 we present the summary of this research 2 dataset 2 1 ccam and hydromlyr the catchments attributes and the daily climatic time series of yrb came from the hydromlyr hydrology machine learning in yellow river dataset which is included in the ccam china catchment attributes and meteorology hao et al 2021 dataset the daily streamflow observations were obtained from the yellow river conservancy committee http www yrcc gov cn though this research benchmarks daily rainfall runoff modeling hydromlyr contains weekly normalized streamflow for 102 yrb catchments from 2000 to 2020 among which 54 catchments were selected with no large dams or reservoirs built within the catchment boundary based on the well known grand dataset lehner et al 2011 these 54 catchments are studied in this research however most of the yrb catchments are affected by human activities these basins are no exception irrigation small reservoirs dams table 1 describes the daily meteorological variables forming the ddm model inputs the length of the streamflow records ranges from 3 to 20 years 2000 2000 with an average length of around 2000 days 5 4 years compared with many existing rainfall runoff modeling studies of yrb tang et al 2008 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2018 xu et al 2022 which either used outdated data prior to 2000 or had low temporal resolution monthly quarterly this research better reflect the recent performance of rainfall runoff modeling in yrb and explore modeling with higher temporal resolution daily compared to the camels data set the yrb streamflow record is relatively short therefore we utilized k fold cross validation strategy refaeilzadeh et al 2009 for the fairness of evaluation for a given catchment the default length of validation is one fifth of the total length however the length of each validation fold has a maximum of 1000 days to retain more training data and has a minimum of 365 days ensure at least one year is used for each validation 2 2 camels the camels u s addor et al 2017 dataset is used to examine the effectiveness of introducing cnn to the lstm rainfall runoff modeling given enough calibration data the camels u s dataset contains approximately 30 year catchment aggregated meteorological forcing data and daily streamflow observations starting for 671 catchments for the experiments on the camels dataset we adopted the same train test set split as kratzert et al 2019a 2019b i e the first half for calibration and the remaining half for testing kratzert et al 2019a 2019b benchmarked lstm across 531 basins selected from 671 basins in the camels dataset and we adopted the same procedure 3 method 3 1 lstm gated recurrent neural networks are perhaps the most effective models for sequence modeling tasks and the long short term memory network lstm is a type of gated rnn traditional rnns suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients the gate mechanism of lstm has two main effects 1 prevent gradient explosion and vanishing problems and 2 the network learns when to forget old information if it is no longer helpful each block of an lstm network has the same inputs and outputs as the ordinary rnns the difference is that lstm introduces a gate mechanism to control the information flow inside the block a component of lstm the state unit s i t for time step t and cell i has a self loop to update itself however the self loop weight is controlled by the forget gate unit f i t which sets the weight to a value between 0 and 1 through a sigmoid unit 1 f i t σ b i f j u i j f x j t j w i j f h j t 1 where x t is the input vector for the time step t h t is the hidden state vector containing outputs from all lstm cells and b f u f and w f are biases input weights and recurrent weights of the forget gates respectively the update formula of the state unit is as follows 2 s i t f i t s i t 1 g i t σ b i j u i j f x j t j w i j f h j t 1 the computation of the input gate g i t is similar to that of the forget gate but with its own parameters 3 g i t σ b i g j u i j f x j t j w i j f h j t 1 the lstm outputs can be shut off by the output gate q i t which is computed as follows 4 h i t tanh s i t q i t 5 q i t σ b i o j u i j f x j t j w i j f h j t 1 where parameters b u and w are biases input weights and recurrent weights for the output gate respectively 3 2 cnn lstm convolutional networks have been successful in practical applications lecun et al 2015 but the hydrology community has underestimated their use in hydrological modeling convolutional neural networks cnns lecun et al 1989 are a family of neural networks for processing data with grid like topology time series data such as forcing observations are a typical type of 1 d grid three essential ideas behind convolutional neural networks are sparse interactions parameter sharing and equivariant representations goodfellow et al 2016 sparse interaction means that every output unit of a convolutional layer interacts with only a few input units this feature enforces a convolutional filter to extract meaningful local features from inputs effectively parameter sharing refers to the same parameters being used more than once in the network while in the traditional neural network a weight is used only once in computing an output in a convolutional neural net each weight of a kernel is used at every portion of the inputs except for points at boundaries parameter sharing significantly reduces the storage requirement for parameters and enforces the kernels to learn meaningful features that share the entire training data in terms of time series data the third property equivariant representations enables the same feature to be extracted from the convolution when we shift the inputs in time convolutional neural networks cnns employ a mathematical operation called cross correlation which is the same as convolution a mathematical function but without flipping the kernel 6 s i j i k i j m n i i m j n k m n where i is the two dimensional input and k is the two dimensional convolution filter many machine learning libraries implement cross correlation but call it convolution paszke et al 2019 convolutional neural networks are excellent for identifying various salient patterns in the input signals specifically lower convolutional layers obtain the local salience of the input signals while higher layers obtain a high level representation of the learned patterns assuming the current time step is t the inputs to the cnn lstm model are the forcing measurements all types of variables from time step t l to t and the lagged streamflow observations from t l a to t a are optionally concatenated with forcing where l is the sequence length and a is the lag time the input sequence first goes through one or several 1 d convolutional filters the extracted features are then fed into an lstm network due to padding the extracted features from convolutional layers have the same length as the original input but the number of convolutional filters replaces the number of input variables when using lstm alone the input features can be simplified if the number of convolutional filters is less than the number of input channels and the input features may also become more complicated when the number of convolutional filters exceeds the number of input channels 3 3 evaluation metrics the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used as the evaluation metrics like kratzert et al 2018 and feng et al 2020 the nse is used to benchmark ddms for comparison with other research the kge is used to compare pbm and ddm since kge has the advantage of being insensitive to streamflow seasonality kge can be decomposed into correlation r bias β and a measure of relative variability α in the simulated and observed values 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 with α σ s σ o β μ s μ o where the quantity α is a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β is the bias normalized by the standard deviation of the observations value of one is desirable for both α and β 3 4 interpretation method we deployed two neural network interrogative algorithms integrated gradients sundararajan et al 2017 and deeplift shrikumar et al 2017 to assess the attributions contributions of input variables climatic and lagged streamflow input to the simulated streamflow the focus is to understand the dependence of the simulated streamflow on different input variables therefore the attribution values of each input variable at all time steps are averaged to obtain the overall assessment of each input variable denote the function for simulating a single time step as f r n r x r n is the input and x r n is the baseline a zero matrix integrated gradients sundararajan et al 2017 calculate the integral of gradients of a neuron to the input along the path from a given baseline to the input that is the attribution of each input to the output is calculated by observing the changes of output when input shifts from a baseline to the actual value 15 integratedgrads i approx x x i x i m k 1 m f x x i x x k m x x where x i is the i th input a scalar m is the number of steps used to approximate the integral we set m 20 based on the author s recommendation sundararajan et al 2017 similar to integrated gradients deeplift shrikumar et al 2017 can be applied to any model representing a differentiable function deeplift has the advantage that it does not need to specify the number of steps for approximating the gradient integral and such that it is more efficient deeplift is proposed to approximate integrated gradients 16 m δ x δ t c δ x δ t δ x where x is the input neuron with a difference δ x from the baseline and t is the target neuron with a difference δ t from the baseline c is the contribution of δ x to δ t 4 results and discussions in this section we first present the benchmarking results of ddms focusing on exploring how cnn helps improve the performance of lstm in rainfall runoff modeling given limited amount of calibration data next we present the xaj benchmarking result based on the benchmarking results of xaj and cnn lstm we discuss two central problems regarding ddm 1 the dependence of ddm and pbm on the calibration data respectively 2 what are the key catchment attributes that affect the streamflow simulation of ddm and whether they have the same impact on pbm finally based on the results of the attribution analysis using deeplift and integrated gradients we demonstrate that ddm performance is highly dependent on the lagged streamflow input which can partly explain why ddm does not perform well in basins with high drought frequencies 1 mm d 1 the cnn lstm model configuration used throughout the discussion is the cnn lstm model with one day lagged streamflow and optimized number of convolutional layers ranging from 1 to 3 for each catchment 4 1 ddm performance in yrb the numerical benchmarking results of ddm can be found in table 2 the cumulative frequencies of the catchment specific nse can be found in fig 1 a key results can be summarized as follows svm produced large negative nse for some of the yrb basins resulting in a non representative average of nses null value in table 2 indicating that the rainfall runoff relationships in some catchments are too complicated for svm to capture adding lagged streamflow to the input significantly improves the ddm streamflow simulation even if the delay is up to 7 days fig 1 a however when the time delay of streamflow input reaches 30 days it no longer benefits the simulated streamflow cnn lstm performs the best among the benchmarked ddms fig 1 b using a convolutional neural network to extract features dramatically improves the rainfall runoff modeling performance of lstm given limited data compared with the volume and spread of the streamflow the timing and shape are easier to capture which is supported by the high correlation coefficient of the simulated streamflow ddms tend to underestimate the variability of streamflow which is the result of using mse nse as the objective function gupta et al 2009 the spatial distribution of nse for cnn lstm is shown in fig 2 the averaged nse in the upper reaches of yrb is 0 93 most of the downstream basins have nse greater than 0 6 however cnn lstm which performs best among the ddms still achieved low nse in the middle reaches in sections 4 3 4 5 based on the results of benchmarking xaj model across the same 54 catchments we discuss the potential reasons for the incompetent of ddms in the middle reaches of yrb through exploring the relationships between the performance distribution of ddm and different catchment attributes 4 2 the role of convolutional networks 4 2 1 overfitting introducing convolution to extract features from input significantly improves the streamflow simulation performance of lstm table 2 in yrb note that the number of convolutional filters 4 is less than the number of original input variables 16 hence the information received by the lstm is simplified within a specific range overlaying convolutional layers improves rainfall runoff modeling of lstm fig 3 a we also found that reducing the dimensionality of lstm hidden units did not achieve the same effect in yrb fig 3 b we conclude that the required feature processing is relatively simple because a shallow convolutional neural network works best however adding pooling layers is not as good as replacing the pooling layers with convolutional ones fig 3 a reducing the hidden dimensions of lstm did not achieve the same effect as introducing convolutional layers this phenomenon can be understood from the theoretical perspective of neural networks the functions that the neural networks have to learn are complex rainfall runoff modeling it is required to find a complex model whose structure is well adjusted i e appropriately regularized rather than a simplified structure goodfellow et al 2016 which is incapable of capturing the complexities to further verify that the performance improvement brought by cnn is due to the alleviation of over fitting we conducted experiments on a larger dataset that is to verify if cnn lstm still performs better than lstm in cases with sufficient data if cnn lstm performed better than lstm it indicated that cnn improved the overall performance of lstm otherwise it indicated that the performance gain came from the efficient simplification of the input features the result fig 4 indicates that the performance improvement through introducing convolutional networks in yrb experiments is mainly due to the prevention of overfitting i e fitting the noise because when data is sufficient to train the lstm introducing cnn does not bring improvements fig 4 even increasing the number of convolutional filters cnn lstm cannot outperform lstm 4 2 2 different filters for different patterns to visualize cnn s processing of input features we utilize the method proposed by zeiler and fergus 2014 which was used to visualize the first two layers of convolutional networks in the original paper the visualization approach first generates some random noise as input then forwards the input and calculates the mean of the convolutional layers activations gradient ascent is then performed on the input to maximize the mean of the activations the resulting input is the most sensitive pattern for the considered filter through which we can inspect which input pattern the filter is most sensitive to the result fig 5 indicates that for different convolutional filters different methods of combining input features are learned since different filters are sensitive to different sets of column variables 4 3 xaj benchmarking table 3 compares the benchmarking numerical results of xaj and cnn lstm fig 6 a b presents the performance distributions the xaj model performs better than cnn lstm in terms of kge index but weaker than cnn lstm in terms of nse table 3 compared with nse kge has a more balanced evaluation of the model performance gupta et al 2009 so xaj is better than cnn lstm in terms of the overall performance considering that mse is used as the loss function the optimization objective of ddm is consistent with nse therefore compared with xaj cnn lstm can benefit more from the high seasonality of streamflow resulting in high nse value to understand the performance difference between ddm and pbm we decompose rainfall runoff modeling into two parts learning physical priors or general laws and regional adaptation fig 6 c both ddm and pbm need to perform well in these two parts to achieve good simulation pbm inherently has better physical priors but has less flexibility in regional adaptation for ddm general laws of rainfall runoff modeling need to be learned from data but due to the high flexibility pbm generally performs better than pbm given enough data from calibrating although the performance of xaj and cnn lstm are both affected by calibration data length cnn lstm suffers more fig 6 d due to the built in physical priors pbm is able to achieve acceptable performance given limited data 4 4 catchment attributes in this section we identify the most important catchment attributes that impact the performance of ddms and we discuss whether pbm is also affected by the same factors we demonstrate that among the many catchment attributes fig 7 the high frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 is the most influential attribute for simulation although the xaj model is also affected by the dry frequency cnn lstm suffers more fig 8 the performance of cnn lstm also depends on the autocorrelation of streamflow all catchment attribute data came from the hydromlyr dataset hao et al 2021 and the pearson correlation coefficient is used the middle reaches of yrb are dry accounting for 19 7 of the runoff production and 55 6 of the sedimentation catchments in this area are sandy a negative correlation 0 16 exists between the nse and the catchment sand content fig 7 a the upstream and downstream streamflow is large in amount and cnn lstm has high performance in these areas fig 7 b however the correlation between nse and the streamflow normalized by the catchment area is weak 0 02 fig 7 c the high nses in the upper basins are attributed to the high streamflow seasonality streamflow seasonality for each basin is calculated according to sankarasubramanian et al 2001 eq 7 of the original paper the last element being p q not q p correlation analysis indicates that the streamflow seasonality is positively 0 5 correlated with nse fig 7 d from a theoretical aspect nse can benefit from high streamflow seasonality because the observation mean is used as the baseline in the nse formulation gupta et al 2009 for basins with high streamflow seasonality a good baseline model is the calendar day model schaefli and gupta 2007 which uses the mean observed streamflow for each calendar day across different years for prediction cnn lstm still outperforms the calendar day baseline model by a large margin fig 7 e in general ddms perform better in basins with high streamflow autocorrelations fig 7 k for ddms high mean runoff does not guarantee the success of rainfall runoff modeling on a catchment but the low frequency of dry days does both nse 0 72 and kge 0 69 are highly negatively correlated with the frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 of the catchment fig 8 suggesting that an appropriate indicator of the modeling difficulty is the frequency of dry days rather than other catchment attributes indicating that the rainfall runoff modeling of catchments with little or no precipitation most of the time is more complex however xaj is less affected by the low frequency of rainfall therefore we conclude that pbm has wider applicability in practice 4 5 lagged streamflow the attribution analysis is performed on the evaluation set attributions are calculated for each simulated daily streamflow then the attributions are averaged for each variable results of variables of the same type are averaged e g maximum minimum and mean temperature then the median for each aggregated variable is calculated and normalized by the group deeplift and integrated gradients mean results table 4 indicates that cnn lstm heavily relies on variables with strong seasonality such as temperature and air pressure cnn lstm is not highly dependent on evapotranspiration which is contrary to common sense this partly explains why cnn lstm performed worse than xaj in watersheds with high frequency of dry days since the evapotranspiration input is not being used effectively deeplift and integrated gradients agree on most variables except ground temperature which may be caused by error of algorithm mechanisms for ddm the simulated streamflow is very dependent on the lagged streamflow the attribution analysis also indicates that the simulated streamflow in the middle reaches is the least sensitive to the lagged streamflow input fig 9 the middle reaches are characterized by drought and a high frequency of dry days the random runoff process results that ddm has less dependence on the historical streamflow in these areas taking all the above analysis together we conclude that the performance of ddm is highly dependent on the introduced lagged streamflow input when calibration data is limited ddm requires more calibration data to learn the mappings from rainfall to runoff compared to pbm given limited data for training ddm modeling relies mainly on the lagged streamflow however pbm is less affected by these factors 5 conclusion we benchmarked ddm and pbm across 54 yrb catchments with no large dams or reservoirs built in the spatial distribution of the ddm simulation performance in yrb is depicted we propose to use convolutional networks to learn efficient feature representations from 16 climatic and hydrologic input variables based on the ddm benchmarking results we discussed how a convolutional network improves the modeling performance of lstm when calibration data is limited through experiments on yrb data and camels dataset we conclude that the performance gain by introducing cnn mainly comes from alleviating the overfitting problem of lstm and the same effect cannot be achieved by reducing the hidden dimension of lstm comparing the benchmarking results of a pbm model namely xaj and based on the catchment attributes data in ccam dataset we identified the most important catchment attributes that impact the performance of ddm and if the same effect happens to xaj the result indicates that a high frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 impacts the ddm simulation most while xaj is also affected by the same factor cnn lstm suffers more when calibration data is limited cnn lstm mainly relies on the introduced lagged streamflow input for rainfall runoff modeling while xaj has a wider applicability when training data is limited large scale benchmarking in the yellow river basin provides a reference for future rainfall runoff simulation studies in the yellow river basin in addition based on the results we believe that ddm needs to be combined with traditional models to reduce the need for calibration data volume especially in cases where the rainfall runoff process is complex

7908,study region yellow river basin china study focus the rainfall runoff modeling performance of data driven models ddm in the yellow river basin yrb at a large scale is unclear such that the ddm research in the yrb lacks essential reference which can be critical for model development research understanding the advantages and disadvantages of ddms by comparing them to process based models pbm helps model selection in practice especially when benchmarking is performed at large scales we benchmarked three ddms namely svm lstm and cnn lstm and a pbm namely the xinanjiang xaj model across 54 basins of the yrb factors affecting ddm performance are identified and the sensitivity of pbm to these factors is also discussed new hydrological insights for the region ddm performs the best in the upper reaches the worst in the middle reaches pbm demonstrates a wider applicability when calibration data is limited whereas ddm generally outperforms pbm for areas where data limitation is not a problem the most important catchment attribute affecting pbm and ddm is a high frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 however ddm is more vulnerable to this factor in addition ddm performance depends heavily on the introduced lagged streamflow when data is insufficient we conclude that the rainfall runoff modeling relationship in catchments with high drought frequencies is more complex resulting in ddm requiring more data but pbm is less affected by these factors indicating that pbm has better applicability in the case of limited data keywords rainfall runoff modeling benchmarking cnn lstm lstm xaj

in china it flows through arid semi arid and sub humid regions the yellow river nourishes 9 of china s population 107 million piao et al 2010 surface water is a critical natural resource for the yellow river basin yrb groundwater resources account for only 10 3 of the total water resources in yrb indicating the importance of surface water numerous dams and reservoirs have been built in the yrb for water resource management since the 21st century rainfall runoff modeling concerns estimating the future streamflow based on the available observations beven 2011 it helps decision making related to flood protection water resource planning and mitigation of pollution transforming rainfall to runoff is an extraordinarily complex process and cannot be well expressed in mathematical forms flury et al 1994 zehe and flühler 2001 weiler and naef 2003 kim et al 2006 blume et al 2009 the traditional methods process based models pbm have structures that are predefined by prior knowledge and have fewer degrees of freedom by contrast data driven models ddm treat the catchments as black boxes models are calibrated based on the observations of historical climate and streamflow data for ddm the internal process of water movement is ignored beven 2011 ddm has the flexibility to describe highly complex relationships while a predefined model structure often restricts pbm shen et al 2018 benchmarking rainfall runoff modeling is critical for hydrologic research uncertainty exists in all aspects of hydrologic simulations from data to model structure and parameterization benchmarking a model across a large number of catchments helps model selections and future model developments lane et al 2019 in addition evaluating models across multiple watersheds reduces the randomness of the model evaluation however current large scale benchmarking focusing on ddm covers only a few areas harrigan et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 lane et al 2019 feng et al 2020 the rainfall runoff modeling performance of ddms in yrb at a large scale is still unclear deep learning based sequence modeling methods such as long short term memory lstm have recently been used in streamflow forecasting simulation kratzert et al 2018 feng et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 gauch et al 2021 lees et al 2021 rainfall runoff modeling typically deals with time series data including forcing and streamflow observations recurrent neural networks rumelhart et al 1986 including the lstm are neural networks with a typical structure that are suitable for processing sequential data rnn s mechanism of parameter sharing between different time steps makes it suitable for rainfall runoff modeling since some storage effects such as the soil moisture content and snow accumulation need to be modeled in rainfall runoff modeling bergstroem 1975 martinec 1975 winstral and marks 2002 recurrent neural networks can also scale to much longer sequences than networks without sequence based specialization goodfellow et al 2016 deep learning models can learn complex nonlinear relationships from a large amount of data compared to pbm they are less prone to structural error shen et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 explored the performance of lstm on rainfall runoff modeling the model was trained at both regional scale and catchment scale across 241 catchments of the contiguous u s kratzert et al 2019a 2019b further built a regional lstm model by adding catchment specific attributes to the model inputs allowing the trained model to better respond to different watershed conditions kratzert et al 2019a 2019b also examined the ability of lstm to generalize from gauged basins to ungauged ones feng et al 2020 used recent streamflow observations to improve the modeling performance of lstm chadalawada et al 2020 and herath et al 2021 built a flexible modeling framework applying machine learning methods genetic programming to search the model space and infer suitable model configurations for conceptual hydrological models gauch et al 2021 recently proposed the multi time scale lstm that simultaneously simulates multiple timescales deep learning methods have also been used in uncertainty estimation for rainfall runoff modeling klotz et al 2021 the different aspects of pbm have been extensively studied by the hydrologic community but there are still many questions that need to be answered regarding ddm the applicability of ddm to large areas in yrb needs to be studied the main factors influencing the performance of ddm need to be identified the adaptability of ddm to

rainfall runoff modeling of three ddms namely svm lstm and cnn lstm and a pbm the xinanjiang xaj model across 54 catchments in the yrb the 54 catchments are selected out of 102 catchments of yrb without large dams or reservoirs built in hao et al 2021 based on the well known grand dataset lehner et al 2011 this research centers around three core aspects regarding ddms large scale benchmarking in yrb dependence on calibration data and the impacts of different catchment attributes on the model performance the xaj model is also benchmarked across the same 54 catchments to provide a comparison such that the different aspects of ddms can be better understood as a side problem we investigate how cnn can help improve the performance of lstm in rainfall runoff modeling especially in cases with limited data since the average length of data used in this study is less than 6 years research on the application of convolutional neural networks in the field of hydrological modeling is scarce although time series data such as 1 d grid data are particularly suitable for convolutional neural networks to process feng et al 2020 applied convolutional neural networks for extracting features from streamflow and then fed the extracted features to lstm together with the meteorological input feng et al 2020 concluded that convolutional networks could reduce the overfitting problem of lstm however it remains to be answered whether the same overfitting effect can be alleviated by simplifying the lstm and whether cnn can effectively extract features from climate variables in addition to lagged streamflow we discuss these issues through experiments on the yrb data and camels u s dataset addor et al 2017 specifically we demonstrate the following 1 cnn significantly improves the modeling performance given limited data even with only one convolutional layer however the same effect cannot be achieved by reducing the hidden unit dimension of the lstm 2 within a specific range stacking convolutional layers improves rainfall runoff modeling but further increases the number of convolutional layers will not yield much 3 adding pooling layers is not as good as replacing the pooling layer with convolutional layers suggesting that the permutation invariant mechanism of convolutional networks does not benefit rainfall runoff modeling the main findings and contributions of this research can be summarized as follows 1 ddms have the best performance in the upper reaches of yrb while modeling in the middle reaches is challenging part of the lower reaches catchments can have good simulation results 2 cnn only works when the calibration data is limited experiments on some of the catchments of yrb it doesn t help when the data is abundant experiments on the camels data set 3 xaj generally performs better than cnn lstm when calibration data is limited though introducing cnn can help alleviate the overfitting problem of lstm 4 given enough calibration data cnn lstm generally outperforms xaj 5 relationships between the modeling performance and more than 120 catchment attributes are quantified based on the recently proposed ccam dataset hao et al 2021 both cnn lstm and xaj are affected by a high frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 but not the streamflow normalized by catchment area however cnn lstm suffers more indicating that pbm has a wider applicability in practice 6 the performance of ddms heavily relies on the introduced lagged streamflow input which can partly explain why lstm and cnn lstm do not perform well in catchments with high frequency of dry days in which cases the streamflow autocorrelation is weak we conclude that the performance of ddm is highly dependent on the introduced lagged streamflow input when the calibration data is limited for basins with a high frequency of dry days learning the rainfall runoff relationships can be more complex and requires more data however pbm performance is less affected by these factors to understand this phenomenon we decompose the rainfall runoff modeling for both pbm and ddm into two parts namely physical priors general laws and regional adaptation adapt to different catchments given enough data ddm learns better regional adaptation relationships than pbm however given pbm is less affected by the data volume and the catchment attributes due to the built in physical priors pbm has wider applicability in practice in section 2 we introduce the dataset used in this research namely the ccam and the camels dataset the camels dataset is used only for evaluating the cnn lstm performance given enough data in section 3 we introduce the ddm modeling methods namely the lstm and the cnn lstm the cnn lstm model introduces convolutional filters to improve the performance of lstm in addition two neural network interpretation methods deeplift and integrated gradients are used to assess ddms dependence on the introduced lagged streamflow input in section 4 we present the results and findings in section 5 we present the summary of this research 2 dataset 2 1 ccam and hydromlyr the catchments attributes and the daily climatic time series of yrb came from the hydromlyr hydrology machine learning in yellow river dataset which is included in the ccam china catchment attributes and meteorology hao et al 2021 dataset the daily streamflow observations were obtained from the yellow river conservancy committee http www yrcc gov cn though this research benchmarks daily rainfall runoff modeling hydromlyr contains weekly normalized streamflow for 102 yrb catchments from 2000 to 2020 among which 54 catchments were selected with no large dams or reservoirs built within the catchment boundary based on the well known grand dataset lehner et al 2011 these 54 catchments are studied in this research however most of the yrb catchments are affected by human activities these basins are no exception irrigation small reservoirs dams table 1 describes the daily meteorological variables forming the ddm model inputs the length of the streamflow records ranges from 3 to 20 years 2000 2000 with an average length of around 2000 days 5 4 years compared with many existing rainfall runoff modeling studies of yrb tang et al 2008 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2018 xu et al 2022 which either used outdated data prior to 2000 or had low temporal resolution monthly quarterly this research better reflect the recent performance of rainfall runoff modeling in yrb and explore modeling with higher temporal resolution daily compared to the camels data set the yrb streamflow record is relatively short therefore we utilized k fold cross validation strategy refaeilzadeh et al 2009 for the fairness of evaluation for a given catchment the default length of validation is one fifth of the total length however the length of each validation fold has a maximum of 1000 days to retain more training data and has a minimum of 365 days ensure at least one year is used for each validation 2 2 camels the camels u s addor et al 2017 dataset is used to examine the effectiveness of introducing cnn to the lstm rainfall runoff modeling given enough calibration data the camels u s dataset contains approximately 30 year catchment aggregated meteorological forcing data and daily streamflow observations starting for 671 catchments for the experiments on the camels dataset we adopted the same train test set split as kratzert et al 2019a 2019b i e the first half for calibration and the remaining half for testing kratzert et al 2019a 2019b benchmarked lstm across 531 basins selected from 671 basins in the camels dataset and we adopted the same procedure 3 method 3 1 lstm gated recurrent neural networks are perhaps the most effective models for sequence modeling tasks and the long short term memory network lstm is a type of gated rnn traditional rnns suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients the gate mechanism of lstm has two main effects 1 prevent gradient explosion and vanishing problems and 2 the network learns when to forget old information if it is no longer helpful each block of an lstm network has the same inputs and outputs as the ordinary rnns the difference is that lstm introduces a gate mechanism to control the information flow inside the block a component of lstm the state unit s i t for time step t and cell i has a self loop to update itself however the self loop weight is controlled by the forget gate unit f i t which sets the weight to a value between 0 and 1 through a sigmoid unit 1 f i t σ b i f j u i j f x j t j w i j f h j t 1 where x t is the input vector for the time step t h t is the hidden state vector containing outputs from all lstm cells and b f u f and w f are biases input weights and recurrent weights of the forget gates respectively the update formula of the state unit is as follows 2 s i t f i t s i t 1 g i t σ b i j u i j f x j t j w i j f h j t 1 the computation of the input gate g i t is similar to that of the forget gate but with its own parameters 3 g i t σ b i g j u i j f x j t j w i j f h j t 1 the lstm outputs can be shut off by the output gate q i t which is computed as follows 4 h i t tanh s i t q i t 5 q i t σ b i o j u i j f x j t j w i j f h j t 1 where parameters b u and w are biases input weights and recurrent weights for the output gate respectively 3 2 cnn lstm convolutional networks have been successful in practical applications lecun et al 2015 but the hydrology community has underestimated their use in hydrological modeling convolutional neural networks cnns lecun et al 1989 are a family of neural networks for processing data with grid like topology time series data such as forcing observations are a typical type of 1 d grid three essential ideas behind convolutional neural networks are sparse interactions parameter sharing and equivariant representations goodfellow et al 2016 sparse interaction means that every output unit of a convolutional layer interacts with only a few input units this feature enforces a convolutional filter to extract meaningful local features from inputs effectively parameter sharing refers to the same parameters being used more than once in the network while in the traditional neural network a weight is used only once in computing an output in a convolutional neural net each weight of a kernel is used at every portion of the inputs except for points at boundaries parameter sharing significantly reduces the storage requirement for parameters and enforces the kernels to learn meaningful features that share the entire training data in terms of time series data the third property equivariant representations enables the same feature to be extracted from the convolution when we shift the inputs in time convolutional neural networks cnns employ a mathematical operation called cross correlation which is the same as convolution a mathematical function but without flipping the kernel 6 s i j i k i j m n i i m j n k m n where i is the two dimensional input and k is the two dimensional convolution filter many machine learning libraries implement cross correlation but call it convolution paszke et al 2019 convolutional neural networks are excellent for identifying various salient patterns in the input signals specifically lower convolutional layers obtain the local salience of the input signals while higher layers obtain a high level representation of the learned patterns assuming the current time step is t the inputs to the cnn lstm model are the forcing measurements all types of variables from time step t l to t and the lagged streamflow observations from t l a to t a are optionally concatenated with forcing where l is the sequence length and a is the lag time the input sequence first goes through one or several 1 d convolutional filters the extracted features are then fed into an lstm network due to padding the extracted features from convolutional layers have the same length as the original input but the number of convolutional filters replaces the number of input variables when using lstm alone the input features can be simplified if the number of convolutional filters is less than the number of input channels and the input features may also become more complicated when the number of convolutional filters exceeds the number of input channels 3 3 evaluation metrics the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used as the evaluation metrics like kratzert et al 2018 and feng et al 2020 the nse is used to benchmark ddms for comparison with other research the kge is used to compare pbm and ddm since kge has the advantage of being insensitive to streamflow seasonality kge can be decomposed into correlation r bias β and a measure of relative variability α in the simulated and observed values 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 with α σ s σ o β μ s μ o where the quantity α is a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β is the bias normalized by the standard deviation of the observations value of one is desirable for both α and β 3 4 interpretation method we deployed two neural network interrogative algorithms integrated gradients sundararajan et al 2017 and deeplift shrikumar et al 2017 to assess the attributions contributions of input variables climatic and lagged streamflow input to the simulated streamflow the focus is to understand the dependence of the simulated streamflow on different input variables therefore the attribution values of each input variable at all time steps are averaged to obtain the overall assessment of each input variable denote the function for simulating a single time step as f r n r x r n is the input and x r n is the baseline a zero matrix integrated gradients sundararajan et al 2017 calculate the integral of gradients of a neuron to the input along the path from a given baseline to the input that is the attribution of each input to the output is calculated by observing the changes of output when input shifts from a baseline to the actual value 15 integratedgrads i approx x x i x i m k 1 m f x x i x x k m x x where x i is the i th input a scalar m is the number of steps used to approximate the integral we set m 20 based on the author s recommendation sundararajan et al 2017 similar to integrated gradients deeplift shrikumar et al 2017 can be applied to any model representing a differentiable function deeplift has the advantage that it does not need to specify the number of steps for approximating the gradient integral and such that it is more efficient deeplift is proposed to approximate integrated gradients 16 m δ x δ t c δ x δ t δ x where x is the input neuron with a difference δ x from the baseline and t is the target neuron with a difference δ t from the baseline c is the contribution of δ x to δ t 4 results and discussions in this section we first present the benchmarking results of ddms focusing on exploring how cnn helps improve the performance of lstm in rainfall runoff modeling given limited amount of calibration data next we present the xaj benchmarking result based on the benchmarking results of xaj and cnn lstm we discuss two central problems regarding ddm 1 the dependence of ddm and pbm on the calibration data respectively 2 what are the key catchment attributes that affect the streamflow simulation of ddm and whether they have the same impact on pbm finally based on the results of the attribution analysis using deeplift and integrated gradients we demonstrate that ddm performance is highly dependent on the lagged streamflow input which can partly explain why ddm does not perform well in basins with high drought frequencies 1 mm d 1 the cnn lstm model configuration used throughout the discussion is the cnn lstm model with one day lagged streamflow and optimized number of convolutional layers ranging from 1 to 3 for each catchment 4 1 ddm performance in yrb the numerical benchmarking results of ddm can be found in table 2 the cumulative frequencies of the catchment specific nse can be found in fig 1 a key results can be summarized as follows svm produced large negative nse for some of the yrb basins resulting in a non representative average of nses null value in table 2 indicating that the rainfall runoff relationships in some catchments are too complicated for svm to capture adding lagged streamflow to the input significantly improves the ddm streamflow simulation even if the delay is up to 7 days fig 1 a however when the time delay of streamflow input reaches 30 days it no longer benefits the simulated streamflow cnn lstm performs the best among the benchmarked ddms fig 1 b using a convolutional neural network to extract features dramatically improves the rainfall runoff modeling performance of lstm given limited data compared with the volume and spread of the streamflow the timing and shape are easier to capture which is supported by the high correlation coefficient of the simulated streamflow ddms tend to underestimate the variability of streamflow which is the result of using mse nse as the objective function gupta et al 2009 the spatial distribution of nse for cnn lstm is shown in fig 2 the averaged nse in the upper reaches of yrb is 0 93 most of the downstream basins have nse greater than 0 6 however cnn lstm which performs best among the ddms still achieved low nse in the middle reaches in sections 4 3 4 5 based on the results of benchmarking xaj model across the same 54 catchments we discuss the potential reasons for the incompetent of ddms in the middle reaches of yrb through exploring the relationships between the performance distribution of ddm and different catchment attributes 4 2 the role of convolutional networks 4 2 1 overfitting introducing convolution to extract features from input significantly improves the streamflow simulation performance of lstm table 2 in yrb note that the number of convolutional filters 4 is less than the number of original input variables 16 hence the information received by the lstm is simplified within a specific range overlaying convolutional layers improves rainfall runoff modeling of lstm fig 3 a we also found that reducing the dimensionality of lstm hidden units did not achieve the same effect in yrb fig 3 b we conclude that the required feature processing is relatively simple because a shallow convolutional neural network works best however adding pooling layers is not as good as replacing the pooling layers with convolutional ones fig 3 a reducing the hidden dimensions of lstm did not achieve the same effect as introducing convolutional layers this phenomenon can be understood from the theoretical perspective of neural networks the functions that the neural networks have to learn are complex rainfall runoff modeling it is required to find a complex model whose structure is well adjusted i e appropriately regularized rather than a simplified structure goodfellow et al 2016 which is incapable of capturing the complexities to further verify that the performance improvement brought by cnn is due to the alleviation of over fitting we conducted experiments on a larger dataset that is to verify if cnn lstm still performs better than lstm in cases with sufficient data if cnn lstm performed better than lstm it indicated that cnn improved the overall performance of lstm otherwise it indicated that the performance gain came from the efficient simplification of the input features the result fig 4 indicates that the performance improvement through introducing convolutional networks in yrb experiments is mainly due to the prevention of overfitting i e fitting the noise because when data is sufficient to train the lstm introducing cnn does not bring improvements fig 4 even increasing the number of convolutional filters cnn lstm cannot outperform lstm 4 2 2 different filters for different patterns to visualize cnn s processing of input features we utilize the method proposed by zeiler and fergus 2014 which was used to visualize the first two layers of convolutional networks in the original paper the visualization approach first generates some random noise as input then forwards the input and calculates the mean of the convolutional layers activations gradient ascent is then performed on the input to maximize the mean of the activations the resulting input is the most sensitive pattern for the considered filter through which we can inspect which input pattern the filter is most sensitive to the result fig 5 indicates that for different convolutional filters different methods of combining input features are learned since different filters are sensitive to different sets of column variables 4 3 xaj benchmarking table 3 compares the benchmarking numerical results of xaj and cnn lstm fig 6 a b presents the performance distributions the xaj model performs better than cnn lstm in terms of kge index but weaker than cnn lstm in terms of nse table 3 compared with nse kge has a more balanced evaluation of the model performance gupta et al 2009 so xaj is better than cnn lstm in terms of the overall performance considering that mse is used as the loss function the optimization objective of ddm is consistent with nse therefore compared with xaj cnn lstm can benefit more from the high seasonality of streamflow resulting in high nse value to understand the performance difference between ddm and pbm we decompose rainfall runoff modeling into two parts learning physical priors or general laws and regional adaptation fig 6 c both ddm and pbm need to perform well in these two parts to achieve good simulation pbm inherently has better physical priors but has less flexibility in regional adaptation for ddm general laws of rainfall runoff modeling need to be learned from data but due to the high flexibility pbm generally performs better than pbm given enough data from calibrating although the performance of xaj and cnn lstm are both affected by calibration data length cnn lstm suffers more fig 6 d due to the built in physical priors pbm is able to achieve acceptable performance given limited data 4 4 catchment attributes in this section we identify the most important catchment attributes that impact the performance of ddms and we discuss whether pbm is also affected by the same factors we demonstrate that among the many catchment attributes fig 7 the high frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 is the most influential attribute for simulation although the xaj model is also affected by the dry frequency cnn lstm suffers more fig 8 the performance of cnn lstm also depends on the autocorrelation of streamflow all catchment attribute data came from the hydromlyr dataset hao et al 2021 and the pearson correlation coefficient is used the middle reaches of yrb are dry accounting for 19 7 of the runoff production and 55 6 of the sedimentation catchments in this area are sandy a negative correlation 0 16 exists between the nse and the catchment sand content fig 7 a the upstream and downstream streamflow is large in amount and cnn lstm has high performance in these areas fig 7 b however the correlation between nse and the streamflow normalized by the catchment area is weak 0 02 fig 7 c the high nses in the upper basins are attributed to the high streamflow seasonality streamflow seasonality for each basin is calculated according to sankarasubramanian et al 2001 eq 7 of the original paper the last element being p q not q p correlation analysis indicates that the streamflow seasonality is positively 0 5 correlated with nse fig 7 d from a theoretical aspect nse can benefit from high streamflow seasonality because the observation mean is used as the baseline in the nse formulation gupta et al 2009 for basins with high streamflow seasonality a good baseline model is the calendar day model schaefli and gupta 2007 which uses the mean observed streamflow for each calendar day across different years for prediction cnn lstm still outperforms the calendar day baseline model by a large margin fig 7 e in general ddms perform better in basins with high streamflow autocorrelations fig 7 k for ddms high mean runoff does not guarantee the success of rainfall runoff modeling on a catchment but the low frequency of dry days does both nse 0 72 and kge 0 69 are highly negatively correlated with the frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 of the catchment fig 8 suggesting that an appropriate indicator of the modeling difficulty is the frequency of dry days rather than other catchment attributes indicating that the rainfall runoff modeling of catchments with little or no precipitation most of the time is more complex however xaj is less affected by the low frequency of rainfall therefore we conclude that pbm has wider applicability in practice 4 5 lagged streamflow the attribution analysis is performed on the evaluation set attributions are calculated for each simulated daily streamflow then the attributions are averaged for each variable results of variables of the same type are averaged e g maximum minimum and mean temperature then the median for each aggregated variable is calculated and normalized by the group deeplift and integrated gradients mean results table 4 indicates that cnn lstm heavily relies on variables with strong seasonality such as temperature and air pressure cnn lstm is not highly dependent on evapotranspiration which is contrary to common sense this partly explains why cnn lstm performed worse than xaj in watersheds with high frequency of dry days since the evapotranspiration input is not being used effectively deeplift and integrated gradients agree on most variables except ground temperature which may be caused by error of algorithm mechanisms for ddm the simulated streamflow is very dependent on the lagged streamflow the attribution analysis also indicates that the simulated streamflow in the middle reaches is the least sensitive to the lagged streamflow input fig 9 the middle reaches are characterized by drought and a high frequency of dry days the random runoff process results that ddm has less dependence on the historical streamflow in these areas taking all the above analysis together we conclude that the performance of ddm is highly dependent on the introduced lagged streamflow input when calibration data is limited ddm requires more calibration data to learn the mappings from rainfall to runoff compared to pbm given limited data for training ddm modeling relies mainly on the lagged streamflow however pbm is less affected by these factors 5 conclusion we benchmarked ddm and pbm across 54 yrb catchments with no large dams or reservoirs built in the spatial distribution of the ddm simulation performance in yrb is depicted we propose to use convolutional networks to learn efficient feature representations from 16 climatic and hydrologic input variables based on the ddm benchmarking results we discussed how a convolutional network improves the modeling performance of lstm when calibration data is limited through experiments on yrb data and camels dataset we conclude that the performance gain by introducing cnn mainly comes from alleviating the overfitting problem of lstm and the same effect cannot be achieved by reducing the hidden dimension of lstm comparing the benchmarking results of a pbm model namely xaj and based on the catchment attributes data in ccam dataset we identified the most important catchment attributes that impact the performance of ddm and if the same effect happens to xaj the result indicates that a high frequency of dry days 1 mm d 1 impacts the ddm simulation most while xaj is also affected by the same factor cnn lstm suffers more when calibration data is limited cnn lstm mainly relies on the introduced lagged streamflow input for rainfall runoff modeling while xaj has a wider applicability when training data is limited large scale benchmarking in the yellow river basin provides a reference for future rainfall runoff simulation studies in the yellow river basin in addition based on the results we believe that ddm needs to be combined with traditional models to reduce the need for calibration data volume especially in cases where the rainfall runoff process is complex

7909,study region the yellow river basin plays a crucial role in china s socio economic development and ecological security study focus the growing trend of water consumption driven by anthropogenic activities has posed an increasing number of challenges for the sustainable development of the yellow river basin water demand prediction plays a central part in facilitating water conservation by developing water allocation strategies hence the water demand prediction model based on the concept of water resources carrying capacity was built to predict water demand with different future scenarios and provide reference strategies for water allocation new hydrological insights for the region with all changing scenarios under consideration the future demand for water resources will significantly increase compared with the current conditions the range of water demand by each province along the yellow river basin is exhibited in this study two scenarios with different economic development conditions and cascading water use efficiency are investigated in addition solutions for improving water use efficiency and increasing the available quantity of water are put forward to ameliorate water stress specifically water distribution schemes with a medium level of water use efficiency in different economic growth scenarios are proposed based on the available water resources from the yellow river basin and the south to north water diversion project this work will benefit local planners and decision makers graphical abstract ga1 keywords water demand water resources carrying capacity yellow river water distribution scheme 1 introduction as the second longest river in china the yellow river has earned it the title of the country s mother river due to its contribution to chinese civilization bao et al 2019 the yellow river is of vital importance for china s human living and sustainable economic development li et al 2021 however with the rapid socio economic expansion beginning in the 1980s little attention had been given to the yrb s environmental protection resulting in river draught up in the lower reaches during the late 1990s omer et al 2020 wohlfart et al 2016 up to now the utilization rate of water resources over the yrb is as high as 80 far exceeding the internationally recognized safety threshold of 40 jia et al 2022 as a result water resources management of the yrb faces huge challenges for realizing the sustainable development under such circumstances rational water resources allocation becomes an urgent issue to be solved for the yrb with this in mind the state council enacted the water allocation plan of the yellow river in 1987 in which the yellow river s annual mean runoff and water supply capacity to all provinces are assumed to be 58 and 37 billion m3 respectively spc and mwrep 1987 over the past few decades the existing 1987 scheme has proved to be successful for relieving water supply contradiction among riparian provinces however the existing water allocation scheme can not effectively address the contradiction between socio economic development and ecological protection with the growing population and economy li et al 2021 moreover both the annual runoff and water use over the yrb have experienced great changes over the past three decades the existing 1987 scheme is exposed to new challenges and therefore needs to be adjusted qiao 2019 wang et al 2019b wang and zheng 2019d consequently china has put forward higher requirements for the water resources allocation and elevated the ecological protection and high quality development of the yrb to a major national strategy in 2019 the above challenges of water resources management in the yrb is actually very common in china accordingly a series of national policies have been promulgated to meet these challenges over the past decade among them the most important one is the so called the most stringent water resources management policy which was issued as part of the chinese government s central document no 1 on january 29 2011 three redlines were set to control the total water use quantity water use efficiency and water pollution for each major basin and each province subsequently the ministry of water resources began to explore the water resources carrying capacity wrcc by controlling water use quantity and efficiency as for the yellow river president xi pointed out that the scale of social economic development must be complemented with the wrcc of the yrb for ecological protection and high quality development as an important part of the high quality development strategy water resources of the yellow river basin should be allocated and utilized rationally and efficiently wang et al 2018 chen and jin 2019 yang et al 2020 zhao and yu 2020 specifically water distribution should be based on water demand prediction brown et al 2015 suggested that forecasting the future of water resources is the basis for implementing sustainable management science in response to global water challenges in the 21st century prediction based water demand management is the key in creating a reliable economic system gharabaghi et al 2019 maruyama and yamamoto 2019 proposed a water demand forecasting method in japan by using multiple regression based on water supply characteristics sanchez et al 2020 predicted urban water demand across two us states through a geographically weighted regression model informed by urban growth and climate change metrics gharabaghi et al 2019 created an integrated nonlinear daily water demand forecast model on the strength of climate change coupled with the seasonal and weekly trends in water demand guo et al 2020 proposed an improved whale optimization algorithm to forecast water demand by adopting historical water use data in agriculture industry residences and ecology however current models that predict water demand are limited in regional scale which also neglects future population change and economic growth a prediction model reflecting china s current water management policies and high quality development strategies is urgently needed under this background the innovation of this study is to develop a water demand prediction model considering the water resources carrying capacity to predict water demand prediction in 2030 during different water use and economic development scenarios meanwhile corresponding water allocation countermeasures against water demand for further socio economic development in nine provinces along yellow river are also provided on this basis we attempted to answer the following questions q1 by 2030 how much water is required by each of the nine provinces along the yellow river basin to maintain sustainable development of the region will water demand exceed the available water resources to support the population and economy in the region what economy scale can be supported by the available water resources in the yellow river basin q2 what s the influence of water use change to population and socio economic development what level of water use efficiency should we have for water utilization and how much water should be rationally allocated to meet the water demand target in 2030 this article comprises five parts part one is the introduction about the background and the overview of this research part two presents the study area part three introduces the methodology of the proposed framework and data sources part four presents the results of the computational experiments part five discussed the results and clarified the future uncertainty the last part summarized the conclusion of the study 2 study area the yellow river flows through nine provinces or municipalities in the north of china specifically it originated in qinghai passed through qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong and then flowed into the bohai sea fig 1 the yellow river brings up a large number of population with limited water resources to be specific with only 2 of china s total water resources the yellow river basin yrb is home to 15 of the nation s arable land and 9 of its population jia and liang 2020 omer et al 2020 the ratio of gross domestic product gdp of yrb to the entire china is approximately 13 2 in 2018 nowadays the severe water scarcity in the yellow river basin has impeded surrounding provinces development and aggravated the economic imbalances among regions for instance the per capita gdp of dongying city in shandong at river outlet is 10 times more than that of yushu prefecture in qinghai at river source xi 2019 meanwhile water scarcity of yellow river basin has become a major issue for regional sustainable development zhao and yu 2020 considering the existing water diversion schemes spc and mwrep 1987 and the data availability the provincial scale is adopted in this study the purpose of this study is to forecast the water resources utilization situation of nine provinces along the yellow river basin by adopting the concept of water resources carrying capacity into the different changing scenarios 3 methodology and materials 3 1 water resources carrying capacity wrcc model water resources carrying capacity first defined by shi and qu 1992 based on the situation of china has been adopted as chinese water resources management policy for many years subsequently wrcc theory has also been improved by different scholars to define the maximum population and economic size able to be carried in a region under the water resources available certain water use efficiency level and per capita welfare standard as well as certain urbanization without destruction of ecology environment li and gan 2000 feng 2000 wang 2001 xia and zhu 2002 jia et al 2004 wang et al 2004 2017 duan et al 2010 generally economic size can be calculated through per capita gdp representing per capita welfare standard times population scale hence the objective of wrcc is to determine the maximum population its mathematical expression can be described as follows objective function max p constraints 1 tw w d w p w e 2 w d

agriculture and industry and ecology respectively ur represents the degree of urbanization which is the proportion of the population living in urban areas q u and q r denote the per capita domestic water use in urban and rural areas respectively y a is per capita gross domestic product gdp q gdp is defined as water use per cny10 000 of gdp which represents water use efficiency w i and w a denote water use for industrial and agricultural respectively combing eqs 1 4 the maximum population can be deduced as follows 5 p tw w e ur q u 1 ur q r y a q gdp based on the definition of water resources carrying capacity water demand can be estimated by the inversion of eq 5 when population size is known the relationship between water demand and water resources carrying capacity is depicted in fig 2 3 2 water demand wd model 3 2 1 wd estimation for the historical period according to the official explanation total water use comprises water used for daily life production and ecology mwr 2019 in the

wd forecasting for the future according to the national plan for population development it is expected that china s population will reach its peak in 2030 sc 2016 under this background water use would reach a high level in the same year in line with the national comprehensive planning of water resources which was approved by the state council in 2011 jiao 2011 therefore water demand for each province along the yellow river basin of 2030 would be studied and 2019 was selected as the reference year differ from the wd estimation for the historical period the calculations of water use per cny10 000 of gdp y a and the per capita gdp growth q gdp in the wd prediction model are expressed as follows 7 y a 2030 y a 2019 1 gr 11 8 q gdp 2030 q gdp 2019 1 dr 9 w e 2030 w e 2019 twrd 2030 twrd

using 2019 s data twrd 2030 is water use red line also called the upper limit of water use in 2030 twrd 2019 represents actual ecological water use in 2019 and w e 2019 denotes actual ecological water

the new water supply equals to water use red line in 2030 from the most stringent water resources management system general office of the state council gosc 2013 minus actual water use quantity in 2019 3 3 model performance evaluation through the above wrcc and wd models the estimates should be approximately equal to the actual values that is the estimated population should be roughly the same as the actual population and the estimated water demand should be remarkably close to the actual water use quantity in order to verify the accuracy and feasibility of proposed models several conventional statistical indicators are adopted to assess model performance specifically mean absolute percentage error mape coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse are utilized in this study independent sample t test is also used to analyze the different cases of the estimated and actual values 10 mape 1 n i 1 n y i ˆ y i 1 11 r 2 1 i y i ˆ y i i y i y i 12 rmse 1 n 1 n y i y i ˆ 2 where y i represents actual water demand y i ˆ represents estimated water demand n is sample size y i is the mean of actual water demand among these statistical indicators low mape and rmse usually means the model is reliable high r 2 usually corresponds to high consistency between actual and estimated water demand in addition the significance level of t test is performed at 5 3 4 sobol global sensitivity analysis according to existing research it is generally believed that water use efficiency plays a critical role in the process of water use world water assessment programme wwap 2015 wang et al 2015b bao and zou 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 to support this viewpoint and to seek countermeasures against water demand further verification has been done sobol global sensitivity analysis a powerful method that is used to analyze time series to uncover significant changes characteristics sobol 1993 has been applied to different fields including hydrology liu et al 2019a 2019b engineering qian et al 2016 biology kontoravdi et al 2005 and other fields it is a method used to seek sensitivity factors or main impact indicators based on variance analysis it decomposes the total variance of model output into the sum of the sub variances contributed by each parameter and its interaction with the other parameters sobol 1993 the expression can be written as 13 i 1 n v i i 1 n 1 j i 1 n v ij v 1 n where v i denotes variance of parameter x i v i v ij v 1 n represent variances among parameters the variance of each parameter can be called direct contribution to the total variance which can be reflected by the first order sensitivity index s i similarly the second order and the high order sensitivity indexes between parameter x i and other parameters can be defined as an indirect contribution the expression is as follows 14 s i v i v s ij v ij v s 1 n v 1 n v then the sum of direct contribution and indirect contribution means total sensitivity indexes that is 15 s ti s i s ij s 1 n 3 5 materials and data processing in the wrcc model and wd model for the historical period the original data of p ur and y a are obtained from china statistical yearbook 2004 2019 and statistical bulletin of each province s national economic and social development besides q gdp the rest parameters are obtained from china water resources bulletin 2003 2019 it should be noted that q gdp is calculated by dividing the sum of industrial and agricultural water use by the gdp rather than employing official statistics from the china water resources bulletin directly this is because domestic and ecological water use are not included in the calculation of q gdp see eq 4 therefore the official statistics may obtain exaggerated results since the elements except for production water use are included in terms of 2030 data population p and degree of urbanization ur are derived from the planning of population and city development made by each province for 2030 q u and q r are determined by historical time series data specifically the mann kendall method hamed 2008 is used to detect the trend of time series data from 2013 to 2019 when it is a prominent downward or rise trend the predicted value is adopted through the artificial neural network backpropagation autoregressive method al zahrani and abo monasar 2015 if no obvious trend appears the mean value is selected annual growth rate gr and decreased rate dr are also derived from the historical trend these two parameters enable the simulation of possible water demand scenarios of each province w e is calculated on the basis of 40 of new water supply that comes from national comprehensive planning of water resources that have been launched to ensure a long term sustainable development jiao 2011 the new water supply equals to water use red line in 2030 from the most stringent water resources management system general office of the state council gosc 2013 minus actual water use quantity in 2019 4 results 4 1 accuracy of wrcc and wd models in order to validate the performance of wrcc model the estimated population of nine provinces from 2003 to 2019 is compared with the actual population mean absolute percentage error mape 1 36 indicates wrcc is a relatively reliable model the coefficient of determination r 2 0 99924 is close to 1 and the value of p 0 9401 in the t test is statistically significant at the 95 confidence level consequently wrcc model can be regarded as a suitable tool to estimate the population furthermore the performance of wd model is also demonstrated the actual water use from 2003 to 2019 is adopted as actual water demand to assess the accuracy of wd model the comparison results at different provinces are displayed in fig 3 there is a slight difference between observed and estimated water demand for these nine provinces the low rmse 0 4008 and high coefficient of determination r 2 0 9971 implies the wd model has a good performance analogously the value of p 0 8528 in the t test is also statistically significant at the 95 confidence level all these statistical indicators indicate the water demand model proposed in this study is reasonable to estimate water demand for the historical period and has potential to forecast for the future in addition to the overall evaluation the difference in the accuracy of estimated water demand are also province specific the good consistency is observed in ningxia and shanxi provinces in the entire validation period for qinghai sichuan gansu inner mongolia shaanxi and henan provinces the estimated water demand after 2012 is more accurate than before 2012 the worst performance of water demand estimation is obtained in shandong province with both overestimation and underestimation in validation period the difference in water demand prediction may be related to the inconsistency between actual water consumption and water use demand at these nine provinces in addition the accurate performance after 2012 may be related to more standard and high quality data are collected 4 2 water demand forecasting for 2030 4 2 1 scenario of steady reform and no major shock taking the per capita gdp growth in the last three years as a reference nbs 2017 2019 the annual per capita gdp growth rate is set from 3 to 8 with an increase step of 1 we set 40 as the baseline of the gross water use decreased rate according to the national comprehensive planning of water resources issued in 2010 which indicated that the water use per cny10 000 of gdp should decrease by 40 from 2020 to 2030 the official data shows that this rate fell by 24 between 2015 and 2019 national office of water conservation nowc 2020 which is averaged to 6 per year as a result the gross water use decreased rate between 2020 and 2030 is assumed to be around 66 so the decreased rate of the gross water use per cny10 000 of gdp also called the increased rate of water use efficiency is set from 40 to 70 with an decreased step of 5 by this means the conditions of water demand by each province under different scenarios are obtained fig 4 meanwhile the comparison of the total water use of the nine provinces with the 2030 water use quantity upper limit that set by the most stringent water resources system in 2013 which also known as the 2030 water use red line general office of the state council gosc 2013 is displayed in fig 4 the water demand situation of each province under the scenarios with increased per capita gdp growth rate and decreased water use per cny10 000 of gdp rate are shown in fig 4 from fig 4 we can easily determine whether the water demand situation is beyond the 2030 water use red line specifically besides qinghai the water demand of the other eight provinces have exceeded their respective upper limits the differences among these provinces can be affected by several factors such as economic development status technological level and environmental conditions meanwhile we can also infer that the increased per capita gdp growth rate promotes the utilization of water the decrease of water use per cny10 000 of gdp rate has ability to offset this influence to ensure the water demand is below the red line it seems that the decrease of water use per cny10 000 of gdp is more sensitive to the increase of per capita gdp growth considering the different economic development conditions and cascading water use efficiency of these nine provinces the actual water demand situation of each province will be analyzed in detail so as to better match with the actual development trend 4 2 2 scenario of actual economic development and water use efficiency since the economic development and water use efficiency are different from each other for these nine provinces it s necessary to testify the actual economic development and water use scenario specifically the increase of per capita gdp growth rate and the decrease of water use per cny10 000 of gdp rate in 2030 are estimated through historical time series data the ceiling of each province s annual per capita gdp growth rate is determined by the average value in the last three years meanwhile the decelerating trend of economic growth rate is also considered world bank and drcsc 2010 moderate economic growth is defined when the gdp growth rate declines by one percentage point while two percentage points falling is known as low economic growth based on the historical trend and the average percentage increase of water use efficiency in china in the last ten years combining with the experience from the developed countries where the water use efficiency growth rate increases gradually the percentage decline of the upper limit of water use per cny10 000 of gdp of every province can be determined following the principle of proximity the average annual value from 2009 to 2019 should be used to determine the upper limit of each province as mentioned above 40 is the bottom limit of each province s water use efficiency growth rate jiao 2011 the estimated water demand by each of the nine provinces along the yellow river basin is presented in tables a1 a9 of the supplementary information si with cascading levels of water use efficiency growth rate and the high medium and low levels of per capita gdp growth rate further the range of province level water demand in 2030 is calculated through the wd model see si table b1 fig 5 presents the predicted water demand of the nine provinces under the high medium and low economic growth conditions and different water use efficiency levels it shows that apart from gansu province the water demand in different economic growth conditions across the other eight provinces is likely to exceed the current water use quantity the estimated maximum water demand of each province exceeds the 2030 water use red line excluding qinghai inner mongolia shanxi and shandong even at a moderate water use efficiency level water demand in henan province and inner mongolia with high economic growth scenario is still slightly over the water use red line overall future water demand will exhibit an increasing trend according to our forecast 4 3 the rule of water supply and water use efficiency 4 3 1 the available water resources in the yellow river basin according to research statistics the runoff reduction of the yellow river basin is obvious wang et al 2019 the average annual runoff of the yellow river basin was 58 billion m3 from 1919 to 1975 53 48 billion m3 from 1956 to 2000 and 48 24 billion m3 from 1956 to 2010 xue et al 2013 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2015a projected the runoff from 2021 to 2050 would decrease by 0 53 9 67 compared to the decreased rate between 1991 and 2010 with a peak of 13 26 during 2021 2030 yuan et al 2016 reported that the future runoff might increase by 14 4 16 8 but it is still below the average value occurred between 1961 and 1985 the comprehensive plan for the yellow river basin depicted that the surface river runoff in the yellow river basin is expected to reduce to 51 48 billion m3 by 2030 yellow river conservancy committee of ministry of water resources yrcc 2013 afterward the average annual runoff range was adjusted to be between 48 2 and 53 48 billion m3 jia and liang 2020 in brief the situation of water scarcity in the yellow river basin is grim zuo 2019 so far the predicted annual runoff of the yellow river basin would be 48 2 51 48 billion m3 in 2030 this minus the estimated ecological water use of 8 12 billion m3 jia and liang 2020 the available water resources for use in the yellow river basin would be approximately 36 2 43 48 billion m3 in 2030 moreover before the opening of the first stage of the west route of the south to north water diversion project it is estimated that the available surface water quantity in the yellow river basin would not exceed 40 176 billion m3 yellow river conservancy committee of ministry of water resources yrcc 2013 wang 2015c presumed that the available surface water quantity would not be more than 46 846 billion m3 by 2030 even after the south to north water diversion project was put into use so the range of the total available water quantity for human use is further adjusted to 36 2 46 846 billion m3 4 3 2 the water use quantity of the yellow river basin fig 6 presents the trend in water use of each province between 2003 and 2019 with significant growth in urbanization population and per capita gdp some locations exhibit a dramatic increase or decrease between years such as the situation between 2008 and 2009 in qinghai between 2003 and 2005 in ningxia between 2009 and 2011 in shanxi and between 2005 and 2006 in shandong in general qinghai gansu and shandong show a striking downward trend while sichuan inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi and henan present a slow upward trend even so the total volume of water supporting regional growth has not seen a substantial increase therefore from the perspective of water resources utilization the wrcc model is adopted to analyze how water use change supports population and socio economic development water use change includes fluctuation of water use quantity and variation of water use efficiency as mentioned above with the rapid growth in urbanization population and per capita gdp there is no considerable increase in each province s total water use quantity from 2003 to 2019 here we focus on the respective influence of water use quantity and water use efficiency on water resource carrying capacity by adopting the sobol global sensitivity analysis method the sensitivity indexes of water use quantity and efficiency are obtained and presented in table 1 it is revealed that water use efficiency has a greater impact on water resources carrying capacity than water use quantity hence water use efficiency is a major driver of temporal variation in water utilization the improvement in water use efficiency which fueled a downward trend of total water use is critical for socio economic development by limited water resources to a large extent 4 4 countermeasures against water demand for 2030 4 4 1 enhance water use efficiency the results obtained from the sobol global sensitivity analysis indicate that water use efficiency plays a key role in water use change assuming the water use for all consumption of each province at 2030 equals to the water use quantity in 2019 the increase rate of water use efficiency to satisfy the water resources carrying capacity at high medium and low levels of economic growth are showing in table 2 according to the above analysis the predicted water demand by the planned population and urbanization will be greater than the current hence table 2 shows a higher increase rate of water use efficiency under three economic growth scenarios additionally fig 4 and fig 5 also exhibit the rate of water use efficiency should be increased under different per capita gdp growth conditions in particular fig 5 is more pertinently displaying the most possible development scenarios of each province in 2030 as a consequence the increase of water use efficiency is a relative flexible way to improve water resources carrying capacity 4 4 2 increase available water resources based on the analysis described above not all provinces can meet the corresponding water use efficiency under the circumstances that the per capita gdp keeps growing while the water use quantity remains unchanged valid and dependable water demand forecasting is a major element of effective and sustainable development zubaidi et al 2018 hence seeking an appropriate and realistic solution where water use efficiency can be integrated into projected economic growth scenarios is necessary here we choose the mean value of the upper and lower limits as the water use efficiency the demand for water in each province is calculated under high medium and low economic growth situations respectively with regard to water use quantity increase there are several ways to increase the available water quantity which can be adopted by the following order first priorities have been given to water supply from the south to north water diversion project where 3 769 billion m3 of water and 3 734 billion m3 of water are distributed to henan and shandong respectively yellow river conservancy committee of ministry of water resources yrcc 2013 jia and liang 2020 liu et al 2020 the second is average water use of 39 billion m3 mwr 2003 2019 from the yellow river basin over the years the third is the maximum available water resources of 46 846 billion m3 in the yellow river basin should be taken into consideration what is noteworthy is that the 46 846 billion m3 of water includes the multi year average water use volumes of 39 billion m3 the distribution of the available water resources from the yellow river basin to the nine provinces is classified into two categories one is the water deficit all come from the further development of the yellow river basin and the other is to distribute water resources in accordance with the proportion of water supply to each province in previous years to be specific we assume that the water deficit of all provinces comes from the yellow river basin when comparing with the water use quantity of 2019 the maximum available water resources of 46 846 billion m3 in the yellow river basin minus 39 billion m3 plus the 3 769 billion m3 of water to henan province and 3 734 billion m3 of water to shandong province through the south to north water diversion project equals to 15 349 billion m3 that is less than the 25 44 billion m3 at a high economic growth level see si table b2 it illustrates that the total available water resources from the south to north water diversion project and the yellow river basin cannot meet development needs when in a medium economic growth scenario 15 349 billion m3 of water is slightly more than the water deficit of 15 11 billion m3 see si table b2 indicating the total available water resources from the south to north water diversion project and the yellow river basin can satisfy the requirements of development likewise water demand at a low economic growth pattern also can be met in other words in the range of 36 2 46 846 billion m3 when the available water resources of the yellow river basin is greater than 37 billion m3 it can meet the water demand for low economic growth and when greater than 46 billion m3 the water demand for medium economic growth can be satisfied however the minimum available water resources of 36 2 billion m3 minus 39 billion m3 plus the 3 769 billion m3 and 3 734 billion m3 from south to north water diversion project is 4 703 billion m3 which is less than the water deficit of 5 69 billion m3 in the low economic growth scenario it means neither low water demand nor water demand under medium economic growth and high economic growth scenarios cannot be met to sum up in comparison with the current situation the water use strategies of yellow river basin still needs to be further developed so as to meet the needs of the medium and low economic growth the specific water allocation plan is illustrated in table 3 where the numbers are calculated by the water deficit see si table b2 plus the current water use quantity from the yellow river basin for each province in terms of the water supply of the yellow river basin to each province the water use proportion of each province from 2013 to 2018 was barely changed so the average proportion during the period 2013 2018 was selected as the 2030 water demand proportion of the yellow river basin thereby the water demand of each province under three economic growth scenarios is calculated see si table b3 as mentioned above we give priority to the distribution of water transmitted through the south to north water diversion project taking such volume out of the total water demand of 47 39 billion m3 see si table b3 the water demand of 39 89 billion m3 see table 4 is less than the maximum 46 846 billion m3 and the remaining water can be redistributed under this situation the available water resources from the yellow river basin can still meet the need for socio economic development when all provinces are at a high economic growth level the detailed water use distribution scheme of the yellow river basin in three economic growth scenarios is shown in table 4 the total water use quantity from the yellow river basin for the nine provinces is 33 52 billion m3 see table 4 which is less than the minimum available water resources of the yellow river basin with 36 2 billion m3 indicating the water demand at low economic growth level is easily satisfied 5 discussion 5 1 hypotheses of the water demand model the precondition of the water demand forecast is that the planned population and urbanization can be realized and the social economic growth is steady differences may exist between the anticipated and the actual population and urbanization but they should be small ones for the following reasons the official planning issued by the nine provinces is accurate and reliable as they are integrated with local development trends and conditions in the course of future development local authorities will formulate policies to facilitate the implementation of planning objectives therefore forecasting water demand through the estimated per capita gdp and water use efficiency is a reliable method as to the solutions of increasing water use quantity two scenarios were investigated one is that water deficits would all come from the yellow river basin the other is that water allocation proportion for each province would remain unchanged telling from the historical trend between 2013 and 2018 however it is unknown how much water in the yellow river basin will be available for use by 2030 and it is unlikely to predict whether the water allocation proportion for every province would change consequently uncertainties exist in the distribution schemes in table 3 and table 4 moreover attention should be paid to analyze the maximum and the minimum available water resources in water allocation planning however the minimum available water resources can merely ensure that the water to each province would be supplied with the current distribution proportion under a low economic growth pattern although some uncertainties and assumptions are existed in this work this study has covered all possible scenarios making it a convincing and valuable work 5 2 accessibility and uncertainty of water use efficiency it is well known that there is a large gap between china and the developed countries in terms of the water use efficiency in order to better understand the situation we compared the estimated water use per cny10 000 of the gdp of china in 2030 with the mean value of the developed countries in the past years according to incomplete statistics the average water use per cny10 000 of gdp in developed countries went down from 24 43 m3 in 2015 18 63 m3 in 2018 however the predicted mean value of the nine provinces would be 24 40 m3 in 2030 in the context of high decreased proportion and even much more water would be required in order to generate cny10 000 of gdp under the circumstances of moderate and low decreased percentage respectively generally the range of water use of the nine provinces would vary roughly from 11 m3 to 80 m3 at the most likely medium level in 2030 however this value of most developed countries is below 30 m3 except for greece see si table c1 that means china would still fall behind the developed countries in water use per cny10 000 of gdp in 2030 by comparing the water use efficiency between the developed counties and the water use efficiency trend between the nine provinces the scenarios with the high medium and low levels of economic growth can be verified the predicted water demand under the medium level scenario may be lower than the actual situation one possibility is that during the 11 years apart from shanxi the water use efficiency increase rate of the other provinces is around 60 which is slightly higher than the above determined medium level thus uncertainty is also included in water use efficiency to predict the future development trend 5 3 water use versus water consumption the quantity of water use that recorded in the documents of china including china water resources bulletin provincial water resources bulletin and 2030 water use red line is equivalent to water demand rather than water consumption water consumption refers to the part that cannot be returned to surface water bodies and underground aquifers by means of transpiration evaporation soil absorption consumption of residents and livestock in the process of water transmission and water use mwr 2019 it can be summarized as the broad water use quantity of water demand and narrow water use of water consumption also called net water use quantity both identical essentially with some variations in values the water consumption rate is calculated by dividing the amount of water consumption by the gross water use in 2019 the national water consumption rate was 53 2 indicating that almost half of the amount of water use was lost mwr 2019 in contrast the water consumption rate of the yellow river basin is approximately 80 that means 80 of the water cannot be returned to the source after withdrawn yrcc 2003 2018 concerning water consumption rate the actual water consumption is less than the actual water demand it means that when the water deficit all comes from the further development of the yellow river basin according to the current speed of technological improvement and socio economic development the estimated water consumption in the future will not exceed the available water resources of the yellow river basin forecasts presented in this study broad water use quantity of water demand was adopted not net water use quantity in this sense the predicted water demand in this study may be overestimated this would have a more practical meaning because water demand forecasting should take into account the possible water loss during the utilization process 5 4 water redistribution over the yellow river basin in the matter of water use the predicted total water use of the nine provinces under the upper limit of water use efficiency decline and the high economic growth pattern is 128 35 billion m3 see si table a10 which is slightly more than the current condition of 127 billion m3 mwr 2019 over the past decade with the rapid urbanization and economic and population development the growth of water amount required by the nine provinces in the yellow river basin has slowed down with only approximately 4 9 billion m3 of water increased mwr 2003 2019 whereas when the mean value of the upper and lower limits of water use efficiency is most likely to be attained the total demand for water from the yellow river basin is 39 89 billion m3 in the high economic growth model as showed in table 3 which is quite close to the average annual water use of 39 billion m3 mwr 2003 2019 with identical efficiency the total water demand under medium and low economic growth patterns are both less than 39 billion m3 taking 39 billion m3 as a basic reference then the remaining 2 45 and 5 48 billion m3 can be allocated again under medium and low economic growth patterns this portion of water can be used either to release the water stress in the provinces that are with high pressure on water abstraction but are drawing a small amount of water from the yellow river basin e g sichuan and shaanxi or to mitigate arid conditions of the border provinces e g gansu qinghai and inner mongolia thereby supporting regional ecological protection and economical construction and facilitating food safety and national defense security jia and liang 2020 6 conclusion the water demand wd prediction model based on water resources carrying capacity wrcc can be applied to calculate the amount of water for domestic production and ecological use this study focus on the available water resources in the yellow river basin the gross water demand in 2030 by the nine provinces along the yellow river basin and the water allocation plans the water demand under different scenarios is presented for all provinces along the yellow river basin through the wd model the scenarios are all determined through the long term trend analysis incorporated with the possible economic development at high medium and low levels in order to meet water resources requirements by every economic growth scenario two solutions are proposed without breaking through the available water volumes of the yellow river basin the first is improving water use efficiency when the water demand of each province is unchanged compared with 2019 the increase proportions of water use efficiency in 2030 with three levels of economic growth are suggested the second is increasing available water resources the specific water allocation schemes combined with the available water resources of the yellow river and from the south to north water diversion project are given based on our knowledge and experience particularly the estimation under medium level water use efficiency is considered conservative which should be close to future water demand in addition the predicted water demand may be higher than the actual for the reasons that 1 differences exist between water use and water consumption which is elaborated in section 5 2 water use efficiency may be underestimated however in general the water allocation plans proposed in this study can satisfy the need for development with the rapid economic development and the acceleration of urbanization and population growth there occurs an increasing water demand in these regions along the yellow river the prediction on water demand can facilitate the arrangement of water supply plans to avoid the unsustainable development caused by water scarcity and the water crisis nevertheless the simulated scenarios are not considered to the definitive the prediction in this study is to forecast the future water demand under the circumstances where water use efficiency and economic growth are rational thereby offering a reference for managing water demand sustainably this study is not intended to confine local planners and policymakers to the estimated scenarios but to foresee reasonable possibilities that may arise in the future and provide an

7909,study region the yellow river basin plays a crucial role in china s socio economic development and ecological security study focus the growing trend of water consumption driven by anthropogenic activities has posed an increasing number of challenges for the sustainable development of the yellow river basin water demand prediction plays a central part in facilitating water conservation by developing water allocation strategies hence the water demand prediction model based on the concept of water resources carrying capacity was built to predict water demand with different future scenarios and provide reference strategies for water allocation new hydrological insights for the region with all changing scenarios under consideration the future demand for water resources will significantly increase compared with the current conditions the range of water demand by each province along the yellow river basin is exhibited in this study two scenarios with different economic development conditions and cascading water use efficiency are investigated in addition solutions for improving water use efficiency and increasing the available quantity of water are put forward to ameliorate water stress specifically water distribution schemes with a medium level of water use efficiency in different economic growth scenarios are proposed based on the available water resources from the yellow river basin and the south to north water diversion project this work will benefit local planners and decision makers graphical abstract ga1 keywords water demand water resources carrying capacity yellow river water distribution scheme 1 introduction as the second longest river in china the yellow river has earned it the title of the country s mother river due to its contribution to chinese civilization bao et al 2019 the yellow river is of vital importance for china s human living and sustainable economic development li et al 2021 however with the rapid socio economic expansion beginning in the 1980s little attention had been given to the yrb s environmental protection resulting in river draught up in the lower reaches during the late 1990s omer et al 2020 wohlfart et al 2016 up to now the utilization rate of water resources over the yrb is as high as 80 far exceeding the internationally recognized safety threshold of 40 jia et al 2022 as a result water resources management of the yrb faces huge challenges for realizing the sustainable development under such circumstances rational water resources allocation becomes an urgent issue to be solved for the yrb with this in mind the state council enacted the water allocation plan of the yellow river in 1987 in which the yellow river s annual mean runoff and water supply capacity to all provinces are assumed to be 58 and 37 billion m3 respectively spc and mwrep 1987 over the past few decades the existing 1987 scheme has proved to be successful for relieving water supply contradiction among riparian provinces however the existing water allocation scheme can not effectively address the contradiction between socio economic development and ecological protection with the growing population and economy li et al 2021 moreover both the annual runoff and water use over the yrb have experienced great changes over the past three decades the existing 1987 scheme is exposed to new challenges and therefore needs to be adjusted qiao 2019 wang et al 2019b wang and zheng 2019d consequently china has put forward higher requirements for the water resources allocation and elevated the ecological protection and high quality development of the yrb to a major national strategy in 2019 the above challenges of water resources management in the yrb is actually very common in china accordingly a series of national policies have been promulgated to meet these challenges over the past decade among them the most important one is the so called the most stringent water resources management policy which was issued as part of the chinese government s central document no 1 on january 29 2011 three redlines were set to control the total water use quantity water use efficiency and water pollution for each major basin and each province subsequently the ministry of water resources began to explore the water resources carrying capacity wrcc by controlling water use quantity and efficiency as for the yellow river president xi pointed out that the scale of social economic development must be complemented with the wrcc of the yrb for ecological protection and high quality development as an important part of the high quality development strategy water resources of the yellow river basin should be allocated and utilized rationally and efficiently wang et al 2018 chen and jin 2019 yang et al 2020 zhao and yu 2020 specifically water distribution should be based on water demand prediction brown et al 2015 suggested that forecasting the future of water resources is the basis for implementing sustainable management science in response to global water challenges in the 21st century prediction based water demand management is the key in creating a reliable economic system gharabaghi et al 2019 maruyama and yamamoto 2019 proposed a water demand forecasting method in japan by using multiple regression based on water supply characteristics sanchez et al 2020 predicted urban water demand across two us states through a geographically weighted regression model informed by urban growth and climate change metrics gharabaghi et al 2019 created an integrated nonlinear daily water demand forecast model on the strength of climate change coupled with the seasonal and weekly trends in water demand guo et al 2020 proposed an improved whale optimization algorithm to forecast water demand by adopting historical water use data in agriculture industry residences and ecology however current models that predict water demand are limited in regional scale which also neglects future population change and economic growth a prediction model reflecting china s current water management policies and high quality development strategies is urgently needed under this background the innovation of this study is to develop a water demand prediction model considering the water resources carrying capacity to predict water demand prediction in 2030 during different water use and economic development scenarios meanwhile corresponding water allocation countermeasures against water demand for further socio economic development in nine provinces along yellow river are also provided on this basis we attempted to answer the following questions q1 by 2030 how much water is required by each of the nine provinces along the yellow river basin to maintain sustainable development of the region will water demand exceed the available water resources to support the population and economy in the region what economy scale can be supported by the available water resources in the yellow river basin q2 what s the influence of water use change to population and socio economic development what level of water use efficiency should we have for water utilization and how much water should be rationally allocated to meet the water demand target in 2030 this article comprises five parts part one is the introduction about the background and the overview of this research part two presents the study area part three introduces the methodology of the proposed framework and data sources part four presents the results of the computational experiments part five discussed the results and clarified the future uncertainty the last part summarized the conclusion of the study 2 study area the yellow river flows through nine provinces or municipalities in the north of china specifically it originated in qinghai passed through qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong and then flowed into the bohai sea fig 1 the yellow river brings up a large number of population with limited water resources to be specific with only 2 of china s total water resources the yellow river basin yrb is home to 15 of the nation s arable land and 9 of its population jia and liang 2020 omer et al 2020 the ratio of gross domestic product gdp of yrb to the entire china is approximately 13 2 in 2018 nowadays the severe water scarcity in the yellow river basin has impeded surrounding provinces development and aggravated the economic imbalances among regions for instance the per capita gdp of dongying city in shandong at river outlet is 10 times more than that of yushu prefecture in qinghai at river source xi 2019 meanwhile water scarcity of yellow river basin has become a major issue for regional sustainable development zhao and yu 2020 considering the existing water diversion schemes spc and mwrep 1987 and the data availability the provincial scale is adopted in this study the purpose of this study is to forecast the water resources utilization situation of nine provinces along the yellow river basin by adopting the concept of water resources carrying capacity into the different changing scenarios 3 methodology and materials 3 1 water resources carrying capacity wrcc model water resources carrying capacity first defined by shi and qu 1992 based on the situation of china has been adopted as chinese water resources management policy for many years subsequently wrcc theory has also been improved by different scholars to define the maximum population and economic size able to be carried in a region under the water resources available certain water use efficiency level and per capita welfare standard as well as certain urbanization without destruction of ecology environment li and gan 2000 feng 2000 wang 2001 xia and zhu 2002 jia et al 2004 wang et al 2004 2017 duan et al 2010 generally economic size can be calculated through per capita gdp representing per capita welfare standard times population scale hence the objective of wrcc is to determine the maximum population its mathematical expression can be described as follows objective function max p constraints 1 tw w d w p w e 2 w d p ur q u p 1 ur q r 3 w p p y a q gdp 4 q gdp w i w a gdp where p denotes population tw is total water use quantity w d w p and w e represent the water used for domestic purposes production i e agriculture and industry and ecology respectively ur represents the degree of urbanization which is the proportion of the population living in urban areas q u and q r denote the per capita domestic water use in urban and rural areas respectively y a is per capita gross domestic product gdp q gdp is defined as water use per cny10 000 of gdp which represents water use efficiency w i and w a denote water use for industrial and agricultural respectively combing eqs 1 4 the maximum population can be deduced as follows 5 p tw w e ur q u 1 ur q r y a q gdp based on the definition of water resources carrying capacity water demand can be estimated by the inversion of eq 5 when population size is known the relationship between water demand and water resources carrying capacity is depicted in fig 2 3 2 water demand wd model 3 2 1 wd estimation for the historical period according to the official explanation total water use comprises water used for daily life production and ecology mwr 2019 in the inversion of eq 5 total water use is converted into total water demand in water demand model on this basis the water demand model is expressed as follows 6 twd p ur q u 1 ur q r y a q gdp w e differ from eq 5 twd represents total water demand when population size is known once w d w p and w e are determined the historical period of total water demand at different regions can be calculated 3 2 2 wd forecasting for the future according to the national plan for population development it is expected that china s population will reach its peak in 2030 sc 2016 under this background water use would reach a high level in the same year in line with the national comprehensive planning of water resources which was approved by the state council in 2011 jiao 2011 therefore water demand for each province along the yellow river basin of 2030 would be studied and 2019 was selected as the reference year differ from the wd estimation for the historical period the calculations of water use per cny10 000 of gdp y a and the per capita gdp growth q gdp in the wd prediction model are expressed as follows 7 y a 2030 y a 2019 1 gr 11 8 q gdp 2030 q gdp 2019 1 dr 9 w e 2030 w e 2019 twrd 2030 twrd 2019 40 where the subscripts 2019 and 2030 indicate the year 2019 and 2030 respectively the annual growth rate gr of per capita gdp and decreased rate dr of water use per cny10 000 of gdp are set using 2019 s data twrd 2030 is water use red line also called the upper limit of water use in 2030 twrd 2019 represents actual ecological water use in 2019 and w e 2019 denotes actual ecological water use in 2019 w e 2030 represents ecological water use in 2030 was calculated on the basis of 40 of the new water supply that comes from the national comprehensive planning of water resources jiao 2011 the new water supply equals to water use red line in 2030 from the most stringent water resources management system general office of the state council gosc 2013 minus actual water use quantity in 2019 3 3 model performance evaluation through the above wrcc and wd models the estimates should be approximately equal to the actual values that is the estimated population should be roughly the same as the actual population and the estimated water demand should be remarkably close to the actual water use quantity in order to verify the accuracy and feasibility of proposed models several conventional statistical indicators are adopted to assess model performance specifically mean absolute percentage error mape coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse are utilized in this study independent sample t test is also used to analyze the different cases of the estimated and actual values 10 mape 1 n i 1 n y i ˆ y i 1 11 r 2 1 i y i ˆ y i i y i y i 12 rmse 1 n 1 n y i y i ˆ 2 where y i represents actual water demand y i ˆ represents estimated water demand n is sample size y i is the mean of actual water demand among these statistical indicators low mape and rmse usually means the model is reliable high r 2 usually corresponds to high consistency between actual and estimated water demand in addition the significance level of t test is performed at 5 3 4 sobol global sensitivity analysis according to existing research it is generally believed that water use efficiency plays a critical role in the process of water use world water assessment programme wwap 2015 wang et al 2015b bao and zou 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 to support this viewpoint and to seek countermeasures against water demand further verification has been done sobol global sensitivity analysis a powerful method that is used to analyze time series to uncover significant changes characteristics sobol 1993 has been applied to different fields including hydrology liu et al 2019a 2019b engineering qian et al 2016 biology kontoravdi et al 2005 and other fields it is a method used to seek sensitivity factors or main impact indicators based on variance analysis it decomposes the total variance of model output into the sum of the sub variances contributed by each parameter and its interaction with the other parameters sobol 1993 the expression can be written as 13 i 1 n v i i 1 n 1 j i 1 n v ij v 1 n where v i denotes variance of parameter x i v i v ij v 1 n represent variances among parameters the variance of each parameter can be called direct contribution to the total variance which can be reflected by the first order sensitivity index s i similarly the second order and the high order sensitivity indexes between parameter x i and other parameters can be defined as an indirect contribution the expression is as follows 14 s i v i v s ij v ij v s 1 n v 1 n v then the sum of direct contribution and indirect contribution means total sensitivity indexes that is 15 s ti s i s ij s 1 n 3 5 materials and data processing in the wrcc model and wd model for the historical period the original data of p ur and y a are obtained from china statistical yearbook 2004 2019 and statistical bulletin of each province s national economic and social development besides q gdp the rest parameters are obtained from china water resources bulletin 2003 2019 it should be noted that q gdp is calculated by dividing the sum of industrial and agricultural water use by the gdp rather than employing official statistics from the china water resources bulletin directly this is because domestic and ecological water use are not included in the calculation of q gdp see eq 4 therefore the official statistics may obtain exaggerated results since the elements except for production water use are included in terms of 2030 data population p and degree of urbanization ur are derived from the planning of population and city development made by each province for 2030 q u and q r are determined by historical time series data specifically the mann kendall method hamed 2008 is used to detect the trend of time series data from 2013 to 2019 when it is a prominent downward or rise trend the predicted value is adopted through the artificial neural network backpropagation autoregressive method al zahrani and abo monasar 2015 if no obvious trend appears the mean value is selected annual growth rate gr and decreased rate dr are also derived from the historical trend these two parameters enable the simulation of possible water demand scenarios of each province w e is calculated on the basis of 40 of new water supply that comes from national comprehensive planning of water resources that have been launched to ensure a long term sustainable development jiao 2011 the new water supply equals to water use red line in 2030 from the most stringent water resources management system general office of the state council gosc 2013 minus actual water use quantity in 2019 4 results 4 1 accuracy of wrcc and wd models in order to validate the performance of wrcc model the estimated population of nine provinces from 2003 to 2019 is compared with the actual population mean absolute percentage error mape 1 36 indicates wrcc is a relatively reliable model the coefficient of determination r 2 0 99924 is close to 1 and the value of p 0 9401 in the t test is statistically significant at the 95 confidence level consequently wrcc model can be regarded as a suitable tool to estimate the population furthermore the performance of wd model is also demonstrated the actual water use from 2003 to 2019 is adopted as actual water demand to assess the accuracy of wd model the comparison results at different provinces are displayed in fig 3 there is a slight difference between observed and estimated water demand for these nine provinces the low rmse 0 4008 and high coefficient of determination r 2 0 9971 implies the wd model has a good performance analogously the value of p 0 8528 in the t test is also statistically significant at the 95 confidence level all these statistical indicators indicate the water demand model proposed in this study is reasonable to estimate water demand for the historical period and has potential to forecast for the future in addition to the overall evaluation the difference in the accuracy of estimated water demand are also province specific the good consistency is observed in ningxia and shanxi provinces in the entire validation period for qinghai sichuan gansu inner mongolia shaanxi and henan provinces the estimated water demand after 2012 is more accurate than before 2012 the worst performance of water demand estimation is obtained in shandong province with both overestimation and underestimation in validation period the difference in water demand prediction may be related to the inconsistency between actual water consumption and water use demand at these nine provinces in addition the accurate performance after 2012 may be related to more standard and high quality data are collected 4 2 water demand forecasting for 2030 4 2 1 scenario of steady reform and no major shock taking the per capita gdp growth in the last three years as a reference nbs 2017 2019 the annual per capita gdp growth rate is set from 3 to 8 with an increase step of 1 we set 40 as the baseline of the gross water use decreased rate according to the national comprehensive planning of water resources issued in 2010 which indicated that the water use per cny10 000 of gdp should decrease by 40 from 2020 to 2030 the official data shows that this rate fell by 24 between 2015 and 2019 national office of water conservation nowc 2020 which is averaged to 6 per year as a result the gross water use decreased rate between 2020 and 2030 is assumed to be around 66 so the decreased rate of the gross water use per cny10 000 of gdp also called the increased rate of water use efficiency is set from 40 to 70 with an decreased step of 5 by this means the conditions of water demand by each province under different scenarios are obtained fig 4 meanwhile the comparison of the total water use of the nine provinces with the 2030 water use quantity upper limit that set by the most stringent water resources system in 2013 which also known as the 2030 water use red line general office of the state council gosc 2013 is displayed in fig 4 the water demand situation of each province under the scenarios with increased per capita gdp growth rate and decreased water use per cny10 000 of gdp rate are shown in fig 4 from fig 4 we can easily determine whether the water demand situation is beyond the 2030 water use red line specifically besides qinghai the water demand of the other eight provinces have exceeded their respective upper limits the differences among these provinces can be affected by several factors such as economic development status technological level and environmental conditions meanwhile we can also infer that the increased per capita gdp growth rate promotes the utilization of water the decrease of water use per cny10 000 of gdp rate has ability to offset this influence to ensure the water demand is below the red line it seems that the decrease of water use per cny10 000 of gdp is more sensitive to the increase of per capita gdp growth considering the different economic development conditions and cascading water use efficiency of these nine provinces the actual water demand situation of each province will be analyzed in detail so as to better match with the actual development trend 4 2 2 scenario of actual economic development and water use efficiency since the economic development and water use efficiency are different from each other for these nine provinces it s necessary to testify the actual economic development and water use scenario specifically the increase of per capita gdp growth rate and the decrease of water use per cny10 000 of gdp rate in 2030 are estimated through historical time series data the ceiling of each province s annual per capita gdp growth rate is determined by the average value in the last three years meanwhile the decelerating trend of economic growth rate is also considered world bank and drcsc 2010 moderate economic growth is defined when the gdp growth rate declines by one percentage point while two percentage points falling is known as low economic growth based on the historical trend and the average percentage increase of water use efficiency in china in the last ten years combining with the experience from the developed countries where the water use efficiency growth rate increases gradually the percentage decline of the upper limit of water use per cny10 000 of gdp of every province can be determined following the principle of proximity the average annual value from 2009 to 2019 should be used to determine the upper limit of each province as mentioned above 40 is the bottom limit of each province s water use efficiency growth rate jiao 2011 the estimated water demand by each of the nine provinces along the yellow river basin is presented in tables a1 a9 of the supplementary information si with cascading levels of water use efficiency growth rate and the high medium and low levels of per capita gdp growth rate further the range of province level water demand in 2030 is calculated through the wd model see si table b1 fig 5 presents the predicted water demand of the nine provinces under the high medium and low economic growth conditions and different water use efficiency levels it shows that apart from gansu province the water demand in different economic growth conditions across the other eight provinces is likely to exceed the current water use quantity the estimated maximum water demand of each province exceeds the 2030 water use red line excluding qinghai inner mongolia shanxi and shandong even at a moderate water use efficiency level water demand in henan province and inner mongolia with high economic growth scenario is still slightly over the water use red line overall future water demand will exhibit an increasing trend according to our forecast 4 3 the rule of water supply and water use efficiency 4 3 1 the available water resources in the yellow river basin according to research statistics the runoff reduction of the yellow river basin is obvious wang et al 2019 the average annual runoff of the yellow river basin was 58 billion m3 from 1919 to 1975 53 48 billion m3 from 1956 to 2000 and 48 24 billion m3 from 1956 to 2010 xue et al 2013 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2015a projected the runoff from 2021 to 2050 would decrease by 0 53 9 67 compared to the decreased rate between 1991 and 2010 with a peak of 13 26 during 2021 2030 yuan et al 2016 reported that the future runoff might increase by 14 4 16 8 but it is still below the average value occurred between 1961 and 1985 the comprehensive plan for the yellow river basin depicted that the surface river runoff in the yellow river basin is expected to reduce to 51 48 billion m3 by 2030 yellow river conservancy committee of ministry of water resources yrcc 2013 afterward the average annual runoff range was adjusted to be between 48 2 and 53 48 billion m3 jia and liang 2020 in brief the situation of water scarcity in the yellow river basin is grim zuo 2019 so far the predicted annual runoff of the yellow river basin would be 48 2 51 48 billion m3 in 2030 this minus the estimated ecological water use of 8 12 billion m3 jia and liang 2020 the available water resources for use in the yellow river basin would be approximately 36 2 43 48 billion m3 in 2030 moreover before the opening of the first stage of the west route of the south to north water diversion project it is estimated that the available surface water quantity in the yellow river basin would not exceed 40 176 billion m3 yellow river conservancy committee of ministry of water resources yrcc 2013 wang 2015c presumed that the available surface water quantity would not be more than 46 846 billion m3 by 2030 even after the south to north water diversion project was put into use so the range of the total available water quantity for human use is further adjusted to 36 2 46 846 billion m3 4 3 2 the water use quantity of the yellow river basin fig 6 presents the trend in water use of each province between 2003 and 2019 with significant growth in urbanization population and per capita gdp some locations exhibit a dramatic increase or decrease between years such as the situation between 2008 and 2009 in qinghai between 2003 and 2005 in ningxia between 2009 and 2011 in shanxi and between 2005 and 2006 in shandong in general qinghai gansu and shandong show a striking downward trend while sichuan inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi and henan present a slow upward trend even so the total volume of water supporting regional growth has not seen a substantial increase therefore from the perspective of water resources utilization the wrcc model is adopted to analyze how water use change supports population and socio economic development water use change includes fluctuation of water use quantity and variation of water use efficiency as mentioned above with the rapid growth in urbanization population and per capita gdp there is no considerable increase in each province s total water use quantity from 2003 to 2019 here we focus on the respective influence of water use quantity and water use efficiency on water resource carrying capacity by adopting the sobol global sensitivity analysis method the sensitivity indexes of water use quantity and efficiency are obtained and presented in table 1 it is revealed that water use efficiency has a greater impact on water resources carrying capacity than water use quantity hence water use efficiency is a major driver of temporal variation in water utilization the improvement in water use efficiency which fueled a downward trend of total water use is critical for socio economic development by limited water resources to a large extent 4 4 countermeasures against water demand for 2030 4 4 1 enhance water use efficiency the results obtained from the sobol global sensitivity analysis indicate that water use efficiency plays a key role in water use change assuming the water use for all consumption of each province at 2030 equals to the water use quantity in 2019 the increase rate of water use efficiency to satisfy the water resources carrying capacity at high medium and low levels of economic growth are showing in table 2 according to the above analysis the predicted water demand by the planned population and urbanization will be greater than the current hence table 2 shows a higher increase rate of water use efficiency under three economic growth scenarios additionally fig 4 and fig 5 also exhibit the rate of water use efficiency should be increased under different per capita gdp growth conditions in particular fig 5 is more pertinently displaying the most possible development scenarios of each province in 2030 as a consequence the increase of water use efficiency is a relative flexible way to improve water resources carrying capacity 4 4 2 increase available water resources based on the analysis described above not all provinces can meet the corresponding water use efficiency under the circumstances that the per capita gdp keeps growing while the water use quantity remains unchanged valid and dependable water demand forecasting is a major element of effective and sustainable development zubaidi et al 2018 hence seeking an appropriate and realistic solution where water use efficiency can be integrated into projected economic growth scenarios is necessary here we choose the mean value of the upper and lower limits as the water use efficiency the demand for water in each province is calculated under high medium and low economic growth situations respectively with regard to water use quantity increase there are several ways to increase the available water quantity which can be adopted by the following order first priorities have been given to water supply from the south to north water diversion project where 3 769 billion m3 of water and 3 734 billion m3 of water are distributed to henan and shandong respectively yellow river conservancy committee of ministry of water resources yrcc 2013 jia and liang 2020 liu et al 2020 the second is average water use of 39 billion m3 mwr 2003 2019 from the yellow river basin over the years the third is the maximum available water resources of 46 846 billion m3 in the yellow river basin should be taken into consideration what is noteworthy is that the 46 846 billion m3 of water includes the multi year average water use volumes of 39 billion m3 the distribution of the available water resources from the yellow river basin to the nine provinces is classified into two categories one is the water deficit all come from the further development of the yellow river basin and the other is to distribute water resources in accordance with the proportion of water supply to each province in previous years to be specific we assume that the water deficit of all provinces comes from the yellow river basin when comparing with the water use quantity of 2019 the maximum available water resources of 46 846 billion m3 in the yellow river basin minus 39 billion m3 plus the 3 769 billion m3 of water to henan province and 3 734 billion m3 of water to shandong province through the south to north water diversion project equals to 15 349 billion m3 that is less than the 25 44 billion m3 at a high economic growth level see si table b2 it illustrates that the total available water resources from the south to north water diversion project and the yellow river basin cannot meet development needs when in a medium economic growth scenario 15 349 billion m3 of water is slightly more than the water deficit of 15 11 billion m3 see si table b2 indicating the total available water resources from the south to north water diversion project and the yellow river basin can satisfy the requirements of development likewise water demand at a low economic growth pattern also can be met in other words in the range of 36 2 46 846 billion m3 when the available water resources of the yellow river basin is greater than 37 billion m3 it can meet the water demand for low economic growth and when greater than 46 billion m3 the water demand for medium economic growth can be satisfied however the minimum available water resources of 36 2 billion m3 minus 39 billion m3 plus the 3 769 billion m3 and 3 734 billion m3 from south to north water diversion project is 4 703 billion m3 which is less than the water deficit of 5 69 billion m3 in the low economic growth scenario it means neither low water demand nor water demand under medium economic growth and high economic growth scenarios cannot be met to sum up in comparison with the current situation the water use strategies of yellow river basin still needs to be further developed so as to meet the needs of the medium and low economic growth the specific water allocation plan is illustrated in table 3 where the numbers are calculated by the water deficit see si table b2 plus the current water use quantity from the yellow river basin for each province in terms of the water supply of the yellow river basin to each province the water use proportion of each province from 2013 to 2018 was barely changed so the average proportion during the period 2013 2018 was selected as the 2030 water demand proportion of the yellow river basin thereby the water demand of each province under three economic growth scenarios is calculated see si table b3 as mentioned above we give priority to the distribution of water transmitted through the south to north water diversion project taking such volume out of the total water demand of 47 39 billion m3 see si table b3 the water demand of 39 89 billion m3 see table 4 is less than the maximum 46 846 billion m3 and the remaining water can be redistributed under this situation the available water resources from the yellow river basin can still meet the need for socio economic development when all provinces are at a high economic growth level the detailed water use distribution scheme of the yellow river basin in three economic growth scenarios is shown in table 4 the total water use quantity from the yellow river basin for the nine provinces is 33 52 billion m3 see table 4 which is less than the minimum available water resources of the yellow river basin with 36 2 billion m3 indicating the water demand at low economic growth level is easily satisfied 5 discussion 5 1 hypotheses of the water demand model the precondition of the water demand forecast is that the planned population and urbanization can be realized and the social economic growth is steady differences may exist between the anticipated and the actual population and urbanization but they should be small ones for the following reasons the official planning issued by the nine provinces is accurate and reliable as they are integrated with local development trends and conditions in the course of future development local authorities will formulate policies to facilitate the implementation of planning objectives therefore forecasting water demand through the estimated per capita gdp and water use efficiency is a reliable method as to the solutions of increasing water use quantity two scenarios were investigated one is that water deficits would all come from the yellow river basin the other is that water allocation proportion for each province would remain unchanged telling from the historical trend between 2013 and 2018 however it is unknown how much water in the yellow river basin will be available for use by 2030 and it is unlikely to predict whether the water allocation proportion for every province would change consequently uncertainties exist in the distribution schemes in table 3 and table 4 moreover attention should be paid to analyze the maximum and the minimum available water resources in water allocation planning however the minimum available water resources can merely ensure that the water to each province would be supplied with the current distribution proportion under a low economic growth pattern although some uncertainties and assumptions are existed in this work this study has covered all possible scenarios making it a convincing and valuable work 5 2 accessibility and uncertainty of water use efficiency it is well known that there is a large gap between china and the developed countries in terms of the water use efficiency in order to better understand the situation we compared the estimated water use per cny10 000 of the gdp of china in 2030 with the mean value of the developed countries in the past years according to incomplete statistics the average water use per cny10 000 of gdp in developed countries went down from 24 43 m3 in 2015 18 63 m3 in 2018 however the predicted mean value of the nine provinces would be 24 40 m3 in 2030 in the context of high decreased proportion and even much more water would be required in order to generate cny10 000 of gdp under the circumstances of moderate and low decreased percentage respectively generally the range of water use of the nine provinces would vary roughly from 11 m3 to 80 m3 at the most likely medium level in 2030 however this value of most developed countries is below 30 m3 except for greece see si table c1 that means china would still fall behind the developed countries in water use per cny10 000 of gdp in 2030 by comparing the water use efficiency between the developed counties and the water use efficiency trend between the nine provinces the scenarios with the high medium and low levels of economic growth can be verified the predicted water demand under the medium level scenario may be lower than the actual situation one possibility is that during the 11 years apart from shanxi the water use efficiency increase rate of the other provinces is around 60 which is slightly higher than the above determined medium level thus uncertainty is also included in water use efficiency to predict the future development trend 5 3 water use versus water consumption the quantity of water use that recorded in the documents of china including china water resources bulletin provincial water resources bulletin and 2030 water use red line is equivalent to water demand rather than water consumption water consumption refers to the part that cannot be returned to surface water bodies and underground aquifers by means of transpiration evaporation soil absorption consumption of residents and livestock in the process of water transmission and water use mwr 2019 it can be summarized as the broad water use quantity of water demand and narrow water use of water consumption also called net water use quantity both identical essentially with some variations in values the water consumption rate is calculated by dividing the amount of water consumption by the gross water use in 2019 the national water consumption rate was 53 2 indicating that almost half of the amount of water use was lost mwr 2019 in contrast the water consumption rate of the yellow river basin is approximately 80 that means 80 of the water cannot be returned to the source after withdrawn yrcc 2003 2018 concerning water consumption rate the actual water consumption is less than the actual water demand it means that when the water deficit all comes from the further development of the yellow river basin according to the current speed of technological improvement and socio economic development the estimated water consumption in the future will not exceed the available water resources of the yellow river basin forecasts presented in this study broad water use quantity of water demand was adopted not net water use quantity in this sense the predicted water demand in this study may be overestimated this would have a more practical meaning because water demand forecasting should take into account the possible water loss during the utilization process 5 4 water redistribution over the yellow river basin in the matter of water use the predicted total water use of the nine provinces under the upper limit of water use efficiency decline and the high economic growth pattern is 128 35 billion m3 see si table a10 which is slightly more than the current condition of 127 billion m3 mwr 2019 over the past decade with the rapid urbanization and economic and population development the growth of water amount required by the nine provinces in the yellow river basin has slowed down with only approximately 4 9 billion m3 of water increased mwr 2003 2019 whereas when the mean value of the upper and lower limits of water use efficiency is most likely to be attained the total demand for water from the yellow river basin is 39 89 billion m3 in the high economic growth model as showed in table 3 which is quite close to the average annual water use of 39 billion m3 mwr 2003 2019 with identical efficiency the total water demand under medium and low economic growth patterns are both less than 39 billion m3 taking 39 billion m3 as a basic reference then the remaining 2 45 and 5 48 billion m3 can be allocated again under medium and low economic growth patterns this portion of water can be used either to release the water stress in the provinces that are with high pressure on water abstraction but are drawing a small amount of water from the yellow river basin e g sichuan and shaanxi or to mitigate arid conditions of the border provinces e g gansu qinghai and inner mongolia thereby supporting regional ecological protection and economical construction and facilitating food safety and national defense security jia and liang 2020 6 conclusion the water demand wd prediction model based on water resources carrying capacity wrcc can be applied to calculate the amount of water for domestic production and ecological use this study focus on the available water resources in the yellow river basin the gross water demand in 2030 by the nine provinces along the yellow river basin and the water allocation plans the water demand under different scenarios is presented for all provinces along the yellow river basin through the wd model the scenarios are all determined through the long term trend analysis incorporated with the possible economic development at high medium and low levels in order to meet water resources requirements by every economic growth scenario two solutions are proposed without breaking through the available water volumes of the yellow river basin the first is improving water use efficiency when the water demand of each province is unchanged compared with 2019 the increase proportions of water use efficiency in 2030 with three levels of economic growth are suggested the second is increasing available water resources the specific water allocation schemes combined with the available water resources of the yellow river and from the south to north water diversion project are given based on our knowledge and experience particularly the estimation under medium level water use efficiency is considered conservative which should be close to future water demand in addition the predicted water demand may be higher than the actual for the reasons that 1 differences exist between water use and water consumption which is elaborated in section 5 2 water use efficiency may be underestimated however in general the water allocation plans proposed in this study can satisfy the need for development with the rapid economic development and the acceleration of urbanization and population growth there occurs an increasing water demand in these regions along the yellow river the prediction on water demand can facilitate the arrangement of water supply plans to avoid the unsustainable development caused by water scarcity and the water crisis nevertheless the simulated scenarios are not considered to the definitive the prediction in this study is to forecast the future water demand under the circumstances where water use efficiency and economic growth are rational thereby offering a reference for managing water demand sustainably this study is not intended to confine local planners and policymakers to the estimated scenarios but to foresee reasonable possibilities that may arise in the future and provide an analytical approach to predict the water demand in the future this work can benefit water resources allocation planning and management and aims to be a reliable source for future studies of the yellow
