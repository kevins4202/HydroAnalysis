6290,theories and models used in soil hydrological sciences rely on the knowledge of the spatially and temporally variable soil hydraulic properties i e the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves obtaining reliable experimental information on these curves for an area of interest is not easy and it still remains a challenge for soil scientists in 2006 a simple and physically based methodology was proposed to completely characterize the soil using a single ring infiltration experiment in the field and determination of soil particle size distribution initial and final soil water content and dry soil bulk density this methodology named best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters has received great attention and interest from the worldwide scientific community and it shows promise for further developments this review paper aims to take the reader into the best world initially the best experiment is described and the different algorithms that can be applied to analyze the infiltration data are illustrated then an overview of the use that has been made of best up to now in the world is provided subsequently infiltration prediction by best equations is discussed from both a theoretical and a practical point of view i e with reference to the shape and geometric parameters of the assumed infiltration model and to the effects of the available information for the transient and steady state phases of the process then the application of best is presented with reference to different types of heterogeneous soils finally practical recommendations and theoretical and experimental perspectives are provided keywords best methods infiltration hydraulic conductivity sealed soil water repellency heterogeneous soil dual permeability soil 1 introduction in the last 50 years the scientific community has developed theories and models for the fluxes and storages of mass and energy through the soil and plant based ecosystems that are the planet s critical zones clothier 2016 there is an enormous number of reasons why the society needs to deal with the soil water processes and to mathematically simulate them including as an example making water and nutrients available for the plant rooting systems in the perspective of a sustainable agriculture in widely different environments contrasting point or diffuse pollution of the groundwater aquifers favoring water conservation and reducing water losses in arid environments controlling accelerated soil water erosion managing soil structures in urban environments e g angulo jaramillo et al 2000 iovino et al 2017 interpreting and simulating soil water processes is complicated since obtaining reliable measurements of those parameters that the models rely on is difficult clothier 2016 especially close to or at saturation soil hydraulic properties strongly depend on the often fragile structure of the porous medium jarvis et al 2013 consequently the experimental information on soil properties varies in dependence of many factors such as sample size established flow geometry for the experiment or sample collection procedure and there are no independent data upon which evaluations and judgments can be made reynolds et al 2000 therefore determining field soil hydraulic properties still remains a challenge for soil scientists angulo jaramillo et al 2016 particularly in the last three decades soil hydraulic characterization by infiltration based methodologies has been given a substantial boost essentially thanks to the development of a robust theory of the established flow processes e g reynolds and elrick 1990 1991 1987 smith et al 2002 moreover infiltration experiments are generally carried out directly in the field and they are relatively easy to perform consequently the functional connection between the sampled soil volume and the surrounding soil is maintained which assures that the collected data are representative of the infiltration process at the sampled point scale bouma 1982 and the experiment can be replicated at many points and times with sustainable resources and workloads this circumstance favors the passage from a point to an areal and time representative information which is crucial since soil hydraulic properties can exhibit a great spatial and temporal variability prieksat et al 1994 warrick 1998 most of the available infiltration methods and procedures were developed with the specific objective to determine the soil hydraulic conductivity at or close to saturation however interpreting and modelling hydrological processes need more information than near saturated soil hydraulic conductivity alone starting from this premise lassabatere et al 2006 developed a new method to completely characterize the soil i e to estimate soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curve on the basis of a very simple field infiltration experiment that could also be carried out with a beer can cut to give a ring and some additional information on particle size distribution initial and final soil water content and dry soil bulk density the procedure named best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters combines pedotransfer functions to estimate the shape parameters of the hydraulic curves with a measurement of water infiltration that yields the scale parameters of these curves best has received considerable interest from the scientific community many applications and checks of the procedure and some theoretical developments have been accomplished in only one decade best was designed with reference to ideal situations i e for uniformly unsaturated rigid and homogeneous soils but some investigations have suggested that the procedure works satisfactorily even in non ideal conditions such as for example when a sealed layer is present at the soil surface moreover some efforts have been made very recently to extend the methodology originally thought for single permeability soils to the hydraulic characterization of dual permeability soils lassabatere et al 2019b therefore best methods could have great interest to make a complete field soil hydraulic characterization practically possible with sustainable efforts and on the basis of a robust physical theory of course not all has been made and there is still much work to be done as for example making more comparisons with other methods to characterize the soil and establishing best performances in particular situations such as soils affected by sub critical water repellency the objective of this review paper is to take the reader into the best world in particular the best procedure of soil transfer parameter estimation is initially illustrated then an overview of the use that has been made of this procedure up to now in the world is provided subsequently the infiltration equation used by the procedure is discussed from both a theoretical and a practical point of view in particular the choice of the parameters of the equation and its performances in dependence of the available information for the transient and steady state phases of the process are discussed then the application of best is presented with specific reference to various types of soil heterogeneity that is sealed soils multi porosity and permeability systems and porous media of contrasting materials at the end of the paper some indications and perspectives are drawn 2 the best procedure the best procedure of soil hydraulic characterization developed by lassabatere et al 2006 allows simultaneous estimation of the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves by a limited experimental information that includes particle size distribution psd of the soil dry soil bulk density cumulative three dimensional 3d infiltration and initial and final soil water contents best focuses specifically on the van genuchten 1980 relationship for the water retention curve and the brooks and corey 1964 relationship for hydraulic conductivity 1a θ θ r θ s θ r 1 h h g n m 1b m 1 2 n 2a k θ k s θ θ r θ s θ r η 2b η 2 mn 2 p where θ l3 l 3 is the volumetric soil water content h l is the soil water pressure head k lt 1 is the soil

hydraulic conductivity are scale parameters in best θ r is assumed to be zero in the field a single sample can be used for determining the psd the dry soil bulk density ρ d ml 3 and the initial volumetric soil water content θ i l3 l 3 water infiltration experiments are carried out by the beerkan method pioneered by braud et al 2005 a ring with a diameter of several centimeters e g 10 to 20 cm according to lassabatere et al 2006 is inserted a short distance e g 0 5 1 cm into the soil to pour water volumes at soil surface while avoiding lateral loss of ponded water a fixed small volume of water in the order of hundreds of cm3 vw l3 is poured into the cylinder at time t t zero to establish a small ponded head of water e g 1 cm and the time elapsed during infiltration of the known volume of water is measured when the first volume has completely infiltrated a second volume of water equal to vw is added to the cylinder and the time needed for it to infiltrate is measured the procedure is repeated for about 8 to 15 known volumes to allow flow into the soil to nearly stabilize lassabatere et al 2006 and cumulative infiltration i l is recorded finally the dataset is made up of a number of ntot discrete points ti ii describing an experimental cumulative infiltration curve at the end of the infiltration run the saturated soil in the ring is sampled to determine the gravimetric saturated water content ws mm 1 the volumetric saturated soil water content can be estimated by θ s w s ρ d as suggested by lassabatere et al 2006 soil porosity f calculated from the bulk ρ d and mineral ρ s densities was used as an estimate of θ s in several applications of the method bagarello et al 2011 mubarak et al 2010 2009 xu et al 2009 yilmaz et al 2010 to obtain the shape parameters of the hydraulic curves the psd is fitted to the following equations 3a f d 1 d g d n m 3b m 1 2 n where f d is the cumulative frequency associated with diameter d l m and n are two shape parameters and d g l is a scale parameter the fit provides an estimate of parameters m n and d g the shape index of the medium p m can then be estimated from m and n by 4a p m p m 1 κ 1 4b p m mn 1 m 4c p m mn 1 m with the coefficient κ defined as 5 κ 2 s 1 2 s 1 s where s is the fractal dimension of the medium defined as the root of the following equation 6 1 f s f 2 s 1 the m parameter is derived from the values of p m considering the positive root of eq 4b 7 m 1 p m 1 p m 2 1 the n and η parameters are then estimated from eqs 1b and 2b if particle size is only known for three fractions i e clay silt and sand the empirical pedotransfer function by minasny and mcbratney 2007 can be used to predict n for the best procedure from sand and clay content to estimate sorptivity s lt 1 2 and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s lt 1 best makes use of the experimental data obtained with the beerkan method and the approximations of the quasi exact implicit infiltration model by haverkamp et al 1994 these authors consider that for an infiltration experiment with zero water pressure head on a circular surface of radius r l above a uniform soil with a uniform water content θ i l3 l 3 the 3d cumulative infiltration i l and the infiltration rate i lt 1 can be approached by the following explicit transient eqs 8a and 8b and steady state eqs 8c and 8d expressions haverkamp et al 1994 8a i t s t a s 2 b k s t 8b i t s 2 t a s 2 b k s 8c i s t a s 2 k s t c s 2 k s 8d i s t a s 2 k s where i s and i s are the asymptotic models for i and i for large times t t is the time and a l 1 b and c are constants that can be defined for the specific case of a brooks and corey 1964 relationship as 9a a γ r θ s θ i 9b b 2 β 3 1 θ i θ s η θ i θ s η 9c c 1 2 1 β 1 θ i θ s η l n 1 β where β and γ are coefficients that are commonly set at 0 6 and 0 75 respectively for θ i 0 25 θ s haverkamp et al 1994 smettem et al 1994 the scale parameter of the water retention curve h g l is obtained from the previous estimates of shape parameters sorptivity and saturated hydraulic conductivity as follows 10 h g s 2 c p θ s θ i 1 θ i θ s η k s in which c p is given by 11 c p γ 1 1 n γ m η 1 n γ m η γ m η m 1 n γ m η m where γ stands for the gamma function for the derivation of k s and s different best algorithms were proposed that differ by the way eqs 8 are fitted to the experimental infiltration data angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the original best slope algorithm lassabatere et al 2006 considers eq 8a for modelling the transient cumulative infiltration data fig 1 a this equation is modified with the replacement of hydraulic conductivity as a function of sorptivity and the experimental steady state infiltration rate i s exp lt 1 using eq 8d leading to eqs 12a and 12b 12a k s i s exp a s 2 12b i t s t a 1 b s 2 b i s exp t where i s exp is estimated by linear regression analysis of the last data points describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot and corresponds to the slope of the regression line eq 12b is fitted to the experimental data to estimate sorptivity establishing a constraint like eq 12a between the estimator for s and the one for k s and inverting cumulative infiltration data through optimizing only sorptivity avoids parameter non uniqueness and increases the robustness of the inverse procedure the fit is performed by minimizing the classical objective function for cumulative infiltration as defined by eq 13 13 f s k s k i 1 k i exp t i i est t i 2 where k is the number of data points considered for the transient state i exp is the experimental cumulative infiltration and i est is the estimated cumulative infiltration using eq 12b once s is estimated ks is calculated by eq 12a as the infiltration model is valid only for the transient state the fit may not be valid for large values of k therefore best fits data for a minimum of five points to a maximum of n tot points representing the whole dataset for each data subset containing the first k points corresponding to a duration of the experiment equal to t k s and k s are estimated and the time t max t defined as the maximum time for which the transient expression can be considered valid is determined by eq 14 14 t max 1 4 1 b 2 s k s 2 where s k s 2 is the gravity time defined by philip 1969 then t k is compared with t max the values of s and k s are not considered valid unless t k is lower than t max among all values of s and k s that fulfill this condition the s and k s values corresponding to the largest k are retained since they are considered more precise according to yilmaz et al 2010 best slope may lead to erroneous k s values when i s exp a s 2 under such conditions attempting to estimate k s by eq 12a appears inappropriate more specifically when the estimated a s 2 value exceeds the measured infiltration rate at the end of the experiment the values obtained for k s are negative in the best intercept algorithm by yilmaz et al 2010 the constraint between s and k s is defined by using the intercept of the asymptotic expansion in eq 8c i e b s exp c s 2 k s fig 1b therefore b s exp is estimated by linear regression analysis of the data describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot and the following relationship eq 15 is applied to determine k s 15 k s c s 2 b s exp this procedure leads to the use of the division operator rather than the subtraction operator and thereby avoids obtaining negative values for the estimation of k s combining eqs 8a and 15 yields the following relationship eq 16 to fit onto the transient state of the experimental cumulative infiltration 16 i t s t a s 2 b c s 2 b s exp t eq 16 that is alternative to eq 12b is applied to determine s by the same procedure described for best slope including the assessment of the time validity of the transient infiltration model by calculation of t max the estimated sorptivity is then used to calculate k s by eq 15 the best steady algorithm by bagarello et al 2014c makes use of the intercept b s exp and the slope i s exp of the straight line fitted to the data describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot fig 1c combining eqs 12a and 15 which are related to the definition of the slope and the intercept of the steady state expansion yields eq 17 17 i s exp a s 2 c s 2 b s exp and hence s can be calculated eq 18 as 18 s i s exp a c b s exp then k s can be obtained by using either eq 12a or 15 or calculated as in eq 19 19 k s c i s exp a b s exp c in summary the infiltration experiment has to be performed until steady state conditions have been reached regardless of the algorithm but the data analysis procedure differs with the algorithm a fitting of the infiltration model to the transient data is common to best slope and best intercept that differ by the use of steady state conditions described by is exp for the former algorithm and bs exp for the latter one both of these last two terms are required by best steady that does not need data fitting for the transient stage of the run but relies solely on the steady state 3 field applications best methods have been largely cited 130 times according to scopus database and used 62 times the number of citation has been generally increasing over years with an average of 10 20 citations per year fig 2 a among these citations around half of the papers use the method corresponding to 5 10 papers per year note that the data for the year 2019 is not representative since this review paper was written at the very beginning of the year 2019 the beerkan protocol and the best methods were pioneered and developed in france braud et al 2005 lassabatere et al 2006 its development and improvement were intensively continued in italy bagarello et al 2014c it is not surprising to see that france and italy were the place for several uses of best fig 2b spain and netherlands are following in terms of citation and use in europe in further countries united states brazil china and iran were active in citing and using best methods however the rate of citation and use is a bit lower the dissemination of best methods can be considered as significant since the first version of best appeared in 2006 braud et al 2005 lassabatere et al 2006 i e less than 15 years ago the journals that published the papers citing best methods are listed in fig 2c most of the papers were published in the following journals decreasing order in terms of occurrences geoderma journal of hydrology soil science society of america journal hydrological processes and journal of hydrology and hydromechanics the papers using best methods are mainly published on geoderma and hydrological processes some original contributions on the study of biological activity and related effects on soil properties were published in more exotic journals like insects cheik et al 2019 as detailed above best methods provide the entire characterization of soil hydraulic functions i e water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which is of interest for the soil science agricultural and environmental communities consequently the panel of subjects treated by best users includes in decreasing order agricultural and biological sciences environmental science earth and planetary science and engineering fig 2d this sorting applies to either publications that only cite or use the methods with slight nuances the papers that use the best methods focus more on agricultural and biological science in more detail the best methods are applied to estimate the soil hydraulic properties with the following final aims understanding the physical processes of generation of water infiltration and runoff linking with soil erosion processes at surface characterization of flow pattern in the vadose zone prediction of the fate of pollutants transported by the infiltrating water table 1 some studies aim at optimizing the agricultural practices e g mubarak et al 2009 management of forests and burned

biological chemical and physical retroactions on physical processes of water flow in the soil clogging impacts on pore size thawing dissolution related macropores etc table 2 summarizes some of the still few studies that have provided comparisons of best predictions of soil hydraulic properties with those obtained by other methods in addition to the examples of applications and tests of best other papers deal with more fundamental aspects regarding the improvement of the methods and the analytical model used to fit the water infiltration data air entrapment is expected to affect these data given that they are collected in the field on an initially unsaturated porous medium e g loizeau et al 2017 however for many unsaturated zone applications determining saturated soil hydraulic properties directly in the field is considered to be the right way to proceed because most natural and man made infiltration processes result in significant air entrapment within the porous medium reynolds 1993 in the following we present aspects related to mathematical improvements and the use of best for specific soils 4 improving the mathematical algorithms best methods fits experimental data on the eqs 8 that describe the transient and steady states of water infiltration these equations correspond to approximate expansions of the quasi exact implicit model defined by haverkamp et al 1994 for water infiltration through a disc source under a null water pressure head the quality of best procedure strongly relies on the validity of this quasi exact implicit model and its related expansions in particular a concern is about the need to restrict the use of approximate expansions to their time validity intervals and thus to define the related time threshold moreover the choice of the values of parameters β and γ may be questioned since it may impact the values of best estimates these aspects are interrelated and discussed below focusing on the way to estimate the parameters β and γ the question of the choice of β and γ was the subject of several studies haverkamp et al 1994 related the shape parameter β to the soil diffusivity function d θ and the soil hydraulic conductivity function k θ smettem et al 1994 related the geometric parameter γ which corrects the simplified theoretical description of the lateral wetting front in the 3d infiltration model to the ratio between two estimators of the soil sorptivity s θ on these bases fuentes et al 1992 proposed the following direct formulations for parameters β and γ eqs 20 and 21 20 β θ i θ s 2 2 θ i θ s k θ k θ i k θ s k θ i θ s θ i θ θ i d θ d θ θ i θ s d θ d θ 21 γ θ i θ s 0 3 2 θ s θ i θ i θ s d θ d θ θ i θ s θ s θ 2 θ i d θ d θ the range of values of the shape and geometric parameters is not known a priori but a few studies have been conducted to investigate i the influence of β and γ on the validity domains for the approximated explicit expansions and ii the optimal choice of the infiltration parameters for mathematical reasons related to the integration method proposed by haverkamp et al 1990 the range of values for β was originally restricted to between zero and unity haverkamp et al 1994 ross et al 1995 however given the positive values of the integrals in eq 20 parameter β is restricted to values smaller than two the same constraint i e β 2 appears from the analysis of the very short and short time approximations of scaled cumulative infiltration lassabatere et al 2009 meaningful physics of flow requires that cumulative infiltration under both capillarity and gravity must remain higher than infiltration due to capillarity alone such condition implies that 2 β 3 0 i e β 2 this condition was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis conducted by lassabatere et al 2018 that showed how for β 2 the analytical models suffer from significant physical inconsistencies and must not be used at the lower limit when β is close to zero the quasi exact implicit equation for 1d infiltration corresponds to the green and ampt 1911 model lassabatere et al 2009 less investigated is the range validity of the geometric parameter γ the proportionality constant was introduced to correct the theoretically assumed value of γ 0 3 for the effect of disk curvature and gravity as well as the approximate estimation of sorptivity haverkamp et al 1994 this value was found to be too small when compared to experimental data and an optimal value of γ 0 75 was suggested smettem et al 1994 theoretically γ ranges from γ 0 6 corresponding to a soil with a δ function diffusivity to γ 0 78 for the case of a linear soil i e constant diffusivity thus for normal working conditions haverkamp et al 1994 concluded that the geometric parameter is bounded by 0 6 γ 0 8 at least in principle γ can simply be obtained from simultaneous measurements of 1d and 3d cumulative infiltration out of a concentric disk tension infiltrometer as the one by bagarello et al 2010 however establishing a true 1d infiltration below the inner disk requires specific conditions zhang et al 1999 and apart from the unique experiment conducted by smettem et al 1995 on a sandy loam soil there are no examples of experimental estimation of γ parameter in the literature a comprehensive analysis of the role of β on 1d dimensionless cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate equations was conducted by lassabatere et al 2009 who showed that both scaled functions decrease with the increase of β 0 2 the steady state condition is reached earlier and the transient state approximation is valid for longer times as β increases the authors compared the quasi exact analytical model with numerically simulated infiltration data obtained by hydrus šimŭnek et al 2006 for different soil types and initial saturation conditions to derive optimum values of parameters β and γ fig 3 a in particular the scaled quasi exact model i and the scaled difference 3d 1d δ i allowed to estimate optimal values of the proportionality constant β and γ fig 3b the theoretical linear trend between δ i and scaled time t was followed for loam and silt soils independently of the initial saturation degree and the optimized values of γ were close to the value of 0 75 suggested by smettem et al 1994 a substantially higher value of γ was observed for the sandy soil γ 1 03 a significant dependence on the initial saturation was observed only for the silty clay soil the optimized values of parameter β differed significantly from the common value of 0 6 suggested by haverkamp et al 1994 with a minimum of 0 334 for sand and a maximum of 1 56 for silt fig 3b the textural class of silty clay remained an exception as scaled numerically generated curves showed larger errors with infiltration data underestimated at low times t and overestimated at larger times t fig 3b silty clay the study proved that the analytical model can accurately describe both the 1d and 3d cumulative infiltrations for most soils provided that great care is taken to determine the values of infiltration parameters nasta et al 2012 using the best slope algorithm numerically evaluated sensitivity of η h g and k s to different combinations of parameters β and γ in their feasible ranges 0 β 2 0 6 γ 0 8 results confirmed that the considered values of the infiltration constants β 0 6 and γ 0 75 were not optimal for the three experimental soils by lassabatere et al 2006 and specific calibration of β and γ as a function of the soil type could significantly improve the estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters values out of the reasonable ranges were not discussed in previous studies and may deserve in depth investigations a proper definition of these constants could be obtained through fitting experimental data onto the quasi exact implicit formulation this approach was tested by latorre et al 2018 on numerically simulated 1d infiltration data to assess the sensitivity of the soil hydraulic properties s and k s and parameter β when inverting the quasi analytical solution with a fixed value of γ 0 75 in such a purpose these authors modelled several synthetic cumulative infiltrations and assessed the relative objective functions defined as the difference between a given target corresponding to target input parameters and modelled curves for different sets of input parameters for the considered loamy soil early infiltration times i e 100 s promoted a good estimation of s but not of k s and β a unique and well defined value of k s could be estimated for t 1000 s whereas an accurate estimate of β required a very long infiltration time overall using the default value of this parameter did not compromise estimation of s and k s the low sensitivity observed for β by latorre et al 2018 suggests that a downward infiltration experiment is not probably an appropriate technique to estimate this parameter an alternative approach to estimate the role of the infiltration parameters could be to compare the soil hydraulic properties obtained by best method to those independently measured with other experimental methods for beerkan infiltration experiments conducted on a sandy loam soil aiello et al 2014 applied the best slope and best intercept algorithms with different combinations of β and γ these authors compared the estimated curves with measured data for the water retention curve and concluded that the discrepancy depended on both β and γ however the discrepancy was more sensitive to β than γ thus suggesting that for the considered soil calibration is particularly important for the former parameter a good correspondence between the predicted and the experimental water retention data was detected when the original best slope algorithm was applied with the infiltration parameters set at β 1 9 and γ 0 79 the impact of the infiltration constants on the water retention scale parameter h g estimated by the three best algorithms i e slope intercept and steady was evaluated by castellini et al 2018 in particular they analytically showed that best intercept and best steady algorithms yield identical h g estimates that are independent of γ both infiltration parameters affect the estimates of h g with best slope comparison with water retention data measured by the evaporation laboratory method showed that h g was more sensitive to the selected β parameter for best slope than the other two algorithms furthermore the lack of a dependence of h g on γ for best intercept and best steady was associated with an overestimation of the water retention scale parameter for these two algorithms as compared to the original best slope algorithm it was concluded that best slope may lead to more accurate soil water retention estimates if specifically calibrated infiltration constants are used however the advantages of calibration are not substantial since specific calibration of β and γ for four differently textured soils led to only moderate improvement of estimation errors also suggesting that using the default values of infiltration constants does not worsen significantly the soil water retention curve estimation 5 best use for specific soils 5 1 very sorptive versus permeable soils three dimensional cumulative infiltration into an initially unsaturated porous medium typically exhibits a concave shape revealing that water infiltration is initially capillarity driven fig 4 a at the late phase of the process water flow is both capillarity and gravity driven and cumulative infiltration presents a more linear part representative of steady state conditions infiltration rates decrease with time during the transient phase of the process and then they become constant fig 4a under this optimum condition the three alternative best algorithms are expected to yield similar results in opposite under certain specific conditions the choice of the algorithm is known to influence the ability of best to yield physically sound soil parameters indeed the structure of the three best algorithms makes them differently sensitive to i non attainment of steady state and ii imprecise description of the transient state an example of non attainment of steady state was illustrated by gonzalez sosa et al 2010 their fig 6 b for a case in which steady state was not yet retained within the end of the run and the fit of the infiltration model was extended to all data points this is also depicted in fig 4b in such a case the estimation of slope and intercept of the line describing steady state on the cumulative infiltration graph can be erroneous and k s and s are expected to be miscalculated lassabatere et al 2013 effects of non attainment of steady state were studied by di prima et al 2016 using analytically generated data for five soils from sand to clay the implicit equation by haverkamp et al 1994 was applied to model infiltration of a fixed water volume through a 150 mm diameter soil surface under an initial effective saturation degree s e ranging from 0 to 0 8 depending on the run this wide range of s e values was considered because the initial soil water content should not exceed 0 25 θ s for a proper application of best methods lassabatere et al 2006 but wetter conditions can occur in practice xu et al 2012 2009 the analytically generated infiltration data were then inverted with the three best algorithms using the workbook proposed by di prima 2013 and considering total cumulative infiltration from 40 to 390 mm then the best deduced k s and s values were compared with the corresponding target values for sorptivity the relative error increased from negative to positive values with the volume of infiltrated water however the estimation of sorptivity was considered to remain quite robust and accurate with relative errors less than 5 in absolute value for almost all cases di prima et al 2016 the estimates of k s decreased with the total infiltrated volume regardless of the considered soil and initial s e value in particular all algorithms overestimated k s for small infiltrated water volumes best slope allowed in general to obtain accurate estimates of k s with less water and hence shorter experimental times than the other two algorithms however this method leads to a slight under estimation for large volumes remaining acceptable with relative errors close to 5 in most cases in conclusion the non attainment of steady state is expected to affect estimation of k s and s and long infiltration runs are advised to obtain a reliable characterization with best methods regarding the transient state best slope can fail as a consequence of an imprecise description of the transient state including only few points xu et al 2009 this case is depicted in fig 4c when the influence of capillary forces on the infiltration process is small in comparison with the gravity driven infiltration transient state is very short i e steady flow is quickly attained and cumulative infiltration data do not contain enough information on transient flow xu et al 2012 this drawback was illustrated by gonzalez sosa et al 2010 their fig 6a for the case of the early diminishment of the capillary force in such a case the optimization of soil sorptivity on infiltration data was performed only on few data points reducing the robustness of the inversion procedure gravity driven flow predominates for highly permeable soils but also for wet soils since the initial water content is high enough to limit the gradient between initial and final water pressure head and thus the capillarity driven flow the importance to collect an appropriate number of data points during the transient phase of the process to successfully apply some of the best algorithms was demonstrated by di prima et al 2016 using analytically generated infiltration data these authors increased the precision of the collected information by decreasing the cumulative infiltration interval from 5 mm to 2 5 mm fig 5b versus 5a as an example for a sandy clay loam soil with a relatively high initial saturation degree s e 0 5 a reading taken every 5 mm of infiltrated water determined the fifth data point to fall beyond the validity time interval of the transient state model leading to the failure of best slope and best intercept algorithms fig 5a in the case of readings every 2 5 mm the number of points used to describe the same curve doubled and allowed the selection of enough points for the description of the transient state and the success of best slope and best intercept algorithms fig 5b too imprecise description of the transient state may occur frequently on the field in particular for soils with macropores lassabatere et al 2019a these complicated situations may be compensated at least in part by an infiltration device such as the one developed by di prima 2015 and concialdi et al 2019 that allows collection of many data points at very short time intervals fig 5c the great advance of the device and its automation is that it does not require anyone once it is installed therefore anyone could set up more devices and run them at the same time data collection is automated and can be replicated without many efforts in the field in addition the mentioned device was designed by minimizing its cost in conclusion all algorithms require a proper attainment of steady state and a proper description of the transient state with real data lassabatere et al 2019a recommended to use all the three algorithms and to combine their estimates in order to include in the analysis of the experimental data all the advantages of each algorithm while reducing the impact of algorithm specific limitations on the accuracy of the estimates in particular the arithmetic means were considered to compute method averaged parameters since these parameters were found to be normally distributed 5 2 water repellent soils non attainment of steady state conditions during the infiltration run and too short duration or poor description of the transient stage of infiltration are possible eventualities for a process that occurs according to theory however there can also be cases in which the data are not consistent with the classical physics of infiltration and in these cases applicability of best methods is questionable lassabatere et al 2019a this is the case of hydrophobic soils when water infiltrates into these soils the advance of water during the early phase of wetting is impeded owing to hydrophobic surface films on soil particles resulting in a non zero contact angle between water and soil hallett et al 2001 jarvis et al 2008 water repellency can be detected by visually checking cumulative infiltration e g alagna et al 2019 di prima et al 2019 2017a lassabatere et al 2013 lassabatere et al 2019a lichner et al 2013 lozano baez et al 2018 for instance beatty and smith 2013 provided an explicative example showing the different shapes of the infiltration rate curves that could be obtained on several soils depending on the presence of an upper layer of organic matter and related hydrophobicity fig 6a three main types of shapes can be detected i a decreasing infiltration rate when water infiltrates into a mineral only soil ii increasing infiltration rate and iii decreasing before increasing infiltration rate fig 6b such trends result from the fact that two antagonist factors play at the same time the dissipation of the water pressure head gradient with time that triggers a decrease in infiltration rate and hydrophobicity that triggers an increase in infiltration rate depending on the relative contribution of the two factors different shapes may be obtained in terms of cumulative infiltration the configurations correspond to i regular shape with a concave part followed by a linear part ii a typical hockey stick like relationship and iii a mixed shape with a very small concave part followed by the hockey stick like shape fig 6a the impact of hydrophobicity on the shape of the cumulative infiltration influences best treatment of the data for example lozano baez et al 2018 applied both the best steady algorithm and the steady version of the simplified method based on a beerkan infiltration run ssbi method proposed by bagarello et al 2017b the ssbi method yielded always physically plausible estimates i e positive k s values on the contrary the failure of best steady was attribuited to the convex shaped cumulative infiltration curves that mainly occurred as a consequence of hydrophobicity although other factors such as heterogeneous soil structure changes in soil structure during the infiltration run initial soil moisture and temperature probably played some role in particular the negative intercept values yielded the failure of best steady but not of the ssbi method however the individual determinations of k s obtained by the two methods differed by no more than 2 4 times 2 in the 90 of the cases suggesting that the ssbi method was a good alternative method to analyze the infiltration data collected in problematic soil conditions 5 3 heterogeneous soils soil heterogeneity is more the rule than the exception heterogeneous soils are contrasting with homogeneous soils that exhibit quite uniform structure and small spatial variability at least two types of heterogeneous soils can be considered and will be treated in this review paper since these were investigated using best like methods i heterogeneity resulting from the concomitancy of several materials with contrasting hydraulic properties and ii soils that have complex and multi modal porosity systems including micro mesopores and macropores heterogeneous systems can also be sorted on the basis of the spatial scale we deal first with sealed soils and multi porosity multi permeability systems that exhibit heterogeneity at the small mm or less scale and then soils that are composed of several lithofacies at larger scales for these systems we show the specific implementations to be done to the usual best approach 5 3 1 sealed soils surface soil seals or crusts have usually a higher bulk density smaller pores and consequently a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity k s than the underlying soil assouline 2011 assouline and mualem 2002 mualem and assouline 1989 the presence of the seal layer influences substantially surface soil hydrological processes such as occurrence of hortonian runoff assouline and mualem 2006 chen et al 2013 vandervaere et al 1998 therefore interpreting and simulating surface hydrological processes in sealed or crusted soils presupposes as a starting point an appropriate hydraulic characterization of the porous medium particularly with reference to k s some work was done in the past two decades to adapt common infiltrometer methodologies for characterizing in situ the sealed soil layer vandervaere et al 1997 šimůnek et al 1998 alagna et al 2013 touma et al 2011 however the developed procedures remain largely untested they appear rather cumbersome especially from the experimental point of view and they could not work well in the case of a high field heterogeneity in this context a practically attractive line of research developed in the last decade is represented by the use of beerkan experimental runs and best algorithms to characterize the sealed soil layer and the underlying undisturbed soil several investigations have yielded encouraging results about the ability of the methodology to distinguish between the hydraulic properties of the two soil layers with a simple experiment alagna et al 2019 lassabatere et al 2010 souza et al 2014 they have also suggested that a beerkan run could be adapted to alter the exposed soil surface to some degree approximately reproducing what happens during intense rainfall events in such a way to obtain the hydraulic properties of an intentionally altered soil layer alagna et al 2018 2016a bagarello et al 2017a 2014a a question that emerged when the best methodologies were applied on a two layered system was what kind of information was really obtained with the experiment that is the hydrodynamic properties of the sealed layer alone or some kind of functionally averaged seal underlying soil properties therefore some recent investigations were specifically focused on giving an answer to this question di prima et al 2017b 2018 lassabatere et al 2010 were the first authors that applied best on a two layered soil system fig 7 a in particular they derived the unsaturated hydraulic properties of sediments and subsoil in two settlement basins in france the field infiltration experiments were performed with the classical beerkan run methodology on both the subsoil alone and the sediment subsoil system considering as an example the django reinhardt djr basin the cumulative infiltration i versus time t curve exhibited the regular concave shape fig 7b subsoil the presence of the sediment triggered a change in the shape of the cumulative infiltration curve since the asymptotic slope decreased and the concavity at the beginning increased fig 7b sediment these water infiltration data were treated with best methods to derive the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions sediments had less steep water retention curves than subsoils fig 7c which likely resulted from the greater capillarity effect in the former case the sediments displayed 4 5 times lower k s values than subsoil but in dry conditions they had a much higher hydraulic conductivity due to greater capillarity effects fig 7d finally the collected soil data were found to be usable for 1d numerical simulation of the flow process in sediment subsoil columns in brazil the original best methodology was applied by souza et al 2014 in non crusted and crusted locations which were visibly more compact hard and brittle when dry than the underlying soil that was more loose and friable the non crusted soil yielded higher s and k s values than the crusted soil the characteristic mean pore radii were similar between the two soil conditions but non crusted surfaces had a five times higher number of hydraulically active pores per unit area therefore souza et al 2014 concluded that the greater pore density was responsible of the greater conductivity detected in the non crusted soil crusted and non crusted soil surfaces were also sampled by alagna et al 2019 in a sicilian loamy soil and even these authors recognized the ability of the best experiment to characterize the sealed layer to prevent fracture of the upper layer during insertion of a 0 15 m diameter ring on crusted soil the soil outside the hedge of the ring was moistened with 5 cm3 of water by means of a syringe before insertion after ten minutes the ring was carefully inserted to a 0 01 m depth applying a slight pressure and a gentle rotation this site preparation was essential to prevent visible crust surface perturbation according to bagarello et al 2014a the height of water pouring on the infiltration surface is a degree of freedom of the experiment a high height of water pouring high h run can induce some disturbance of the exposed soil surface perhaps similar to that produced by a rainfall event inducing hortonian runoff generation whereas a run carried out as commonly prescribed by the beerkan protocol i e with low heights of water pouring low l run should yield more representative data for a soil that is not directly impacted by rainfall to test this idea four differently textured soils were sampled with beerkan runs and two heights of water application h w 0 03 and 1 5 m the effect of the height of water pouring was noticeable since the l runs yielded 11 5 35 2 times higher ks means than the h ones when surface soil deterioration was not completed during the infiltration run the gravitational potential energy e p of the water used for a run was an appropriate predictor of the expected changes in k s fig 8 a instead a soil alteration ending before concluding the infiltration run made e p a less useful parameter alagna et al 2016b conducted beerkan l and h runs in a sandy loam soil to verify if height of water pouring effects on k s and s varied with θ i 0 12 θ i 0 20 m 3 m 3 a low height of water pouring yielded 13 to 27 times higher k s means and 2 3 to 2 8 times higher s means than a high height depending on θ i therefore the height effects were particularly noticeable for k s a dry soil was more sensitive to the height of water pouring than a wet soil probably because there were more opportunities for aggregate breakdown compaction of the exposed soil surface and macropore obstruction in initially more macroporous conditions i e lower θ i and higher k s bagarello et al 2017a and alagna et al 2018 tested water pouring height effects in initially very wet soils making use of two types of two stage beerkan infiltration runs namely l1l2 and l1h2 in the former case 15 volumes of water are applied by an l run and then the sampled soil is allowed to drain for a short time then the same procedure is used to pour other 15 volumes of water with the l1h2 runs an h run is carried out in the second stage of infiltration the double two stage beerkan run methodology yielded infiltration rates at the end of the perturbing stage of the experiment of 0 2 0 3 sandy loam soil and 0 15 loam soil times those obtained with the initial non perturbing stage whereas without any perturbing effect infiltration rates at the end of the second run were 0 5 times those at the end of the first run therefore the methodology allowed to distinguish between a decrease in infiltration rate due to water redistribution during the drainage and that attributable to soil surface perturbation fig 8b and it was able to signal that the loam soil was 1 5 times more sensitive to disturbance effects induced by a high height of pouring than a sandy loam soil the usability of the collected data by low and high runs to simulate hydrological processes in sealed soils could be considered more a presumption than a certainty but some recent investigations by di prima et al 2018 2017b supported the practical usability of the methodology in particular di prima et al 2017b working in the field on a sandy loam soil compared rainfall simulation and beerkan infiltration experiments establishing a similarity between the gravitational potential energy of the applied water e p for the infiltration run and the simulated rainfall kinetic energy e k in particular the soil was sampled with best and two heights of water pouring 0 03 m i e the usual procedure and 0 34 m yielding e p e k then the experimental steady state infiltration rates i sr obtained with simulated rainfall experiments were compared with the k s values obtained with the two water pouring heights in order to discriminate between theoretically possible i sr k s and impossible i sr k s situations physically possible k s values were only obtained applying water at a relatively large distance from the soil surface fig 8c as a consequence of soil compaction and mechanical aggregate breakdown phenomena considering e p and e k was an effective way to establish a physical link between simulated hydrological process and soil hydraulic characterization di prima et al 2018 assessed the effect of soil sealing due to the repeated water application during beerkan experiments for three layered soils with different textures for the upper layer and they investigated the capability of best procedure to catch the formation of the seal and related consequences on water infiltration these authors carried out rainfall experiments to induce the formation of the seal and beerkan infiltration runs with different water pouring heights h and l runs l runs provided usual shapes fig 8d that could be easily treated with any best method in opposite the h runs exhibited a marked concave shape due to the progressive seal formation fig 8d affecting the treatment of the data among the three algorithms best steady which considers exclusively the late phase of the infiltration process i e when the seal is fully developed allowed a successful treatment of the h runs and lead to values close to those obtained by rainfall simulations this result proved that surface soil sealing processes generally occurred with both rainfall simulation experiments and h beerkan runs instead the l runs prevented the seal formation and thus revealed unable to mimic the effect of rain drop impact on soil structure during intense rainfall events 5 3 2 multi porosity and permeability systems due to the development of root systems or physical processes like wetting drying cycles or thawing freezing cycles the soil structure may evolve towards the formation of a macropore network allaire et al 2009 köhne et al 2009 in these cases the pore size distribution may be described using multi modal functions durner 1994 gerke and van genuchten 1993 consequently each pore system having its own capability of conducting water and then its peculiar hydraulic conductivity the soil bulk conductivity may be described also using multi modal functions dual porosity and permeability approaches were developed to account for such multi modal distributions for pore size and hydraulic conductivity e g gerke and van genuchten 1996 several studies based on best approach have dealt with the hydraulic characterization of such systems as a first approach gonzalez sosa et al 2010 studied the catchment of yzeron river region of rhône alpes east part of france including forest soils and developed a method for the determination of the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions accounting for the macropore system these authors used mini disk infiltrometers with water pressure head h fixed at 2 cm to deactivate the macropore system and sample the matrix only the runs performed with the mini disk infiltrometers were treated with best slope to characterize the matrix i the water contents measured below the device were used to estimate the matrix porosity ii the particle size distribution was treated to derive the shape parameters and iii the cumulative infiltrations were inverted to derive the shape parameters for the macropores the authors used large rings 40 cm in diameter to perform falling head experiments and derive the bulk saturated hydraulic conductivity corresponding to the activation of the porosity system including the macropore network the ring dimension was increased to be sure to sample the macropore network these authors supposed a linear increase for both water content and the natural logarithm of hydraulic conductivity between h 2 cm and h 0 the different water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions are depicted in fig 9 the combination of water infiltration experiments under ponded conditions using regular beerkan run and water tension at surface using a tension infiltrometer allows the quantification of the hydraulic fluxes with and without the activation of the macropores network on this basis lassabatere et al 2014 and lassabatere et al 2019b designed best 2k for the hydraulic characterization of dual permeability systems fig 10 to run best 2k method the following measures are needed in addition to the two water infiltration runs beerkan and tension infiltrometer a measure of water content at the end of the tension infiltrometer experiment a sample for the determination of the dry bulk density and of the particle size distribution psd and potentially the mineral density fig 10a in addition it requires guessing a previous estimate of the volume occupied by the fast flow region wf at first the bulk saturated water content θ s 2 k is derived from the dry bulk and the mineral densities then the water content measured at the end of the tension infiltrometer θ ti is used to derive the saturated water contents eqs 22a and 22b in the matrix and the fast flow zone lassabatere et al 2019b 22a θ s m θ ti 1 w f 22b θ s f θ s 2 k θ ti w f in an analogous way the two infiltration curves obtained with the beerkan method i b and the tension infiltrometer i ti are used to derive the cumulative infiltrations corresponding to beerkan experiments for the matrix and the fast flow regions eqs 23a and 23b 23a i b m i ti 1 w f 23b i b f i b i ti w f lastly the psd is fitted to bimodal functions to derive the parameters related to the smaller and larger particles eq 24 24 ff 2 k d τ f 1 d g f d n f m f 1 τ f 1 d g m d n m m m where ff 2 k d is the cumulative distribution of particle size d is the particle diameter τ f is the fractional contribution of the particles in the fast flow region unknown a priori d g is the average diameter of either particle size mode and n and m are textural parameters related by the expression m 1 2 n the shape parameters of the matrix n m η m and the fast flow region n f η f are estimated from the values of the psd shape parameters m m n m and m f n f using the regular best method pedotransfer function then the two water infiltration curves i b m and i b f are treated using best methods to derive the whole set of hydraulic parameters given that the saturated water contents θ s m θ s f were already estimated using eqs 22 both the fast flow and the matrix regions are assumed to follow the same equations for the description of their water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions i e eqs 1 and 2 the bulk water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions can then be retrieved using eqs 25a and 25b 25a θ 2 k h w f θ f h 1 w f θ m h 25b k 2 k θ w f k f θ f 1 w f k m θ m where subscripts m and f refer to the matrix and the fast flow region respectively therefore best 2 k was designed to estimate the whole set of the local hydraulic parameters for the matrix region θ r m θ s m h g m k s m n m and η m and the fast flow region θ r f θ s f h g f k s f n f and η f given that residual water contents are considered as negligible i e equaled to zero the use of best 2k on analytically generated data validated the approach and allowed the determination of the errors linked to these assumptions when the dual permeability media are made of contrasting matrix and fast flow regions and when the water pressure head is chosen adequately best 2k achieves a proper hydraulic characterization however when experimental data is used the experimental errors could make it difficult to compute the dual permeability function in particular regular protocols and devices make it complicated to sample very precisely the transient state of the beerkan run in fact the beerkan run is dominated by the influence of the fast flow region with a very fast infiltration and a very short transient state fig 10b and c consequently the run of best methods to curves that are close to linear makes it complicated to estimate the scale parameter for water pressure head h g f however best 2k performed well for several tests and proved efficient to provide the complete hydraulic curves for the dual permeability systems fig 10d finally there should be no differences between running a tension infiltrometer run plus a beerkan test or running the tension infiltrometer with two pressure heads one negative and the other close to zero however the use of beerkan runs ensures that the soil will be completely saturated at the surface in opposite the use of the tension infiltrometer may be tricky and full saturation may not be attained when using such a device in addition the contact between the soil and the membrane and or the need for a sand layer may constitute an additional drawback 5 3 3 soil systems and deposits made of contrasting materials soil systems like glaciofluvial deposits or alluvial deposits are made of contrasting materials in terms of soil particles and consequently hydraulic properties the dynamics of particle deposition that form glaciofluvial deposits is quite chaotic and highly conditioned by the formation of braided streams in each stream lower velocity zones are prone to the deposition of very fine clayey materials whereas higher velocity parts are the place for the deposition of coarser materials sand gravel rocks glaciofluvial deposits are thus the typical examples of very heterogeneous soil systems with large spatial variability at the scale of the meter or the dozens of meters this type of system was already investigated in the east region of lyon goutaland et al 2013 goutaland et al 2008 these authors dug several trenches in the deposit and sampled the matrices to characterize the spatial variability of the particle size distribution over the trenches fig 11 all the samples could be sorted in four distinct lithofacies using the miall code miall 1977 that defines a typology of lithofacies as a function of both texture particle size distribution and structure particle arrangement the main lithofacies which constitutes most of the body of the deposit is a mixture of gravel and a sandy matrix with a bimodal particle size distribution fig 11a referred to as bimodal gravel two other lithofacies form inclusions embedded in the main lithofacies a well sorted sandy matrix inclusions of dimensions of several meters referred to as sand and an open framework matrix free gravel forming smaller inclusions referred to as matrix free gravel lastly the body of the deposit is covered with an upper layer involving a mixture of a sandy matrix and gravel referred to as gravel with matrix following this procedure a stratigraphic model was completed over a section of 13 5 m in length and 2 5 m in height fig 11b at larger scales sedimentological units were determined using the ground penetrating radar gpr however the gpr profiles provide information at the unit scale and do not provide a clear picture at the lithofacies scale or only for the biggest lithofacies like the upper layer and the sandy lenses e g coutinho et al 2015 on the basis of the stratigraphic model goutaland et al 2013 defined a hydro stratigraphic model these authors performed beerkan runs and used best methods to derive the hydraulic properties for each lithofacies fig 11c they positioned the rings above each lithofacies some of them necessitating digging part of the upper horizons they also confirmed their results by sampling lithofacies in other experimental sites where the glaciofluvial deposits were still forming allowing all types of lithofacies accessible at the surface goutaland et al 2013 the coarsest material i e the matrix free gravel lead to linear water infiltration curves without any concavity as the result of a very short transient state typical of very permeable soils consequently best methods could not be used for these cases the arya paris model arya and paris 1981 was used to derive the water retention function and then the relative hydraulic conductivity goutaland et al 2013 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was equaled to the final flow rate and combined with values from the literature finally the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions could be determined for the four lithofacies leading to the determination of hydrofacies fig 11c however the estimates sounds meaning on a physical ground and proved efficient for modelling water flow in this type of heterogeneous deposit the combination of the stratigraphic model description of 2d section and 3d blocks with the hydraulic properties of each hydrofacies allowed the determination of hydro stratigraphic models usable for the prediction of flow goutaland et al 2013 the hydro stratigraphic model was used for several numerical studies to predict preferential flows in the glaciofluvial deposit ben slimene et al 2017 worked on the influence on each lithofacies of the degree of heterogeneity of flow these authors considered the hydro stratigraphic section presented above fig 11 with all its complexity along with simpler scenarios in terms of lithological heterogeneity fig 12 the authors modelled the responses of all these sections when submitted to a constant flow rate at surface and for initial conditions after a long draining phase these authors clearly demonstrated that lithological heterogeneity induced preferential flow and in particular funneled flow at the interface between fine and coarse materials preferential flow was much marked under unsaturated conditions that promote the capillary barrier effect with lower hydraulic conductivity of coarser materials it was proven that under these conditions the sandy and the gravel inclusions drained and exhibited a lower hydraulic conductivity than the predominant lithofacies resulting in deviation of flow at the top boundaries of these inclusions the influence of inclusions was related to their size with the development of larger preferential flow paths at the surrounding of the sandy lenses because of their larger sizes in particular the smaller lenses of gravel have only a local role fig 12 it was also proved that sandy and gravel inclusions did not modify drastically the bulk hydraulic conductivity at the scale of the section in opposite to layers layers in particular when constituted of finer material with lower hydraulic conductivity may impede flow at the scale of the section and their impact should be quantified when modelling flow at larger scale is targeted these studies demonstrate that heterogeneous systems that are made of contrasting materials may be investigated using best methods however these investigations require that all the lithofacies can be sampled with the beerkan experiments this situation may be complicated when some of them are below several layers in such a case analogous lithofacies can be sampled in the deposit that are still forming and that expose all the lithofacies to the surface as proposed by goutaland et al 2013 6 concluding remarks best is a very promising tool for performing a complete soil hydraulic characterization directly in the field since it relies on a robust theory and needs limited experimental resources and workloads the large interest for the procedure documented in this article represents a stimulus to go ahead on our knowledge of best potentials and limitations and hence to develop several issues of both scientific and practical relevance in most cases for regular soils a beerkan run provides accurate descriptions of cumulative infiltrations at both transient and steady states fig 13 regular soils in this case all best methods are efficient to retrieve the soil hydraulic functions the three methods best slope intercept and steady should be used and the averages between parameters should be considered to build the hydraulic functions however specific soils and conditions may arise and spoil the use of best methods water repellency is often one of these specific conditions in particular when beerkan runs are performed after a long dry period hydrophobicity may impede flow at short times leading to specific convex or hockey stick like shapes fig 13 water repellent soils in such cases best slope and intercept that requires a concave shape do not work and cannot be applied in certain cases best steady may lead to results in particular when the intercept is positive however the experimental steady state asymptote is impacted by flow impediment at the beginning of the infiltration run and does not represent water infiltration under regular circumstances related estimates should not be considered as mentioned above water infiltration may not sample both transient and steady states for very fine soils with very low permeability fig 13 very fine soils the attainment of steady state may require a very long experiment not feasible with regular means and devices in such a case all the best methods may work however the final infiltration rate will be over estimated leading to potentially erroneous estimates in opposite for very permeable soils fig 13 very coarse soils the transient state is restricted to very short time and not easy to sample with the regular beerkan protocol in this case only best steady may provide values however the parameter h g linked to the intercept of the asymptotic regime requires a very consistent and precise estimate of the intercept soils may contain macropores conveying them a very permeable behavior close to saturation fig 13 soils with macropores the shape of cumulative infiltration may resemble that of very permeable soils leading to similar difficulties i e the need to use best steady and the difficulty to determine precisely the steady state asymptote intercept however it may be considered that the best methods are dedicated to single permeability soils the related estimates may not be representative of the dual permeability soils lastly sealing may occur during the water infiltration experiments if a special care is not taken to avoid soil disturbance at surface fig 13 sealed soils in this case the extra concavity may prevent any use of best slope and intercept however even if best steady may provide some estimates it may be borne in mind that best are not dedicated to sealed soils and that related estimates may not be representative of the real behavior of the soil to mitigate these shortcomings and address these specific types of soils several investigations are conducted firstly automated devices are developed to improve the sampling of the transient and steady states in particular for very fine or coarse soils the new best 2 k is under development for an accurate and consistent characterization of dual permeability soils ongoing research deal with the development of best methods for water repellent soils and sealing soils for these soils the combinations of l and h runs that prevent or trigger sealing may be of good help a point needing consideration is checking best against alternative methods to determine the soil hydraulic properties only a few contributions can be found in the literature although these comparisons provide one of the few sources of information that practitioners can draw upon to select appropriate measurement methods for their circumstances reynolds et al 2000 much research has been focused on infiltration but there are still problems that need to be fixed in particular the choice of proper values of β and γ still requires further investigations and the mathematical approach developed in best methods can also be improved regarding other aspects in particular the definition of time validity intervals for the use of the approximate expansions is still unclear to avoid this issue a few studies have tried to replace the use of the approximate expansions with the quasi exact implicit formulation in the fitting process latorre et al 2018 latorre et al 2013 with these approaches all the points are directly fitted to the quasi exact implicit model that is valid for any time thus avoiding the need for selecting subsets of data points for the transient and steady states however these procedures are computationally intensive since the model is implicit thus requiring the combination of two inverting procedures which may slow down calculation processes and increase the risk of non convergence these approaches need then to be tested in more depth with both numerically generated and real experimental data the existing information supports the usability of the best procedure for the hydraulic characterization of sealed soils since the data collected at the soil surface can be assigned to the seal layer and removing this layer allows characterization of the underlying undisturbed soil of course the available information is encouraging but not exhaustive therefore it is still not possible to suggest that the methodology can generally be used in sealed soils or as a means to induce sealing instead there are different issues still needing confirmation clarification and developments primarily it is necessary to support the conclusion that best gives the exact hydraulic characteristics of the seal layer by sampling other sealed soils the testing procedures developed by di prima et al 2018 2017b appear appropriate to yield a robust information both in the field and the laboratory at this purpose additional experimental investigations on the applicability of the methodology are particularly necessary in initially dry soil conditions since water repellency can also impede infiltration into the sealed layer lassabatere et al 2010 and ring insertion could remain very complicated even with the pre wetting procedure by alagna et al 2019 due to the fragility of the porous medium in such cases research needs can also be delineated with reference to the low high beerkan run methodology for example a question to be considered is that the same energy can be supplied to the soil by using small water volumes and high heights of pouring or more water and lower heights of pouring another point needing consideration is to see how surface soil alteration evolves with time and particularly if soil characteristics stabilize after a certain time approaching a fully developed seal layer assouline and mualem 2002 and if best is able to capture a possible recovery of the soil properties after disturbance best 2k seems practical for the determination of the water retention and hydraulic function of dual permeability soils however this method relies on several assumptions that need some investigations regarding the treatment of the particle size distribution the value of shape parameters of the smaller mode is assigned to the matrix and the value of the larger mode is assigned to the fast flow region it means implicitly that the matrix is made of small particles whereas the fast flow region is surrounded by larger particles this statement seems logical but under certain circumstances the fast flow region may correspond to cracks and fractures being surrounded by the particles of the matrix this implicit link between particle size and pore size could maybe be questionable another critical issue concerns the hypothesis of the entire deactivation of the fast flow region indeed the sets of equations used for the determination of saturated water contents and of cumulative infiltration into the matrix and the fast flow regions assume that the deactivation of the fast flow region is complete in fact deactivation may be partial with infiltration into the walls of the larger macropores similarly a part of the water content θ ti may be retained in the fast flow region leading to erroneous estimates of the saturated water contents θ s m and θ s f the third assumption that may be criticized states that the matrix behave in the same way at saturation and at the value of the water pressure head used for the tension infiltration experiments it means that the water content remains the same when the water pressure head is decreased from zero to the value applied with the infiltrometer it also means that cumulative infiltrations obtained when using the tension infiltrometer or the beerkan method remains similar these assumptions could be invalid depending on the matrix properties lastly the estimation of the void fraction occupied by the fast flow region w f is one of the shortcoming of the methods this parameter must be chosen a priori and requires additional data for its estimation declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

6290,theories and models used in soil hydrological sciences rely on the knowledge of the spatially and temporally variable soil hydraulic properties i e the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves obtaining reliable experimental information on these curves for an area of interest is not easy and it still remains a challenge for soil scientists in 2006 a simple and physically based methodology was proposed to completely characterize the soil using a single ring infiltration experiment in the field and determination of soil particle size distribution initial and final soil water content and dry soil bulk density this methodology named best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters has received great attention and interest from the worldwide scientific community and it

jaramillo et al 2000 iovino et al 2017 interpreting and simulating soil water processes is complicated since obtaining reliable measurements of those parameters that the models rely on is difficult clothier 2016 especially close to or at saturation soil hydraulic properties strongly depend on the often fragile structure of the porous medium jarvis et al 2013 consequently the experimental information on soil properties varies in dependence of many factors such as sample size established flow geometry for the experiment or sample collection procedure and there are no independent data upon which evaluations and judgments can be made reynolds et al 2000 therefore determining field soil hydraulic properties still remains a challenge for soil scientists angulo jaramillo et al 2016 particularly in the last three decades soil hydraulic characterization by infiltration based methodologies has been given a substantial boost essentially thanks to the development of a robust theory of the established flow processes e g reynolds and elrick 1990 1991 1987 smith et al 2002 moreover infiltration experiments are generally carried out directly in the field and they are relatively easy to perform consequently the functional connection between the sampled soil volume and the surrounding soil is maintained which assures that the collected data are representative of the infiltration process at the sampled point scale bouma 1982 and the experiment can be replicated at many points and times with sustainable resources and workloads this circumstance favors the passage from a point to an areal and time representative information which is crucial since soil hydraulic properties can exhibit a great spatial and temporal variability prieksat et al 1994 warrick 1998 most of the available infiltration methods and procedures were developed with the specific objective to determine the soil hydraulic conductivity at or close to saturation however interpreting and modelling hydrological processes need more information than near saturated soil hydraulic conductivity alone starting from this premise lassabatere et al 2006 developed a new method to completely characterize the soil i e to estimate soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curve on the basis of a very simple field infiltration experiment that could also be carried out with a beer can cut to give a ring and some additional information on particle size distribution initial and final soil water content and dry soil bulk density the procedure named best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters combines pedotransfer functions to estimate the shape parameters of the hydraulic curves with a measurement of water infiltration that yields the scale parameters of these curves best has received considerable interest from the scientific community many applications and checks of the procedure and some theoretical developments have been accomplished in only one decade best was designed with reference to ideal situations i e for uniformly unsaturated rigid and homogeneous soils but some investigations have suggested that the procedure works satisfactorily even in non ideal conditions such as for example when a sealed layer is present at the soil surface moreover some efforts have been made very recently to extend the methodology originally thought for single permeability soils to the hydraulic characterization of dual permeability soils lassabatere et al 2019b therefore best methods could have great interest to make a complete field soil hydraulic characterization practically possible with sustainable efforts and on the basis of a robust physical theory of course not all has been made and there is still much work to be done as for example making more comparisons with other methods to characterize the soil and establishing best performances in particular situations such as soils affected by sub critical water repellency the objective of this review paper is to take the reader into the best world in particular the best procedure of soil transfer parameter estimation is initially illustrated then an overview of the use that has been made of this procedure up to now in the world is provided subsequently the infiltration equation used by the procedure is discussed from both a theoretical and a practical point of view in particular the choice of the parameters of the equation and its performances in dependence of the available information for the transient and steady state phases of the process are discussed then the application of best is presented with specific reference to various types of soil heterogeneity that is sealed soils multi porosity and permeability systems and porous media of contrasting materials at the end of the paper some indications and perspectives are drawn 2 the best procedure the best procedure of soil hydraulic characterization developed by lassabatere et al 2006 allows simultaneous estimation of the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves by a limited experimental information that includes particle size distribution psd of the soil dry soil bulk density cumulative three dimensional 3d infiltration and

cm according to lassabatere et al 2006 is inserted a short distance e g 0 5 1 cm into the soil to pour water volumes at soil surface while avoiding lateral loss of ponded water a fixed small volume of water in the order of hundreds of cm3 vw l3 is poured into the cylinder at time t t zero to establish a small ponded head of water e g 1 cm and the time elapsed during infiltration of the known volume of water is measured when the first volume has completely infiltrated a second volume of water equal to vw is added to the cylinder and the time needed for it to infiltrate is measured the procedure is repeated for about 8 to 15 known volumes to allow flow into the soil to nearly stabilize lassabatere et al 2006 and cumulative infiltration i l is recorded finally the dataset is made up of a number of ntot discrete points ti ii describing an experimental cumulative infiltration curve at the end of the infiltration run the saturated soil in the ring is sampled to determine the gravimetric saturated water content ws mm 1 the volumetric saturated soil water content can be estimated by θ s w s ρ d as suggested by lassabatere et al 2006 soil porosity f calculated from the bulk ρ d and mineral ρ s densities was used as an estimate of θ s in several applications of the method bagarello et al 2011 mubarak et al 2010 2009 xu et al 2009 yilmaz et al 2010 to obtain the shape parameters of the hydraulic curves the psd is fitted to the following equations 3a f d 1 d g d n m 3b m 1 2 n where f d is the cumulative frequency associated with diameter d l m and n are two shape parameters and d g l is a scale parameter the fit provides an estimate of parameters m n and d g the shape index of the medium p m can then be estimated from m and n by 4a p m p m 1 κ 1 4b p m mn 1 m 4c p m mn 1

values of p m considering the positive root of eq 4b 7 m 1 p m 1 p m 2 1 the n and η parameters are then estimated from eqs 1b and 2b if particle size is only known for three fractions i e clay silt

hydraulic conductivity k s lt 1 best makes use of the experimental data obtained with the beerkan method and the approximations of the quasi exact implicit infiltration model by haverkamp et al 1994 these authors consider that for an infiltration experiment with zero water pressure head on a circular surface of radius r l above a uniform soil with a uniform water content θ i l3 l 3 the 3d cumulative infiltration i l and the infiltration rate i lt 1 can be approached by the following explicit transient eqs 8a and 8b and steady state eqs 8c and 8d expressions haverkamp et al 1994 8a i t s t a s 2 b k s t 8b i t s 2 t a s 2 b k s 8c i s t a s 2 k s t c s 2 k s 8d i s t a s 2 k s where i s and i s are the asymptotic models for i and i for large times t t is the time and a l 1 b and c are constants that can be defined for the specific case of a brooks and corey 1964 relationship as 9a a γ r θ s θ i 9b b 2 β 3 1 θ i θ s η θ i θ s η 9c c 1 2 1 β 1 θ i θ s η l n 1 β where β and γ are coefficients that are commonly set at 0 6 and 0 75 respectively for θ i 0 25 θ s haverkamp et al 1994 smettem et al 1994 the scale parameter of the water retention curve h g l is obtained from the previous estimates of shape parameters sorptivity and saturated hydraulic conductivity as follows 10 h g s 2 c p θ s θ i 1 θ i θ s η k s in which c p is given by 11 c p γ 1 1 n γ m η 1 n γ m η γ m η m 1 n γ m η m where γ stands for the gamma function for the derivation of k s and s different best algorithms were proposed that differ by the way eqs 8 are fitted to the experimental infiltration data angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the original best slope algorithm lassabatere et al 2006 considers eq 8a for modelling the transient cumulative infiltration data fig 1 a this equation is modified with the replacement of hydraulic conductivity as a function of sorptivity and the experimental steady state infiltration rate i s exp lt 1 using eq 8d leading to eqs 12a and 12b 12a k s i s exp a s 2 12b i t s t a 1 b s 2 b i s exp t where i s exp is estimated by linear regression analysis of the last data points describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot and corresponds to the slope of the regression line eq 12b is fitted to the experimental data to estimate sorptivity establishing a constraint like eq 12a between the estimator for s and the one for k s and inverting cumulative infiltration data through optimizing only sorptivity avoids parameter non uniqueness and increases the robustness of the inverse procedure the fit is performed by minimizing the classical objective function for cumulative infiltration as defined by eq 13 13 f s k s k i 1 k i exp t i i est t i 2 where k is the number of data points considered for the transient state i exp is the experimental cumulative infiltration and i est is the estimated cumulative infiltration using eq 12b once s is estimated ks is calculated by eq 12a as the infiltration model is valid only for the transient state the fit may not be valid for large values of k therefore best fits data for a minimum of five points to a maximum of n tot points representing the whole dataset for each data subset containing the first k points corresponding to a duration of the experiment equal to t k s and k s are estimated and the time t max t defined as the maximum time for which the transient expression can be considered valid is determined by eq 14 14 t max 1 4 1 b 2 s k s 2 where s k s 2 is the gravity time defined by philip 1969 then t k is compared with t max the values of s and k s are not considered valid unless t k is lower than t max among all values of s and k s that fulfill this condition the s and k s values corresponding to the largest k are retained since they are considered more precise according to yilmaz et al 2010 best slope may lead to erroneous k s values when i s exp a s 2 under such conditions attempting to estimate k s by eq 12a appears inappropriate more specifically when the estimated a s 2 value exceeds the measured infiltration rate at the end of the experiment the values obtained for k s are negative in the best intercept algorithm by yilmaz et al 2010 the constraint between s and k s is defined by using the intercept of the asymptotic expansion in eq 8c i e b s exp c s 2 k s fig 1b therefore b s exp is estimated by linear regression analysis of the data describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot and the following relationship eq 15 is applied to determine k s 15 k s c s 2 b s exp this procedure leads to the use of the division operator rather than the subtraction operator and thereby avoids obtaining negative values for the estimation of k s combining eqs 8a and 15 yields the following relationship eq 16 to fit onto the transient state of the experimental cumulative infiltration 16 i t s t a s 2 b c s 2 b s exp t eq 16 that is alternative to eq 12b is applied to determine s by the same procedure described for best slope including the assessment of the time validity of the transient infiltration model by calculation of t max the estimated sorptivity is then used to calculate k s by eq 15 the best steady algorithm by bagarello et al 2014c makes use of the intercept b s exp and the slope i s exp of the straight line fitted to the data describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot fig 1c combining eqs 12a and 15 which are related to the definition of the slope and the intercept of the steady state expansion yields eq 17 17 i s exp a s 2 c s 2 b s exp and hence s can be calculated eq 18 as 18 s i s exp a c b s exp then k s can be obtained by using either eq 12a or 15 or calculated as in eq 19 19 k s c i s exp a b s exp c in summary the infiltration experiment has to be performed until steady state conditions have been reached regardless of the algorithm but the data analysis procedure differs with the algorithm a fitting of the infiltration model to the transient data is common to best slope and best intercept that differ by the use of steady state conditions described by is exp for the former algorithm and bs exp for the latter one both of these last two terms are required by best steady that does not need data fitting for the transient stage of the run but relies solely on the steady state 3 field applications best methods have been largely cited 130 times according to scopus database and used 62 times the number of citation has been generally increasing over years with an average of 10 20 citations per year fig 2 a among these citations around half of the papers use the method corresponding to 5 10 papers per year note that the data for the year 2019 is not representative since this review paper was written at the very beginning of the year 2019 the beerkan protocol and the best methods were pioneered and developed in france braud et al 2005 lassabatere et al 2006 its development and improvement were intensively continued in italy bagarello et al 2014c it is not surprising to see that france and italy were the place for several uses of best fig 2b spain and netherlands are following in terms of citation and use in europe in further countries united states brazil china and iran were active in citing and using best methods however the rate of citation and use is a bit lower the dissemination of best methods can be considered as significant since the first version of best appeared in 2006 braud et al 2005 lassabatere et al 2006 i e less than 15 years ago the journals that published the papers citing best methods are listed in fig 2c most of the papers were published in the following journals decreasing order in terms of occurrences geoderma journal of hydrology soil science society of america journal hydrological processes and journal of hydrology and hydromechanics the papers using best methods are mainly published on geoderma and hydrological processes some original contributions on the study of biological activity and related effects on soil properties were published in more exotic journals like insects cheik et al 2019 as detailed above best methods provide the entire characterization of soil hydraulic functions i e water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which is of interest for the soil science agricultural and environmental communities consequently the panel of subjects treated by best users includes in decreasing order agricultural and biological sciences environmental science earth and planetary science and engineering fig 2d this sorting applies to either publications that only cite or use the methods with slight nuances the papers that use the best methods focus more on agricultural and biological science in more detail the best methods are applied to estimate the soil hydraulic properties with the following

still few studies that have provided comparisons of best predictions of soil hydraulic properties with those obtained by other methods in addition to the examples of applications and tests of best other papers deal with more fundamental aspects regarding the improvement of the methods and the analytical model used to fit the water infiltration data air entrapment is expected to affect these data given that they are collected in the field on an initially unsaturated porous medium e g loizeau et al 2017 however for many unsaturated zone applications determining saturated soil hydraulic properties directly in the field is considered to be the right way to proceed because most natural and man made infiltration processes result in significant air entrapment within the porous medium reynolds 1993 in the following we present aspects related to mathematical improvements and the use of best for specific soils 4 improving the mathematical algorithms best methods fits experimental data on the eqs 8 that describe the transient and steady states of water infiltration these equations correspond to approximate expansions of the quasi exact implicit model defined by haverkamp et al 1994 for water infiltration through a disc source under a null water pressure head the quality of best procedure strongly relies on the validity of this quasi exact implicit model and its related expansions in particular a concern is about the need to restrict the use of approximate expansions to their time validity intervals and thus to define the related time threshold moreover the choice of the values of parameters β and γ may be questioned since it may impact the values of best estimates these aspects are interrelated and discussed below focusing on the way to estimate the parameters β and γ the question of the choice of β and γ was the subject of several studies haverkamp et al 1994 related the shape parameter β to the soil diffusivity function d θ and the soil hydraulic conductivity function k θ smettem et al 1994 related the geometric parameter γ which corrects the simplified theoretical description of the lateral wetting front in the 3d infiltration model to the ratio between two estimators of the soil sorptivity s θ on these bases fuentes et al 1992 proposed the following direct formulations for parameters β and γ eqs 20 and 21 20 β θ i θ s 2 2 θ i θ s k θ k θ i k θ s k θ i θ s θ i θ θ i d θ d θ θ i θ s d θ d θ 21 γ θ i θ s 0 3 2 θ s θ i θ i θ s d θ d θ θ i θ s θ s θ 2 θ i d θ d θ the range of values of the shape and geometric parameters is not known a priori but a few studies have been conducted to investigate i the influence of β and γ on the validity domains for the approximated explicit expansions and ii the optimal choice of the infiltration parameters for mathematical reasons related to the integration method proposed by haverkamp et al 1990 the range of values for β was originally restricted to between zero and unity haverkamp et al 1994 ross et al 1995 however given the positive values of the integrals in eq 20 parameter β is restricted to values smaller than two the same constraint i e β 2 appears from the analysis of the very short and short time approximations of scaled cumulative infiltration lassabatere et al 2009 meaningful physics of flow requires that cumulative infiltration under both capillarity and gravity must remain higher than infiltration due to capillarity alone such condition implies that 2 β 3 0 i e β 2 this condition was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis conducted by lassabatere et al 2018 that showed how for β 2 the analytical models suffer from significant physical inconsistencies and must not be used at the lower limit when β is close to zero the quasi exact implicit equation for 1d infiltration corresponds to the green and ampt 1911 model lassabatere et al 2009 less investigated is the range validity of the geometric parameter γ the proportionality constant was introduced to correct the theoretically assumed value of γ 0 3 for the effect of disk curvature and gravity as well as the approximate estimation of sorptivity haverkamp et al 1994 this value was found to be too small when compared to experimental data and an optimal value of γ 0 75 was suggested smettem et al 1994 theoretically γ ranges from γ 0 6 corresponding to a soil with a δ function diffusivity to γ 0 78 for the case of a linear soil i e constant diffusivity thus for normal working conditions haverkamp et al 1994 concluded that the geometric parameter is bounded by 0 6 γ 0 8 at least in principle γ can simply be obtained from simultaneous measurements of 1d and 3d cumulative infiltration out of a concentric disk tension infiltrometer as the one by bagarello et al 2010 however establishing a true 1d infiltration below the inner disk requires specific conditions zhang et al 1999 and apart from the unique experiment conducted by smettem et al 1995 on a sandy loam soil there are no examples of experimental estimation of γ parameter in the literature a comprehensive analysis of the role of β on 1d dimensionless cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate equations was conducted by lassabatere et al 2009 who showed that both scaled functions decrease with the increase of β 0 2 the steady state condition is reached earlier and the transient state approximation is valid for longer times as β increases the authors compared the quasi exact analytical model with numerically simulated infiltration data obtained by hydrus šimŭnek et al 2006 for different soil types and initial saturation conditions to derive optimum values of parameters β and γ fig 3 a in particular the scaled quasi exact model i and the scaled difference 3d 1d δ i allowed to estimate optimal values of the proportionality constant β and γ fig 3b the theoretical linear trend between δ i and scaled time t was followed for loam and silt soils independently of the initial saturation degree and the optimized values of γ were close to the value of 0 75 suggested by smettem et al 1994 a substantially higher value of γ was observed for the sandy soil γ 1 03 a significant dependence on the initial saturation was observed only for the silty clay soil the optimized values of parameter β differed significantly from the common value of 0 6 suggested by haverkamp et al 1994 with a minimum of 0 334 for sand and a maximum of 1 56 for silt fig 3b the textural class of silty clay remained an exception as scaled numerically generated curves showed larger errors with infiltration data underestimated at low times t and overestimated at larger times t fig 3b silty clay the study proved that the analytical model can accurately describe both the 1d and 3d cumulative infiltrations for most soils provided that great care is taken to determine the values of infiltration parameters nasta et al 2012 using the best slope algorithm numerically evaluated sensitivity of η h g and k s to different combinations of parameters β and γ in their feasible ranges 0 β 2 0 6 γ 0 8 results confirmed that the considered values of the infiltration constants β 0 6 and γ 0 75 were not optimal for the three experimental soils by lassabatere et al 2006 and specific calibration of β and γ as a function of the soil type could significantly improve the estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters values out of the reasonable ranges were not discussed in previous studies and may deserve in depth investigations a proper definition of these constants could be obtained through fitting experimental data onto the quasi exact implicit formulation this approach was tested by latorre et al 2018 on numerically simulated 1d infiltration data to assess the sensitivity of the soil hydraulic properties s and k s and parameter β when inverting the quasi analytical solution with a fixed value of γ 0 75 in such a purpose these authors modelled several synthetic cumulative infiltrations and assessed the relative objective functions defined as the difference between a given target corresponding to target input parameters and modelled curves for different sets of input parameters for the considered loamy soil early infiltration times i e 100 s promoted a good estimation of s but not of k s and β a unique and well defined value of k s could be estimated for t 1000 s whereas an accurate estimate of β required a very long infiltration time overall using the default value of this parameter did not compromise estimation of s and k s the low sensitivity observed for β by latorre et al 2018 suggests that a downward infiltration experiment is not probably an appropriate technique to estimate this parameter an alternative approach to estimate the role of the infiltration parameters could be to compare the soil hydraulic properties obtained by best method to those independently measured with other experimental methods for beerkan infiltration experiments conducted on a sandy loam soil aiello et al 2014 applied the best slope and best intercept algorithms with different combinations of β and γ these authors compared the estimated curves with measured data for the water retention curve and concluded that the discrepancy depended on both β and γ however the discrepancy was more sensitive to β than γ thus suggesting that for the considered soil calibration is particularly important for the former parameter a good correspondence between the predicted and the experimental water retention data was detected when the original best slope algorithm was applied with the infiltration parameters set at β 1 9 and γ 0 79 the impact of the infiltration constants on the water retention scale parameter h g estimated by the three best algorithms i e slope intercept and steady was evaluated by castellini et al 2018 in particular they analytically showed that best intercept and best steady algorithms yield identical h g estimates that are independent of γ both infiltration parameters affect the estimates of h g with best slope comparison with water retention data measured by the evaporation laboratory method showed that h g was more sensitive to the selected β parameter for best slope than the other two algorithms furthermore the lack of a dependence of h g on γ for best intercept and best steady was associated with an overestimation of the water retention scale parameter for these two algorithms as compared to the original best slope algorithm it was concluded that best slope may lead to more accurate soil water retention estimates if specifically calibrated infiltration constants are used however the advantages of calibration are not substantial since specific calibration of β and γ for four differently textured soils led to only moderate improvement of estimation errors also suggesting that using the default values of infiltration constants does not worsen significantly the soil water retention curve estimation 5 best use for specific soils 5 1 very sorptive versus permeable soils three dimensional cumulative infiltration into an initially unsaturated porous medium typically exhibits a concave shape revealing that water infiltration is initially capillarity driven fig 4 a at the late phase of the process water flow is both capillarity and gravity driven and cumulative infiltration presents a more linear part representative of steady state conditions infiltration rates decrease with time during the transient phase of the process and then they become constant fig 4a under this optimum condition the three alternative best algorithms are expected to yield similar results in opposite under certain specific conditions the choice of the algorithm is known to influence the ability of best to yield physically sound soil parameters indeed the structure of the three best algorithms makes them differently sensitive to i non attainment of steady state and ii imprecise description of the transient state an example of non attainment of steady state was illustrated by gonzalez sosa et al 2010 their fig 6 b for a case in which steady state was not yet retained within the end of the run and the fit of the infiltration model was extended to all data points this is also depicted in fig 4b in such a case the estimation of slope and intercept of the line describing steady state on the cumulative infiltration graph can be erroneous and k s and s are expected to be miscalculated lassabatere et al 2013 effects of non attainment of steady state were studied by di prima et al 2016 using analytically generated data for five soils from sand to clay the implicit equation by haverkamp et al 1994 was applied to model infiltration of a fixed water volume through a 150 mm diameter soil surface under an initial effective saturation degree s e ranging from 0 to 0 8 depending on the run this wide range of s e values was considered because the initial soil water content should not exceed 0 25 θ s for a proper application of best methods lassabatere et al 2006 but wetter conditions can occur in practice xu et al 2012 2009 the analytically generated infiltration data were then inverted with the three best algorithms using the workbook proposed by di prima 2013 and considering total cumulative infiltration from 40 to 390 mm then the best deduced k s and s values were compared with the corresponding target values for sorptivity the relative error increased from negative to positive values with the volume of infiltrated water however the estimation of sorptivity was considered to remain quite robust and accurate with relative errors less than 5 in absolute value for almost all cases di prima et al 2016 the estimates of k s decreased with the total infiltrated volume regardless of the considered soil and initial s e value in particular all algorithms overestimated k s for small infiltrated water volumes best slope allowed in general to obtain accurate estimates of k s with less water and hence shorter experimental times than the other two algorithms however this method leads to a slight under estimation for large volumes remaining acceptable with relative errors close to 5 in most cases in conclusion the non attainment of steady state is expected to affect estimation of k s and s and long infiltration runs are advised to obtain a reliable characterization with best methods regarding the transient state best slope can fail as a consequence of an imprecise description of the transient state including only few points xu et al 2009 this case is depicted in fig 4c when the influence of capillary forces on the infiltration process is small in comparison with the gravity driven infiltration transient state is very short i e steady flow is quickly attained and cumulative infiltration data do not contain enough information on transient flow xu et al 2012 this drawback was illustrated by gonzalez sosa et al 2010 their fig 6a for the case of the early diminishment of the capillary force in such a case the optimization of soil sorptivity on infiltration data was performed only on few data points reducing the robustness of the inversion procedure gravity driven flow predominates for highly permeable soils but also for wet soils since the initial water content is high enough to limit the gradient between initial and final water pressure head and thus the capillarity driven flow the importance to collect an appropriate number of data points during the transient phase of the process to successfully apply some of the best algorithms was demonstrated by di prima et al 2016 using analytically generated infiltration data these authors increased the precision of the collected information by decreasing the cumulative infiltration interval from 5 mm to 2 5 mm fig 5b versus 5a as an example for a sandy clay loam soil with a relatively high initial saturation degree s e 0 5 a reading taken every 5 mm of infiltrated water determined the fifth data point to fall beyond the validity time interval of the transient state model leading to the failure of best slope and best intercept algorithms fig 5a in the case of readings every 2 5 mm the number of points used to describe the same curve doubled and allowed the selection of enough points for the description of the transient state and the success of best slope and best intercept algorithms fig 5b too imprecise description of the transient state may occur frequently on the field in particular for soils with macropores lassabatere et al 2019a these complicated situations may be compensated at least in part by an infiltration device such as the one developed by di prima 2015 and concialdi et al 2019 that allows collection of many data points at very short time intervals fig 5c the great advance of the device and its automation is that it does not require anyone once it is installed therefore anyone could set up more devices and run them at the same time data collection is automated and can be replicated without many efforts in the field in addition the mentioned device was designed by minimizing its cost in conclusion all algorithms require a proper attainment of steady state and a proper description of the transient state with real data lassabatere et al 2019a recommended to use all the three algorithms and to combine their estimates in order to include in the analysis of the experimental data all the advantages of each algorithm while reducing the impact of algorithm specific limitations on the accuracy of the estimates in particular the arithmetic means were considered to compute method averaged parameters since these parameters were found to be normally distributed 5 2 water repellent soils non attainment of steady state conditions during the infiltration run and too short duration or poor description of the transient stage of infiltration are possible eventualities for a process that occurs according to theory however there can also be cases in which the data are not consistent with the classical physics of infiltration and in these cases applicability of best methods is questionable lassabatere et al 2019a this is the case of hydrophobic soils when water infiltrates into these soils the advance of water during the early phase of wetting is impeded owing to hydrophobic surface films on soil particles resulting in a non zero contact angle between water and soil hallett et al 2001 jarvis et al 2008 water repellency can be detected by visually checking cumulative infiltration e g alagna et al 2019 di prima et al 2019 2017a lassabatere et al 2013 lassabatere et al 2019a lichner et al 2013 lozano baez et al 2018 for instance beatty and smith 2013 provided an explicative example showing the different shapes of the infiltration rate curves that could be obtained on several soils depending on the presence of an upper layer of organic matter and related hydrophobicity fig 6a three main types of shapes can be detected i a decreasing infiltration rate when water infiltrates into a mineral only soil ii increasing infiltration rate and iii decreasing before increasing infiltration rate fig 6b such trends result from the fact that two antagonist factors play at the same time the dissipation of the water pressure head gradient with time that triggers a decrease in infiltration rate and hydrophobicity that triggers an increase in infiltration rate depending on the relative contribution of the two factors different shapes may be obtained in terms of cumulative infiltration the configurations correspond to i regular shape with a concave part followed by a linear part ii a typical hockey stick like relationship and iii a mixed shape with a very small concave part followed by the hockey stick like shape fig 6a the impact of hydrophobicity on the shape of the cumulative infiltration influences best treatment of the data for example lozano baez et al 2018 applied both the best steady algorithm and the steady version of the simplified method based on a beerkan infiltration run ssbi method proposed by bagarello et al 2017b the ssbi method yielded always physically plausible estimates i e positive k s values on the contrary the failure of best steady was attribuited to the convex shaped cumulative infiltration curves that mainly occurred as a consequence of hydrophobicity although other factors such as heterogeneous soil structure changes in soil structure during the infiltration run initial soil moisture and temperature probably played some role in particular the negative intercept values yielded the failure of best steady but not of the ssbi method however the individual determinations of k s obtained by the two methods differed by no more than 2 4 times 2 in the 90 of the cases suggesting that the ssbi method was a good alternative method to analyze the infiltration data collected in problematic soil conditions 5 3 heterogeneous soils soil heterogeneity is more the rule than the exception heterogeneous soils are contrasting with homogeneous soils that exhibit quite uniform structure and small spatial variability at least two types of heterogeneous soils can be considered and will be treated in this review paper since these were investigated using best like methods i heterogeneity resulting from the concomitancy of several materials with contrasting hydraulic properties and ii soils that have complex and multi modal porosity systems including micro mesopores and macropores heterogeneous systems can also be sorted on the basis of the spatial scale we deal first with sealed soils and multi porosity multi permeability systems that exhibit heterogeneity at the small mm or less scale and then soils that are composed of several lithofacies at larger scales for these systems we show the specific implementations to be done to the usual best approach 5 3 1 sealed soils surface soil seals or crusts have usually a higher bulk density smaller pores and consequently a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity k s than the underlying soil assouline 2011 assouline and mualem 2002 mualem and assouline 1989 the presence of the seal layer influences substantially surface soil hydrological processes such as occurrence of hortonian runoff assouline and mualem 2006 chen et al 2013 vandervaere et al 1998 therefore interpreting and simulating surface hydrological processes in sealed or crusted soils presupposes as a starting point an appropriate hydraulic characterization of the porous medium particularly with reference to k s some work was done in the past two decades to adapt common infiltrometer methodologies for characterizing in situ the sealed soil layer vandervaere et al 1997 šimůnek et al 1998 alagna et al 2013 touma et al 2011 however the developed procedures remain largely untested they appear rather cumbersome especially from the experimental point of view and they could not work well in the case of a high field heterogeneity in this context a practically attractive line of research developed in the last decade is represented by the use of beerkan experimental runs and best algorithms to characterize the sealed soil layer and the underlying undisturbed soil several investigations have yielded encouraging results about the ability of the methodology to distinguish between the hydraulic properties of the two soil layers with a simple experiment alagna et al 2019 lassabatere et al 2010 souza et al 2014 they have also suggested that a beerkan run could be adapted to alter the exposed soil surface to some degree approximately reproducing what happens during intense rainfall events in such a way to obtain the hydraulic properties of an intentionally altered soil layer alagna et al 2018 2016a bagarello et al 2017a 2014a a question that emerged when the best methodologies were applied on a two layered system was what kind of information was really obtained with the experiment that is the hydrodynamic properties of the sealed layer alone or some kind of functionally averaged seal underlying soil properties therefore some recent investigations were specifically focused on giving an answer to this question di prima et al 2017b 2018 lassabatere et al 2010 were the first authors that applied best on a two layered soil system fig 7 a in particular they derived the unsaturated hydraulic properties of sediments and subsoil in two settlement basins in france the field infiltration experiments were performed with the classical beerkan run methodology on both the subsoil alone and the sediment subsoil system considering as an example the django reinhardt djr basin the cumulative infiltration i versus time t curve exhibited the regular concave shape fig 7b subsoil the presence of the sediment triggered a change in the shape of the cumulative infiltration curve since the asymptotic slope decreased and the concavity at the beginning increased fig 7b sediment these water infiltration data were treated with best methods to derive the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions sediments had less steep water retention curves than subsoils fig 7c which likely resulted from the greater capillarity effect in the former case the sediments displayed 4 5 times lower k s values than subsoil but in dry conditions they had a much higher hydraulic conductivity due to greater capillarity effects fig 7d finally the collected soil data were found to be usable for 1d numerical simulation of the flow process in sediment subsoil columns in brazil the original best methodology was applied by souza et al 2014 in non crusted and crusted locations which were visibly more compact hard and brittle when dry than the underlying soil that was more loose and friable the non crusted soil yielded higher s and k s values than the crusted soil the characteristic mean pore radii were similar between the two soil conditions but non crusted surfaces had a five times higher number of hydraulically active pores per unit area therefore souza et al 2014 concluded that the greater pore density was responsible of the greater conductivity detected in the non crusted soil crusted and non crusted soil surfaces were also sampled by alagna et al 2019 in a sicilian loamy soil and even these authors recognized the ability of the best experiment to characterize the sealed layer to prevent fracture of the upper layer during insertion of a 0 15 m diameter ring on crusted soil the soil outside the hedge of the ring was moistened with 5 cm3 of water by means of a syringe before insertion after ten minutes the ring was carefully inserted to a 0 01 m depth applying a slight pressure and a gentle rotation this site preparation was essential to prevent visible crust surface perturbation according to bagarello et al 2014a the height of water pouring on the infiltration surface is a degree of freedom of the experiment a high height of water pouring high h run can induce some disturbance of the exposed soil surface perhaps similar to that produced by a rainfall event inducing hortonian runoff generation whereas a run carried out as commonly prescribed by the beerkan protocol i e with low heights of water pouring low l run should yield more representative data for a soil that is not directly impacted by rainfall to test this idea four differently textured soils were sampled with beerkan runs and two heights of water application h w 0 03 and 1 5 m the effect of the height of water pouring was noticeable since the l runs yielded 11 5 35 2 times higher ks means than the h ones when surface soil deterioration was not completed during the infiltration run the gravitational potential energy e p of the water used for a run was an appropriate predictor of the expected changes in k s fig 8 a instead a soil alteration ending before concluding the infiltration run made e p a less useful parameter alagna et al 2016b conducted beerkan l and h runs in a sandy loam soil to verify if height of water pouring effects on k s and s varied with θ i 0 12 θ i 0 20 m 3 m 3 a low height of water pouring yielded 13 to 27 times higher k s means and 2 3 to 2 8 times higher s means than a high height depending on θ i therefore the height effects were particularly noticeable for k s a dry soil was more sensitive to the height of water pouring than a wet soil probably because there were more opportunities for aggregate breakdown compaction of the exposed soil surface and macropore obstruction in initially more macroporous conditions i e lower θ i and higher k s bagarello et al 2017a and alagna et al 2018 tested water pouring height effects in initially very wet soils making use of two types of two stage beerkan infiltration runs namely l1l2 and l1h2 in the former case 15 volumes of water are applied by an l run and then the sampled soil is allowed to drain for a short time then the same procedure is used to pour other 15 volumes of water with the l1h2 runs an h run is carried out in the second stage of infiltration the double two stage beerkan run methodology yielded infiltration rates at the end of the perturbing stage of the experiment of 0 2 0 3 sandy loam soil and 0 15 loam soil times those obtained with the initial non perturbing stage whereas without any perturbing effect infiltration rates at the end of the second run were 0 5 times those at the end of the first run therefore the methodology allowed to distinguish between a decrease in infiltration rate due to water redistribution during the drainage and that attributable to soil surface perturbation fig 8b and it was able to signal that the loam soil was 1 5 times more sensitive to disturbance effects induced by a high height of pouring than a sandy loam soil the usability of the collected data by low and high runs to simulate hydrological processes in sealed soils could be considered more a presumption than a certainty but some recent investigations by di prima et al 2018 2017b supported the practical usability of the methodology in particular di prima et al 2017b working in the field on a sandy loam soil compared rainfall simulation and beerkan infiltration experiments establishing a similarity between the gravitational potential energy of the applied water e p for the infiltration run and the simulated rainfall kinetic energy e k in particular the soil was sampled with best and two heights of water pouring 0 03 m i e the usual procedure and 0 34 m yielding e p e k then the experimental steady state infiltration rates i sr obtained with simulated rainfall experiments were compared with the k s values obtained with the two water pouring heights in order to discriminate between theoretically possible i sr k s and impossible i sr k s situations physically possible k s values were only obtained applying water at a relatively large distance from the soil surface fig 8c as a consequence of soil compaction and mechanical aggregate breakdown phenomena considering e p and e k was an effective way to establish a physical link between simulated hydrological process and soil hydraulic characterization di prima et al 2018 assessed the effect of soil sealing due to the repeated water application during beerkan experiments for three layered soils with different textures for the upper layer and they investigated the capability of best procedure to catch the formation of the seal and related consequences on water infiltration these authors carried out rainfall experiments to induce the formation of the seal and beerkan infiltration runs with different water pouring heights h and l runs l runs provided usual shapes fig 8d that could be easily treated with any best method in opposite the h runs exhibited a marked concave shape due to the progressive seal formation fig 8d affecting the treatment of the data among the three algorithms best steady which considers exclusively the late phase of the infiltration process i e when the seal is fully developed allowed a successful treatment of the h runs and lead to values close to those obtained by rainfall simulations this result proved that surface soil sealing processes generally occurred with both rainfall simulation experiments and h beerkan runs instead the l runs prevented the seal formation and thus revealed unable to mimic the effect of rain drop impact on soil structure during intense rainfall events 5 3 2 multi porosity and permeability systems due to the development of root systems or physical processes like wetting drying cycles or thawing freezing cycles the soil structure may evolve towards the formation of a macropore network allaire et al 2009 köhne et al 2009 in these cases the pore size distribution may be described using multi modal functions durner 1994 gerke and van genuchten 1993 consequently each pore system having its own capability of conducting water and then its peculiar hydraulic conductivity the soil bulk conductivity may be described also using multi modal functions dual porosity and permeability approaches were developed to account for such multi modal distributions for pore size and hydraulic conductivity e g gerke and van genuchten 1996 several studies based on best approach have dealt with the hydraulic characterization of such systems as a first approach gonzalez sosa et al 2010 studied the catchment of yzeron river region of rhône alpes east part of france including forest soils and developed a method for the determination of the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions accounting for the macropore system these authors used mini disk infiltrometers with water pressure head h fixed at 2 cm to deactivate the macropore system and sample the matrix only the runs performed with the mini disk infiltrometers were treated with best slope to characterize the matrix i the water contents measured below the device were used to estimate the matrix porosity ii the particle size distribution was treated to derive the shape parameters and iii the cumulative infiltrations were inverted to derive the shape parameters for the macropores the authors used large rings 40 cm in diameter to perform falling head experiments and derive the bulk saturated hydraulic conductivity corresponding to the activation of the porosity system including the macropore network the ring dimension was increased to be sure to sample the macropore network these authors supposed a linear increase for both water content and the natural logarithm of hydraulic conductivity between h 2 cm and h 0 the different water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions are depicted in fig 9 the combination of water infiltration experiments under ponded conditions using regular beerkan run and water tension at surface using a tension infiltrometer allows the quantification of the hydraulic fluxes with and without the activation of the macropores network on this basis lassabatere et al 2014 and lassabatere et al 2019b designed best 2k for the hydraulic characterization of dual permeability systems fig 10 to run best 2k method the following measures are needed in addition to the two water infiltration runs beerkan and tension infiltrometer a measure of water content at the end of the tension infiltrometer experiment a sample for the determination of the dry bulk density and of the particle size distribution psd and potentially the mineral density fig 10a in addition it requires guessing a previous estimate of the volume occupied by the fast flow region wf at first the bulk saturated water content θ s 2 k is derived from the dry bulk and the mineral densities then the water content measured at the end of the tension infiltrometer θ ti is used to derive the saturated water contents eqs 22a and 22b in the matrix and the fast flow zone lassabatere et al 2019b 22a θ s m θ ti 1 w f 22b θ s f θ s 2 k θ ti w f in an analogous way the two infiltration curves obtained with the beerkan method i b and the tension infiltrometer i ti are used to derive the cumulative infiltrations corresponding to beerkan experiments for the matrix and the fast flow regions eqs 23a and 23b 23a i b m i ti 1 w f 23b i b f i b i ti w f lastly the psd is fitted to bimodal functions to derive the parameters related to the smaller and larger particles eq 24 24 ff 2 k d τ f 1 d g f d n f m f 1 τ f 1 d g m d n m m m where ff 2 k d is the cumulative distribution of particle size d is the particle diameter τ f is the fractional contribution of the particles in the fast flow region unknown a priori d g is the average diameter of either particle size mode and n and m are textural parameters related by the expression m 1 2 n the shape parameters of the matrix n m η m and the fast flow region n f η f are estimated from the values of the psd shape parameters m m n m and m f n f using the regular best method pedotransfer function then the two water infiltration curves i b m and i b f are treated using best methods to derive the whole set of hydraulic parameters given that the saturated water contents θ s m θ s f were already estimated using eqs 22 both the fast flow and the matrix regions are assumed to follow the same equations for the description of their water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions i e eqs 1 and 2 the bulk water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions can then be retrieved using eqs 25a and 25b 25a θ 2 k h w f θ f h 1 w f θ m h 25b k 2 k θ w f k f θ f 1 w f k m θ m where subscripts m and f refer to the matrix and the fast flow region respectively therefore best 2 k was designed to estimate the whole set of the local hydraulic parameters for the matrix region θ r m θ s m h g m k s m n m and η m and the fast flow region θ r f θ s f h g f k s f n f and η f given that residual water contents are considered as negligible i e equaled to zero the use of best 2k on analytically generated data validated the approach and allowed the determination of the errors linked to these assumptions when the dual permeability media are made of contrasting matrix and fast flow regions and when the water pressure head is chosen adequately best 2k achieves a proper hydraulic characterization however when experimental data is used the experimental errors could make it difficult to compute the dual permeability function in particular regular protocols and devices make it complicated to sample very precisely the transient state of the beerkan run in fact the beerkan run is dominated by the influence of the fast flow region with a very fast infiltration and a very short transient state fig 10b and c consequently the run of best methods to curves that are close to linear makes it complicated to estimate the scale parameter for water pressure head h g f however best 2k performed well for several tests and proved efficient to provide the complete hydraulic curves for the dual permeability systems fig 10d finally there should be no differences between running a tension infiltrometer run plus a beerkan test or running the tension infiltrometer with two pressure heads one negative and the other close to zero however the use of beerkan runs ensures that the soil will be completely saturated at the surface in opposite the use of the tension infiltrometer may be tricky and full saturation may not be attained when using such a device in addition the contact between the soil and the membrane and or the need for a sand layer may constitute an additional drawback 5 3 3 soil systems and deposits made of contrasting materials soil systems like glaciofluvial deposits or alluvial deposits are made of contrasting materials in terms of soil particles and consequently hydraulic properties the dynamics of particle deposition that form glaciofluvial deposits is quite chaotic and highly conditioned by the formation of braided streams in each stream lower velocity zones are prone to the deposition of very fine clayey materials whereas higher velocity parts are the place for the deposition of coarser materials sand gravel rocks glaciofluvial deposits are thus the typical examples of very heterogeneous soil systems with large spatial variability at the scale of the meter or the dozens of meters this type of system was already investigated in the east region of lyon goutaland et al 2013 goutaland et al 2008 these authors dug several trenches in the deposit and sampled the matrices to characterize the spatial variability of the particle size distribution over the trenches fig 11 all the samples could be sorted in four distinct lithofacies using the miall code miall 1977 that defines a typology of lithofacies as a function of both texture particle size distribution and structure particle arrangement the main lithofacies which constitutes most of the body of the deposit is a mixture of gravel and a sandy matrix with a bimodal particle size distribution fig 11a referred to as bimodal gravel two other lithofacies form inclusions embedded in the main lithofacies a well sorted sandy matrix inclusions of dimensions of several meters referred to as sand and an open framework matrix free gravel forming smaller inclusions referred to as matrix free gravel lastly the body of the deposit is covered with an upper layer involving a mixture of a sandy matrix and gravel referred to as gravel with matrix following this procedure a stratigraphic model was completed over a section of 13 5 m in length and 2 5 m in height fig 11b at larger scales sedimentological units were determined using the ground penetrating radar gpr however the gpr profiles provide information at the unit scale and do not provide a clear picture at the lithofacies scale or only for the biggest lithofacies like the upper layer and the sandy lenses e g coutinho et al 2015 on the basis of the stratigraphic model goutaland et al 2013 defined a hydro stratigraphic model these authors performed beerkan runs and used best methods to derive the hydraulic properties for each lithofacies fig 11c they positioned the rings above each lithofacies some of them necessitating digging part of the upper horizons they also confirmed their results by sampling lithofacies in other experimental sites where the glaciofluvial deposits were still forming allowing all types of lithofacies accessible at the surface goutaland et al 2013 the coarsest material i e the matrix free gravel lead to linear water infiltration curves without any concavity as the result of a very short transient state typical of very permeable soils consequently best methods could not be used for these cases the arya paris model arya and paris 1981 was used to derive the water retention function and then the relative hydraulic conductivity goutaland et al 2013 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was equaled to the final flow rate and combined with values from the literature finally the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions could be determined for the four lithofacies leading to the determination of hydrofacies fig 11c however the estimates sounds meaning on a physical ground and proved efficient for modelling water flow in this type of heterogeneous deposit the combination of the stratigraphic model description of 2d section and 3d blocks with the hydraulic properties of each hydrofacies allowed the determination of hydro stratigraphic models usable for the prediction of flow goutaland et al 2013 the hydro stratigraphic model was used for several numerical studies to predict preferential flows in the glaciofluvial deposit ben slimene et al 2017 worked on the influence on each lithofacies of the degree of heterogeneity of flow these authors considered the hydro stratigraphic section presented above fig 11 with all its complexity along with simpler scenarios in terms of lithological heterogeneity fig 12 the authors modelled the responses of all these sections when submitted to a constant flow rate at surface and for initial conditions after a long draining phase these authors clearly demonstrated that lithological heterogeneity induced preferential flow and in particular funneled flow at the interface between fine and coarse materials preferential flow was much marked under unsaturated conditions that promote the capillary barrier effect with lower hydraulic conductivity of coarser materials it was proven that under these conditions the sandy and the gravel inclusions drained and exhibited a lower hydraulic conductivity than the predominant lithofacies resulting in deviation of flow at the top boundaries of these inclusions the influence of inclusions was related to their size with the development of larger preferential flow paths at the surrounding of the sandy lenses because of their larger sizes in particular the smaller lenses of gravel have only a local role fig 12 it was also proved that sandy and gravel inclusions did not modify drastically the bulk hydraulic conductivity at the scale of the section in opposite to layers layers in particular when constituted of finer material with lower hydraulic conductivity may impede flow at the scale of the section and their impact should be quantified when modelling flow at larger scale is targeted these studies demonstrate that heterogeneous systems that are made of contrasting materials may be investigated using best methods however these investigations require that all the lithofacies can be sampled with the beerkan experiments this situation may be complicated when some of them are below several layers in such a case analogous lithofacies can be sampled in the deposit that are still forming and that expose all the lithofacies to the surface as proposed by goutaland et al 2013 6 concluding remarks best is a very promising tool for performing a complete soil hydraulic characterization directly in the field since it relies on a robust theory and needs limited experimental resources and workloads the large interest for the procedure documented in this article represents a stimulus to go ahead on our knowledge of best potentials and limitations and hence to develop several issues of both scientific and practical relevance in most cases for regular soils a beerkan run provides accurate descriptions of cumulative infiltrations at both transient and steady states fig 13 regular soils in this case all best methods are efficient to retrieve the soil hydraulic functions the three methods best slope intercept and steady should be used and the averages between parameters should be considered to build the hydraulic functions however specific soils and conditions may arise and spoil the use of best methods water repellency is often one of these specific conditions in particular when beerkan runs are performed after a long dry period hydrophobicity may impede flow at short times leading to specific convex or hockey stick like shapes fig 13 water repellent soils in such cases best slope and intercept that requires a concave shape do not work and cannot be applied in certain cases best steady may lead to results in particular when the intercept is positive however the experimental steady state asymptote is impacted by flow impediment at the beginning of the infiltration run and does not represent water infiltration under regular circumstances related estimates should not be considered as mentioned above water infiltration may not sample both transient and steady states for very fine soils with very low permeability fig 13 very fine soils the attainment of steady state may require a very long experiment not feasible with regular means and devices in such a case all the best methods may work however the final infiltration rate will be over estimated leading to potentially erroneous estimates in opposite for very permeable soils fig 13 very coarse soils the transient state is restricted to very short time and not easy to sample with the regular beerkan protocol in this case only best steady may provide values however the parameter h g linked to the intercept of the asymptotic regime requires a very consistent and precise estimate of the intercept soils may contain macropores conveying them a very permeable behavior close to saturation fig 13 soils with macropores the shape of cumulative infiltration may resemble that of very permeable soils leading to similar difficulties i e the need to use best steady and the difficulty to determine precisely the steady state asymptote intercept however it may be considered that the best methods are dedicated to single permeability soils the related estimates may not be representative of the dual permeability soils lastly sealing may occur during the water infiltration experiments if a special care is not taken to avoid soil disturbance at surface fig 13 sealed soils in this case the extra concavity may prevent any use of best slope and intercept however even if best steady may provide some estimates it may be borne in mind that best are not dedicated to sealed soils and that related estimates may not be representative of the real behavior of the soil to mitigate these shortcomings and address these specific types of soils several investigations are conducted firstly automated devices are developed to improve the sampling of the transient and steady states in particular for very fine or coarse soils the new best 2 k is under development for an accurate and consistent characterization of dual permeability soils ongoing research deal with the development of best methods for water repellent soils and sealing soils for these soils the combinations of l and h runs that prevent or trigger sealing may be of good help a point needing consideration is checking best against alternative methods to determine the soil hydraulic properties only a few contributions can be found in the literature although these comparisons provide one of the few sources of information that practitioners can draw upon to select appropriate measurement methods for their circumstances reynolds et al 2000 much research has been focused on infiltration but there are still problems that need to be fixed in particular the choice of proper values of β and γ still requires further investigations and the mathematical approach developed in best methods can also be improved regarding other aspects in particular the definition of time validity intervals for the use of the approximate expansions is still unclear to avoid this issue a few studies have tried to replace the use of the approximate expansions with the quasi exact implicit formulation in the fitting process latorre et al 2018 latorre et al 2013 with these approaches all the points are directly fitted to the quasi exact implicit model that is valid for any time thus avoiding the need for selecting subsets of data points for the transient and steady states however these procedures are computationally intensive since the model is implicit thus requiring the combination of two inverting procedures which may slow down calculation processes and increase the risk of non convergence these approaches need then to be tested in more depth with both numerically generated and real experimental data the existing information supports the usability of the best procedure for the hydraulic characterization of sealed soils since the data collected at the soil surface can be assigned to the seal layer and removing this layer allows characterization of the underlying undisturbed soil of course the available information is encouraging but not exhaustive therefore it is still not possible to suggest that the methodology can generally be used in sealed soils or as a means to induce sealing instead there are different issues still needing confirmation clarification and developments primarily it is necessary to support the conclusion that best gives the exact hydraulic characteristics of the seal layer by sampling other sealed soils the testing procedures developed by di prima et al 2018 2017b appear appropriate to yield a robust information both in the field and the laboratory at this purpose additional experimental investigations on the applicability of the methodology are particularly necessary in initially dry soil conditions since water repellency can also impede infiltration into the sealed layer lassabatere et al 2010 and ring insertion could remain very complicated even with the pre wetting procedure by alagna et al 2019 due to the fragility of the porous medium in such cases research needs can also be delineated with reference to the low high beerkan run methodology for example a question to be considered is that the same energy can be supplied to the soil by using small water volumes and high heights of pouring or more water and lower heights of pouring another point needing consideration is to see how surface soil alteration evolves with time and particularly if soil characteristics stabilize after a certain time approaching a fully developed seal layer assouline and mualem 2002 and if best is able to capture a possible recovery of the soil properties after disturbance best 2k seems practical for the determination of the water retention and hydraulic function of dual permeability soils however this method relies on several assumptions that need some investigations regarding the treatment of the particle size distribution the value of shape parameters of the smaller mode is assigned to the matrix and the value of the larger mode is assigned to the fast flow region it means implicitly that the matrix is made of small particles whereas the fast flow region is surrounded by larger particles this statement seems logical but under certain circumstances the fast flow region may correspond to cracks and fractures being surrounded by the particles of the matrix this implicit link between particle size and pore size could maybe be questionable another critical issue concerns the hypothesis of the entire deactivation of the fast flow region indeed the sets of equations used for the determination of saturated water contents and of cumulative infiltration into the matrix and the fast flow regions assume that the deactivation of the fast flow region is complete in fact deactivation may be partial with infiltration into the walls of the larger macropores similarly a part of the water content θ ti may be retained in the fast flow region leading to erroneous estimates of the saturated water contents θ s m and θ s f the third assumption that may be criticized states that the matrix behave in the same way at saturation and at the value of the water pressure head used for the tension infiltration experiments it means that the water content remains the same when the water pressure head is decreased from zero to the value applied with the infiltrometer it also means that cumulative infiltrations obtained when using the tension infiltrometer or the beerkan method remains similar these assumptions could be invalid depending on the matrix properties lastly the estimation of the void fraction occupied by the fast flow region w f is one of the shortcoming of the methods this parameter must be chosen a priori and requires additional data for its estimation declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

6291,the groundwater storage of china s alxa plateau ap one of the driest plateaus in the world with a mixed landscape of deserts including the gobi natural riparian oases and mosaic groundwater fed irrigation areas is vulnerable to global climate change and enhanced human activities in this study we revealed the temporal and spatial pattern of the changes in groundwater storage gws across the ap by integrating satellite observations hydrological modelling and ground data during the period of 2003 2016 our results showed the gws experienced a significant decreasing trend across the ap while the precipitation did not significantly change gws continues to decrease in the center of the ap i e the badain jaran desert which is likely associated with the fact of increasing evapotranspiration the anthropogenic influences were reflect as the long term extraction of groundwater has strongly depleted the gws in the southeastern ap however in the northwestern part of the ap groundwater depletion has been relieved due to the water diversion project with general increasing river runoff furthermore based on our analysis and a broad review of the studies in other sub regions over the ap the possible regional flow path was proposed with particular addressing on the likely influence by anthropogenic activities the dynamics in the gws among the different hydrogeological units is likely interconnected through regional groundwater flow paths decreasing of gws in the central ap which would lead to reducing groundwater discharge to the northwestern ap might further cause the groundwater depletion in the northwestern ap our results emphasize the tempo spatial patterns in gws change and the associated hydrological and ecological processes across the dry plateau identifying and untangling the various processes that impact on groundwater storage would allow us to develop more effective water management strategies keywords groundwater depletion water storage change grace arid

döll et al 2012 orellana et al 2012 in arid regions where rainfall is low and surface water is insufficient the importance of groundwater is extremely significant according to gleeson et al 2016 global groundwater storage gws in the upper 2 km of the continental crust has been estimated at 22 6 million km3 this is far more than the total volume of surface water however a growing influence of

southern high plains in north america scanlon et al 2012 and the middle east joodaki et al 2014 voss et al 2013 recently wang et al 2018 have revealed that the tws depletion in global endorheic basins was estimated as 106 32 gt a 1 with a contribution of nearly 38 from groundwater loss during 2002 and 2016 which is twice that in exorheic regions although only one fifth of the global land area of the endorheic basin as the endorheic basin is a relatively closed system to water the net water loss would contribute a significant portion of sea level rise highlighting the significance of water storage in inland regions for the global water cycle and the importance of rational water management in inland regions the alxa plateau ap an endorheic region in northwest china is one of the driest plateaus in the world fig 1 its great distance from the coast forms an extremely continental climate which makes the natural ecosystems and human development heavily dependent on groundwater historically the landscape has changed significantly due to hydrological changes induced by both climate change and human activities chen et al 2014 li et al 2017b luo et al 2016 despite the low degree of human activities which are generally concentrated in several limited areas of the ap such activity could have great influence on the water circulation of large areas furthermore the local groundwater dependent vegetation serves as an ecological defense for east asia because the ap is one of the most important sandstorm sources in china gou et al 2012 wang et al 2004 thus the water consumption of human society and natural ecosystems is highly competitive and a rational water resource management stratagem is particularly important in such a water limited environment however due to relatively few observations research on the groundwater storage and its changes in this region are very limited and have never been studied as a whole over the ap cao et al 2012 jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 an accurate understanding of the response of groundwater storage under such different water management strategies is critical to decision making efforts aiming to address this issue this study estimates changes in terrestrial water storage on the ap based on satellite data model simulation and observation data to 1 reveal the water storage changes in such an endorheic region 2 diagnose the reasons leading to the depletion of gws and 3 understand how water management and climate variability influence the water storage in this region 2 study area the ap has an area of nearly 270 000 km2 and elevations ranging from 740 to 3556 m a s l fig 1 the eastern edge of the ap is bordered by the helan mountains the langshan mountains and the yellow river to the north the plateau ends in a series of low hills the zongnai mountains to the west it is bounded by the mazong mountains and to the southwest by the longshou mountains and the qilian mountains yao et al 2011 the landform is dominated by deserts and the gobi desert the ap is mainly characterized by an extreme continental climate mean annual precipitation decreases form the southeast 200 mm to the northwest 40 mm at the same time potential evapotranspiration et increases from the southeast 2200 mm to the northwest 2800 mm he et al 2007 xi et al 2013 owing to such an arid environment surface runoff only occasionally occurs in mountain regions except for the heihe river no other runoff comes from the outside the ap based on the characteristics of the landform and human activities the ap can be generally divided into three sub regions from northwest to southeast which are the inland river basin the desert region and the irrigated areas the ejina basin on the northwestern ap is located in the lower reaches of heihe river basin the heihe river which originates from the qilian mountains and terminates in the east juyan lake in the ejina basin fig 1 is the only major river in the ap it branches into two streams which are the east river and the west river at the langxinshan except for some oasis vegetation that has developed along the river generally with a width of less than 2 km which corresponds to the riparian zone most of the ejina basin belongs to the gobi desert region the oasis developed along the rivers is an important ecological barrier for the regional environment wang et al 2011b zhang et al 2011 owing to the large expansion of irrigated farmlands in the midstream area since the 1950s the amount of water entering the ejina basin was significantly decreased wang et al 2014 wang et al 2011a this resulted in the decline of the regional groundwater table and shrinking of the terminal lake i e juyan lake in addition it led to the death of riparian plants degradation of the oases that develop along the streams and deterioration of the local environment e g an increase of sandstorms finally humans in turn suffered the results of irrational water consumption to restore the riparian ecosystem the central government implemented an ecological water diversion project ewdp in 2000 to limit the water use in the midstream and to guarantee that the discharge downstream should be no less than 1 58 billion m3 a 1 cheng et al 2014 since then the water table in riparian zone has increased wang et al 2011b the east juyan lake has been recovered li et al 2017a and the oases have changed for the better zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 in the middle portion of the ap there are two huge deserts namely the badain jaran desert bjd and the tengger desert with relatively low levels of human activities the bjd is the second largest desert of china with an area of approximately 52 100 km2 luo et al 2017 zhu et al 2010 the landscape in the bjd is dominated by numerous large sand dunes interspersed with more than 100 lakes of varying salinity dong et al 2013 most of the lakes are permanent surface water bodies the tengger desert with an area of 42 700 km2 is the fourth largest desert of china dong 2011 there are more than 400 lake basins in the tengger desert and approximately 250 of them are perennial dong 2011 because of the low precipitation ma et al 2014 the lakes in the desert region are mainly fed by groundwater dong et al 2016 in the southeastern portion of the ap in which a major concentration of human activities exists is located the ulan buh desert and some piedmont plains the ulan buh desert with an area of 11 000 km2 is situated on the west bank of the yellow river tectonically it is part of the hetao basin zhao et al 2012 the ulan buh desert consists of a high dune zone in the south a low dune zone in the west a dry wetland and lake bed zone in the north and a sand zone in the east chen et al 2014 most of the present desert region was covered by a jilantai hetao mega paleolake until approximately 90 ka ago chen et al 2014 the piedmont plains are the main gathering area of human activities and are home to many large irrigation areas and towns human activities there which include agriculture households and manufacturing are almost totally dependent on groundwater resources owing to afforestation projects e g the grain for green project cao et al 2011 the vegetation in the ulan buh desert and eastern tengger desert has significantly expanded in recent years yuan 2015 3 data and methods 3 1 grace data the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission launched by nasa and the german aerospace center in march 2002 allows us to measure variations of total water storage tws at large scales with a monthly time resolution tapley et al 2004 over land temporal variations in the gravity field are mainly due to tws change which is the vertically integrated measure of groundwater soil moisture snow ice and surface water through modeling or observation of the other components of water storage change the gws can be isolated from the tws asoka et al 2017 feng et al 2013 ma et al 2017 macdonald et al 2016 this study uses 151 months of data ranging from january 2003 to december 2016 with 17 months missing data the gridded grace tws data were obtained from three processing centers 1 the center for space research at university of texas at austin 2 the jet propulsion laboratory at the california institute of technology and 3 the german research center for geoscience these data sets are freely available from the following website https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the spatial resolution of all three data sets is 1 degree thirty two pixels covering the whole study region were chosen for estimating values to reduce uncertainty the average of the three data sets was calculated for each cell each month the missing data are obtained via simple temporal interpolation using adjacent data andrew et al 2017 3 2 meteorological data 3 2 1 precipitation we used the china monthly surface precipitation 0 5 0 5 gridded dataset v2 0 cnp05 available at http data cma cn to estimate precipitation variability between 2003 and 2016 in the study region the cnp05 is a gridded dataset released by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration this dataset was derived by interpolating the observed precipitation data from 2472 stations over china since 1961 zhao et al 2014 owing to the high quality of this dataset it has been widely used in climate change studies bueh et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 3 2 2 evapotranspiration the dataset of global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 1a gleam available at https www gleam eu were used for the regional et analysis this dataset provides different components of terrestrial evaporation e g transpiration bare soil evaporation interception loss open water evaporation and sublimation etc spanning a 37 year period 1980 2016 the spatial resolution is 0 25 degrees and the temporal resolution is one day martens et al 2017 the dataset has been extensively validated and inter compared with other methodologies to estimate heat fluxes miralles et al 2011 trambauer et al 2014 and was widely used in large scale climate change studies forzieri et al 2017 greve et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 through comparisons with eddy covariance et data in several biome types yang et al 2017 and bai and liu 2018 concluded that the gleam estimated actual et consistent with observations and has a reasonable accuracy in china to match the resolution of the grace dataset for this study we first calculated the monthly et by accumulating the daily et then every 16 grids in 1 degree cells were averaged to represent the monthly et of the corresponding grace cells 3 2 3 soil water content soil moisture content values produced by noah simulations of the global land data assimilation system version 2 1 gldasv2 1 noah beaudoing et al 2016 rodell et al 2004 were used for estimating the soil water storage sws dynamics the model was forced with a combination of model and observation based forcing datasets the resulting dataset contains 4 layer soil moisture content values for depths of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm at two spatial resolutions 0 25 and 1 degree and two temporal resolutions 3 hourly and monthly inter comparisons between the soil moisture products of gldasv2 1 noah and some other reanalysis datasets e g the esa cci era interim jra 55 etc revealed that gldasv2 1 noah generally has a better performance liu et al 2019 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 moreover an evaluation by biao et al 2018 indicated that the outputs of gldasv2 1 noah are in good agreement with observations in western china previous studies have shown that because of the hyper arid climate of the ap precipitation infiltration depth is basically between 30 and 50 mm li et al 2017c thus the soil moisture content is low and tends to vary mainly in the upper 50 cm of soil du et al 2018 hou et al 2016 li et al 2016 lu et al 2012 shang 2014 to avoid introducing too many model errors therefore the sws is calculated by a countup of the soil water content in the upper two layers 0 10 cm and 10 40 cm of the gldasv2 1 noah model which generally represents the climatic forcing effects on soil moisture dynamics we admit that would potentially underestimate the root zone sws 3 3 hydrological observations 3 3 1 groundwater table the observed monthly water table depth wtd in the ejina basin and the irrigated areas which are indicators of the anthropogenic influence i e water diversion and pumping on the groundwater dynamics were used to verify the grace derived water storage variation spatial distribution and statistical characteristics of the wells are shown in fig 2 and table 1 wells in the ejina basin three of which are in the riparian zone r1 r2 and r3 and three in the gobi desert zone g1 g2 and g3 have an average wtd of 2 97 m with a deeper water table and weaker variation in the gobi desert in the irrigated areas due to extensive groundwater extraction the water table generally has a deep depth and strong variation the mean wtd in the irrigated area of yaoba xitan and chahaertan is 22 32 m 71 56 m and 65 42 m respectively 3 3 2 river discharge in the ejina basin the shallow groundwater is almost completely recharged by the heihe river which is an ephemeral stream with the flow regulated by the ewdp wang et al 2017 among all the water diversion into the ejina volume of the water inflow at the langxinshan hydrologic section 30 is allocated to the west river and 70 to the east river the water in the west river can hardly reach the west juyan lake but most is dissipated by evaporation and replenishes the groundwater for the east river approximately 14 of the river flow is ends up in the terminal lake of the east juyan lake thus to estimate the influence of water diversion on gws dynamics in the typical area of the ejina basin the monthly discharge q at the hydrologic station of the langxinshan and east juyanhai fig 1 from 2003 to 2016 was used to quantify the surface inflow along the stream qsin qlangxinshan qjuyanhai 3 4 methods except for a few small lakes in the ejina basin e g east juyan lake that are fed by the heihe river from outside the ap all the other surface waters which mainly distribute in the desert regions are primarily recharged by groundwater jiao et al 2015 hence the surface water storage changes were neglected when conducting regional groundwater storage analysis getirana et al 2017 furthermore as winter rainfall is scare the snow water equivalent can also be neglected thus the gws anomalies can be estimated by subtracting the soil water component from the anomalies in tws that is gws tws sws because of the large variations in water cycle characteristics and degree of human activity across the ap there may be regional differences in influencing factors of water storage dynamics thus typical pixels sub areas in sub regions fig 2 were chosen for detailed analysis which are 1 the area between the two tributaries of the lower heihe river representing an inland river basin environment with controlled river discharge wang et al 2011a 2 the central part of the ap which is located in the bjd and represents a desert environment with low degree of human disturbance 3 irrigated areas in the southeast part of the ap which have a long history of groundwater pumping to evaluate the relative contribution of different components of water storage such as sws and gws on tws variability linear regression was utilized the relative contribution was estimated on the basis of the fraction of total variability r2 in tws explained by gws or sws as used in previous studies e g asoka et al 2017 furthermore correlation and lag correlation r were used to reveal the causality and response time between different hydrological processes 4 results 4 1 water storage changes over ap grace observations of monthly tws anomalies from 2003 to 2016 are shown in fig 2 all the pixels show a significant change trend p 0 01 although there are a few pixels in the westernmost region that have a trend close to 0 a clear negative trend in the grace tws estimates is mainly found over the ap the decreasing pattern of the tws on the ap is well spatially organized with a much greater depletion in the eastern and central ap and an unobvious change in the northwestern ap the magnitude of depletion changes from close to 0 mm month 1 in the northwest to 0 26 mm month 1 in the southeast with a mean value of 0 11 mm month 1 which equates to the loss of 39 3 million m3 each year over the ap the et and sws have a tight relationship with precipitation fig 3 with correlation coefficients of 0 91 and 0 69 at the 99 confidence level respectively there are no significant changes in annual precipitation over the ap however the sws showed a slightly increasing trend 0 14 mm a 1 this trend may be associated with the relatively dry period that occurred between 2004 and 2006 fig 3 which resulted in depletion of soil moisture the small difference between the tws trend 0 11 mm month 1 and gws trend 0 12 mm month 1 indicates that the sws has limited influence on the long term trend of the tws in such an arid climate the gws explains 76 of tws variability over the ap meaning that the gws change plays the most significant role in the terrestrial water balance of the ap this is quite different with the typical situation in the global terrestrial scale where is has been estimated that sws and gws contributed 51 2 and 17 4 to the tws respectively getirana et al 2017 4 2 main factors affect the gws in sub regions 4 2 1 downstream of inland river basin previous studies revealed that the groundwater level had obviously risen and vegetation had significantly recovered in the riparian zone of the ejina basin since the implementation of the ewdp in 2000 guo et al 2008 wang et al 2011b zhou et al 2018 apparently this means an increase of gws as the groundwater level is a direct indicator of gws dynamics however the estimated tws and gws were significantly p 0 01 depleted with the rates of 0 018 and 0 035 mm month 1 from 2003 to 2016 respectively fig s1 how to explain the inconsistency between the water level records and the grace estimation whether the groundwater depletion exits or not if the depletion happened does it or would it continue these questions are critical for evaluating the effects of ewdp and for future policy making the monthly wtd records indicated that the observation wells basically showed increases of the water table during apr 2011 and dec 2016 except the g1 which was slightly decreased table 1 and fig 4 the trends are significant and greater in the riparian zone while they are insignificant and weaker in the gobi desert to investigate the causes of these differences r2 and g1 were chosen for special estimation as it is shown in fig 4 the wtd dynamic of r2 and the river discharge is significantly correlated r 0 41 p 0 01 indicating that the water level in the riparian zone r2 is directly controlled by the river discharge as the distance to the river bank increases the variance of wtd of g1 becomes gentler and there is a significant lag correlation p 0 05 between the wtd of g1 and r2 with the maximum correlation r 0 31 p 0 01 at 4 and 5 month lag times fig 5 a this means a delayed response of gobi desert groundwater to river flow more notable is the fact that the groundwater level shows a declining and a rising trend before and after 2013 in the gobi desert respectively fig 4 this is quite different from the situation in the riparian zone which manifests as continuously rising however it matches well the long term trend of the tws which showed an overall decreasing trend from 2003 to 2016 but a slight increasing trend from 2013 to 2016 fig s1 furthermore the tws anomalies were significantly correlated with the wtd dynamics and the strongest correlation r 0 49 p 0 01 is obtained when comparing the tws signal with the wtd record from 2 months before fig 5 b nevertheless the estimated gws does not show any significant correlation with the wtd dynamics this might be attributed to the errors in sws which are quite low in such an extremely arid region due to little precipitation a mean annual precipitation of 36 6 mm liu et al 2016 and contribute little to the tws it can be concluded that the tws dynamics in this region is mainly controlled by the ewdp and it has nearly a half year 6 7 months time span delay with the water diversion the lag time indicates a lateral groundwater recharge from upper reaches which also sources from the water diversion and makes a great contribution to the tws dynamics in addition the influence of the lateral migration process of the groundwater on gws which has rarely been mentioned should arouse the attention of academic circles and command further study 4 2 2 desert region although there is no surface runoff and the precipitation is low in the bjd it contains many perennial lakes dong et al 2013 four main hypotheses have been put forward to explain the source of the water in these lakes dong et al 2013 1 direct precipitation recharge in the watershed or slope areas of nearby mountains to the south gates et al 2008 2 groundwater recharge from nearby areas ding and wang 2007 3 remote source recharge from the qilian mountains and the qinghai tibetan plateau chen et al 2004 4 paleowater formed during past periods when the climate was wetter yang and williams 2003 recent studies indicate that the lakes are likely mainly recharged by groundwater dong et al 2013 jiao et al 2015 although the exact mechanism of groundwater circulation remains unclear and the water source of the bjd groundwater is still under debate the decreasing trend of tws and gws fig s2 which are estimated as 0 118 and 0 143 mm month 1 respectively are generally consistent with the results of jiao et al 2015 and zhang et al 2018 this indicated that the groundwater in the bjd was in a negative balance state which was also confirmed by extensive shrinking of lake in the bjd jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 the precipitation controls the surface sws variance and affects the et on a seasonal scale fig s2 a however it has limited influence on the inter annual variability of the sws and tws fig 6 a although there were no significant changes in precipitation between 2003 and 2016 the et significantly increased at a rate of 2 51 mm a 1 p 0 01 which generally corresponds with the decreasing rate of the gws 1 74 mm a 1 fig 6 a meanwhile a significant negative correlation r 0 54 p 0 05 between the annual et and the gws indicates that groundwater depletion in bjd regions might be attributed to the increase of et recently increasing amounts of vegetation have been detected in the southeastern bjd due to human afforestation liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the greening and groundwater extraction would contribute to the increase of et and loss of tws to a certain degree yet the increase of et revealed in this study is more likely driven by climatic variability given that the human impacts generally are not well represented in the assimilation products e g the gleam furthermore we found that the de trended annual tws and gws had a significantly one year delayed correlation with annual precipitation owing to the high rate of potential et the rainfall on the surface is quickly evaporated into the air and the soil water generally has a short memory of precipitation thus we suspect this signal might reflect the lateral recharge of groundwater from nearby mountain regions we analyzed the precipitation in the yabrai mountains and qilian mountains results indicated the annual precipitation in these two regions has different variation characteristics fig 6 b both the de trended tws and gws have a significant time lagged correlation with precipitation in the yabrai mountains r 0 58 p 0 05 for tws and r 0 73 p 0 01 for gws as the distance from the yabrai mountains increases the correlations decreased not shown here however there is no obvious response of the water storage in bjd to the precipitation in the qilian mountains this evidenced that precipitation in nearby mountains is an important source of the bjd s groundwater 4 2 3 irrigated areas the southeastern part of the ap experiences the highest degree of human activity croplands there are entirely dependent on groundwater irrigation the groundwater level dynamics from 2010 to 2016 showed that the variation of the water table seems to have an opposite phase as the precipitation fig s3 this is attributed to the groundwater pumping for irrigation in the growing season because the local rainfall is not sufficient to support crops the withdrawal of groundwater is associated with sharp declines in the water table at the seasonal scale and can lead to continuous depletion of groundwater year by year the lowering of the water table in three irrigated areas is associated with decreasing tws and gws and increasing et table 2 because annual precipitation wasn t significantly changed and the wtd is deeper than 15 m the increased et can be ascribed to the intensified groundwater pumping linear regression of annual mean wtd and tws for 2010 2016 indicated significant correlations between them fig 7 the wtd contributes approximately 80 76 and 15 to total tws variability r 2 in chahaertan xitan and yaoba respectively a relatively weaker correlation between the tws and wtd in the pixel indicates that the irrigated area of yaoba is attributed to a large contribution of municipal water since groundwater is the only water source for human society in the region long term exploitation has led to continuous depletion of the gws 5 discussion 5 1 credibility of estimation the gws is estimated as deducting the sws from the tws in this study based on the fact that limited snow cover and scarce surface water exists on the ap in such an arid environment with an annual potential et of approximately 1500 mm the soil water content is quite low and the limited precipitation can hardly infiltrate into soil layers deeper than 50 cm du et al 2018 hou et al 2016 li et al 2016 lu et al 2012 shang 2014 thus the uncertainty in the sws is a main factor influencing the accuracy of the estimated gws the errors in model simulation generally increase with depth due to lake of representation of sub surface properties although gldasv2 1 noah provides soil moisture data at the 0 2 m depth to avoid introducing too many model errors we only represent the tws with the soil moisture content within 40 cm depth which would potentially underestimate the tws even so however the soil moisture variability still tends to be overestimated in the ejina basin where the tws shows significant correlation with the wtd dynamics rather than the gws that in turn provides a verification of the reliability of the grace estimations nevertheless in the irrigated areas i e the southeastern ap because a large amount of the extracted groundwater is used for irrigation which is generally not included in the assimilation system the soil moisture variability should be underestimated however since the local environment exhibits a deep wtd and high potential et there is little return flow to groundwater thus the water extracted from groundwater is nearly totally lost to the atmosphere in conclusion based on our estimation the soil moisture has a limited influence on the tws variation and the decline of the tws is mainly attributed to groundwater depletion 5 2 anthropogenic and natural factor influences on regional groundwater system the significant correlations between the tws and wtd and river discharge indicate that water diversion largely controls the variability of groundwater storage despite the fact that the volume of water diversion to the ejina basin is increasing and the vegetation is recovering since the ewdp which has generally been concluded to be due to an increase of gws the grace derived water storage shows an overall declining trend our estimation indicated that different from the situation in the riparian zone where the water level is continuously raised the water level in the gobi area began to show a rising trend until 2013 which is quite consistent with the dynamics of the tws furthermore liu 2018 revealed the oasis area tended to be stable since 2013 thus it can be concluded that the water allocated into the ejina basin is mainly used to restore the riparian environment and ecological water demand caused by a long term historical water shortage the above evidence demonstrates the inertial property of the gws that is it is slow to recover from perturbations one important reason for the increase of water transportation in the lower reaches of the heihe river in recent years is that climate warming has led to an increase of precipitation kuang and jiao 2016 qiang et al 2016 accelerated melting of glaciers yao et al 2012 and permafrost degradation qin et al 2016 in the qilian mountains under the background of climate warming it is predicted that the gws will increase in the ejina basin in the future with the continuous ewdp however the main object of the ewdp is to restore the oasis ecosystem rather than infinitely expanding groundwater reserves although there is an interdependence between them the uplift of the groundwater level within a certain range is generally beneficial to the regulation and storage of groundwater reservoir and conducive to plant growth effective transpiration t while in the arid zone when the water level rises above a certain range soil evaporation will be aggravated ineffective evaporation e and the shallow soil salt will accumulate excessively which will also cause soil salinization and ultimately inhibit plant growth naumburg et al 2005 balancing the relationship of groundwater in the riparian zone and the gobi desert and rationally controlling the t et is an important and urgent issue in optimizing the ecological water diversion strategy zhao et al 2016 revealed that the cultivated lands in the ejina basin experienced dramatic expansion between 2000 and 2006 the increased water diversion might stimulate the agriculture activities nevertheless we insist that the cultivated land should be controlled and limited to a certain degree the situation in the central valley of the u s indicated that water transfers to the arid areas actually amplify the impacts of droughts because they supply water during times of excess but restrict transfers during droughts scanlon et al 2012 despite the fact that groundwater dynamics is expected to be delayed with the climate induced variations under the influence of human activities the reaction time of deep groundwater to climate could be shortened because groundwater pumping is promoted or mitigated by the drought or wet gurdak 2017 russo and lall 2017 under the background of climate warming continued glacier shrinkage would eventually transform the glacial nival runoff regime in the upper heihe river into a nival pluvial regime with a much larger year to year variability in water yields sorg et al 2012 this is a reminder of why the management and distribution of water resources must be rationally planned from the systematic aspect of the water cycle the gws depletion in the desert regions of the central ap e g the bjd have been mainly interpreted as being driven by human induced gws depletion in neighboring basins jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 however the significant negative correlation between the et and gws indicates that the decline in the gws is more likely warming induced chen et al 2004 reported that a large annual volume of water 5 108 m3 a 1 from the qilian mountains recharges the groundwater of the bjd however despite increases in precipitation and snow melt water in the qilian mountains in the last few decades kuang and jiao 2016 qiang et al 2016 yao et al 2012 the tws in the bjd decreased during that same period our work shows that the monthly tws and the de trended annual tws are significantly correlated with the local monthly precipitation and previous year precipitation in adjacent mountains respectively this indicates that groundwater in the bjd is mainly recharged by the precipitation of local areas and mountainous areas adjacent to the desert which is also supported by isotopic evidence dong et al 2016 luo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and water level observations jiao et al 2015 jing et al 2015 pumping groundwater for irrigation has resulted in the continuous decline of the groundwater table in the southeastern ap for example the observed maximum drawdown was more than 26 m from 2004 to 2016 in the irrigated area of the xitan the decreasing rates of gws in the three irrigated areas is consistent with the magnitude of groundwater withdrawal table 1 that is the most intense gws depletion happens in the area with most severe groundwater exploitation i e in yaoba and vice versa however the declining rates of wtd which have the greatest value in the xitan do not follow this pattern this should be attributed to the difference in the hydrogeological settings such as the aquifer specific yield han 2013 jiang 2009 the sensitivity of the water table to groundwater extraction mainly depends on the sediment texture and recharge rate a finer grained textured aquifer generally has a smaller specific yield and lower permeability bear 1979 and thus is more sensitive to pumping 5 3 possible flow path of regional groundwater system the groundwater flow system generally has a hierarchical structure that is the size and depth of groundwater flow system can be different and can overlie one another along with the changes of the study scale as it has been proposed in tóth 1963 and tóth 1980 locally the shallow groundwater flow over the ap is regulated by topography and closely interacts with the surface water such as the heihe river and lakes in the deserts underling the local flow systems basin and regional flow systems are mainly controlled by hydrogeological conditions such as the fault and lithology of the aquifers previous studies have revealed that except for the yabrai mountains the bjd might also receive recharge from the midstream area of the heihe river basin through the altyn fault belt dong et al 2013 and then discharge to the downstream area of the ejina basin wang et al 2013 which was estimated as 1 36 108 m3 a 1 on the southeastern ap the tengger desert is recharged by the surrounding mountains i e the helan mountains the qilian mountains and the yabrai mountains and discharges to the minqin basin on the west of the tengger desert fig 1 and ulan buh desert ding et al 2013 tan and zhou 1985 however with intensive human activities pumping of deep groundwater the natural flow system can be greatly disturbed gorelick and zheng 2015 the well spatially organized gws depletion pattern which gradually weakened from southeast to northwest indicates that the groundwater abstraction on the southeastern ap might have direct deplete storage and indirect through modifying the flow system impact on the regional groundwater system as is schematically illustrated in fig 8 that is long term over exploitation of deep confined groundwater generally with the depth more than 100 m on the piedmont plain of the southeastern ap and the minqin basin has led to the decline of the water table and expansion of groundwater funnels yu et al 2018 zhu et al 2007 this induced the further increasing deep groundwater recharge from the tengger desert which has been already observed via the shrinkage of saline lakes in the tengger desert qiao et al 2006 and via the rise of deep groundwater salinity in some areas of the southeastern ap during summer in addition as is also shown in fig 2 the tws in areas around the tengger desert are more depleted than its central part that depletion might move the groundwater divide in the yabrai mountains northwest and potentially decrease the mountain groundwater discharge to the bjd fig 8 similarly the gws depletion in the bjd would inevitably reduce the volume of groundwater discharge to the ejina basin thus in addition to the previous explanation it may be also the case that while surface recharge increases due to the ewdp deep groundwater recharge decreases resulting in a reduction in total groundwater reserves in the ejina basin however constrained by limited observations knowledge of the regional groundwater flow system which is a fundamental basis for water resource management remains unclear over the ap with developments in satellite observation the grace product provides us a chance to understand the regional groundwater flow system from a systematic perspective and to diagnose the anthropogenic and natural influences thus further works including field surveys and modeling studies are imperative in the future 6 conclusions the ap one of the largest dry plateaus in the world experienced significant decreases in the tws over the past decade despite consistent levels of precipitation recharge during the period 2003 2016 the tws declined in the southeastern part at the rate of 0 26 mm month 1 as it moves towards to the northwest the rate gradually changes to nearly 0 mm month 1 this spatial variability in the tws is mainly controlled by various human activities and climatic factors on the northwestern ap since 2000 the implemented ewdp has relived the previous groundwater depletion in the lower reaches of the heihe river and the gws in that region has shown a slight increasing trend from 2013 in contrast long term extraction of groundwater associated with irrigation and domestic use strongly depletes the gws in the southeastern ap which is evinced by the continuously declining water table and increasing et the central ap the bjd also experienced decreases in gws these are likely associated with the warming induced increase of et additionally the tws signal provides eloquent evidence that the groundwater in the bjd is being recharged by modern precipitation furthermore the well spatially organized gws depletion pattern which gradually weakened from southeast to northwest indicates that groundwater abstraction on southeastern ap might have already directly and indirectly changed the regional groundwater system given the significance of groundwater to ecologically fragile regions like the ap understanding of the relative contributions of climate effects and human influences to changes in groundwater will allow for better water management decision making providing a probable naturally based solution to protect ecological and social economic security declaration of competing interest

6291,the groundwater storage of china s alxa plateau ap one of the driest plateaus in the world with a mixed landscape of deserts including the gobi natural riparian oases and mosaic groundwater fed irrigation areas is vulnerable to global climate change and enhanced human activities in this study we revealed the temporal and spatial pattern of the changes in groundwater storage gws across the ap by integrating satellite observations hydrological modelling and ground data during the period of 2003 2016 our results showed the gws experienced a significant decreasing trend across the ap while the precipitation did not significantly change gws continues to decrease in the center of the ap i e the badain jaran desert which is likely associated with the fact of increasing evapotranspiration the anthropogenic influences were reflect as the long term extraction of groundwater has strongly depleted the gws in the southeastern ap however in the northwestern part of the ap groundwater depletion has been relieved due to the water diversion project with general increasing river runoff furthermore based on our analysis and a broad review of the studies in other sub regions over the ap the possible regional flow path was proposed with particular addressing on the likely influence by anthropogenic activities the dynamics in the gws among the different hydrogeological units is likely interconnected through regional groundwater flow paths decreasing of gws in the central ap which would lead to reducing groundwater discharge to the northwestern ap might further cause the groundwater depletion in the northwestern ap our results emphasize the tempo spatial patterns in gws change and the associated hydrological and ecological processes across the dry plateau identifying and untangling the various processes that impact on groundwater storage would allow us to develop more effective water management strategies keywords groundwater depletion water storage change grace arid area alxa plateau 1 introduction groundwater is generally characterized by relatively even distribution and high quality and is a reliable water source for both natural ecosystems and human activities döll et al 2012 orellana et al 2012 in arid regions where rainfall is low and surface water is insufficient the importance of groundwater is extremely significant according to gleeson et al 2016 global groundwater storage gws in the upper 2 km of the continental crust has been estimated at 22 6 million km3 this is far more than the total volume of surface water however a growing influence of anthropogenic factors during the past several decades has induced a global depletion in groundwater resources wada et al 2010 studies have revealed that over half of the gws depletion in iran joodaki et al 2014 and 38 of the gws variability in northwest india asoka et al 2017 could be attributed to human groundwater abstraction in asia the anthropogenic depletion of groundwater 100 47 gt a 1 is estimated as accounting for 38 of the terrestrial water storage tws loss 261 25 gt a 1 during 2003 and 2009 yi et al 2016 a global estimation indicated the climate driven tws gross 470 gt a 1 is largely eliminated by human driven loss in tws 350 gt a 1 which is mainly due to groundwater depletion reager et al 2016 globally approximately 40 of irrigation water which constitutes 90 of global consumptive water use is derived from groundwater sources siebert et al 2010 with the intensification of groundwater extraction for irrigation serious groundwater depletion has been extensively reported in arid areas during the past few decades the most affected regions include the north china plain feng et al 2013 northwestern india asoka et al 2017 rodell et al 2009 california and the southern high plains in north america scanlon et al 2012 and the middle east joodaki et al 2014 voss et al 2013 recently wang et al 2018 have revealed that the tws depletion in global endorheic basins was estimated as 106 32 gt a 1 with a contribution of nearly 38 from groundwater loss during 2002 and 2016 which is twice that in exorheic regions although only one fifth of the global land area of the endorheic basin as the endorheic basin is a relatively closed system to water the net water loss would contribute a significant portion of sea level rise highlighting the significance of water storage in inland regions for the global water cycle and the importance of rational water management in inland regions the alxa plateau ap an endorheic region in northwest china is one of the driest plateaus in the world fig 1 its great distance from the coast forms an extremely continental climate which makes the natural ecosystems and human development heavily dependent on groundwater historically the landscape has changed significantly due to hydrological changes induced by both climate change and human activities chen et al 2014 li et al 2017b luo et al 2016 despite the low degree of human activities which are generally concentrated in several limited areas of the ap such activity could have great influence on the water circulation of large areas furthermore the local groundwater dependent vegetation serves as an ecological defense for east asia because the ap is one of the most important sandstorm sources in china gou et al 2012 wang et al 2004 thus the water consumption of human society and natural ecosystems is highly competitive and a rational water resource management stratagem is particularly important in such a water limited environment however due to relatively few observations research on the groundwater storage and its changes in this region are very limited and have never been studied as a whole over the ap cao et al 2012 jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 an accurate understanding of the response of groundwater storage under such different water management strategies is critical to decision making efforts aiming to address this issue this study estimates changes in terrestrial water storage on the ap based on satellite data model simulation and observation data to 1 reveal the water storage changes in such an endorheic region 2 diagnose the reasons leading to the depletion of gws and 3 understand how water management and climate variability influence the water storage in this region 2 study area the ap has an area of nearly 270 000 km2 and elevations ranging from 740 to 3556 m a s l fig 1 the eastern edge of the ap is bordered by the helan mountains the langshan mountains and the yellow river to the north the plateau ends in a series of low hills the zongnai mountains to the west it is bounded by the mazong mountains and to the southwest by the longshou mountains and the qilian mountains yao et al 2011 the landform is dominated by deserts and the gobi desert the ap is mainly characterized by an extreme continental climate mean annual precipitation decreases form the southeast 200 mm to the northwest 40 mm at the same time potential evapotranspiration et increases from the southeast 2200 mm to the northwest 2800 mm he et al 2007 xi et al 2013 owing to such an arid environment surface runoff only occasionally occurs in mountain regions except for the heihe river no other runoff comes from the outside the ap based on the characteristics of the landform and human activities the ap can be generally divided into three sub regions from northwest to southeast which are the inland river basin the desert region and the irrigated areas the ejina basin on the northwestern ap is located in the lower reaches of heihe river basin the heihe river which originates from the qilian mountains and terminates in the east juyan lake in the ejina basin fig 1 is the only major river in the ap it branches into two streams which are the east river and the west river at the langxinshan except for some oasis vegetation that has developed along the river generally with a width of less than 2 km which corresponds to the riparian zone most of the ejina basin belongs to the gobi desert region the oasis developed along the rivers is an important ecological barrier for the regional environment wang et al 2011b zhang et al 2011 owing to the large expansion of irrigated farmlands in the midstream area since the 1950s the amount of water entering the ejina basin was significantly decreased wang et al 2014 wang et al 2011a this resulted in the decline of the regional groundwater table and shrinking of the terminal lake i e juyan lake in addition it led to the death of riparian plants degradation of the oases that develop along the streams and deterioration of the local environment e g an increase of sandstorms finally humans in turn suffered the results of irrational water consumption to restore the riparian ecosystem the central government implemented an ecological water diversion project ewdp in 2000 to limit the water use in the midstream and to guarantee that the discharge downstream should be no less than 1 58 billion m3 a 1 cheng et al 2014 since then the water table in riparian zone has increased wang et al 2011b the east juyan lake has been recovered li et al 2017a and the oases have changed for the better zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 in the middle portion of the ap there are two huge deserts namely the badain jaran desert bjd and the tengger desert with relatively low levels of human activities the bjd is the second largest desert of china with an area of approximately 52 100 km2 luo et al 2017 zhu et al 2010 the landscape in the bjd is dominated by numerous large sand dunes interspersed with more than 100 lakes of varying salinity dong et al 2013 most of the lakes are permanent surface water bodies the tengger desert with an area of 42 700 km2 is the fourth largest desert of china dong 2011 there are more than 400 lake basins in the tengger desert and approximately 250 of them are perennial dong 2011 because of the low precipitation ma et al 2014 the lakes in the desert region are mainly fed by groundwater dong et al 2016 in the southeastern portion of the ap in which a major concentration of human activities exists is located the ulan buh desert and some piedmont plains the ulan buh desert with an area of 11 000 km2 is situated on the west bank of the yellow river tectonically it is part of the hetao basin zhao et al 2012 the ulan buh desert consists of a high dune zone in the south a low dune zone in the west a dry wetland and lake bed zone in the north and a sand zone in the east chen et al 2014 most of the present desert region was covered by a jilantai hetao mega paleolake until approximately 90 ka ago chen et al 2014 the piedmont plains are the main gathering area of human activities and are home to many large irrigation areas and towns human activities there which include agriculture households and manufacturing are almost totally dependent on groundwater resources owing to afforestation projects e g the grain for green project cao et al 2011 the vegetation in the ulan buh desert and eastern tengger desert has significantly expanded in recent years yuan 2015 3 data and methods 3 1 grace data the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission launched by nasa and the german aerospace center in march 2002 allows us to measure variations of total water storage tws at large scales with a monthly time resolution tapley et al 2004 over land temporal variations in the gravity field are mainly due to tws change which is the vertically integrated measure of groundwater soil moisture snow ice and surface water through modeling or observation of the other components of water storage change the gws can be isolated from the tws asoka et al 2017 feng et al 2013 ma et al 2017 macdonald et al 2016 this study uses 151 months of data ranging from january 2003 to december 2016 with 17 months missing data the gridded grace tws data were obtained from three processing centers 1 the center for space research at university of texas at austin 2 the jet propulsion laboratory at the california institute of technology and 3 the german research center for geoscience these data sets are freely available from the following website https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the spatial resolution of all three data sets is 1 degree thirty two pixels covering the whole study region were chosen for estimating values to reduce uncertainty the average of the three data sets was calculated for each cell each month the missing data are obtained via simple temporal interpolation using adjacent data andrew et al 2017 3 2 meteorological data 3 2 1 precipitation we used the china monthly surface precipitation 0 5 0 5 gridded dataset v2 0 cnp05 available at http data cma cn to estimate precipitation variability between 2003 and 2016 in the study region the cnp05 is a gridded dataset released by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration this dataset was derived by interpolating the observed precipitation data from 2472 stations over china since 1961 zhao et al 2014 owing to the high quality of this dataset it has been widely used in climate change studies bueh et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 3 2 2 evapotranspiration the dataset of global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 1a gleam available at https www gleam eu were used for the regional et analysis this dataset provides different components of terrestrial evaporation e g transpiration bare soil evaporation interception loss open water evaporation and sublimation etc spanning a 37 year period 1980 2016 the spatial resolution is 0 25 degrees and the temporal resolution is one day martens et al 2017 the dataset has been extensively validated and inter compared with other methodologies to estimate heat fluxes miralles et al 2011 trambauer et al 2014 and was widely used in large scale climate change studies forzieri et al 2017 greve et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 through comparisons with eddy covariance et data in several biome types yang et al 2017 and bai and liu 2018 concluded that the gleam estimated actual et consistent with observations and has a reasonable accuracy in china to match the resolution of the grace dataset for this study we first calculated the monthly et by accumulating the daily et then every 16 grids in 1 degree cells were averaged to represent the monthly et of the corresponding grace cells 3 2 3 soil water content soil moisture content values produced by noah simulations of the global land data assimilation system version 2 1 gldasv2 1 noah beaudoing et al 2016 rodell et al 2004 were used for estimating the soil water storage sws dynamics the model was forced with a combination of model and observation based forcing datasets the resulting dataset contains 4 layer soil moisture content values for depths of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm at two spatial resolutions 0 25 and 1 degree and two temporal resolutions 3 hourly and monthly inter comparisons between the soil moisture products of gldasv2 1 noah and some other reanalysis datasets e g the esa cci era interim jra 55 etc revealed that gldasv2 1 noah generally has a better performance liu et al 2019 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 moreover an evaluation by biao et al 2018 indicated that the outputs of gldasv2 1 noah are in good agreement with observations in western china previous studies have shown that because of the hyper arid climate of the ap precipitation infiltration depth is basically between 30 and 50 mm li et al 2017c thus the soil moisture content is low and tends to vary mainly in the upper 50 cm of soil du et al 2018 hou et al 2016 li et al 2016 lu et al 2012 shang 2014 to avoid introducing too many model errors therefore the sws is calculated by a countup of the soil water content in the upper two layers 0 10 cm and 10 40 cm of the gldasv2 1 noah model which generally represents the climatic forcing effects on soil moisture dynamics we admit that would potentially underestimate the root zone sws 3 3 hydrological observations 3 3 1 groundwater table the observed monthly water table depth wtd in the ejina basin and the irrigated areas which are indicators of the anthropogenic influence i e water diversion and pumping on the groundwater dynamics were used to verify the grace derived water storage variation spatial distribution and statistical characteristics of the wells are shown in fig 2 and table 1 wells in the ejina basin three of which are in the riparian zone r1 r2 and r3 and three in the gobi desert zone g1 g2 and g3 have an average wtd of 2 97 m with a deeper water table and weaker variation in the gobi desert in the irrigated areas due to extensive groundwater extraction the water table generally has a deep depth and strong variation the mean wtd in the irrigated area of yaoba xitan and chahaertan is 22 32 m 71 56 m and 65 42 m respectively 3 3 2 river discharge in the ejina basin the shallow groundwater is almost completely recharged by the heihe river which is an ephemeral stream with the flow regulated by the ewdp wang et al 2017 among all the water diversion into the ejina volume of the water inflow at the langxinshan hydrologic section 30 is allocated to the west river and 70 to the east river the water in the west river can hardly reach the west juyan lake but most is dissipated by evaporation and replenishes the groundwater for the east river approximately 14 of the river flow is ends up in the terminal lake of the east juyan lake thus to estimate the influence of water diversion on gws dynamics in the typical area of the ejina basin the monthly discharge q at the hydrologic station of the langxinshan and east juyanhai fig 1 from 2003 to 2016 was used to quantify the surface inflow along the stream qsin qlangxinshan qjuyanhai 3 4 methods except for a few small lakes in the ejina basin e g east juyan lake that are fed by the heihe river from outside the ap all the other surface waters which mainly distribute in the desert regions are primarily recharged by groundwater jiao et al 2015 hence the surface water storage changes were neglected when conducting regional groundwater storage analysis getirana et al 2017 furthermore as winter rainfall is scare the snow water equivalent can also be neglected thus the gws anomalies can be estimated by subtracting the soil water component from the anomalies in tws that is gws tws sws because of the large variations in water cycle characteristics and degree of human activity across the ap there may be regional differences in influencing factors of water storage dynamics thus typical pixels sub areas in sub regions fig 2 were chosen for detailed analysis which are 1 the area between the two tributaries of the lower heihe river representing an inland river basin environment with controlled river discharge wang et al 2011a 2 the central part of the ap which is located in the bjd and represents a desert environment with low degree of human disturbance 3 irrigated areas in the southeast part of the ap which have a long history of groundwater pumping to evaluate the relative contribution of different components of water storage such as sws and gws on tws variability linear regression was utilized the relative contribution was estimated on the basis of the fraction of total variability r2 in tws explained by gws or sws as used in previous studies e g asoka et al 2017 furthermore correlation and lag correlation r were used to reveal the causality and response time between different hydrological processes 4 results 4 1 water storage changes over ap grace observations of monthly tws anomalies from 2003 to 2016 are shown in fig 2 all the pixels show a significant change trend p 0 01 although there are a few pixels in the westernmost region that have a trend close to 0 a clear negative trend in the grace tws estimates is mainly found over the ap the decreasing pattern of the tws on the ap is well spatially organized with a much greater depletion in the eastern and central ap and an unobvious change in the northwestern ap the magnitude of depletion changes from close to 0 mm month 1 in the northwest to 0 26 mm month 1 in the southeast with a mean value of 0 11 mm month 1 which equates to the loss of 39 3 million m3 each year over the ap the et and sws have a tight relationship with precipitation fig 3 with correlation coefficients of 0 91 and 0 69 at the 99 confidence level respectively there are no significant changes in annual precipitation over the ap however the sws showed a slightly increasing trend 0 14 mm a 1 this trend may be associated with the relatively dry period that occurred between 2004 and 2006 fig 3 which resulted in depletion of soil moisture the small difference between the tws trend 0 11 mm month 1 and gws trend 0 12 mm month 1 indicates that the sws has limited influence on the long term trend of the tws in such an arid climate the gws explains 76 of tws variability over the ap meaning that the gws change plays the most significant role in the terrestrial water balance of the ap this is quite different with the typical situation in the global terrestrial scale where is has been estimated that sws and gws contributed 51 2 and 17 4 to the tws respectively getirana et al 2017 4 2 main factors affect the gws in sub regions 4 2 1 downstream of inland river basin previous studies revealed that the groundwater level had obviously risen and vegetation had significantly recovered in the riparian zone of the ejina basin since the implementation of the ewdp in 2000 guo et al 2008 wang et al 2011b zhou et al 2018 apparently this means an increase of gws as the groundwater level is a direct indicator of gws dynamics however the estimated tws and gws were significantly p 0 01 depleted with the rates of 0 018 and 0 035 mm month 1 from 2003 to 2016 respectively fig s1 how to explain the inconsistency between the water level records and the grace estimation whether the groundwater depletion exits or not if the depletion happened does it or would it continue these questions are critical for evaluating the effects of ewdp and for future policy making the monthly wtd records indicated that the observation wells basically showed increases of the water table during apr 2011 and dec 2016 except the g1 which was slightly decreased table 1 and fig 4 the trends are significant and greater in the riparian zone while they are insignificant and weaker in the gobi desert to investigate the causes of these differences r2 and g1 were chosen for special estimation as it is shown in fig 4 the wtd dynamic of r2 and the river discharge is significantly correlated r 0 41 p 0 01 indicating that the water level in the riparian zone r2 is directly controlled by the river discharge as the distance to the river bank increases the variance of wtd of g1 becomes gentler and there is a significant lag correlation p 0 05 between the wtd of g1 and r2 with the maximum correlation r 0 31 p 0 01 at 4 and 5 month lag times fig 5 a this means a delayed response of gobi desert groundwater to river flow more notable is the fact that the groundwater level shows a declining and a rising trend before and after 2013 in the gobi desert respectively fig 4 this is quite different from the situation in the riparian zone which manifests as continuously rising however it matches well the long term trend of the tws which showed an overall decreasing trend from 2003 to 2016 but a slight increasing trend from 2013 to 2016 fig s1 furthermore the tws anomalies were significantly correlated with the wtd dynamics and the strongest correlation r 0 49 p 0 01 is obtained when comparing the tws signal with the wtd record from 2 months before fig 5 b nevertheless the estimated gws does not show any significant correlation with the wtd dynamics this might be attributed to the errors in sws which are quite low in such an extremely arid region due to little precipitation a mean annual precipitation of 36 6 mm liu et al 2016 and contribute little to the tws it can be concluded that the tws dynamics in this region is mainly controlled by the ewdp and it has nearly a half year 6 7 months time span delay with the water diversion the lag time indicates a lateral groundwater recharge from upper reaches which also sources from the water diversion and makes a great contribution to the tws dynamics in addition the influence of the lateral migration process of the groundwater on gws which has rarely been mentioned should arouse the attention of academic circles and command further study 4 2 2 desert region although there is no surface runoff and the precipitation is low in the bjd it contains many perennial lakes dong et al 2013 four main hypotheses have been put forward to explain the source of the water in these lakes dong et al 2013 1 direct precipitation recharge in the watershed or slope areas of nearby mountains to the south gates et al 2008 2 groundwater recharge from nearby areas ding and wang 2007 3 remote source recharge from the qilian mountains and the qinghai tibetan plateau chen et al 2004 4 paleowater formed during past periods when the climate was wetter yang and williams 2003 recent studies indicate that the lakes are likely mainly recharged by groundwater dong et al 2013 jiao et al 2015 although the exact mechanism of groundwater circulation remains unclear and the water source of the bjd groundwater is still under debate the decreasing trend of tws and gws fig s2 which are estimated as 0 118 and 0 143 mm month 1 respectively are generally consistent with the results of jiao et al 2015 and zhang et al 2018 this indicated that the groundwater in the bjd was in a negative balance state which was also confirmed by extensive shrinking of lake in the bjd jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 the precipitation controls the surface sws variance and affects the et on a seasonal scale fig s2 a however it has limited influence on the inter annual variability of the sws and tws fig 6 a although there were no significant changes in precipitation between 2003 and 2016 the et significantly increased at a rate of 2 51 mm a 1 p 0 01 which generally corresponds with the decreasing rate of the gws 1 74 mm a 1 fig 6 a meanwhile a significant negative correlation r 0 54 p 0 05 between the annual et and the gws indicates that groundwater depletion in bjd regions might be attributed to the increase of et recently increasing amounts of vegetation have been detected in the southeastern bjd due to human afforestation liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the greening and groundwater extraction would contribute to the increase of et and loss of tws to a certain degree yet the increase of et revealed in this study is more likely driven by climatic variability given that the human impacts generally are not well represented in the assimilation products e g the gleam furthermore we found that the de trended annual tws and gws had a significantly one year delayed correlation with annual precipitation owing to the high rate of potential et the rainfall on the surface is quickly evaporated into the air and the soil water generally has a short memory of precipitation thus we suspect this signal might reflect the lateral recharge of groundwater from nearby mountain regions we analyzed the precipitation in the yabrai mountains and qilian mountains results indicated the annual precipitation in these two regions has different variation characteristics fig 6 b both the de trended tws and gws have a significant time lagged correlation with precipitation in the yabrai mountains r 0 58 p 0 05 for tws and r 0 73 p 0 01 for gws as the distance from the yabrai mountains increases the correlations decreased not shown here however there is no obvious response of the water storage in bjd to the precipitation in the qilian mountains this evidenced that precipitation in nearby mountains is an important source of the bjd s groundwater 4 2 3 irrigated areas the southeastern part of the ap experiences the highest degree of human activity croplands there are entirely dependent on groundwater irrigation the groundwater level dynamics from 2010 to 2016 showed that the variation of the water table seems to have an opposite phase as the precipitation fig s3 this is attributed to the groundwater pumping for irrigation in the growing season because the local rainfall is not sufficient to support crops the withdrawal of groundwater is associated with sharp declines in the water table at the seasonal scale and can lead to continuous depletion of groundwater year by year the lowering of the water table in three irrigated areas is associated with decreasing tws and gws and increasing et table 2 because annual precipitation wasn t significantly changed and the wtd is deeper than 15 m the increased et can be ascribed to the intensified groundwater pumping linear regression of annual mean wtd and tws for 2010 2016 indicated significant correlations between them fig 7 the wtd contributes approximately 80 76 and 15 to total tws variability r 2 in chahaertan xitan and yaoba respectively a relatively weaker correlation between the tws and wtd in the pixel indicates that the irrigated area of yaoba is attributed to a large contribution of municipal water since groundwater is the only water source for human society in the region long term exploitation has led to continuous depletion of the gws 5 discussion 5 1 credibility of estimation the gws is estimated as deducting the sws from the tws in this study based on the fact that limited snow cover and scarce surface water exists on the ap in such an arid environment with an annual potential et of approximately 1500 mm the soil water content is quite low and the limited precipitation can hardly infiltrate into soil layers deeper than 50 cm du et al 2018 hou et al 2016 li et al 2016 lu et al 2012 shang 2014 thus the uncertainty in the sws is a main factor influencing the accuracy of the estimated gws the errors in model simulation generally increase with depth due to lake of representation of sub surface properties although gldasv2 1 noah provides soil moisture data at the 0 2 m depth to avoid introducing too many model errors we only represent the tws with the soil moisture content within 40 cm depth which would potentially underestimate the tws even so however the soil moisture variability still tends to be overestimated in the ejina basin where the tws shows significant correlation with the wtd dynamics rather than the gws that in turn provides a verification of the reliability of the grace estimations nevertheless in the irrigated areas i e the southeastern ap because a large amount of the extracted groundwater is used for irrigation which is generally not included in the assimilation system the soil moisture variability should be underestimated however since the local environment exhibits a deep wtd and high potential et there is little return flow to groundwater thus the water extracted from groundwater is nearly totally lost to the atmosphere in conclusion based on our estimation the soil moisture has a limited influence on the tws variation and the decline of the tws is mainly attributed to groundwater depletion 5 2 anthropogenic and natural factor influences on regional groundwater system the significant correlations between the tws and wtd and river discharge indicate that water diversion largely controls the variability of groundwater storage despite the fact that the volume of water diversion to the ejina basin is increasing and the vegetation is recovering since the ewdp which has generally been concluded to be due to an increase of gws the grace derived water storage shows an overall declining trend our estimation indicated that different from the situation in the riparian zone where the water level is continuously raised the water level in the gobi area began to show a rising trend until 2013 which is quite consistent with the dynamics of the tws furthermore liu 2018 revealed the oasis area tended to be stable since 2013 thus it can be concluded that the water allocated into the ejina basin is mainly used to restore the riparian environment and ecological water demand caused by a long term historical water shortage the above evidence demonstrates the inertial property of the gws that is it is slow to recover from perturbations one important reason for the increase of water transportation in the lower reaches of the heihe river in recent years is that climate warming has led to an increase of precipitation kuang and jiao 2016 qiang et al 2016 accelerated melting of glaciers yao et al 2012 and permafrost degradation qin et al 2016 in the qilian mountains under the background of climate warming it is predicted that the gws will increase in the ejina basin in the future with the continuous ewdp however the main object of the ewdp is to restore the oasis ecosystem rather than infinitely expanding groundwater reserves although there is an interdependence between them the uplift of the groundwater level within a certain range is generally beneficial to the regulation and storage of groundwater reservoir and conducive to plant growth effective transpiration t while in the arid zone when the water level rises above a certain range soil evaporation will be aggravated ineffective evaporation e and the shallow soil salt will accumulate excessively which will also cause soil salinization and ultimately inhibit plant growth naumburg et al 2005 balancing the relationship of groundwater in the riparian zone and the gobi desert and rationally controlling the t et is an important and urgent issue in optimizing the ecological water diversion strategy zhao et al 2016 revealed that the cultivated lands in the ejina basin experienced dramatic expansion between 2000 and 2006 the increased water diversion might stimulate the agriculture activities nevertheless we insist that the cultivated land should be controlled and limited to a certain degree the situation in the central valley of the u s indicated that water transfers to the arid areas actually amplify the impacts of droughts because they supply water during times of excess but restrict transfers during droughts scanlon et al 2012 despite the fact that groundwater dynamics is expected to be delayed with the climate induced variations under the influence of human activities the reaction time of deep groundwater to climate could be shortened because groundwater pumping is promoted or mitigated by the drought or wet gurdak 2017 russo and lall 2017 under the background of climate warming continued glacier shrinkage would eventually transform the glacial nival runoff regime in the upper heihe river into a nival pluvial regime with a much larger year to year variability in water yields sorg et al 2012 this is a reminder of why the management and distribution of water resources must be rationally planned from the systematic aspect of the water cycle the gws depletion in the desert regions of the central ap e g the bjd have been mainly interpreted as being driven by human induced gws depletion in neighboring basins jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 however the significant negative correlation between the et and gws indicates that the decline in the gws is more likely warming induced chen et al 2004 reported that a large annual volume of water 5 108 m3 a 1 from the qilian mountains recharges the groundwater of the bjd however despite increases in precipitation and snow melt water in the qilian mountains in the last few decades kuang and jiao 2016 qiang et al 2016 yao et al 2012 the tws in the bjd decreased during that same period our work shows that the monthly tws and the de trended annual tws are significantly correlated with the local monthly precipitation and previous year precipitation in adjacent mountains respectively this indicates that groundwater in the bjd is mainly recharged by the precipitation of local areas and mountainous areas adjacent to the desert which is also supported by isotopic evidence dong et al 2016 luo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and water level observations jiao et al 2015 jing et al 2015 pumping groundwater for irrigation has resulted in the continuous decline of the groundwater table in the southeastern ap for example the observed maximum drawdown was more than 26 m from 2004 to 2016 in the irrigated area of the xitan the decreasing rates of gws in the three irrigated areas is consistent with the magnitude of groundwater withdrawal table 1 that is the most intense gws depletion happens in the area with most severe groundwater exploitation i e in yaoba and vice versa however the declining rates of wtd which have the greatest value in the xitan do not follow this pattern this should be attributed to the difference in the hydrogeological settings such as the aquifer specific yield han 2013 jiang 2009 the sensitivity of the water table to groundwater extraction mainly depends on the sediment texture and recharge rate a finer grained textured aquifer generally has a smaller specific yield and lower permeability bear 1979 and thus is more sensitive to pumping 5 3 possible flow path of regional groundwater system the groundwater flow system generally has a hierarchical structure that is the size and depth of groundwater flow system can be different and can overlie one another along with the changes of the study scale as it has been proposed in tóth 1963 and tóth 1980 locally the shallow groundwater flow over the ap is regulated by topography and closely interacts with the surface water such as the heihe river and lakes in the deserts underling the local flow systems basin and regional flow systems are mainly controlled by hydrogeological conditions such as the fault and lithology of the aquifers previous studies have revealed that except for the yabrai mountains the bjd might also receive recharge from the midstream area of the heihe river basin through the altyn fault belt dong et al 2013 and then discharge to the downstream area of the ejina basin wang et al 2013 which was estimated as 1 36 108 m3 a 1 on the southeastern ap the tengger desert is recharged by the surrounding mountains i e the helan mountains the qilian mountains and the yabrai mountains and discharges to the minqin basin on the west of the tengger desert fig 1 and ulan buh desert ding et al 2013 tan and zhou 1985 however with intensive human activities pumping of deep groundwater the natural flow system can be greatly disturbed gorelick and zheng 2015 the well spatially organized gws depletion pattern which gradually weakened from southeast to northwest indicates that the groundwater abstraction on the southeastern ap might have direct deplete storage and indirect through modifying the flow system impact on the regional groundwater system as is schematically illustrated in fig 8 that is long term over exploitation of deep confined groundwater generally with the depth more than 100 m on the piedmont plain of the southeastern ap and the minqin basin has led to the decline of the water table and expansion of groundwater funnels yu et al 2018 zhu et al 2007 this induced the further increasing deep groundwater recharge from the tengger desert which has been already observed via the shrinkage of saline lakes in the tengger desert qiao et al 2006 and via the rise of deep groundwater salinity in some areas of the southeastern ap during summer in addition as is also shown in fig 2 the tws in areas around the tengger desert are more depleted than its central part that depletion might move the groundwater divide in the yabrai mountains northwest and potentially decrease the mountain groundwater discharge to the bjd fig 8 similarly the gws depletion in the bjd would inevitably reduce the volume of groundwater discharge to the ejina basin thus in addition to the previous explanation it may be also the case that while surface recharge increases due to the ewdp deep groundwater recharge decreases resulting in a reduction in total groundwater reserves in the ejina basin however constrained by limited observations knowledge of the regional groundwater flow system which is a fundamental basis for water resource management remains unclear over the ap with developments in satellite observation the grace product provides us a chance to understand the regional groundwater flow system from a systematic perspective and to diagnose the anthropogenic and natural influences thus further works including field surveys and modeling studies are imperative in the future 6 conclusions the ap one of the largest dry plateaus in the world experienced significant decreases in the tws over the past decade despite consistent levels of precipitation recharge during the period 2003 2016 the tws declined in the southeastern part at the rate of 0 26 mm month 1 as it moves towards to the northwest the rate gradually changes to nearly 0 mm month 1 this spatial variability in the tws is mainly controlled by various human activities and climatic factors on the northwestern ap since 2000 the implemented ewdp has relived the previous groundwater depletion in the lower reaches of the heihe river and the gws in that region has shown a slight increasing trend from 2013 in contrast long term extraction of groundwater associated with irrigation and domestic use strongly depletes the gws in the southeastern ap which is evinced by the continuously declining water table and increasing et the central ap the bjd also experienced decreases in gws these are likely associated with the warming induced increase of et additionally the tws signal provides eloquent evidence that the groundwater in the bjd is being recharged by modern precipitation furthermore the well spatially organized gws depletion pattern which gradually weakened from southeast to northwest indicates that groundwater abstraction on southeastern ap might have already directly and indirectly changed the regional groundwater system given the significance of groundwater to ecologically fragile regions like the ap understanding of the relative contributions of climate effects and human influences to changes in groundwater will allow for better water management decision making providing a probable naturally based solution to protect ecological and social economic security declaration of competing interest

for mapping monitoring and modeling in watershed studies as conservation programs gain awareness and support among downstream users and industries interested in mitigating their impact on natural resources research on hydropedology and these intertwined ecosystem services is increasing naeem et al 2015 with attention often focused on short term soil functioning and long term soil pedogenic processes bouwer et al 2015 de lima et al 2019 hamel et al 2018 ma et al 2017 two of these main dynamics that conservation programs intend on remediating are related to the soil nutrients and hydraulic properties recharging shallow and deep aquifers buytaert et al 2004 in 2014 a large agreement was reached between an ngo the nature conservancy and latin american institutions in order to catalyze partnerships between water users and community stewards that promote conservation projects designed to help enhance watershed ecosystem services the nature conservancy 2014a b ponette gonzález et al 2015 empirical findings in these projects on the conditions of the soils main determinant of these watershed ecosystem services are limited but emerging recently and demonstrating the unique patterns in the humid tropics ponette gonzález et al 2014 wohl et al 2012 hoyos villada et al 2016 for mountainous humid tropics conservation projects must contend with the fact that soil nutrients are known to be spatially heterogeneous and dependent on local climate land use topography and parent material guzman et al 2017b tebebu et al 2017 additionally the humid tropics are regions where leaching of nitrate and accompanying plant nutrients quickly increase in a positive feedback loop after shifting from humid forest cover to cultivated land cover wong and rowell 1994 indicating that empirical findings are static snapshots in dynamic processes changing over time soil hydraulic properties similarly are not only highly dependent on soil surface characteristics but also land use previous researchers have measured strong influences of land use and topography on the infiltration patterns of tropical soils bayabil et al 2010 2019 buytaert et al 2004 hoyos et al 2005 brauman et al 2012 brauman 2015 da silva et al 2016a b tilahun et al 2016 guzman et al 2017b zimale et al 2017 generally forested land use patterns were found to have conditions of greater infiltration than what is measured on areas with altered anthropological use tebebu et al 2017 recently studies have shown the dependence of saturated hydraulic conductivity on the textural heterogeneity of soils garcía gutiérrez et al 2018 and others have noted that in mountainous regions cultivated lands are capable of much lower runoff coefficients than trails unpaved roads abandoned or fallow lands harden 2001 hanson et al 2004 the susceptibility of these land uses to degradation and subsequent hardpan and runoff are tied to the moisture availability and productivity of the soils harden 2001 hanson et al 2004 in order to maximize the ecosystem services provided by the diverse soil qualities indicators of conditions enhancing soil quality such as vegetation cover forests are being studied and promoted among several conservation organizations barrios et al 2006 bonnesoeur et al 2019 bruijnzeel 2004 de lima et al 2019 ponette gonzález et al 2014 naeem et al 2015 it is important to better understand these variations and expected impacts on hydrology as hydropedology suggests ma et al 2017 le bissonnais et al 2005 determined the variability of soil surface characteristics to be an important part of understanding where runoff and sediment concentration would increase in loess soils where hortonian flow processes horton 1933 are dominant this variability needs to be considered in climates and soil conditions where saturation excess flow beven and kirkby 1979 dunne and black 1970 dunne 1983 kirkby 1997 steenhuis et al 2013 may be more important humid tropical mountainous watersheds with volcanic clay soils and high moisture are likely regions where soil surface conditions enable various mixtures of hortonian and saturation excess flow processes to be occurring resulting in implications for watershed conservation programs the southwest colombian andes is a part of the andean mountain range and produces headwaters for several important rivers in colombia s economic and municipal sectors the rio bolo in particular receives waters from paramo high altitude tropical wetlands and high elevation watersheds that have been changing in land use and in their weather patterns a sub watershed of a nested study site within the rio bolo drainage network was chosen for work on soil surface characteristics to complement ongoing watershed ecosystem services research hoyos villada et al 2016 the objective of this study is to investigate the emergent characteristics of a sub humid tropical watershed to better understand the changes in soil surface characteristics that will have the most impact on sediment transport soil quality and changes in vadose zone hydrological processes specifically the land use and hillslope positions will be used as indicators of expected factors influence hydraulic properties saturated hydraulic conductivity ks bulk density ρb texture and chemical properties nutrients organic matter ph at the nascent stage of shifting land use we ask are reforestation initiatives likely to promote soil characteristic changes that could have significant impact on increasing recharge and decreasing sediment and solute transport some hypotheses we posit are that soil properties saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density texture in the tropics enable sufficiently high percolation high ks low ρb in most zones of the highland watersheds such that water from most storms is able to infiltrate and that soil quality indicators are greatest in re forested regions 2 methods 2 1 study site the 75 ha la vega study site is a sub watershed in the rio bolo watershed within the cauca valley in the southwestern colombian andes located at 76 11 42 687 w 3 29 55 541 n fig 1 the five year mean annual rainfall as measured at the international center for tropical agriculture 25 km away from la vega from 2010 to 2014 was 1005 mm distributed over two periods october to january and february to may with periods of dryness in between the climate is influenced by the el niño southern oscillation enso which can bring significant conditions of drought negative anomalies of rainfall and discharge during the warming phase of enso el niño and positive anomalies during the cold phase la niña de lima et al 2017 hoyos et al 2005 poveda et al 2001 in addition the pacific decadal oscillation affects the arrival of drought and flooding periods mantua and hare 2002 high intensity of precipitation can range from 1 0 cm hr 1 to over 2 5 cm hr 1 hoyos et al 2005 ruppenthal et al 1996 sonder 2004 around 40 to 49 of the rainfall intensities in this region have been previously measured to exceed 2 5 cm hr 1 ruppenthal et al 1996 in contrast to the expected 5 of rainfall intensities exceeding this threshold in temperate regions hudson 1971 soils in this region of colombia have been mapped by the geographic institute agustín codazzi igac and are categorized as dystrudepts udorthents eutrudepts hapludolls with outcroppings igac code 47fg2 due to the coarse resolution of this mapping the soil unit code 47fg2 is a combination of these soil types for the region covering la vega the study investigates 16 sites spatially distributed across land use and elevation ranges in the la vega sub watershed fig 2 these distributed sites are positioned to inform effects on erosion and hydrologic recharge eight study points are located on the western portion of the watershed and eight are located on the eastern portion two for each elevation range within the two portions four of the sampled sites are located in the downslope area elevation is 1450 m sites 1 2 3 4 very close to a small forested area with grazing land surrounding the stream sides and outlet fig 2 point 2 and 3 appear to be within the fenced area that is mapped as conserved forest fig 2b however they are physically slightly outside of the actual forest land use and are in fact in open regions where occasional cattle grazing occurs in the middle part of the slope two transects were differentiated four sampling sites within each elevation range the first midslope 1 area is located at a lower elevation range closer to the watershed outlet 1500 m 5 6 7 8 the western side of this range is located in grazing land and the eastern portion is located in forage and plantain cultivation areas the second of the midslope ranges midslope 2 is higher in elevation 1600 m 9 10 11 12

walnut fern palm comino gualanday alder croton and epiphytes the sites at the highest elevations 1700 m 13 14 15 16 were located in range land with regrowth of natural vegetation and trees 2 2 soil sampling and analysis sixteen pvc type monitoring wells were installed with manual soil augers to determine depth of soil thickness and water levels fig 3 in the initial baseline water level measurement water tables were only present at point 15 in the upper slope and at point 2 in the downslope area most piezometers were installed to depths of 3 m there were several locations for example in the midslope forested region where the parent material was near the soil surface that were only installed to a depth of 1 m due to difficulty drilling through the rock layer three soil sampling periods were established beginning of february late february and late march of 2015 to measure primary nutrients total nitrogen tn available phosphorus ap and potassium k as well as soil surface properties such as organic matter om ph and measurement of secondary nutrients magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 at each of the sixteen sampling points a set of split core samplers were used to collect composite soil samples made up of about three combined samples to achieve 1 kg to a depth of 30 cm below the surface fig 4 total nitrogen was analyzed using the uv visible spectrometry technique and available phosphorus was analyzed by the bray ii method while exchangeable cations where estimated using the atomic absorption method organic matter estimation was analyzed by the walkley black method finally particle size analysis was performed to determine soil texture class using the bouyoucos hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 composite disturbed soil samples were analyzed in the laboratory of analytical services in the international center for tropical agriculture ciat in colombia to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity ks laboratory measurements were conducted on six replicates of undisturbed soil samples fig 5 collected in metallic cylinders of 5 cm diameter and at two depths three replicates at 0 5 cm and three replicates at 5 10 cm while a variety of in situ field measurements are available e g double ring infiltrometer guelph permeameter and tension permeameters each has its own drawback in comparison to benchmark steady deep flow rates morbidelli et al 2017 in the absence of readily available large volumes of water for these or other controlled methods the undisturbed soil core method klute and dirksen 1986 reynolds et al 2000 was used as an initial starting benchmark for ks measurements in the catchment these undisturbed samples were analyzed in the physical soil laboratory in the international center for tropical agriculture ciat using the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 and then oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine bulk density ρb pedotransfer functions were used to compare methods of estimating ks from soil texture

2006 for full equations describing these variables statistical analyses of differences between spatial and temporal samples were conducted with student t tests for normally distributed data and with non parametric tests for non normally distributed data bartlett s test was used to determine homogeneity of variances bartlett and fowler 1937 3 results 3 1 spatial and topographical differences in soil physical properties pvc monitoring wells intended to measure water table dynamics captured very little patterns due to the low frequency of visits and apparent deep or dry status of the soil profiles only at the nearest points to the stream were water tables present within the depths of the installed wells this indicates extremely well drained soils within the profile above bedrock and potentially that some of the 3 m depth wells had not reached bedrock nevertheless important information regarding soil profiles was discovered the western portion of the sub watershed had deep soil profiles 3 m deep as revealed through the augering calculated texture averages for this western portion of sampling sites found higher percentages of clay in the top 0 5 cm and 5 10 cm 25 compared to 15 for eastern portion sampling points west of the stream the eastern part of the watershed had variable soil profile depths some areas exceeded 3 m while others had a high content of stones and rocks fig 4 in both sides of the sub watershed the areas with greatest forest cover contained the darkest soils signifying high organic matter content table 1 these regions broadly in the upslope and midslope 2 zones also contained the highest sand content and the lowest clay content in contrast to the lower regions which had the inverse texture relationship table 1 in the upper elevation range regrowth of natural vegetation was found on deep soils 3 m with moderately high ks 26 cm hr 1 and the lowest bulk density 0 92 g cm 3 soil in the lowest elevation range in mixed land use of grazing and riparian forests with deep profiles had the lowest ks 4 cm hr 1 and highest bulk density 1 02 g cm 3 in the middle elevation ranges conserved tropical forest vegetation were located on soils of shallow depths with high organic matter and high ks 86 cm hr 1 when compared with regional precipitation 1005 mm yr 1 the lowest infiltration rate is exceeded about 50 of the time while the average and median infiltration rates were not exceeded the second depths of measurements 5 10 cm showed mostly lower ks than the first depth layer measurement except for at the upslope region first layer 26 cm hr 1 second layer 28 cm hr 1 the coefficient of variation for these soils cv 0 68 1 8 indicate that there is high variability across all slope positions according to the classification of wilding and drees 1983 low variability for cv 0 15 moderate variability for 0 15 cv 0 35 and high variability for cv 0 35 very high cv was similarly found for oxisols in são paulo state brazil for laboratory experiments investigating solute transport and ks spatial variability godoy et al 2019 though most of the saturated hydraulic conductivity tests tended to be highest in the upslope forested areas upslope and midslope 2 within one site of the midslope 1 region in plantain cultivation landcover there was an instance where the measured ks for the first 5 cm was very high 79 cm hr 1 high ks results were similar in areas with high rock content due to the lower bulk density resulting from the larger void spaces caused by the presence of the rocks these void spaces in the profile provide quick flow paths for water to infiltrate high biological activity was observed in various parts of the watershed represented by the macro soil fauna earthworms beetles larvae among other observations in addition to soil profiles with distinctly darker surface soil layers black in comparison to deeper soil layers 3 2 spatio temporal nutrient variation soil nutrient properties are varied throughout

regions as well i e revegetated and natural forested areas were upslope and at midslope 2 regions while actively used lands were at midslope 1 and lower slope regions calcium concentrations are the greatest statistically significant p 0 01 in the midslope 2 position where the greatest proportion of native forest vegetation is found soils tend to be modestly shifting over time and only depleting in certain locations for certain nutrients such as tn and k for example for tn trends for midslope and downslope regions shift slightly lower from the beginning of february till the end of march however this is only statistically significant for k and tn in the midslope 1 zone p 0 05 and near significant for tn p 0 053 in the downslope zone the trend of change overall for the remaining nutrients ap ca2 and mg2 is less sharp for the upslope regions than for midslope and downslope but overall the pattern seems to be decreasing though high variability means that these are not statistically significant fig 7 ap trends decrease in midslope 1 p 0 53 and downslope regions p 0 12 while they increase upslope p 0 19 ca2 and mg2 decrease most notably in the downslope regions p 0 26 and p 0 55 respectively 4 discussion hydropedology considers the feedbacks between water and soil dynamics as can be seen through these results and in other studies topography and land use show controls on the development of soil infiltration bulk density and nutrient conditions bean and dukes 2015 price et al 2010 siltecho et al 2015 zimmermann et al 2006 the soil characteristics that developed in this watershed denote two soil hydraulic and nutrient dynamics conservation implications and some future needs 4 1 soils are compacted and less permeable in non forested conditions soil compaction as measured through bulk density shows an influence of land use and an additional control being induced by topography differences in soil texture class due to elevation has been observed previously in tropical agricultural watersheds taye et al 2018 and elsewhere papanicolaou et al 2015 riebe et al 2015 still whether these texture difference have occurred as a result of land use change and management or whether this relates to geological and climatic differences may require further investigation field studies indicate that the production of fine sediments may be enhanced at lower elevations and inhibited at higher elevations for an alpine catchment in the high sierra california however these elevation differences are on the scale of kilometers rather than hundreds of meters riebe et al 2015 studies investigating contrasting textures along a topographic sequence of thailand rice fields have pointed to the translocation of clays down the soil profile as the primary mechanism for differences boivin et al 2004 in comparison to studies at nearby ciat research stations the proportion of clay between 14 and 26 was much lower than that found in bare fallow fields of quilichao 75 and mondomo 64 experimental fields ruppenthal et al 1996 however as mapped by the igac igac code 47fg2 for the coarse areal average this study found similar results with slightly higher silt and clay fractions than reported for the average of the combination of soils found in this code dystrudepts udorthents eutrudepts hapludolls 65 sand 20 silt 15 clay while slightly different proportions of sand silt and clay are found for the different regions organic matter om appears to be higher at the higher elevation ranges in this study upslope and midslope 2 in addition to its relationship to decreased bulk density higher om could lead to soil storage recovery through nutrients provided and establishment of vegetation both are effects that can potentially reduce runoff through increased capture and storage of water bean and dukes 2014 saturated hydraulic conductivity ks measurements here are determined through laboratory analysis but do not correspond to other measurements that may be determined in the field that are capable of capturing larger characteristics such as macropores greater depths or other soil heterogeneities bean and dukes 2015 morbidelli et al 2017 reynolds et al 2000 the guelph permeameter for example is one approach that might provide a more holistic measurement of the subsoil infiltration dynamics however after several attempts logistical challenges made repeated measurements difficult furthermore tests have sometimes demonstrated that the guelph permeameter can overestimate laboratory controlled experimental soil infiltration rates and underestimate those in natural soil at study plots morbidelli et al 2017 as it measures the conductivity of the matrix and may have a lower probability of measuring macropore flow mohanty et al 1994 while some modifications to the guelph permeameter are available to make it more representative of different porous media types reynolds and lewis 2012 other methods more suited to forested and mountainous conditions may be needed such as single or double ring infiltrometers or soil monolith sampling in cylindrical containers ilek and kucza 2014 ilek et al 2019 hence the data presented here provide a starting point for estimation of infiltration dynamics that could be assumed to be underestimating hydrological subsurface processes at several of the locations brooks et al 2004 noted that in field experiments and modeling exercises point estimates of vertical and lateral hydraulic conductivity can be 10 to 100 times smaller than actual hillslope scale k s due in part to macropores and biological activity lateral flow is also shown to be important as it erodes soil structure internally and thereby increases the conductivity mendoza and steenhuis 2002 in comparison to pedotransfer functions cosby et al 1984 puckett et al 1985 jabro 1992 saxton and rawls 2006 the data in fact were largely underestimated indicating that transfer functions may even be assuming lower conductivities than laboratory measurements capture for their estimate of natural conditions in tropical watersheds of the andes fig 8 the pedotransfer function developed by jabro 1992 was the only empirical formula that actually overestimated the ks by a factor of between 25 and 40 this equation eq 3 was derived from 350 silt loam soil samples originating in southeastern pennsylvania with high bulk density and a well drained nature and high silt fraction the lower bulk densities and silt fractions measured in these andean soils result in estimated values that are much higher than observed values mainly due to the assumptions formulated by the contextually scaled empirical inverse relationship between silt fraction or bulk density and ks the remaining pedotransfer functions also rely on us based soil properties to define the relationships between soil texture bulk density and ks but underestimate the value saxton and rawls 2006 use 2000 samples from the usda nrcs soil survey puckett et al 1985 used samples from the lower coastal plain of alabama and cosby et al 1984 use data from samples obtained over 35 localities in 23 states of the us cosby et al 1984 note that their database did not originally include particle size distribution but rather had percentage sand silt and clay assigned through mid point of soil texture class each of these particular features of the original derived equations show the region specific nature of the equations ramírez et al 2017 also found that for their study in the orinoco river basin colombia the rosetta pedotransfer function schaap et al 2001 likely underestimated ks by a factor of 10 as had similarly been the case in studies for ecuador costa rica and jamaica hafkenscheid 2000 huwe et al 2008 tobón et al 2011 these volcanic soils tend to have much greater conductivity than other soils in similar texture classes upon which pedotransfer functions were developed moreover the value obtained from the reference information for these regional soils mapped by the geographic institute agustín codazzi igac code 47fg2 was also much lower 3 3 cm hr 1 another important finding is the demonstration of vertical non uniformity in saturated hydraulic conductivity though previously understood that upper layers of soil may be more permeable than soils beneath the surface and that a decreasing trend with depth may be observed brooks et al 2004 morbidelli et al 2018 this has not been as widely researched in these mountainous soils some researchers have found hard pan layers in soils ranging from 0 15 m to 0 6 m from the surface of the soil in degraded mountainous regions tebebu et al 2017 more findings describing these variable depth profiles will help to integrate the tropical dynamics into modeling practices describing runoff from tropical hilly watersheds 4 2 nutrients are lower in non forested conditions the concentration of total nitrogen available phosphorus and exchangeable cations demonstrate low availability in non forested compacted areas in the lower portions of the watershed downslope these areas experience more disruption and have processes that could lead to depletion of the nutrients as has been found in other mountainous regions guzman et al 2017b tebebu et al 2017 furthermore found that the depletion of nutrients and organic matter is indicative of degradation processes that increase the disaggregation of soils and later leads to clogged macropore networks and development of hardpan slowly permeable regions temporal nutrient dynamics fig 7 could be influenced by the changing hydraulic structure of the soils due to forest conversion to agriculture or pasture land uses however these dynamics are not always straightforward in the tropics ponette gonzález et al 2014 studies have found that nitrogen could be leached at higher rates after conversion yet the effects may be dampened due to different proportions of nitrogen input from wet fog and dry deposition weathers and ponette gonzález 2011 or the effects could be inverted due to microbial nitrification ponette gonzález et al 2014 finally studies investigating high altitude vs lower altitude forest cover show that water reaching the forest floor which would influence leaching and other processes may depend on the interception and throughfall differences caused by tree size crown cover density understorey vegetation and epiphytes coverage crockford and richardson 2000 given that these data are only available in a short time period they currently provide a baseline of conditions in the initial phases of these projects rather than a full study on the majority of the annual climatic hydrological variability in the site interestingly bonnesoeur et al 2019 indicate that forestation in the andean regions tends to increase infiltration rates by a factor of 8 within 14 20 years and allows for improved erosion control recent laboratory studies on the times scale of weeks have shown that soils leached with varying levels of cations may be behind some of these physical changes for instance mg2 leaching through soils in excess can lead to disaggregation of soil structure and reduced ks zhu et al 2019 while excess k has been shown to decrease soil hydraulic conductivity through dispersion of clays and reduced porosity and pore connectivity thereby increasing bulk density and leading to soil structural degradation marchuk and marchuk 2018 4 3 conservation implementation where should erosion processes be a concern soils in tropical andean watersheds can be quite permeable and may counteract the intensity of precipitation ruppenthal et al 1996 janeau et al 2015 leading to a disconnect between theory and evidence of runoff and erosion processes dagnew et al 2016 2017 harden 2001 showed that for plowed fields in the soils of the rio paute basin of southern andean ecuador little runoff was observed all rainfall was absorbed for the frequently observed intensities in the beginning of the season and even later when fields were more compacted there was rarely evidence for soil washed out of a cultivated field harden 2001 moreover endemic vegetation may be able to provide an additional benefit over short cycle crops of enhanced water transmission to the root zone after rainfall janeau et al 2015 preserving macrostructure and soil moisture models must take into account that roads trails and compacted lands can contribute a disproportionate amount of runoff and sediment compared to their presence in the landscape guzman et al 2017a harden 2001 frequently estimates of erosivity and erodibility in tropical climates are deduced from usle wischmeier and smith 1978 or modified versions of the usle i e rusle to map and identify where erosion could be a concern and highlight particular zones or management practices to implement guzman et al 2018 hoyos et al 2005 hoyos 2006 quintero et al 2009 ochoa cueva et al 2015 stocking 1995 however ponette gonzález et al 2015 argue that rather than relying on this assumed relationship between land cover and hydrological flux research should be targeted towards accounting for structural and ecological characteristics of the certain land covers and key mediators of the hydrologic flux of concern particularly the infiltration rate changes should be investigated and of primary concern the data presented in this study has demonstrated an expected link from compacted soils through land use change which can influence how infiltration rates can decrease potentially leading to greater surface runoff and subsequently erosion nutrient transport and decreased baseflow bean and dukes 2014 however upslope regions do not appear to be as large a concern as typically argued whether these hydraulic properties develop geomorphologically or due to the vegetative changes will need further investigation however high k s was measured in most of the higher elevation regions 26 86 cm hr 1 and much lower ks were found in areas closest to the lower regions near the access road and stream valley likely experiencing much more disturbance 1 14 cm hr 1 ruppenthal et al 1996 and sonder 2004 find that regional precipitation tends to have a much higher percentage 40 of storm events that can be considered erosive precipitation intensities 2 5 cm hr 1 than temperate regions 5 hoyos et al 2005 for the 140 storms measured by sonder 2004 62 were lower than 2 5 cm hr 1 80 lower than 5 cm hr 1 roughly 90 lower than 7 5 cm hr 1 and 94 were 10 cm hr 1 this means that the average ks for the samples in the downslope region for both depth measurements 2 3 cm hr 1 roughly exceeds storm intensities 60 of the time while midslope 2 and upslope measurements almost always exceed this intensity table 1 fig 9 the median ks 10 cm hr 1 for all measured samples coincides with the intensity that is 90 greater than all storm intensities sonder 2004 the maximum measured rainfall intensity was 47 cm hr 1 exceeded mostly by samples in the midslope 2 forested region investments in watershed services iws have targeted the enhancement of the natural for the benefit of human populations ponette gonzález et al 2015 vogl et al 2017 beyond the difficulty of identifying the most vulnerable areas in watershed or the most critical target areas to invest in some scholars argue that only tackling gaps in scientific knowledge will not solve the effectiveness issue for payment for ecosystem services de lima et al 2017 2019 uncertainties in the assumptions involved in assessing ecosystem services and in the links between land use and ecosystem services present challenges for expectations and assessment of impacts de lima et al 2017 4 4 future research needs for soil hydraulic properties and ecosystem services researchers and community partners are continuing to build databases in these sub catchments hoyos villada et al 2016 rodríguez de francisco 2013 de lima et al 2017 2019 to fill in the knowledge gaps in baseline information and the impacts of new interventions complexities that need to be address in ecosystem services research have been described by de lima et al 2017 as falling into three main dimensions a the complexity of human environment systems hes b the limits of knowledge about these systems and c practical constraints such as the high cost of measuring and monitoring system variables these complexities are described below as opportunities for response time analysis cross disciplinary collaborations and support structures for future research on soil hydraulic properties and watershed hydrological services in tropical climates 4 4 1 the complexity of human environment systems hes the complexity of the human environment system means that effects can be masked in ongoing unreported or unknown physical or social processes in addition addressing the low flow problem and the time lag between upland conservation activities and downslope sediment concentration patterns require further research in tropical forested regions bruijnzeel 2004 within a short period of time there have been some recent trends emerging in this watershed the water fund project agua por la vida y sostenibilidad water for life and sustainability measured flow and total suspended solids from november 2013 to may 2015 hoyos villada et al 2016 starting in april 2014 conservation activities were implemented in about 60 of the watershed primarily composed of fencing and enclosing areas off from agricultural or grazing use mostly in midslope 2 and upslope regions most of the peaks for these measured dynamics of flow and total suspended solids occur during march to may and between the months of november to december hoyos villada et al 2016 two indicators of flow regulation were reported as having some notable changes in the brief monitoring period of la vega the first flow indicator for high flows was set with a threshold of 5 exceedance and resulted in a value of 0 012 m3 s 1 1037 m3 d 1 before conservation activities were enacted post implementation this 5 exceedance resulted in a value of 0 067 m3 s 1 5789 m3 d 1 supplementary materials fig s1 similarly the low flow indicator flows equal to or exceeded 95 of the time had a value of 0 007 m3 s 1 605 m3 d 1 before conservation activities and 0 034 m3 s 1 2938 m3 d 1 post implementation hoyos villada et al 2016 for sediment monitoring the sediment load per day was calculated based on suspended solids measured with automatic sensors sonda solitax thresholds for sediment loads equaled or exceeded 5 of the time were found to be 20 5 t y 1 4110 kg d 1 before conservation activities and 12 9 t y 1 2651 kg d 1 post implementation supplementary materials fig s2 both flow and sediment data presented in the graphs are aggregated from 15 min data hoyos villada et al 2016 these findings have provided initial evidence for emerging patterns and will offer future opportunities to connect intervention impacts to the patterns in other parts of the andes concerning reforestation and conservation techniques bonnesoeur et al 2019 4 4 2 the limits of knowledge about these systems as these databases emerge further linkages will be needed to between hydrologists ecologists and biogeochemists to begin synthesizing and making progress towards reducing uncertainties in ecosystem service assessment and impact measurement bouwer et al 2015 hamel et al 2018 ponette gonzalez et al 2014 2015 report a summary of findings from tropical watersheds with expected changes in nutrient fluxes and also unexpected or complex changes resulting from conversion of forest cover to non forest land uses these interdisciplinary analyses of vegetation changes hydrological fluxes hydraulic impacts and nutrient fluxes will be increasingly needed to help develop more understanding and build on the important field work and theoretical formulation developed for tropical regions bruijnzeel 2004 a physically based reasoning behind how some of these presented soil physical and chemical observation may have emerged would be the ultimate goal of successive field campaigns and a sustained research program that could help indicate the mechanisms of change over time for example soil moisture dynamics weathering water table fluctuations and acidification are a mixture of hydropedological processes influenced by water fluxes which bouwer et al 2015 suggest could be used to construct hydrological response models based on accessible soil data in their study bouwer et al 2015 offer a soilscape that relates recent soil water regime flowpaths and storage mechanics as indicated by soil chemistry to ancient soil water regime as indicated by morphology and current soil water regime indicated by hydrometric field measurements hydrochemical and ecohydrological studies are still only recently uncovering dynamics that have previously been overlooked in the analysis of runoff generation infiltration and preferential deep water flow bonnesoeur et al 2019 bouwer et al 2015 hamel et al 2018 marchuk and marchuk 2018 tebebu et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 penna et al 2018 and hamel et al 2018 review a series of opportunities for interdisciplinary work in tracing ecosystem water fluxes that help initiate future agenda in research partnerships in the tropical andes 4 4 3 practical constraints high costs of measuring and monitoring system variables finally there are practical constraints which have shifted the field of hydrology from field work to modeling burt and mcdonnell 2016 vidon 2015 leading there to be issues with assumptions and validity in the analysis and compilation of field data and patterns stocking 1995 boardman 2006 while pedotransfer functions and hydrological models could help evaluate changes in landscapes without spending the associated costs needed for soil sampling current estimates may not yet be at the point where soil characteristics can be reliably interpolated or scaled across watersheds due to the variability and differing topographical soil origin and climatic impacts more base line level field studies providing empirical data such as that which have gone into developing models e g the 10 000 plot years for the universal soil loss equation and hundreds of samples for various pedotransfer functions in north america will be needed to develop this reliability in understanding in these subwatersheds in particular further tests on the soil hydraulic properties in deeper soil horizons in addition to repeating measurements after certain periods of time or regular intervals will be needed to gain a more representative understanding of the hydrological system similarly these studies will need the partnerships and sustained financial resources that have funded previous work in the u s e g usgs usda nsf in order to ensure that these studies on soil and hydrological processes develop into theoretical foundations for sediment transport and watershed landscape changes digital soil mapping for instance has been developing methods of using terrain attributes to estimate continuous maps of soil types and properties beyond simply using statistical techniques da silva et al 2016b lastly longer term evaluation and continuing cooperative agreements with stakeholders will be needed to ensure that conservation mechanisms garner local support and obtain the maintenance required to ensure that conditions do not return to pre conservation levels boardman et al 2003 de lima et al 2019 guzman et al 2017c 5 conclusion soils in tropical sub watersheds have varied soil nutrient and hydraulic properties resulting from a combination of extreme weather influences e g el niño southern oscillation and land use changes e g grazing agroforestry etc recently payments for ecosystem services pes schemes and investment in watershed services iws have been developing conservation projects that aim to quantify and enhance the natural capacity of mountainous and forested regions to provide sustainable supplies of water de lima et al 2017 these pes schemes have developed into innovative partnerships that employ water funds to encourage farmers and watershed community stakeholders to participate in conservation techniques e g enclosures near riparian zones reforestation to reduce erosion rates and improve soil infiltration in degraded areas in an effort to provide insights into some of the extant conditions in a watershed as it undergoes ecosystem service management the estimation of hydraulic properties and soil nutrient conditions were measured in this southwestern andean catchment 75 ha greater saturated hydraulic conductivity rates ks and lower bulk densities ρb are measured throughout the upper parts of the watershed lower ks and greater bulk densities are measured throughout the lower parts of the watershed forested and enclosed revegetated regions coincide with these higher hydraulic properties as well as higher soil nutrients for most of the measured parameters these findings indicate the variability within the watershed across land uses and in different slope positions revealing patterns that should be considered for hydrological modeling in tropical mountainous watersheds especially as it pertains to models that strongly assume slope gradient is the greatest determinant of runoff or erosion particularly important is that soils are highly permeable in certain forested upslope regions but there may be converted areas in lower regions of the watershed nearer to streams where rain and surface water runoff is not infiltrating as readily hydropedological feedback cycles may be present in these lower and midslope regions where anthropogenic land use patterns have decreased nutrients organic matter and ph that can further alter infiltration and runoff to produce conditions that increase erosion greater attention should be given to these biogeochemical changes especially organic matter and nutrient loss in an effort to improve ecosystem services related to landscape hydrology further field studies assessing the main differences between conserved regions of headwater catchments will be needed for reduction of uncertainties in ecosystem service evaluation and for future research and stakeholder support declaration of competing interest none

6292,understanding catchment sediment or solute transport frequently relies on understanding of soil nutrient conditions and physical properties this study investigates hydropedological patterns in a tropical catchment by understanding soil nutrient and soil surface changes soil nutrient concentrations and hydraulic properties were measured from the la vega micro watershed in the southwestern colombian andes at 16 distributed locations in four elevation ranges between 1450 and 1700 m a s l the site is a part of a conservation partnerships which implements programs and monitor impacts soil samples were analyzed for total nitrogen tn bray ii available phosphorus exchangeable cations ph organic matter and texture soil hydraulic conductivities at two depths 0 5 cm and 5 10 cm were determined in conservation implementation areas enclosures and natural regrowth in the upper elevation range regrowth of natural vegetation was found on deep soils 3 m with moderate infiltration 26 cm hr 1 the lowest bulk density 0 92 g cm 3 and the highest tn 0 4 the lowest elevation mixed land use of grazing and riparian forests with deep profiles had the lowest infiltration 4 cm hr 1 highest bulk density 1 02 g cm 3 and the lowest tn 0 26 in the middle elevation ranges conserved tropical forest vegetation were located on shallow soil depths with high organic matter 6 and high infiltration 86 cm hr 1 the lowest infiltration rate average 2 3 cm hr 1 exceeded the estimated erosive regional precipitation intensity 2 5 cm hr 1 about 60 of the time while the median infiltration rate 10 cm hr 1 exceeded rainfall intensities 94 of the time indicating that infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanisms are both present coupling data with sediment concentration and solute concentration patterns can help discern correlations between scales and will help to monitor effectiveness of conservation programs aimed at sustaining ecosystem services keywords saturated hydraulic conductivity soil nutrient gradients colombian andes 1 introduction the intertwined nature of soil and water dynamics referred to as hydropedology ma et al 2017 show how each component is important for mapping monitoring and modeling in watershed studies as conservation programs gain awareness and support among downstream users and industries interested in mitigating their impact on natural resources research on hydropedology and these intertwined ecosystem services is increasing naeem et al 2015 with attention often focused on short term soil functioning and long term soil pedogenic processes bouwer et al 2015 de lima et al 2019 hamel et al 2018 ma et al 2017 two of these main dynamics that conservation programs intend on remediating are related to the soil nutrients and hydraulic properties recharging shallow and deep aquifers buytaert et al 2004 in 2014 a large agreement was reached between an ngo the nature conservancy and latin american institutions in order to catalyze partnerships between water users and community stewards that promote conservation projects designed to help enhance watershed ecosystem services the nature conservancy 2014a b ponette gonzález et al 2015 empirical findings in these projects on the conditions of the soils main determinant of these watershed ecosystem services are limited but emerging recently and demonstrating the unique patterns in the humid tropics ponette gonzález et al 2014 wohl et al 2012 hoyos villada et al 2016 for mountainous humid tropics conservation projects must contend with the fact that soil nutrients are known to be spatially heterogeneous and dependent on local climate land use topography and parent material guzman et al 2017b tebebu et al 2017 additionally the humid tropics are regions where leaching of nitrate and accompanying plant nutrients quickly increase in a positive feedback loop after shifting from humid forest cover to cultivated land cover wong and rowell 1994 indicating that empirical findings are static snapshots in dynamic processes changing over time soil hydraulic properties similarly are not only highly dependent on soil surface characteristics but also land use previous researchers have measured strong influences of land use and topography on the infiltration patterns of tropical soils bayabil et al 2010 2019 buytaert et al 2004 hoyos et al 2005 brauman et al 2012 brauman 2015 da silva et al 2016a b tilahun et al 2016 guzman et al 2017b zimale et al 2017 generally forested land use patterns were found to have conditions of greater infiltration than what is measured on areas with altered anthropological use tebebu et al 2017 recently studies have shown the dependence of saturated hydraulic conductivity on the textural heterogeneity of soils garcía gutiérrez et al 2018 and others have noted that in mountainous regions cultivated lands are capable of much lower runoff coefficients than trails unpaved roads abandoned or fallow lands harden 2001 hanson et al 2004 the susceptibility of these land uses to degradation and subsequent hardpan and runoff are tied to the moisture availability and productivity of the soils harden 2001 hanson et al 2004 in order to maximize the ecosystem services provided by the diverse soil qualities indicators of conditions enhancing soil quality such as vegetation cover forests are being studied and promoted among several conservation organizations barrios et al 2006 bonnesoeur et al 2019 bruijnzeel 2004 de lima et al 2019 ponette gonzález et al 2014 naeem et al 2015 it is important to better understand these variations and expected impacts on hydrology as hydropedology suggests ma et al 2017 le bissonnais et al 2005 determined the variability of soil surface characteristics to be an important part of understanding where runoff and sediment concentration would increase in loess soils where hortonian flow processes horton 1933 are dominant this variability needs to be considered in climates and soil conditions where saturation excess flow beven and kirkby 1979 dunne and black 1970 dunne 1983 kirkby 1997 steenhuis et al 2013 may be more important humid tropical mountainous watersheds with volcanic clay soils and high moisture are likely regions where soil surface conditions enable various mixtures of hortonian and saturation excess flow processes to be occurring resulting in implications for watershed conservation programs the southwest colombian andes is a part of the andean mountain range and produces headwaters for several important rivers in colombia s economic and municipal sectors the rio bolo in particular receives waters from paramo high altitude tropical wetlands and high elevation watersheds that have been changing in land use and in their weather patterns a sub watershed of a nested study site within the rio bolo drainage network was chosen for work on soil surface characteristics to complement ongoing watershed ecosystem services research hoyos villada et al 2016 the objective of this study is to investigate the emergent characteristics of a sub humid tropical watershed to better understand the changes in soil surface characteristics that will have the most impact on sediment transport soil quality and changes in vadose zone hydrological processes specifically the land use and hillslope positions will be used as indicators of expected factors influence hydraulic properties saturated hydraulic conductivity ks bulk density ρb texture and chemical properties nutrients organic matter ph at the nascent stage of shifting land use we ask are reforestation initiatives likely to promote soil characteristic changes that could have significant impact on increasing recharge and decreasing sediment and solute transport some hypotheses we posit are that soil properties saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density texture in the tropics enable sufficiently high percolation high ks low ρb in most zones of the highland watersheds such that water from most storms is able to infiltrate and that soil quality indicators are greatest in re forested regions 2 methods 2 1 study site the 75 ha la vega study site is a sub watershed in the rio bolo watershed within the cauca valley in the southwestern colombian andes located at 76 11 42 687 w 3 29 55 541 n fig 1 the five year mean annual rainfall as measured at the international center

hare 2002 high intensity of precipitation can range from 1 0 cm hr 1 to over 2 5 cm hr 1 hoyos et al 2005 ruppenthal et al 1996 sonder 2004 around 40 to 49 of the rainfall intensities in this region have been previously measured to exceed 2 5 cm hr 1 ruppenthal et al 1996 in contrast to the expected 5 of rainfall intensities exceeding this threshold in temperate regions hudson 1971 soils in this region of colombia have been mapped by the geographic institute agustín codazzi igac and are categorized as dystrudepts udorthents eutrudepts hapludolls with outcroppings igac code 47fg2 due to the coarse resolution of this mapping the soil unit code 47fg2 is a combination of these soil types for the region covering la vega the study investigates 16 sites spatially distributed across land use and elevation ranges in the la vega sub watershed fig 2 these distributed sites are positioned to inform effects on erosion and hydrologic recharge eight study points are located on the western portion of the watershed and eight are located on the eastern portion two for each elevation range within the two portions four of the sampled sites are located in the downslope area elevation is 1450

were differentiated four sampling sites within each elevation range the first midslope 1 area is located at a lower elevation range closer to the watershed outlet 1500 m 5 6 7 8 the western side of this range is located in grazing land and the eastern portion is located in forage and plantain cultivation areas the second of the midslope ranges midslope 2 is higher in elevation 1600 m 9 10 11 12

sampling and analysis sixteen pvc type monitoring wells were installed with manual soil augers to determine depth of soil thickness and water levels fig 3 in the initial baseline water level measurement water tables were only present at point 15 in the upper slope and at point 2 in the downslope area most piezometers were installed to depths of 3 m there were several locations for example in the midslope forested region where the parent material was near the soil surface that were only installed to a depth of 1 m due to difficulty drilling through the rock layer three soil sampling periods were established beginning of february late february and late march of 2015 to measure primary nutrients total nitrogen tn available phosphorus ap and potassium k as well as soil surface properties such as organic matter om ph and measurement of secondary nutrients magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 at each of the sixteen sampling points a set of split core samplers were used to collect composite soil samples made up of about three combined samples to achieve 1 kg to a depth of 30 cm below the surface fig 4 total nitrogen was analyzed using the uv visible spectrometry technique and available phosphorus was analyzed by the bray ii method while exchangeable cations where estimated using the atomic absorption method organic matter estimation was analyzed by the walkley black method finally particle size analysis was performed to determine soil texture class using the bouyoucos hydrometer method bouyoucos 1962 composite disturbed soil samples were analyzed in the laboratory of analytical services in the international center for tropical agriculture ciat in colombia to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity ks laboratory measurements were conducted on six replicates of undisturbed soil samples fig 5 collected in metallic cylinders of 5 cm diameter and at two depths three replicates at 0 5 cm and three replicates at 5 10 cm while a variety of in situ field measurements are available e g double ring infiltrometer guelph permeameter and tension permeameters each has its own drawback in comparison to benchmark steady deep flow rates morbidelli et al 2017 in the absence of readily available large volumes of water for these or other controlled methods the undisturbed soil core method klute and dirksen 1986 reynolds et al 2000 was used as an initial starting benchmark for ks measurements in the catchment these undisturbed samples were analyzed in the physical soil laboratory in the international center for tropical agriculture ciat using the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 and then oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine bulk density ρb pedotransfer functions were used to compare methods of estimating ks from soil texture

non parametric tests for non normally distributed data bartlett s test was used to determine homogeneity of variances bartlett and fowler 1937 3 results 3 1 spatial and topographical differences in soil physical properties pvc monitoring wells intended to measure water table dynamics captured very little patterns due to the low frequency of visits and apparent deep or dry status of the soil profiles only at the nearest points to the stream were water tables present within the depths of the installed wells this indicates extremely well drained soils within the profile above bedrock and potentially that some of the 3 m depth wells had not reached bedrock nevertheless important information regarding soil profiles was discovered the western portion of the sub watershed had deep soil profiles 3 m deep as revealed through the augering calculated texture averages for this western portion of sampling sites found higher percentages of clay in the top 0 5 cm and 5 10 cm 25 compared to 15 for eastern portion sampling points west of the stream the eastern part of the watershed had variable soil profile depths some areas exceeded 3 m while others had a high content of stones and rocks fig 4 in both sides of the sub watershed the areas with greatest forest cover contained the darkest soils signifying high organic matter content table 1 these regions broadly in the upslope and midslope 2 zones also contained the highest sand content and the lowest clay content in contrast to the lower regions which had the inverse texture relationship table 1 in the upper elevation range regrowth of natural vegetation was found on deep soils 3 m with moderately high ks 26 cm hr 1 and the lowest bulk density 0 92 g cm 3 soil in the lowest elevation range in mixed land use of grazing and riparian forests with deep profiles had the lowest ks 4 cm hr 1 and highest bulk density 1 02 g cm 3 in the middle elevation ranges conserved tropical forest vegetation were located on soils of shallow depths with high organic matter and high ks 86 cm hr 1 when compared with regional precipitation 1005 mm yr 1 the lowest infiltration rate is exceeded about 50 of the time while the average and median infiltration rates were not exceeded the second depths of measurements 5 10 cm showed mostly lower ks than the first depth layer measurement except for at the upslope region first layer 26 cm hr 1 second layer 28 cm hr 1 the coefficient of variation for these soils cv 0 68 1 8 indicate that there is high variability across all slope positions according to the classification of wilding and drees 1983 low variability for cv 0 15 moderate variability for 0 15 cv 0 35 and high variability for cv 0 35 very high cv was similarly found for oxisols in são paulo state brazil for laboratory experiments investigating solute transport and ks spatial variability godoy et al 2019 though most of the saturated hydraulic conductivity tests tended to be highest in the upslope forested areas upslope and midslope 2 within one site of the midslope 1 region in plantain cultivation landcover there was an instance where the measured ks for the first 5 cm was very high 79 cm hr 1 high ks results were similar in areas with high rock content due to the lower bulk density resulting from the larger void spaces caused by the presence of the rocks these void spaces in the profile provide quick flow paths for water to infiltrate high biological activity was observed in various parts of the watershed represented by the macro soil fauna earthworms beetles larvae among other observations in addition to soil profiles with distinctly darker surface soil layers black in comparison to deeper soil layers 3 2 spatio temporal nutrient variation soil nutrient properties are varied throughout the watershed with each interacting with the differing fluxes from slope positions and land use table 2 the upper elevation zones had the highest tn 0 4 and organic matter om 6 9 with soil organic carbon soc approximately 3 5 4 pribyl 2010 soils in the lowest elevation zone had the lowest tn 0 26 om 4 8 and soc 2 4 2 8 forested areas have greater levels of tn ap ca2 and k forested regions e g

regions as well i e revegetated and natural forested areas were upslope and at midslope 2 regions while actively used lands were at midslope 1 and lower slope regions calcium concentrations are the greatest statistically significant p 0 01 in the midslope 2 position where the greatest proportion of native forest vegetation is found soils tend to be modestly shifting over time and only depleting in certain locations for certain nutrients such as tn and k for example for tn trends for midslope and downslope regions shift slightly lower from the beginning of february till the end of march however this is only statistically significant for k and tn in the midslope 1 zone p 0 05 and near significant for tn p 0 053 in the downslope zone the trend of change overall for the remaining nutrients ap ca2 and mg2 is less sharp for the upslope regions than for midslope and downslope but overall the pattern seems to be decreasing though high variability means that these are not statistically significant fig 7 ap trends decrease in midslope 1 p 0 53 and downslope regions p 0 12 while they increase upslope p 0 19 ca2 and mg2 decrease most notably in the downslope regions p 0 26 and p 0 55 respectively 4 discussion hydropedology considers the feedbacks between water and soil dynamics as can be seen through these results and in other studies topography and land use show controls on the development of soil infiltration bulk density and nutrient conditions bean and dukes 2015 price et al 2010 siltecho et al 2015 zimmermann et al 2006 the soil characteristics that developed in this watershed denote two soil hydraulic and nutrient dynamics conservation implications and some future needs 4 1 soils are compacted and less permeable in non forested conditions soil compaction as measured through bulk density shows an influence of land use and an additional control being induced by topography differences in soil texture class due to elevation has been observed previously in tropical agricultural watersheds taye et al 2018 and elsewhere papanicolaou et al 2015 riebe et al 2015 still whether these texture difference have occurred as a result of land use change and management or whether this relates to geological and climatic differences may require further investigation field studies indicate that the production of fine sediments may be enhanced at lower elevations and inhibited at higher elevations for an alpine catchment in the high sierra california however these elevation differences are on the scale of kilometers rather than hundreds of meters riebe et al 2015 studies investigating contrasting textures along a topographic sequence of thailand rice fields have pointed to the translocation of clays down the soil profile as the primary mechanism for differences boivin et al 2004 in comparison to studies at nearby ciat research stations the proportion of clay between 14 and 26 was much lower than that found in bare fallow fields of quilichao 75 and mondomo 64 experimental fields ruppenthal et al 1996 however as mapped by the igac igac code 47fg2 for the coarse areal average this study found similar results with slightly higher silt and clay fractions than reported for the average of the combination of soils found in this code dystrudepts udorthents eutrudepts hapludolls 65 sand 20 silt 15 clay while slightly different proportions of sand silt and clay are found for the different regions organic matter om appears to be higher at the higher elevation ranges in this study upslope and midslope 2 in addition to its relationship to decreased bulk density higher om could lead to soil storage recovery through nutrients provided and establishment of vegetation both are effects that can potentially reduce runoff through increased capture and storage of water bean and dukes 2014 saturated hydraulic conductivity ks measurements here are determined through laboratory analysis but do not correspond to other measurements that may be determined in the field that are capable of capturing larger characteristics such as macropores greater depths or other soil heterogeneities bean and dukes 2015 morbidelli et al 2017 reynolds et al 2000 the guelph permeameter for example is one approach that might provide a more holistic measurement of the subsoil infiltration dynamics however after several attempts logistical challenges made repeated measurements difficult furthermore tests have sometimes demonstrated that the guelph permeameter can overestimate laboratory controlled experimental soil infiltration rates and underestimate those in natural soil at study plots morbidelli et al 2017 as it measures the conductivity of the matrix and may have a lower probability of measuring macropore flow mohanty et al 1994 while some modifications to the guelph permeameter are available to make it more representative of different porous media types reynolds and lewis 2012 other methods more suited to forested and mountainous conditions may be needed such as single or double ring infiltrometers or soil monolith sampling in cylindrical containers ilek and kucza 2014 ilek et al 2019 hence the data presented here provide a starting point for estimation of infiltration dynamics that could be assumed to be underestimating hydrological subsurface processes at several of the locations brooks et al 2004 noted that in field experiments and modeling exercises point estimates of vertical and lateral hydraulic conductivity can be 10 to 100 times smaller than actual hillslope scale k s due in part to macropores and biological activity lateral flow is also shown to be important as it erodes soil structure internally and thereby increases the conductivity mendoza and steenhuis 2002 in comparison to pedotransfer functions cosby et al 1984 puckett et al 1985 jabro 1992 saxton and rawls 2006 the data in fact were largely underestimated indicating that transfer functions may even be assuming lower conductivities than laboratory measurements capture for their estimate of natural conditions in tropical watersheds of the andes fig 8 the pedotransfer function developed by jabro 1992 was the only empirical formula that actually overestimated the ks by a factor of between 25 and 40 this equation eq 3 was derived from 350 silt loam soil samples originating in southeastern pennsylvania with high bulk density and a well drained nature and high silt fraction the lower bulk densities and silt fractions measured in these andean soils result in estimated values that are much higher than observed values mainly due to the assumptions formulated by the contextually scaled empirical inverse relationship between silt fraction or bulk density and ks the remaining pedotransfer functions also rely on us based soil properties to define the relationships between soil texture bulk density and ks but underestimate the value saxton and rawls 2006 use 2000 samples from the usda nrcs soil survey puckett et al 1985 used samples from the lower coastal plain of alabama and cosby et al 1984 use data from samples obtained over 35 localities in 23 states of the us cosby et al 1984 note that their database did not originally include particle size distribution but rather had percentage sand silt and clay assigned through mid point of soil texture class each of these particular features of the original derived equations show the region specific nature of the equations ramírez et al 2017 also found that for their study in the orinoco river basin colombia the rosetta pedotransfer function schaap et al 2001 likely underestimated ks by a factor of 10 as had similarly been the case in studies for ecuador costa rica and jamaica hafkenscheid 2000 huwe et al 2008 tobón et al 2011 these volcanic soils tend to have much greater conductivity than other soils in similar texture classes upon which pedotransfer functions were developed moreover the value obtained from the reference information for these regional soils mapped by the geographic institute agustín codazzi igac code 47fg2 was also much lower 3 3 cm hr 1 another important finding is the demonstration of vertical non uniformity in saturated hydraulic conductivity though previously understood that upper layers of soil may be more permeable than soils beneath the surface and that a decreasing trend with depth may be observed brooks et al 2004 morbidelli et al 2018 this has not been as widely researched in these mountainous soils some researchers have found hard pan layers in soils ranging from 0 15 m to 0 6 m from the surface of the soil in degraded mountainous regions tebebu et al 2017 more findings describing these variable depth profiles will help to integrate the tropical dynamics into modeling practices describing runoff from tropical hilly watersheds 4 2 nutrients are lower in non forested conditions the concentration of total nitrogen available phosphorus and exchangeable cations demonstrate low availability in non forested compacted areas in the lower portions of the watershed downslope these areas experience more disruption and have processes that could lead to depletion of the nutrients as has been found in other mountainous regions guzman et al 2017b tebebu et al 2017 furthermore found that the depletion of nutrients and organic matter is indicative of degradation processes that increase the disaggregation of soils and later leads to clogged macropore networks and development of hardpan slowly permeable regions temporal nutrient dynamics fig 7 could be influenced by the changing hydraulic structure of the soils due to forest conversion to agriculture or pasture land uses however these dynamics are not always straightforward in the tropics ponette gonzález et al 2014 studies have found that nitrogen could be leached at higher rates after conversion yet the effects may be dampened due to different proportions of nitrogen input from wet fog and dry deposition weathers and ponette gonzález 2011 or the effects could be inverted due to microbial nitrification ponette gonzález et al 2014 finally studies investigating high altitude vs lower altitude forest cover show that water reaching the forest floor which would influence leaching and other processes may depend on the interception and throughfall differences caused by tree size crown cover density understorey vegetation and epiphytes coverage crockford and richardson 2000 given that these data are only available in a short time period they currently provide a baseline of conditions in the initial phases of these projects rather than a full study on the majority of the annual climatic hydrological variability in the site interestingly bonnesoeur et al 2019 indicate that forestation in the andean regions tends to increase infiltration rates by a factor of 8 within 14 20 years and allows for improved erosion control recent laboratory studies on the times scale of weeks have shown that soils leached with varying levels of cations may be behind some of these physical changes for instance mg2 leaching through soils in excess can lead to disaggregation of soil structure and reduced ks zhu et al 2019 while excess k has been shown to decrease soil hydraulic conductivity through dispersion of clays and reduced porosity and pore connectivity thereby increasing bulk density and leading to soil structural degradation marchuk and marchuk 2018 4 3 conservation implementation where should erosion processes be a concern soils in tropical andean watersheds can be quite permeable and may counteract the intensity of precipitation ruppenthal et al 1996 janeau et al 2015 leading to a disconnect between theory and evidence of runoff and erosion processes dagnew et al 2016 2017 harden 2001 showed that for plowed fields in the soils of the rio paute basin of southern andean ecuador little runoff was observed all rainfall was absorbed for the frequently observed intensities in the beginning of the season and even later when fields were more compacted there was rarely evidence for soil washed out of a cultivated field harden 2001 moreover endemic vegetation may be able to provide an additional benefit over short cycle crops of enhanced water transmission to the root zone after rainfall janeau et al 2015 preserving macrostructure and soil moisture models must take into account that roads trails and compacted lands can contribute a disproportionate amount of runoff and sediment compared to their presence in the landscape guzman et al 2017a harden 2001 frequently estimates of erosivity and erodibility in tropical climates are deduced from usle wischmeier and smith 1978 or modified versions of the usle i e rusle to map and identify where erosion could be a concern and highlight particular zones or management practices to implement guzman et al 2018 hoyos et al 2005 hoyos 2006 quintero et al 2009 ochoa cueva et al 2015 stocking 1995 however ponette gonzález et al 2015 argue that rather than relying on this assumed relationship between land cover and hydrological flux research should be targeted towards accounting for structural and ecological characteristics of the certain land covers and key mediators of the hydrologic flux of concern particularly the infiltration rate changes should be investigated and of primary concern the data presented in this study has demonstrated an expected link from compacted soils through land use change which can influence how infiltration rates can decrease potentially leading to greater surface runoff and subsequently erosion nutrient transport and decreased baseflow bean and dukes 2014 however upslope regions do not appear to be as large a concern as typically argued whether these hydraulic properties develop geomorphologically or due to the vegetative changes will need further investigation however high k s was measured in most of the higher elevation regions 26 86 cm hr 1 and much lower ks were found in areas closest to the lower regions near the access road and stream valley likely experiencing much more disturbance 1 14 cm hr 1 ruppenthal et al 1996 and sonder 2004 find that regional precipitation tends to have a much higher percentage 40 of storm events that can be considered erosive precipitation intensities 2 5 cm hr 1 than temperate regions 5 hoyos et al 2005 for the 140 storms measured by sonder 2004 62 were lower than 2 5 cm hr 1 80 lower than 5 cm hr 1 roughly 90 lower than 7 5 cm hr 1 and 94 were 10 cm hr 1 this means that the average ks for the samples in the downslope region for both depth measurements 2 3 cm hr 1 roughly exceeds storm intensities 60 of the time while midslope 2 and upslope measurements almost always exceed this intensity table 1 fig 9 the median ks 10 cm hr 1 for all measured samples coincides with the intensity that is 90 greater than all storm intensities sonder 2004 the maximum measured rainfall intensity was 47 cm hr 1 exceeded mostly by samples in the midslope 2 forested region investments in watershed services iws have targeted the enhancement of the natural for the benefit of human populations ponette gonzález et al 2015 vogl et al 2017 beyond the difficulty of identifying the most vulnerable areas in watershed or the most critical target areas to invest in some scholars argue that only tackling gaps in scientific knowledge will not solve the effectiveness issue for payment for ecosystem services de lima et al 2017 2019 uncertainties in the assumptions involved in assessing ecosystem services and in the links between land use and ecosystem services present challenges for expectations and assessment of impacts de lima et al 2017 4 4 future research needs for soil hydraulic properties and ecosystem services researchers and community partners are continuing to build databases in these sub catchments hoyos villada et al 2016 rodríguez de francisco 2013 de lima et al 2017 2019 to fill in the knowledge gaps in baseline information and the impacts of new interventions complexities that need to be address in ecosystem services research have been described by de lima et al 2017 as falling into three main dimensions a the complexity of human environment systems hes b the limits of knowledge about these systems and c practical constraints such as the high cost of measuring and monitoring system variables these complexities are described below as opportunities for response time analysis cross disciplinary collaborations and support structures for future research on soil hydraulic properties and watershed hydrological services in tropical climates 4 4 1 the complexity of human environment systems hes the complexity of the human environment system means that effects can be masked in ongoing unreported or unknown physical or social processes in addition addressing the low flow problem and the time lag between upland conservation activities and downslope sediment concentration patterns require further research in tropical forested regions bruijnzeel 2004 within a short period of time there have been some recent trends emerging in this watershed the water fund project agua por la vida y sostenibilidad water for life and sustainability measured flow and total suspended solids from november 2013 to may 2015 hoyos villada et al 2016 starting in april 2014 conservation activities were implemented in about 60 of the watershed primarily composed of fencing and enclosing areas off from agricultural or grazing use mostly in midslope 2 and upslope regions most of the peaks for these measured dynamics of flow and total suspended solids occur during march to may and between the months of november to december hoyos villada et al 2016 two indicators of flow regulation were reported as having some notable changes in the brief monitoring period of la vega the first flow indicator for high flows was set with a threshold of 5 exceedance and resulted in a value of 0 012 m3 s 1 1037 m3 d 1 before conservation activities were enacted post implementation this 5 exceedance resulted in a value of 0 067 m3 s 1 5789 m3 d 1 supplementary materials fig s1 similarly the low flow indicator flows equal to or exceeded 95 of the time had a value of 0 007 m3 s 1 605 m3 d 1 before conservation activities and 0 034 m3 s 1 2938 m3 d 1 post implementation hoyos villada et al 2016 for sediment monitoring the sediment load per day was calculated based on suspended solids measured with automatic sensors sonda solitax thresholds for sediment loads equaled or exceeded 5 of the time were found to be 20 5 t y 1 4110 kg d 1 before conservation activities and 12 9 t y 1 2651 kg d 1 post implementation supplementary materials fig s2 both flow and sediment data presented in the graphs are aggregated from 15 min data hoyos villada et al 2016 these findings have provided initial evidence for emerging patterns and will offer future opportunities to connect intervention impacts to the patterns in other parts of the andes concerning reforestation and conservation techniques bonnesoeur et al 2019 4 4 2 the limits of knowledge about these systems as these databases emerge further linkages will be needed to between hydrologists ecologists and biogeochemists to begin synthesizing and making progress towards reducing uncertainties in ecosystem service assessment and impact measurement bouwer et al 2015 hamel et al 2018 ponette gonzalez et al 2014 2015 report a summary of findings from tropical watersheds with expected changes in nutrient fluxes and also unexpected or complex changes resulting from conversion of forest cover to non forest land uses these interdisciplinary analyses of vegetation changes hydrological fluxes hydraulic impacts and nutrient fluxes will be increasingly needed to help develop more understanding and build on the important field work and theoretical formulation developed for tropical regions bruijnzeel 2004 a physically based reasoning behind how some of these presented soil physical and chemical observation may have emerged would be the ultimate goal of successive field campaigns and a sustained research program that could help indicate the mechanisms of change over time for example soil moisture dynamics weathering water table fluctuations and acidification are a mixture of hydropedological processes influenced by water fluxes which bouwer et al 2015 suggest could be used to construct hydrological response models based on accessible soil data in their study bouwer et al 2015 offer a soilscape that relates recent soil water regime flowpaths and storage mechanics as indicated by soil chemistry to ancient soil water regime as indicated by morphology and current soil water regime indicated by hydrometric field measurements hydrochemical and ecohydrological studies are still only recently uncovering dynamics that have previously been overlooked in the analysis of runoff generation infiltration and preferential deep water flow bonnesoeur et al 2019 bouwer et al 2015 hamel et al 2018 marchuk and marchuk 2018 tebebu et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 penna et al 2018 and hamel et al 2018 review a series of opportunities for interdisciplinary work in tracing ecosystem water fluxes that help initiate future agenda in research partnerships in the tropical andes 4 4 3 practical constraints high costs of measuring and monitoring system variables finally there are practical constraints which have shifted the field of hydrology from field work to modeling burt and mcdonnell 2016 vidon 2015 leading there to be issues with assumptions and validity in the analysis and compilation of field data and patterns stocking 1995 boardman 2006 while pedotransfer functions and hydrological models could help evaluate changes in landscapes without spending the associated costs needed for soil sampling current estimates may not yet be at the point where soil characteristics can be reliably interpolated or scaled across watersheds due to the variability and differing topographical soil origin and climatic impacts more base line level field studies providing empirical data such as that which have gone into developing models e g the 10 000 plot years for the universal soil loss equation and hundreds of samples for various pedotransfer functions in north america will be needed to develop this reliability in understanding in these subwatersheds in particular further tests on the soil hydraulic properties in deeper soil horizons in addition to repeating measurements after certain periods of time or regular intervals will be needed to gain a more representative understanding of the hydrological system similarly these studies will need the partnerships and sustained financial resources that have funded previous work in the u s e g usgs usda nsf in order to ensure that these studies on soil and hydrological processes develop into theoretical foundations for sediment transport and watershed landscape changes digital soil mapping for instance has been developing methods of using terrain attributes to estimate continuous maps of soil types and properties beyond simply using statistical techniques da silva et al 2016b lastly longer term evaluation and continuing cooperative agreements with stakeholders will be needed to ensure that conservation mechanisms garner local support and obtain the maintenance required to ensure that conditions do not return to pre conservation levels boardman et al 2003 de lima et al 2019 guzman et al 2017c 5 conclusion soils in tropical sub watersheds have varied soil nutrient and hydraulic properties resulting from a combination of extreme weather influences e g el niño southern oscillation and land use changes e g grazing agroforestry etc recently payments for ecosystem services pes schemes and investment in watershed services iws have been developing conservation projects that aim to quantify and enhance the natural capacity of mountainous and forested regions to provide sustainable supplies of water de lima et al 2017 these pes schemes have developed into innovative partnerships that employ water funds to encourage farmers and watershed community stakeholders to participate in conservation techniques e g enclosures near riparian zones reforestation to reduce erosion rates and improve soil infiltration in degraded areas in an effort to provide insights into some of the extant conditions in a watershed as it undergoes ecosystem service management the estimation of hydraulic properties and soil nutrient conditions were measured in this southwestern andean catchment 75 ha greater saturated hydraulic conductivity rates ks and lower bulk densities ρb are measured throughout the upper parts of the watershed lower ks and greater bulk densities are measured throughout the lower parts of the watershed forested and enclosed revegetated regions coincide with these higher hydraulic properties as well as higher soil nutrients for most of the measured parameters these findings indicate the variability within the watershed across land uses and in different slope positions revealing patterns that should be considered for hydrological modeling in tropical mountainous watersheds especially as it pertains to models that strongly assume slope gradient is the greatest determinant of runoff or erosion particularly important is that soils are highly permeable in certain forested upslope regions but there may be converted areas in lower regions of the watershed nearer to streams where rain and surface water runoff is not infiltrating as readily hydropedological feedback cycles may be present in these lower and midslope regions where anthropogenic land use patterns have decreased nutrients organic matter and ph that can further alter infiltration and runoff to produce conditions that increase erosion greater attention should be given to these biogeochemical changes especially organic matter and nutrient loss in an effort to improve ecosystem services related to landscape hydrology further field studies assessing the main differences between conserved

6293,water planner and managers always work in a changing and uncertain environment since the majority of water resource related data is imprecise or uncertain to some extent mcdm multi criteria decision making is a well suited decision support tool for water resources management however multiple uncertainties existed in criteria weights cws and performance values pvs hinder the application of mcdm methods in real world problems this paper proposes an application oriented stochastic mcdm framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty a weight aggregation approach based on the game theory coupled with feasible weight space fws is developed for conflict resolution and uncertainty estimation we propose a novel smaa gra model by combining the stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa theory and grey relational analysis gra the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree are utilized to assess decision making uncertainty we perform significance analysis to examine the impacts of input parameter uncertainties on the final assessment of alternatives the proposed framework is demonstrated via two water resources management case studies numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the robustness and computational efficiency of the framework as well as the effects of uncertainty level and probability distribution type on decision making results the results indicate that the framework enables water managers to examine the robustness of final decisions and allows a risk informed water resource decision to be made with higher reliabilities keywords water resources management stochastic multi criteria decision making multiple uncertainties risk analysis probabilistic ranking 1 introduction water resources management usually involves social environmental economic even political influences as well as hydraulic and hydrologic analysis lund 2015 these interdependent impacts among spatial and temporal relations especially the uncertainty concerning the availability of water resources make the problem rather complex and uncertain cai et al 2018 water resource decisions are generally guided by a large number of alternatives and criteria measured in incommensurable units in addition the decisions can often be characterized by complex interactions uncertain outcomes and conflicting interests of multiple participating stakeholders therefore water resources management requires the application of decision support tools which can take into account stakeholders views trade offs objectives candidate alternatives and numerous criteria multi criteria decision making mcdm is an umbrella term for a body of methods that can be applied to support management in problems involving multiple alternatives and criteria through a structured framework the advantages of mcdm include facilitating resolution of conflict participation of multiple stakeholders group negotiation and collaborative decision making which make mcdm a well suited decision support tool for water resources management since the late 1980s mcdm techniques have attracted much attention not only from water resources researchers but also water managers outside the scientific community cai et al 2004 malekmohammadi et al 2011 wan et al 2014 until now mcdm still has widespread and growing application in the management of water resources inamdar et al 2018 ren et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 wan et al 2014 proposed an mcdm method based on variable sets and fuzzy rating interval to assess water allocation alternatives of jining city china more recently inamdar et al 2018 developed a comprehensive methodology framework for selection of suitable stormwater harvesting sites in urban areas using multi criteria decision analysis ren et al 2018 proposed a triangular multi attribute preference model based on fuzzy logic for facilitating the selection of groundwater remediation strategies traditionally mcdm methods applied in water resources planning and management are limited to deterministic or fuzzy environments where associated uncertainties are more or less ignored in reality water planner and managers always work in a changing and uncertain environment fu et al 2017 hutton et al 2014 tian et al 2017 for example water supplies are uncertain if not in the short term at least in the long term water demands and multiple purposes water serve may change over time which are very difficult to be accurately predicted moreover the hydrologic environmental economic social and ecological data which water resource decisions depend are inherently uncertain singh 2016 all of these uncertainty factors will finally lead to the uncertainty of criteria performance values pvs which are obtained by solving water resources optimization or simulation models in addition criteria weights cws have also been identified as a possible source of considerable uncertainty in the mcdm process which mainly result from the following three aspects first water resources management involves conflicts between multiple stakeholders with different backgrounds views responsibilities interests and frequently competing objectives conflict at a local level may occur when two users extract underground water from the same aquifer or at an international level when the same water resource is competed for by two countries while past water resources conflicts have occurred present day conflicts have become much more severe as a result of growing demands from more diverse users on water resource systems second the subjectivity and fuzziness of human judgments in the weighting process may result in imprecise or uncertain cws third the aggregating or averaging of cws from multiple managers is a source of additional uncertainty and results in a considerable loss of information under this strategy a concealment of the true uncertainty of cws will occur in fact uncertainties exist simultaneously in criteria pvs and cws throughout the mcdm modeling process information on uncertainty does not make decision making easier but ignoring it is ignoring reality incorporating input parameter uncertainties i e criteria pvs and cws used in an mcdm model can help quantify the resulting uncertainty in model outputs and allow a risk informed water resource decision to be made with higher reliabilities therefore it is important to trace the source of uncertainties in the mcdm modeling process and assess the risk associated with water resource decisions to the best of our knowledge existing mcdm methods for water resources management are not convincing enough due to the following shortcomings over the past decades mcdm methods themselves have been overemphasized with substantial attention being given to developing or improving different kinds of mcdm methods although a large number of mcdm methods are available to guide water resource decisions few of them can handle uncertainties the criteria pvs and cws have the most significant influence on decision making results since they determine the information inputs to an mcdm model however uncertainty analysis of criteria pvs and cws remains an issue and was rarely considered in mcdm for water resources management the uncertain input parameters will ultimately lead to uncertainties in the mcdm outcomes such as the reversal of fixed ranks and decision making risks in general this issue has been ignored or poorly evaluated in the reported application of mcdm to water resources management an important step to verify the stability of mcdm results and identifying the most critical input parameters is performing sensitivity analysis however most of existing mcdm methods do not adopt any kind of sensitivity analysis thereby neglecting the influence of variations in input parameters on model outputs based on the above analysis although much research has been conducted over the past decades the subject of stochastic mcdm for water resources management under uncertainty remains incompletely addressed in a unified framework in this study we propose an application oriented stochastic mcdm framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty the proposed framework helps to incorporate expected uncertainties into the mcdm modeling process and enable water managers to examine the robustness of water recourse decisions first the definitions of problems associated with mcdm and methods for handling criteria pv uncertainties are introduced a weight aggregation method based on the game theory is proposed for conflict resolution then the feasible weight space fws is utilized to quantify the uncertainty of cws by expanding the aggregated weight vector from a single point to a subspace in the whole weight space in addition by combining the stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa theory and grey relational analysis gra we develop a novel smaa gra model which enables uncertainties in input parameters to be considered simultaneously two statistical indicators i e the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree are adopted to assess the decision making uncertainty we then perform significance analysis to examine the impacts of input parameter uncertainties on the final assessment of alternatives finally the proposed framework is illustrated via two water resources management case studies numerical experiments are also conducted to investigate the robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed framework as well as the effects of uncertainty level and probability distribution type on decision making results 2 methodology a flowchart of the stochastic mcdm framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty is shown in fig 1 each step is presented in detail in the following subsections 2 1 definition of mcdm problems in general the composition of an mcdm problem can be defined as 1 a set of criteria measured in incommensurable units 2 a set of alternatives to be evaluated ranked and selected and 3 a decision model for combining criteria measurements with decision makers preferences mcdm methods mainly differ in terms of different decision models adopted such as the outranking relations utility functions pairwise comparisons or reference based models from this point we assume an mcdm problem to consist of a set of m alternatives a a 1 a 2 a m the evaluation of which is performed in terms of n criteria c c 1 c 2 c n the weight vector is represented as w w 1 w 2 w n let xij be the criteria pvs with i and j representing the alternative ai and the criterion cj respectively the decision matrix is expressed as x x ij m n consequently an mcdm model can be formulated as follows 1 t i f x w where f denotes the function of the adopted decision model ti is the total value through which the overall performance of alternative ai is measured regarding all criteria candidate alternative ranking can be determined according to the total value normally the most preferred alternative is the one with the largest ti 2 2 define uncertainty in the criteria pvs due to the inherently uncertain characteristics of water supplies and water demands as well as the variability of hydrologic environmental economic social and ecological data the criteria pvs are inevitably uncertain criteria pv uncertainty can be represented using continuous probability distributions such as uniform normal exponential gumbel and etc plenty of methods are available to do this such as optimal hedging rules wan et al 2016 xu et al 2017 yan et al 2018 risk analysis techniques chen et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 liu et al 2015 and so on in a stochastic mcdm problem the deterministic decision matrix x should be replaced by a stochastic decision matrix ξ where each element can be a random variable following certain probability distribution a constant or a mixture of both 2 ξ ξ ij m n ξ 11 ξ 12 ξ 1 n ξ 21 ξ 22 ξ 2 n ξ m 1 ξ m 2 ξ mn 2 3 weight aggregation and uncertainty quantification based on the game theory allied with feasible weight space water resources management is usually a group decision making problem which involves groups or institutions with conflicting objectives and interests and it requires collaboration for conflict resolution in the mcdm process the preferences of different groups are typically different or even conflicting reaching consensus over the preferences poses a challenge which leads to uncertainties and complexities of decision making in this section we propose a method based on the game theory coupled with the feasible weight space to aggregate conflicting weight vectors and quantify the uncertainty of cws 2 3 1 weight aggregation using the game theory as a new branch of mathematics as well as an important field within operational research game theory mainly focuses on mathematical representations of the strategic interactions between rational decision makers this study introduces the game theory into stochastic mcdm problems the basic idea is to reach the consistency or compromise among conflicting cws based on the nash equilibrium define weights obtained from multiple decision makers as the basic weight vectors denoted by w k w 1 k w 2 k w n k k 1 2 l where l denotes the total number of decision makers involved in the mcdm process the basic weight vector can be easily determined using one of a variety of existing weighting method such as ahp delphi method and etc the arbitrary linear combination of the basic weight vectors can be expressed as 3 w b k 1 l α k w k t α k 0 k 1 l α k 1 where αk is the combination coefficient according to the game theory we optimize the combination coefficient to determine the coordinated weight vector denoted by w the objective is minimizing the deviation between w and each wk 4 min i 1 l α i w i t w k 2 k 1 2 l the global solver available in lingo 17 0 is utilized to solve the above optimization model the optimal combination coefficient is expressed as α 1 α 2 αl finally we can determine the coordinated weight vector as follows 5 w k 1 l α k w k t 2 3 2 feasible weight space as stated above the conflicting weight vectors are aggregated as a coordinated weight vector in order to resolve conflicts among multiple decision makers this section proposes the use of feasible weight space fws to further quantify the uncertainty of cws by expanding the coordinated weight vector from a single point to a subspace in the whole weight space fig 2 illustrates the fws in a case involving three criteria when weight information remains unknown the whole weight space can be described as a triangular plane formulated by w 1 w 2 w 3 1 0 w 1 w 2 w 3 1 as fig 2 shows fws is defined as a subspace on this plane with the coordinated weight vector being the center fws is formulated as follows 6 fws w r n w j 0 w j 1 λ w j w j 1 λ j 1 n w j 1 where λ is utilized to reflect the uncertainty level of cws which is related to the conflict degree among multiple stakeholders if decision makers are satisfied about the coordinated weight vector a small value should be assigned to λ alternatively a large λ should be utilized to generate a fws covering wider area of the weight space fws is more reasonable than using a deterministic weight vector since it can incorporate as much preferences as possible in the mcdm modeling process and avoid information loss furthermore the weight uncertainty can be easily quantified via probability distributions with interval constraints within the fws boundaries 2 4 the smaa gra model in this section we propose a novel smaa gra model by combining the stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa theory and grey relational analysis gra the decision making uncertainty is estimated using two statistical indicators including the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree 2 4 1 deterministic grey relational analysis grey relational analysis gra is an important component of grey system theory deng 1989 which has been applied in various field of engineering and management with discrete data and fuzzy information gra uses a specific definition of information situations with no information are defined as black whereas those with perfect information are defined as white however in real life problems neither of these ideal situations ever occurs in actual fact the word grey is utilized to describe situations between these two extremes in this study we use gra to solve mcdm problems by aggregating the entire range of criteria measurements and preference information into a quantified value of grey relational degree the following steps are involved step 1 define the reference set x x j n 7 x j max 1 i m x ij for benefit criteria min 1 i m x ij for cost criteria step 2 normalize the decision matrix x to z z ij m n the reference set x is also normalized as z z j n step 3 calculate the grey relational coefficient between each alternative and the normalized reference set 8 r z i z min i min j z ij z j ϕ max i max j z ij z j z ij z j ϕ max i max j z ij z j where z i is the normalized pv vector of alternative ai ϕ is the recognition coefficient ranging from 0 to 1 ϕ equals 0 5 in this study step 4 define the grey relational degree of alternative ai as the weighted sum of grey relational coefficients 9 ϑ i j 1 n w j r z i z where ϑ i provides a global evaluation for ai with respect to all criteria and form the basis for the final decision i e the most preferred alternative is the one with the largest grey relational degree 2 4 2 stochastic version of gra smaa gra stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa is a set of related methods for assisting multi criteria group decision making with imprecise uncertain or missing information durbach et al 2014 lahdelma and salminen 2001 lahdelma and salminen 2006 the foundation of the smaa framework is simulating diverse value combinations for uncertain parameters and calculating statistics describing how alternatives are evaluated for example to determine the probability that a specific alternative obtains a certain rank the advantage of smaa lies in that it can flexibly handle the uncertain imprecise or missing information with suitable probability distributions this study proposes a novel smaa gra model by integrating the gra algorithm with the smaa framework smaa gra is an extension of deterministic gra to deal with uncertainties i e a stochastic type of gra additionally the integrated model can be also regarded as a novel variant of smaa with a gra type utility function the mathematical formulation of smaa gra is described as follows the original smaa framework adopts a real valued additive utility function u to evaluate how good an alternative is by a real number ranging from 0 to 1 10 u i u x i w j 1 n x ij w j where x i is the criteria pv vector of alternative ai in smaa gra the additive utility function u is replaced with the gra algorithm as follows 11 u i ϑ x i w where the function ϑ calculates the grey relational degree of each alternative based on the criteria pv vector and weight vector as mentioned previously the uncertain criteria pvs are represented by the stochastic decision matrix ξ consisting of random variables ξ ij with estimated joint probability distribution function f x ξ in the space ξ r m n the uncertainties in the cws are quantified via the weight aggregation method coupled with fws which are further represented by weight distributions with joint probability distribution function f w w within the fws boundaries we define the following ranking function to calculate the rank of each alternative from the best rank 1 to the worst rank m 12 rank ξ i w 1 k 1 m ρ ϑ ξ k w ϑ ξ i w where ξ i is the stochastic criteria pv vector of alternative ai ρ t r u e 1 and ρ f a l s e 0 ϑ is the gra type utility function the smaa gra is based on the analysis of the sets of favourable rank weights w i r ξ and any weight vector w w i r ξ grants alternative ai rank r w i r ξ is defined as follows 13 w i r ξ w fws rank ξ i w r the main outputs of the smaa gra model consist of five summary metrics that form the basis to reach a final decision including 1 the rank acceptability index rai 2 holistic acceptability index hai 3 central weight vector cwv 4 confidence factor and 5 cross confidence factor the rai b i r is the expected volume of the set of favourable rank weights for each alternative which measures the variety of different valuations resulting in rank r for alternative ai b i r is calculated as a multi dimensional integral over the criteria pv distributions f x ξ and w i r ξ as 14 b i r x f x ξ w i r ξ f w w d w d ξ obviously the rai is in the range 0 1 where 0 indicates that an alternative is impossible to get a given rank and 1 indicates that it always gets the given rank with any combination of cws alternatives with large rais for the best ranks can be considered as the most acceptable solutions while those with large rais for the worst ranks should be eliminated from the alternative set the hai a i h is utilized to examine the overall acceptability of each alternative and is defined as the weighted sum of all rais 15 a i h r 1 m α r b i r where α r represent meta weights which reflect the contribution of each rai to the evaluation of an alternative in this study we define α r as a monotonically decreasing vector α r i r m 1 i i 1 m 1 i to model that the best ranks are preferred over the worst ranks the cwv w i c is the expected gravity center of the favourable first rank weight space of alternative ai the cwv denotes the preference information supporting corresponding alternatives which enables decision makers to comprehend how different weights are associated with different decisions and assists in the cw assignment w i c is calculated as a multi dimensional integral over the criteria pv distributions f x ξ and the favourable first rank weights w i 1 ξ 16 w i c x f x ξ w i 1 ξ f w w w d w d ξ b i 1 the confidence factor p i c is the probability of an alternative being the most preferred based on its own cwv p i c is a measure of whether the criteria data are sufficiently accurate to discern alternatives and can be regarded as the proportion of stochastic criterion space that leads to the best alternative p i c is computed as a multi dimensional integral over the criteria pv distributions 17 p i c ξ x rank ξ w i c 1 f x ξ d ξ a low confidence factor e g less than 5 suggests that the alternative is unlikely to be selected as the most preferred one even using its cwv on the contrary a high confidence factor e g over 95 indicates that the alternative is almost certainly the most preferred one with suitable preference information in order to improve the discrimination capability of smaa gra for those similar alternatives we define the cross confidence factor p ik c by calculating the confidence factor using the cwv of other alternatives particularly the cross confidence factor for alternative ai with regard to target alternative ak is formulated as 18 p ik c ξ x b k 1 0 w k c w i 1 ξ f x ξ d ξ the cross confidence factor measures the probability that an alternative gets the best rank when using the cwv of a target alternative thus a nonzero cross confidence factor p ik c implies that the alternative ai will compete for the best rank with ak and the value measures how strongly ai do it obviously the cross confidence factor p ii c equals the confidence factor p i c 2 4 3 decision making uncertainty with deterministic criteria pvs and cws gra will produce precise results of the grey relational degree and a fixed ranking result this means that under perfect information about input parameters an mcdm problem can be easily solved by applying gra and then implementing the first rank alternative however due to impact of uncertainties the grey relational degree becomes stochastic and an arbitrary rank is likely to be assigned to each alternative which will lead to a reversal of the established ranking in this study we use two statistical indicators i e the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree rud to measure this kind of decision making uncertainty the risk of errors in decision making is defined to measure the uncertainty of each alternative obtaining the first rank because in actual mcdm challenges managers are more concerned about the first rank alternative which will be implemented for the immediate time period due to the influence of uncertainties the assignment of the first rank to any worse alternative will lead to unfavourable results for water resources management since it deviates from the optimal solution the risk of errors in decision making is defined as the weighted probability that non optimal alternatives i e the alternatives that do not obtain the first rank according to the hai obtain the first rank 19 p f k 2 m β k b k 1 where b k 1 denotes the first rank acceptability index of the alternative that obtains rank k according to the hai β k k 2 3 m is defined as the risk weights to discern the contribution of each non optimal alternative to the risk in this study β k is formulated as an incremental and m 1 dimensional vector β k k k 2 m k rud is utilized to measure the overall uncertainty of the ranking results which is defined as the sum of rais that each alternative obtains all possible ranks except for its final rank 20 rud i 1 m r 1 r s i m b i r i 1 m r 1 m b i r i 1 m b i s i m i 1 m b i s i where si is the final rank of alternative ai determined by the hai it is important to mention that multi dimensional integrals exist in the smaa gra model which are difficult to be estimated via analytical methods due to nonlinear characteristics of the gra type utility function however the dramatically increased performance of modern computers enables us to solve these multi dimensional integrals with uncertainty efficiently in a numerical way in the study the monte carlo simulation technique is employed to solve the smaa gra model numerically 2 5 significance analysis in order to quantify the impacts of input parameter uncertainties i e criteria pvs and cws on the final ranking of alternatives this study carries out significance analysis using the spearman rank correlation coefficient srcc which denotes the contribution of each input parameter to the decision making results the srcc is expressed as follows 21 ρ 1 6 i 1 k d i 2 k k 2 1 where k is the total number of monte carlo simulations di denotes the difference between the rank of grey relational degree and the rank of considered input parameter at the ith monte carlo iteration the srcc is computed between each input parameter and the grey relational degree of each alternative based on the smaa gra outputs the range of ρ is 1 1 in which a value of 1 or 1 suggests perfect relationship between variations in input parameters and resulting changes in the rank of alternatives the minus sign occurring for reverse ranks while the plus sign occurring for identical ranks the decision making result is insensitive to the input parameter with a srcc close to 0 significance analysis is useful since it enables decision makers to better understand the emphasis of further work required i e reinvestigate the uncertainties of those sensitive parameters to reach a more reasonable decision 3 case study 1 3 1 background in case study 1 we apply the proposed framework to a reservoir operation problem in china undertaken by zhu et al 2017 in which a multi objective stochastic programming with recourse model was developed to guide optimal reservoir operation considering hydrological uncertainties the obtained pareto optimal solutions consisted of 10 alternatives which were assessed using five criteria the peak discharge q max and the risk of flooding at a downstream control point pq were utilized to measure downstream region safety the highest reservoir water level z max and reservoir overtopping risk pz were utilized to characterize the safety of reservoirs the end water level ze was adopted to balance the purpose of water use and flood control the uncertainties of q max z max and ze were quantified using normal distributions table 1 shows the resulting stochastic decision matrix which is a mixture of 30 random variables and 20 constants 3 2 inverse weight space analysis a real world mcdm process usually starts with a very vague preference information and more accurate information is obtained as the process evolves in this case study we adopt the strategy of inverse weight space analysis by running smaa gra repetitively after each round of preference elicitation until sufficient information is collected for making the final decision at the very beginning of an mcdm process decision makers may be unwilling or have some difficulties to express their preferences which is often referred to as the wait and see situation in such a case i e information on weights is not available we run the smaa gra model based on the stochastic decision matrix shown in table 1 100 000 monte carlo iterations are used in the simulation to solve the smaa gra model numerically fig 3 illustrates the rais representing the probabilities that each alternative attains ranks from 1 to 10 according to fig 3 a1 should be rejected as a compromise alternative since its rai is quite large for the worst rank 66 2 and relatively small for good ranks before rank 8 this means that a1 has a large possibility of achieving rank 10 whereas it is almost impossible for a1 to achieve the best rank even by exploring the whole weight space a8 and a9 have relatively high rais for the best ranks before 3 and low rais for the worst ranks therefore they can be chosen as two compromise alternatives for further analysis fig 4 shows the central weight vectors as stacked bars a8 a10 favor the criteria of q max pq and ze while a1 and a2 favor the criteria of z max and pz this means that if decision makers are more concerned downstream safety of control points a8 a10 would be more likely to be selected as the most preferred alternatives since their central weight vectors are closer to the decision makers preferences according to figs 3 and 4 even though a10 has a relatively large first rank acceptability index 21 1 it cannot be considered as a compromise alternative due to the large rais for worst ranks 14 5 for rank 9 21 5 for rank 10 namely not only is there a large probability of a10 obtaining the first ranks but also is likely to get the worst ranks as long as the decision makers preferences slightly deviate from its cwv in conclusion although no weight information is available smaa gra can provide a preliminary identification about possible compromise alternatives and help decision makers better understand the stochastic mcdm problem at hand 3 3 weight aggregation and fws determination next we invite four reservoir operation experts to assist in decision making the well known ahp technique is employed to help experts express their preferences as quantitative cws as shown in table 2 and illustrated graphically in fig 5 it can be found that there exists some differences among the cws we then aggregate these four weight vectors as the coordinated weight vector using the proposed method based on game theory as shown in fig 5 the fws is determined using eq 6 with λ 0 2 to expand the coordinated weight vector from a single to a subspace uniform distribution is adopted to represent the uncertainty of cws within the fws boundaries overall the experts pay more attention to downstream region safety with relatively large weights assigned for q max and pq 3 4 results of the smaa gra model next we run the smaa gra model with inputs of the stochastic decision matrix and the estimated fws table 3 lists the confidence factor rank and holistic acceptability indices additionally all acceptability indices are illustrated in fig 6 while the first rank and holistic acceptability indices are highlighted in fig 7 by comparing figs 3 and 6 we can find that the mcdm results become much more explicit after incorporating the fws in the simulation for example the confidence factor and the first rank acceptability indices of a1 and a10 equal 0 indicating that these two alternatives are impossible to obtain the first rank besides a1 has a probability of 99 97 for rank 10 which means that this alternative must be the worst one and can be eliminated directly as fig 7 shows a8 has the highest confidence factor first rank and holistic acceptability indices among all alternatives moreover a8 has very small rais for the ranks after 3 e g 8 25 for rank 4 5 50 for rank 5 3 63 for rank 6 2 11 for rank 7 0 64 for rank 8 0 for ranks 9 and 10 according to table 1 a8 has almost zero risk of reservoir overtopping and flooding at downstream regions which is acceptable by all experts after the second round of consultations therefore a8 can be selected as the most preferred alternative and implemented for real time reservoir operation as shown in table 3 and fig 6 in addition to a8 there are certain probabilities of some other alternatives obtaining the first rank 20 80 for a7 14 92 for a9 11 10 for a3 6 32 for a6 and etc the risk of errors in decision making is determined as 4 32 based on eq 19 next we focus on the analysis of the cross confidence factor to further improve the discrimination of the above results it is clear from table 4 that a8 has the highest cross confidence factors regarding all target alternatives namely a8 still performs pretty well and can obtain the first rank even if the cwvs of other alternatives are used thus a8 is dominant in comparison with other alternatives for instance table 3 shows that a7 also has large confidence factor first rank and holistic acceptability indices and will obtain rank 2 according to the hai however a8 s cross confidence factor with the target alternative of a7 is 45 25 which is much higher than a7 s own confidence factor 20 80 namely even if a7 s cwv is employed it should not be considered as the most preferred alternative since it is dominated by a8 in conclusion the analysis of cross confidence factors allows a large degree of confidence to be placed in the water resource decision to choose a8 as the optimal alternative by the managers finally we perform significant analysis to identify the input parameters that have the most influences on decision making results fig 8 illustrates the 3d surface map of the srccs both uncertainties of criteria pvs and cws have significant impacts on the mcdm results which means that minor changes of the sensitive parameters may reverse some of the ranks this finding highlights the importance of considering uncertainties of criteria pvs and cws concurrently in the decision making process therefore stochastic water resource optimization or simulation models with explicit consideration of uncertainties are recommended instead of deterministic models widely applied in the past labadie 2004 yeh 1985 3 5 robustness and efficiency of smaa gra computations in this study the proposed smaa gra model is solved numerically via monte carlo simulations an important issue is to assess the reliability of such sampling based method against sampling variability thus a numerical experiment is carried out to examine the robustness and efficiency of smaa gra computations specifically we run the smaa gra model with 200 replicates by setting 200 different random seeds each replicate is individually implemented using 100 000 monte carlo iterations on a standard personal computer with an intel xeon e3 eight core 2 8 ghz cpu four indicators including b 8 1 pf rud and execution time are selected to perform the statistical analysis fig 9 illustrates the box plot of these indicators under the 200 replicates as fig 9 shows b 8 1 pf and rud have small standard deviations and change within very small ranges thus the smaa gra computation is robust to sampling variability in terms of the rai the risk of errors in decision making and rud fig 9 also indicates that the smaa gra computation can be implemented efficiently with execution time around 7 6 s overall sufficient accuracy can be obtained quickly allowing smaa gra to be integrated into existing decision support systems for purposes of real world water resource mcdm problems 3 6 effect of hydrological forecast uncertainty level on decision making a numerical experiment is conducted to investigate the effect of hydrological forecast uncertainty level on decision making according to fig 10 the risk of errors in decision making and rud tend to increase as hydrological forecast uncertainty level increases this implies that the uncertainty propagated from hydrological forecasts to optimization or simulation models to the final water resource decision increases with the forecast uncertainty level therefore it is important to develop reliable hydrological forecasts for making a robust water resource decision 4 case study 2 4 1 background in case study 2 we apply the proposed framework to an irrigation planning problem in the huesca province of spain raju et al 2000 considering water sustainability in this area raju et al 2000 designed seven irrigation planning alternatives which were formulated by mixing factors such as water allocation water pricing crop distribution the type of irrigation system subsidies received and etc ten criteria were chosen to evaluate the seven alternatives in terms of these factors the preferences of three groups of water resources experts who prioritize social environmental and economic effects respectively were reflected by three sets of cws table 5 indicates that conflicts exist among experts preferences thus we first aggregate the three weight vectors as a coordinated weight vector and then estimate the fws based on eq 6 with λ 0 2 uniform distribution is utilized to quantify the uncertainty of cws within the fws boundaries the decision matrix is presented in table 5 and the criteria pvs are normalized in commensurable units uniform distribution is adopted to represent the variability and uncertainty of the criteria pvs the upper and lower bounds of the distribution are defined as 10 of the original value e g for pv1 of a2 the uniform distribution ranges between 90 and 110 4 2 probabilistic interpretation of smaa gra outputs we first run the deterministic gra model with inputs of the deterministic decision matrix and the aggregated weight vector fig 11 a presents the deterministic result using vertical dashed lines it is evident that a1 and a2 outperform the remainder of alternatives significantly although a2 obtains the first rank a1 and a2 are almost indistinguishable with the difference of grey relational degree being 0 011 thus further analysis is required for making a robust water resource decision we then run the smaa gra model with inputs of the stochastic decision matrix and the fws fig 11 shows the probability density curve and cumulative probability distribution of the grey relational degrees essentially the decision making uncertainty results from the uncertainty of grey relational degrees which are described as random variables following normal distributions in contrast to the deterministic gra model smaa gra provides the probabilistic ranking information such as the possible range of grey relational degrees the probability that each alternative will obtain a certain rank and the decision making risks when uncertainties in input parameters are considered it can be seen from fig 11 a that the grey relational degree of a2 may range between 0 509 and 0 918 as opposed to the single value of 0 817 provided by the deterministic gra model fig 11 b shows the probability of each alternative s grey relational degree less than or equal to a certain value for instance there is a probability of 46 that a2 will obtain a grey relational degree less than or equal to 0 7 while for a1 there is a probability of 53 that a grey relational degree of 0 7 or less will be attained in addition fig 11 indicates that the probability density curve will cover wider ranges as grey relational degree increases which implies that the uncertainty level tends to increase with increasing grey relational degree 4 3 effect of probability distribution type on decision making any type of probability distribution can be feasibly used in the smaa gra model we conduct numerical experiments to investigate the effect of probability distribution type used on the stochastic decision making for comparison normal distribution and uniform distribution are selected to represent the uncertainties of criteria of pvs and cws respectively fig 12 indicates that the decision making result based on normal distributions is slightly clearer than that using uniform distributions with larger rais of each alternative obtaining respective ranks according to fig 13 there is no significant difference in the hais using two types of probability distributions however it can be seen from fig 14 that the risk of errors in decision making and rud based on normal distributions are lower than that using uniform distributions the reason lies in the fact that the uniform distribution assumes values are equally likely within the fws boundary while the normal distribution assigns greater probabilities around mean values and smaller probabilities around the fws boundary for real world stochastic mcdm problems the probability distribution that is straightforward to endorse is uniform distribution in the absence of further information especially at the beginning of an mcdm process as the process evolves decision makers will get increasingly clear understandings about the facing problem with additional evidence or probabilistic information provided by the smaa gra model thus in order to obtain a more robust water resource decision it is justified to adopt a probability distribution with decreasing density around the aggregated weight vector examples of such distributions include normal distributions triangular distributions and etc 5 discussion and conclusions water resource planners and managers always work in an environment of uncertainty due to the data used being to some degree imprecise or uncertain or even sometimes missing mcdm is a well suited decision support tool for water resources management however multiple uncertainties usually result in risks associated with water resource decisions in this paper we proposed an application oriented stochastic mcdm framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty a weight aggregation approach based on the game theory allied with fws was proposed for conflict resolution and uncertainty estimation we developed a novel smaa gra model which enables uncertainties of criteria pvs and cws to be incorporated simultaneously in the mcdm modeling process we proposed the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree to assess the risk propagated to water resource decisions significance analysis was carried out to examine the impacts of input parameter uncertainty on the final ranking of alternatives we demonstrated the proposed framework via two water resources management case studies furthermore numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the robustness and computational efficiency of the framework as well as the effects of uncertainty level and probability distribution type on decision making results the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 at the beginning of an mcdm process despite there being no information on weights smaa gra can provide a preliminary identification about possible compromise alternatives and help decision makers better understand the stochastic mcdm problem via the strategy of inverse weight space analysis as the mcdm process evolves the decision making results become increasingly explicit after each round of preference expression determined by fws 2 the smaa gra model can provide decision makers with valuable information in the form of probabilistic ranking results and quantitative risks these information enables water managers to examine the robustness of final decisions and allows a risk informed water resource decision to be made with higher reliabilities 3 the significance analysis indicates that both uncertainties of criteria pvs and cws have significant impacts on the mcdm results which highlights the importance of using stochastic optimization or simulation models instead of deterministic models for guiding water resource decisions 4 the proposed framework can be efficiently and accurately implemented based on monte carlo simulation making it easily to be integrated into existing decision support systems for supporting real world water resources management problems under uncertainty 5 the uncertainty propagated from hydrological forecasts to optimization or simulation models to the final water resource decision tends to increase as the forecast uncertainty level increases which highlights the importance of developing reliable hydrological forecasts for making a robust water resource decision 6 the probabilistic interpretation of smaa gra outputs indicates that the decision making uncertainty essentially arises from the uncertainty of grey relational degrees 7 any kind of probability distribution can be feasibly used within the proposed framework as the mcdm process evolves probability distributions with decreasing density around the aggregated weight vector can be utilized to obtain a more robust water resource decision credit authorship contribution statement feilin zhu methodology writing

6293,water planner and managers always work in a changing and uncertain environment since the majority of water resource related data is imprecise or uncertain to some extent mcdm multi criteria decision making is a well suited decision support tool for water resources management however multiple uncertainties existed in criteria weights cws and performance values pvs hinder the application of mcdm methods in real world problems this paper proposes an application oriented stochastic mcdm framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty a weight aggregation approach based on the game theory coupled with feasible weight space fws is developed for conflict resolution and uncertainty estimation we propose a novel smaa gra model by combining the stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa theory and grey relational analysis gra the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree are utilized to assess decision making uncertainty we perform significance analysis to examine the impacts of input parameter uncertainties on the final assessment of alternatives the proposed framework is demonstrated via two water resources management case studies numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the robustness and computational efficiency of the framework as well as the effects of uncertainty level and probability distribution type on decision making results the results indicate that the framework enables water managers to examine the robustness of final decisions and allows a risk informed water resource decision to be made with higher reliabilities keywords water resources management stochastic multi criteria decision making multiple uncertainties risk analysis probabilistic ranking 1 introduction water resources management usually involves social environmental economic even political influences as well as hydraulic and hydrologic analysis lund 2015 these interdependent impacts among spatial and temporal relations especially the uncertainty concerning the availability of water resources make the problem rather complex and uncertain cai et al 2018 water resource decisions are generally guided by a large number of alternatives and criteria measured in incommensurable units in addition the decisions can often be characterized by complex interactions uncertain outcomes and conflicting interests of multiple participating stakeholders therefore water resources management requires the application of decision support tools which can take into account stakeholders views trade offs objectives candidate alternatives and numerous criteria multi criteria decision making mcdm is an umbrella term for a body of methods that can be applied to support management in problems involving multiple alternatives and criteria through a structured framework the advantages of mcdm include facilitating resolution of conflict participation of multiple stakeholders group negotiation and collaborative decision making which make mcdm a well suited decision support tool for water resources management since the late 1980s mcdm techniques have attracted much attention not only from water resources researchers but also water managers outside the scientific community cai et al 2004 malekmohammadi et al 2011 wan et al 2014 until now mcdm still has widespread and growing application in the management of water resources inamdar et al 2018 ren et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 wan et al 2014 proposed an mcdm method based on variable sets and fuzzy rating interval to assess water allocation alternatives of jining city china more recently inamdar et al 2018 developed a comprehensive methodology framework for selection of suitable stormwater harvesting sites in urban areas using multi criteria decision analysis ren et al 2018 proposed a triangular multi attribute preference model based on fuzzy logic for facilitating the selection of groundwater remediation strategies traditionally mcdm methods applied in water resources planning and management are limited to deterministic or fuzzy environments where associated uncertainties are more or less ignored in reality water planner and managers always work in a changing and uncertain environment fu et al 2017 hutton et al 2014 tian et al 2017 for example water supplies are uncertain if not in the short term at least in the long term water demands and multiple purposes water serve may change over time which are very difficult to be accurately predicted moreover the hydrologic environmental economic social and ecological data which water resource decisions depend are inherently uncertain singh 2016 all of these uncertainty factors will finally lead to the uncertainty of criteria performance values pvs which are obtained by solving water resources optimization or simulation models in addition criteria weights cws have also been identified as a possible source of considerable uncertainty in the mcdm process which mainly result from the following three aspects first water resources management involves conflicts between multiple stakeholders with different backgrounds views responsibilities interests and frequently competing objectives conflict at a local level may occur when two users extract underground water from the same aquifer or at an international level when the same water resource is competed for by two countries while past water resources conflicts have occurred present day conflicts have become much more severe as a result of growing demands from more diverse users on water resource systems second the subjectivity and fuzziness of human judgments in the weighting process may result in imprecise or uncertain cws third the aggregating or averaging of cws from multiple managers is a source of additional uncertainty and results in a considerable loss of information under this strategy a concealment of the true uncertainty of cws will occur in fact uncertainties exist simultaneously in criteria pvs and cws throughout the mcdm modeling process information on uncertainty does not make decision making easier but ignoring it is ignoring reality incorporating input parameter uncertainties i e criteria pvs and cws used in an mcdm model can help quantify the resulting uncertainty in model outputs and allow a risk informed water resource decision to be made with higher reliabilities therefore it is important to trace the source of uncertainties in the mcdm modeling process and assess the risk associated with water resource decisions to the best of our knowledge existing mcdm methods for water resources management are not convincing enough due to the following shortcomings over the past decades mcdm methods themselves have been overemphasized with substantial attention being given to developing or improving different kinds of mcdm methods although a large number of mcdm methods are available to guide water resource decisions few of them can handle uncertainties the criteria pvs and cws have the most significant influence on decision making results since they determine the information inputs to an mcdm model however uncertainty analysis of criteria pvs and cws remains an issue and was rarely considered in mcdm for water resources management the uncertain input parameters will ultimately lead to uncertainties in the mcdm outcomes such as the reversal of fixed ranks and decision making risks in general this issue has been ignored or poorly evaluated in the reported application of mcdm to water resources management an important step to verify the stability of mcdm results and identifying the most critical input parameters is performing sensitivity analysis however most of existing mcdm methods do not adopt any kind of sensitivity analysis thereby neglecting the influence of variations in input parameters on model outputs based on the above analysis although much research has been conducted over the past decades the subject of stochastic mcdm for water resources management under uncertainty remains incompletely addressed in a unified framework in this study we propose an application oriented stochastic mcdm framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty the proposed framework helps to incorporate expected uncertainties into the mcdm modeling process and enable water managers to examine the robustness of water recourse decisions first the definitions of problems associated with mcdm and methods for handling criteria pv uncertainties are introduced a weight aggregation method based on the game theory is proposed for conflict resolution then the feasible weight space fws is utilized to quantify the uncertainty of cws by expanding the aggregated weight vector from a single point to a subspace in the whole weight space in addition by combining the stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa theory and grey relational analysis gra we develop a novel smaa gra model which enables uncertainties in input parameters to be considered simultaneously two statistical indicators i e the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree are adopted to assess the decision making uncertainty we then perform significance analysis to examine the impacts of input parameter uncertainties on the final assessment of alternatives finally the proposed framework is illustrated via two water resources management case studies numerical experiments are also conducted to investigate the robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed framework as well as the effects of uncertainty level and probability distribution type on decision making results 2 methodology a flowchart of the stochastic mcdm framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty is shown in fig 1 each step is presented in detail in the following subsections 2 1 definition of mcdm problems in general the composition of an mcdm problem can be defined as 1 a set of criteria measured in incommensurable units 2 a set of alternatives to be evaluated ranked and selected and 3 a decision model for combining criteria measurements with decision makers preferences mcdm methods mainly differ in terms of different decision models adopted such as the outranking relations utility functions pairwise comparisons or reference based models from this point we assume an mcdm problem to consist of a set of m alternatives a a 1 a 2 a m the evaluation of which is performed in terms of n criteria c c 1 c 2 c n the weight vector is represented as w w 1 w 2 w n let xij be the criteria pvs with i and j representing the alternative ai and the criterion cj respectively the decision matrix is expressed as x x ij m n consequently an mcdm model can be formulated as follows 1 t i f x w where f denotes the function of the adopted decision model ti is the total value through which the overall performance of alternative ai is measured regarding all criteria candidate alternative ranking can be determined according to the total value normally the most preferred alternative is the one with the largest ti 2 2 define uncertainty in the criteria pvs due to the inherently uncertain characteristics of water supplies and water demands as well as the variability of hydrologic environmental economic social and ecological data the criteria pvs are inevitably uncertain criteria pv uncertainty can be represented using continuous probability distributions such as uniform normal exponential gumbel and etc plenty of methods are available to do this such as optimal hedging rules wan et al 2016 xu et al 2017 yan et al 2018 risk analysis techniques chen et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 liu et al 2015 and so on in a stochastic mcdm problem the deterministic decision matrix x should be replaced by a stochastic decision matrix ξ where each element can be a random variable following certain probability distribution a constant or a mixture of both 2 ξ ξ ij m n ξ 11 ξ 12 ξ 1 n ξ 21 ξ 22 ξ 2 n ξ m 1 ξ m 2 ξ mn 2 3 weight aggregation and uncertainty quantification based on the game theory allied with feasible weight space water resources management is usually a group decision making problem which involves groups or institutions with conflicting objectives and interests and it requires collaboration for conflict resolution in the mcdm process the preferences of different groups are typically different or even conflicting reaching consensus over the preferences poses a challenge which leads to uncertainties and complexities of decision making in this section we propose a method based on the game theory coupled with the feasible weight space to aggregate conflicting weight vectors and quantify the uncertainty of cws 2 3 1 weight aggregation using the game theory as a new branch of mathematics as well as an important field within operational research game theory mainly focuses on mathematical representations of the strategic interactions between rational decision makers this study introduces the game theory into stochastic mcdm problems the basic idea is to reach the consistency or compromise among conflicting cws based on the nash equilibrium define weights obtained from multiple decision makers as the basic weight vectors denoted by w k w 1 k w 2 k w n k k 1 2 l where l denotes the total number of decision makers involved in the mcdm process the basic weight vector can be easily determined using one of a variety of existing weighting method such as ahp delphi method and etc the arbitrary linear combination of the basic weight vectors can be expressed as 3 w b k 1 l α k w k t α k 0 k 1 l α k 1 where αk is the combination coefficient according to the game theory we optimize the combination coefficient to determine the coordinated weight vector denoted by w the objective is minimizing the deviation between w and each wk 4 min i 1 l α i w i t w k 2 k 1 2 l the global solver available in lingo 17 0 is utilized to solve the above optimization model the optimal combination coefficient is expressed as α 1 α 2 αl finally we can determine the coordinated weight vector as follows 5 w k 1 l α k w k t 2 3 2 feasible weight space as stated above the conflicting weight vectors are aggregated as a coordinated weight vector in order to resolve conflicts among multiple decision makers this section proposes the use of feasible weight space fws to further quantify the uncertainty of cws by expanding the coordinated weight vector from a single point to a subspace in the whole weight space fig 2 illustrates the fws in a case involving three criteria when weight information remains unknown the whole weight space can be described as a triangular plane formulated by w 1 w 2 w 3 1 0 w 1 w 2 w 3 1 as fig 2 shows fws is defined as a subspace on this plane with the coordinated weight vector being the center fws is formulated as follows 6 fws w r n w j 0 w j 1 λ w j w j 1 λ j 1 n w j 1 where λ is utilized to reflect the uncertainty level of cws which is related to the conflict degree among multiple stakeholders if decision makers are satisfied about the coordinated weight vector a small value should be assigned to λ alternatively a large λ should be utilized to generate a fws covering wider area of the weight space fws is more reasonable than using a deterministic weight vector since it can incorporate as much preferences as possible in the mcdm modeling process and avoid information loss furthermore the weight uncertainty can be easily quantified via probability distributions with interval constraints within the fws boundaries 2 4 the smaa gra model in this section we propose a novel smaa gra model by combining the stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa theory and grey relational analysis gra the decision making uncertainty is estimated using two statistical indicators including the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree 2 4 1 deterministic grey relational analysis grey relational analysis gra is an important component of grey system theory deng 1989 which has been applied in various field of engineering and management with discrete data and fuzzy information gra uses a specific definition of information situations with no information are defined as black whereas those with perfect information are defined as white however in real life problems neither of these ideal situations ever occurs in actual fact the word grey is utilized to describe situations between these two extremes in this study we use gra to solve mcdm problems by aggregating the entire range of criteria measurements and preference information into a quantified value of grey relational degree the following steps are involved step 1 define the reference set x x j n 7 x j max 1 i m x ij for benefit criteria min 1 i m x ij for cost criteria step 2 normalize the decision matrix x to z z ij m n the reference set x is also normalized as z z j n step 3 calculate the grey relational coefficient between each alternative and the normalized reference set 8 r z i z min i min j z ij z j ϕ max i max j z ij z j z ij z j ϕ max i max j z ij z j where z i is the normalized pv vector of alternative ai ϕ is the recognition coefficient ranging from 0 to 1 ϕ equals 0 5 in this study step 4 define the grey relational degree of alternative ai as the weighted sum of grey relational coefficients 9 ϑ i j 1 n w j r z i z where ϑ i provides a global evaluation for ai with respect to all criteria and form the basis for the final decision i e the most preferred alternative is the one with the largest grey relational degree 2 4 2 stochastic version of gra smaa gra stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis smaa is a set of related methods for assisting multi criteria group decision making with imprecise uncertain or missing information durbach et al 2014 lahdelma and salminen 2001 lahdelma and salminen 2006 the foundation of the smaa framework is simulating diverse value combinations for uncertain parameters and calculating statistics describing how alternatives are evaluated for example to determine the probability that a specific alternative obtains a certain rank the advantage of smaa lies in that it can flexibly handle the uncertain imprecise or missing information with suitable probability distributions this study proposes a novel smaa gra model by integrating the gra algorithm with the smaa framework smaa gra is an extension of deterministic gra to deal with uncertainties i e a stochastic type of gra additionally the integrated model can be also regarded as a novel variant of smaa with a gra type utility function the mathematical formulation of smaa gra is described as follows the original smaa framework adopts a real valued additive utility function u to evaluate how good an alternative is by a real number ranging from 0 to 1 10 u i u x i w j 1 n x ij w j where x i is the criteria pv vector of alternative ai in smaa gra the additive utility function u is replaced with the gra algorithm as follows 11 u i ϑ x i w where the function ϑ calculates the grey relational degree of each alternative based on the criteria pv vector and weight vector as mentioned previously the uncertain criteria pvs are represented by the stochastic decision matrix ξ consisting of random variables ξ ij with estimated joint probability distribution function f x ξ in the space ξ r m n the uncertainties in the cws are quantified via the weight aggregation method coupled with fws which are further represented by weight distributions with joint probability distribution function f w w within the fws boundaries we define the following ranking function to calculate the rank of each alternative from the best rank 1 to the worst rank m 12 rank ξ i w 1 k 1 m ρ ϑ ξ k w ϑ ξ i w where ξ i is the stochastic criteria pv vector of alternative ai ρ t r u e 1 and ρ f a l s e 0 ϑ is the gra type utility function the smaa gra is based on the analysis of the sets of favourable rank weights w i r ξ and any weight vector w w i r ξ grants alternative ai rank r w i r ξ is defined as follows 13 w i r ξ w fws rank ξ i w r the main outputs of the smaa gra model consist of five summary metrics that form the basis to reach a final decision including 1 the rank acceptability index rai 2 holistic acceptability index hai 3 central weight vector cwv 4 confidence factor and 5 cross confidence factor the rai b i r is the expected volume of the set of favourable rank weights for each alternative which measures the variety of different valuations resulting in rank r for alternative ai b i r is calculated as a multi dimensional integral over the criteria pv distributions f x ξ and w i r ξ as 14 b i r x f x ξ w i r ξ f w w d w d ξ obviously the rai is in the range 0 1 where 0 indicates that an alternative is impossible to get a given rank and 1 indicates that it always gets the given rank with any combination of cws alternatives with large rais for the best ranks can be considered as the most acceptable solutions while those with large rais for the worst ranks should be eliminated from the alternative set the hai a i h is utilized to examine the overall acceptability of each alternative and is defined as the weighted sum of all rais 15 a i h r 1 m α r b i r where α r represent meta weights which reflect the contribution of each rai to the evaluation of an alternative in this study we define α r as a monotonically decreasing vector α r i r m 1 i i 1 m 1 i to model that the best ranks are preferred over the worst ranks the cwv w i c is the expected gravity center of the favourable first rank weight space of alternative ai the cwv denotes the preference information supporting corresponding alternatives which enables decision makers to comprehend how different weights are associated with different decisions and assists in the cw assignment w i c is calculated as a multi dimensional integral over the criteria pv distributions f x ξ and the favourable first rank weights w i 1 ξ 16 w i c x f x ξ w i 1 ξ f w w w d w d ξ b i 1 the confidence factor p i c is the probability of an alternative being the most preferred based on its own cwv p i c is a measure of whether the criteria data are sufficiently accurate to discern alternatives and can be regarded as the proportion of stochastic criterion space that leads to the best alternative p i c is computed as a multi dimensional integral over the criteria pv distributions 17 p i c ξ x rank ξ w i c 1 f x ξ d ξ a low confidence factor e g less than 5 suggests that the alternative is unlikely to be selected as the most preferred one even using its cwv on the contrary a high confidence factor e g over 95 indicates that the alternative is almost certainly the most preferred one with suitable preference information in order to improve the discrimination capability of smaa gra for those similar alternatives we define the cross confidence factor p ik c by calculating the confidence factor using the cwv of other alternatives particularly the cross confidence factor for alternative ai with regard to target alternative ak is formulated as 18 p ik c ξ x b k 1 0 w k c w i 1 ξ f x ξ d ξ the cross confidence factor measures the probability that an alternative gets the best rank when using the cwv of a target alternative thus a nonzero cross confidence factor p ik c implies that the alternative ai will compete for the best rank with ak and the value measures how strongly ai do it obviously the cross confidence factor p ii c equals the confidence factor p i c 2 4 3 decision making uncertainty with deterministic criteria pvs and cws gra will produce precise results of the grey relational degree and a fixed ranking result this means that under perfect information about input parameters an mcdm problem can be easily solved by applying gra and then implementing the first rank alternative however due to impact of uncertainties the grey relational degree becomes stochastic and an arbitrary rank is likely to be assigned to each alternative which will lead to a reversal of the established ranking in this study we use two statistical indicators i e the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree rud to measure this kind of decision making uncertainty the risk of errors in decision making is defined to measure the uncertainty of each alternative obtaining the first rank because in actual mcdm challenges managers are more concerned about the first rank alternative which will be implemented for the immediate time period due to the influence of uncertainties the assignment of the first rank to any worse alternative will lead to unfavourable results for water resources management since it deviates from the optimal solution the risk of errors in decision making is defined as the weighted probability that non optimal alternatives i e the alternatives that do not obtain the first rank according to the hai obtain the first rank 19 p f k 2 m β k b k 1 where b k 1 denotes the first rank acceptability index of the alternative that obtains rank k according to the hai β k k 2 3 m is defined as the risk weights to discern the contribution of each non optimal alternative to the risk in this study β k is formulated as an incremental and m 1 dimensional vector β k k k 2 m k rud is utilized to measure the overall uncertainty of the ranking results which is defined as the sum of rais that each alternative obtains all possible ranks except for its final rank 20 rud i 1 m r 1 r s i m b i r i 1 m r 1 m b i r i 1 m b i s i m i 1 m b i s i where si is the final rank of alternative ai determined by the hai it is important to mention that multi dimensional integrals exist in the smaa gra model which are difficult to be estimated via analytical methods due to nonlinear characteristics of the gra type utility function however the dramatically increased performance of modern computers enables us to solve these multi dimensional integrals with uncertainty efficiently in a numerical way in the study the monte carlo simulation technique is employed to solve the smaa gra model numerically 2 5 significance analysis in order to quantify the impacts of input parameter uncertainties i e criteria pvs and cws on the final ranking of alternatives this study carries out significance analysis using the spearman rank correlation coefficient srcc which denotes the contribution of each input parameter to the decision making results the srcc is expressed as follows 21 ρ 1 6 i 1 k d i 2 k k 2 1 where k is the total number of monte carlo simulations di denotes the difference between the rank of grey relational degree and the rank of considered input parameter at the ith monte carlo iteration the srcc is computed between each input parameter and the grey relational degree of each alternative based on the smaa gra outputs the range of ρ is 1 1 in which a value of 1 or 1 suggests perfect relationship between variations in input parameters and resulting changes in the rank of alternatives the minus sign occurring for reverse ranks while the plus sign occurring for identical ranks the decision making result is insensitive to the input parameter with a srcc close to 0 significance analysis is useful since it enables decision makers to better understand the emphasis of further work required i e reinvestigate the uncertainties of those sensitive parameters to reach a more reasonable decision 3 case study 1 3 1 background in case study 1 we apply the proposed framework to a reservoir operation problem in china undertaken by zhu et al 2017 in which a multi objective stochastic programming with recourse model was developed to guide optimal reservoir operation considering hydrological uncertainties the obtained pareto optimal solutions consisted of 10 alternatives which were assessed using five criteria the peak discharge q max and the risk of flooding at a downstream control point pq were utilized to measure downstream region safety the highest reservoir water level z max and reservoir overtopping risk pz were utilized to characterize the safety of reservoirs the end water level ze was adopted to balance the purpose of water use and flood control the uncertainties of q max z max and ze were quantified using normal distributions table 1 shows the resulting stochastic decision matrix which is a mixture of 30 random variables and 20 constants 3 2 inverse weight space analysis a real world mcdm process usually starts with a very vague preference information and more accurate information is obtained as the process evolves in this case study we adopt the strategy of inverse weight space analysis by running smaa gra repetitively after each round of preference elicitation until sufficient information is collected for making the final decision at the very beginning of an mcdm process decision makers may be unwilling or have some difficulties to express their preferences which is often referred to as the wait and see situation in such a case i e information on weights is not available we run the smaa gra model based on the stochastic decision matrix shown in table 1 100 000 monte carlo iterations are used in the simulation to solve the smaa gra model numerically fig 3 illustrates the rais representing the probabilities that each alternative attains ranks from 1 to 10 according to fig 3 a1 should be rejected as a compromise alternative since its rai is quite large for the worst rank 66 2 and relatively small for good ranks before rank 8 this means that a1 has a large possibility of achieving rank 10 whereas it is almost impossible for a1 to achieve the best rank even by exploring the whole weight space a8 and a9 have relatively high rais for the best ranks before 3 and low rais for the worst ranks therefore they can be chosen as two compromise alternatives for further analysis fig 4 shows the central weight vectors as stacked bars a8 a10 favor the criteria of q max pq and ze while a1 and a2 favor the criteria of z max and pz this means that if decision makers are more concerned downstream safety of control points a8 a10 would be more likely to be selected as the most preferred alternatives since their central weight vectors are closer to the decision makers preferences according to figs 3 and 4 even though a10 has a relatively large first rank acceptability index 21 1 it cannot be considered as a compromise alternative due to the large rais for worst ranks 14 5 for rank 9 21 5 for rank 10 namely not only is there a large probability of a10 obtaining the first ranks but also is likely to get the worst ranks as long as the decision makers preferences slightly deviate from its cwv in conclusion although no weight information is available smaa gra can provide a preliminary identification about possible compromise alternatives and help decision makers better understand the stochastic mcdm problem at hand 3 3 weight aggregation and fws determination next we invite four reservoir operation experts to assist in decision making the well known ahp technique is employed to help experts express their preferences as quantitative cws as shown in table 2 and illustrated graphically in fig 5 it can be found that there exists some differences among the cws we then aggregate these four weight vectors as the coordinated weight vector using the proposed method based on game theory as shown in fig 5 the fws is determined using eq 6 with λ 0 2 to expand the coordinated weight vector from a single to a subspace uniform distribution is adopted to represent the uncertainty of cws within the fws boundaries overall the experts pay more attention to downstream region safety with relatively large weights assigned for q max and pq 3 4 results of the smaa gra model next we run the smaa gra model with inputs of the stochastic decision matrix and the estimated fws table 3 lists the confidence factor rank and holistic acceptability indices additionally all acceptability indices are illustrated in fig 6 while the first rank and holistic acceptability indices are highlighted in fig 7 by comparing figs 3 and 6 we can find that the mcdm results become much more explicit after incorporating the fws in the simulation for example the confidence factor and the first rank acceptability indices of a1 and a10 equal 0 indicating that these two alternatives are impossible to obtain the first rank besides a1 has a probability of 99 97 for rank 10 which means that this alternative must be the worst one and can be eliminated directly as fig 7 shows a8 has the highest confidence factor first rank and holistic acceptability indices among all alternatives moreover a8 has very small rais for the ranks after 3 e g 8 25 for rank 4 5 50 for rank 5 3 63 for rank 6 2 11 for rank 7 0 64 for rank 8 0 for ranks 9 and 10 according to table 1 a8 has almost zero risk of reservoir overtopping and flooding at downstream regions which is acceptable by all experts after the second round of consultations therefore a8 can be selected as the most preferred alternative and implemented for real time reservoir operation as shown in table 3 and fig 6 in addition to a8 there are certain probabilities of some other alternatives obtaining the first rank 20 80 for a7 14 92 for a9 11 10 for a3 6 32 for a6 and etc the risk of errors in decision making is determined as 4 32 based on eq 19 next we focus on the analysis of the cross confidence factor to further improve the discrimination of the above results it is clear from table 4 that a8 has the highest cross confidence factors regarding all target alternatives namely a8 still performs pretty well and can obtain the first rank even if the cwvs of other alternatives are used thus a8 is dominant in comparison with other alternatives for instance table 3 shows that a7 also has large confidence factor first rank and holistic acceptability indices and will obtain rank 2 according to the hai however a8 s cross confidence factor with the target alternative of a7 is 45 25 which is much higher than a7 s own confidence factor 20 80 namely even if a7 s cwv is employed it should not be considered as the most preferred alternative since it is dominated by a8 in conclusion the analysis of cross confidence factors allows a large degree of confidence to be placed in the water resource decision to choose a8 as the optimal alternative by the managers finally we perform significant analysis to identify the input parameters that have the most influences on decision making results fig 8 illustrates the 3d surface map of the srccs both uncertainties of criteria pvs and cws have significant impacts on the mcdm results which means that minor changes of the sensitive parameters may reverse some of the ranks this finding highlights the importance of considering uncertainties of criteria pvs and cws concurrently in the decision making process therefore stochastic water resource optimization or simulation models with explicit consideration of uncertainties are recommended instead of deterministic models widely applied in the past labadie 2004 yeh 1985 3 5 robustness and efficiency of smaa gra computations in this study the proposed smaa gra model is solved numerically via monte carlo simulations an important issue is to assess the reliability of such sampling based method against sampling variability thus a numerical experiment is carried out to examine the robustness and efficiency of smaa gra computations specifically we run the smaa gra model with 200 replicates by setting 200 different random seeds each replicate is individually implemented using 100 000 monte carlo iterations on a standard personal computer with an intel xeon e3 eight core 2 8 ghz cpu four indicators including b 8 1 pf rud and execution time are selected to perform the statistical analysis fig 9 illustrates the box plot of these indicators under the 200 replicates as fig 9 shows b 8 1 pf and rud have small standard deviations and change within very small ranges thus the smaa gra computation is robust to sampling variability in terms of the rai the risk of errors in decision making and rud fig 9 also indicates that the smaa gra computation can be implemented efficiently with execution time around 7 6 s overall sufficient accuracy can be obtained quickly allowing smaa gra to be integrated into existing decision support systems for purposes of real world water resource mcdm problems 3 6 effect of hydrological forecast uncertainty level on decision making a numerical experiment is conducted to investigate the effect of hydrological forecast uncertainty level on decision making according to fig 10 the risk of errors in decision making and rud tend to increase as hydrological forecast uncertainty level increases this implies that the uncertainty propagated from hydrological forecasts to optimization or simulation models to the final water resource decision increases with the forecast uncertainty level therefore it is important to develop reliable hydrological forecasts for making a robust water resource decision 4 case study 2 4 1 background in case study 2 we apply the proposed framework to an irrigation planning problem in the huesca province of spain raju et al 2000 considering water sustainability in this area raju et al 2000 designed seven irrigation planning alternatives which were formulated by mixing factors such as water allocation water pricing crop distribution the type of irrigation system subsidies received and etc ten criteria were chosen to evaluate the seven alternatives in terms of these factors the preferences of three groups of water resources experts who prioritize social environmental and economic effects respectively were reflected by three sets of cws table 5 indicates that conflicts exist among experts preferences thus we first aggregate the three weight vectors as a coordinated weight vector and then estimate the fws based on eq 6 with λ 0 2 uniform distribution is utilized to quantify the uncertainty of cws within the fws boundaries the decision matrix is presented in table 5 and the criteria pvs are normalized in commensurable units uniform distribution is adopted to represent the variability and uncertainty of the criteria pvs the upper and lower bounds of the distribution are defined as 10 of the original value e g for pv1 of a2 the uniform distribution ranges between 90 and 110 4 2 probabilistic interpretation of smaa gra outputs we first run the deterministic gra model with inputs of the deterministic decision matrix and the aggregated weight vector fig 11 a presents the deterministic result using vertical dashed lines it is evident that a1 and a2 outperform the remainder of alternatives significantly although a2 obtains the first rank a1 and a2 are almost indistinguishable with the difference of grey relational degree being 0 011 thus further analysis is required for making a robust water resource decision we then run the smaa gra model with inputs of the stochastic decision matrix and the fws fig 11 shows the probability density curve and cumulative probability distribution of the grey relational degrees essentially the decision making uncertainty results from the uncertainty of grey relational degrees which are described as random variables following normal distributions in contrast to the deterministic gra model smaa gra provides the probabilistic ranking information such as the possible range of grey relational degrees the probability that each alternative will obtain a certain rank and the decision making risks when uncertainties in input parameters are considered it can be seen from fig 11 a that the grey relational degree of a2 may range between 0 509 and 0 918 as opposed to the single value of 0 817 provided by the deterministic gra model fig 11 b shows the probability of each alternative s grey relational degree less than or equal to a certain value for instance there is a probability of 46 that a2 will obtain a grey relational degree less than or equal to 0 7 while for a1 there is a probability of 53 that a grey relational degree of 0 7 or less will be attained in addition fig 11 indicates that the probability density curve will cover wider ranges as grey relational degree increases which implies that the uncertainty level tends to increase with increasing grey relational degree 4 3 effect of probability distribution type on decision making any type of probability distribution can be feasibly used in the smaa gra model we conduct numerical experiments to investigate the effect of probability distribution type used on the stochastic decision making for comparison normal distribution and uniform distribution are selected to represent the uncertainties of criteria of pvs and cws respectively fig 12 indicates that the decision making result based on normal distributions is slightly clearer than that using uniform distributions with larger rais of each alternative obtaining respective ranks according to fig 13 there is no significant difference in the hais using two types of probability distributions however it can be seen from fig 14 that the risk of errors in decision making and rud based on normal distributions are lower than that using uniform distributions the reason lies in the fact that the uniform distribution assumes values are equally likely within the fws boundary while the normal distribution assigns greater probabilities around mean values and smaller probabilities around the fws boundary for real world stochastic mcdm problems the probability distribution that is straightforward to endorse is uniform distribution in the absence of further information especially at the beginning of an mcdm process as the process evolves decision makers will get increasingly clear understandings about the facing problem with additional evidence or probabilistic information provided by the smaa gra model thus in order to obtain a more robust water resource decision it is justified to adopt a probability distribution with decreasing density around the aggregated weight vector examples of such distributions include normal distributions triangular distributions and etc 5 discussion and conclusions water resource planners and managers always work in an environment of uncertainty due to the data used being to some degree imprecise or uncertain or even sometimes missing mcdm is a well suited decision support tool for water resources management however multiple uncertainties usually result in risks associated with water resource decisions in this paper we proposed an application oriented stochastic mcdm framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty a weight aggregation approach based on the game theory allied with fws was proposed for conflict resolution and uncertainty estimation we developed a novel smaa gra model which enables uncertainties of criteria pvs and cws to be incorporated simultaneously in the mcdm modeling process we proposed the risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree to assess the risk propagated to water resource decisions significance analysis was carried out to examine the impacts of input parameter uncertainty on the final ranking of alternatives we demonstrated the proposed framework via two water resources management case studies furthermore numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the robustness and computational efficiency of the framework as well as the effects of uncertainty level and probability distribution type on decision making results the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 at the beginning of an mcdm process despite there being no information on weights smaa gra can provide a preliminary identification about possible compromise alternatives and help decision makers better understand the stochastic mcdm problem via the strategy of inverse weight space analysis as the mcdm process evolves the decision making results become increasingly explicit after each round of preference expression determined by fws 2 the smaa gra model can provide decision makers with valuable information in the form of probabilistic ranking results and quantitative risks these information enables water managers to examine the robustness of final decisions and allows a risk informed water resource decision to be made with higher reliabilities 3 the significance analysis indicates that both uncertainties of criteria pvs and cws have significant impacts on the mcdm results which highlights the importance of using stochastic optimization or simulation models instead of deterministic models for guiding water resource decisions 4 the proposed framework can be efficiently and accurately implemented based on monte carlo simulation making it easily to be integrated into existing decision support systems for supporting real world water resources management problems under uncertainty 5 the uncertainty propagated from hydrological forecasts to optimization or simulation models to the final water resource decision tends to increase as the forecast uncertainty level increases which highlights the importance of developing reliable hydrological forecasts for making a robust water resource decision 6 the probabilistic interpretation of smaa gra outputs indicates that the decision making uncertainty essentially arises from the uncertainty of grey relational degrees 7 any kind of probability distribution can be feasibly used within the proposed framework as the mcdm process evolves probability distributions

6294,this work adopts a multicriteria approach combining diverse karst hydrogeology techniques to investigate the functioning of evaporite karst systems which are normally less studied due to the poor quality of their water resources the applicability of using several methods was also verified in view of previous experience at a pilot site within southern spain the natural responses of the main discharge point of the system of study lower anzur spring were controlled by continuous monitoring of the discharge rate water temperature and electrical conductivity water samples were collected for chemical analysis and for the determination of intrinsic fluorescence water stable isotopes δ18o δ2h and tritium 3h concentrations physico chemical data were statistically examined applying principal component analysis pca and trend analysis tests mann kendall and sen s slope the system shows a clear karstic functioning highly dependent on concentrated recharge and influenced by a limited drainage capacity of the conduit network the piston flow effects at the beginning of floods indicate a contribution to the drainage of deep ascending flows through the saturated zone subsequent drops in temperature and mineralization values in the water drained by the spring as well as a recent infiltration deduced from the signature of intrinsic fluorescence and stable isotopes point to a good hydrogeological connection from the recharge areas to the spring later restoration of the initial values of mineralization in a much shorter time than those of temperature reveals a faster geochemical evolution of the recently infiltrated groundwater which may be a distinctive trait of evaporite karst aquifers lastly the high solute content of the spring water in depletion conditions with ascending trends of mineralization and temperature observed during several dry years as a consequence of lower recharge contribution together with the tritium activity of selected samples suggest the existence of an old component partly responsible for the spring base flow thus groundwater would be linked to gravity driven regional flows but also to recent conduit flows all the results obtained led us to devise a hydrogeological conceptual model to precisely reflect the functioning of the studied system the results presented here demonstrate the advantages of using diverse techniques when investigating evaporite karst aquifers keywords evaporite karst hydrogeochemical processes hydrodynamics tritium s spain 1 introduction the importance of karst aquifers can be traced to ancient civilizations e g greek roman persian or chinese empires that used karst springs for water supply in many cities and villages lamoreaux 1999 parise and sammarco 2015 karst water exploitation has continued for centuries and approximately 15 25 of the world s population relies on it nowadays ford and williams 2007 stevanović 2018 in some european countries and in southwest china karst resources represent over half of the freshwater supply eu 1995 chen et al 2017 a better understanding of the inherent hydrological complexity of these aquifers is needed to advance in the implementation of sustainable water governance strategies particularly in europe eu 1995 2004 researchers and administrations contribute to this progress by developing and applying numerous karst specific approaches goldscheider and drew 2007 and references therein which shed light on the functioning of aquifers and their available water resources hydrogeological interest in evaporite karst systems is traditionally minor as their groundwater resources are usually not suitable for drinking due to their high solute contents andreo et al 2016 d angeli et al 2017 evaporite rocks are extensively spread worldwide being present on roughly 25 of the earth s continental surface klimchouk et al 1996 the largest evaporite outcrops are found in north america and russia warren 2016 although abundant

high solubility of gypsum anhydrite and halite favors rapid formation of subsurface karst conduits often resulting in collapse and subsidence phenomena aspects associated with the hydrogeology of evaporite karst formations are not so well known even though their resources usually contribute to the hydrological functioning and preservation of groundwater dependent ecosystems including wetlands sullivan et al 2013 beltram 2016 and rivers ford and williams 2007 wetlands related to evaporite outcrops are abundant and diverse andreo et al 2016 warren 2016 they host such varied wildlife species that many have achieved international relevance such as cuatrociénegas in méxico whooping crane summer range in canada al wathba in the united arab emirates bazer sakra in algeria or fuente de piedra and zoñar in spain valero garcés et al 2006 gutiérrez et al 2008a cardona et al 2018 sathish et al 2018 but the natural drainage of evaporite systems is often accompanied by a deterioration in the chemical quality of downstream water in rivers memon et al 1999 kaçaroğlu et al 2001 phillips et al 2003 négrel et al 2007 dam reservoirs carrasco 1986 calaforra et al 2002 miyamoto et al 2007 aghdam et al 2012 raeisi et al 2013 and even freshwater aquifers apaydin and aktaş 2012 naderi et al 2016 thus there are compelling reasons to perform research and develop scientific strategies that could help us to understand particular details of the hydrological functioning of evaporite karst systems heretofore most publications dealing with the hydrogeology of evaporite formations provide an overview of their general characteristics johnson 1985 pulido bosch and calaforra 1993 klimchouk 1996 andreo et al 2016 nekouei and zarei 2017 or the geochemical processes behind groundwater

2010 vigna et al 2017 d angeli et al 2017 have explored this approach combining spring time series analyses of discharge rate water temperature and electrical conductivity yet without equal consideration of chemical and isotopic parameters recently frank et al 2019 analyzed major ion time series during a single flood in a gypsum karst spring located in the austrian alps a means of inferring the importance of conduit matrix interaction in the systeḿs workings there is clearly room to further investigate the hydrogeological functioning of evaporite karst systems by including information from other sources and characterizing techniques the present goal is to arrive at a realistic understanding of flow patterns and evaluate the main geochemical processes involved recent studies andreo et al 2016 gil márquez et al 2017a b highlight the hydrogeological complexity of certain evaporitic systems including hierarchically organized groundwater flowpaths of different lengths and residence times from quick and shallow local flows through karst conduits to deep diffusive and slow regional flows combining information obtained from as many experimental methods as possible with a joint interpretation of results would allow researchers to define specific actions to be applied for the management and protection of wetlands associated with evaporite formations it would also help mitigate the negative effects of brine groundwater on the quality of water resources rivers reservoirs aquifers downstream the value of springs as exceptional observation points and integrators

reisenhofer et al 1998 helsel and hirsch 2002 stuart et al 2007 in this study a brine spring lower anzur tds 140 160 g l located at the border of an evaporite karst plateau in s spain was studied it was monitored for four hydrological years september 2013 october 2017 as a pilot site to investigate the hydrogeological behavior of evaporite karst systems in temperate climatic conditions this outlet has significant environmental and social implications as it drains groundwater with high solute content annually transporting about 20 000 tons of nacl gil márquez 2018 the water drained by the spring together with the surface runoff water flowing into the nearby anzur river is retained by a dam some 15 km downstream consequently the reservoir water is brackish and cannot be used for urban supply only for energy generation and irrigation purposes there are moreover several endorheic areas in the catchment area of the pilot evaporitic system many constituting ephemeral lakes and groundwater dependent wetlands of variable size but of great environmental value some listed in the ramsar convention of wetlands on the whole the system drained by the lower anzur spring is of vast scientific interest given its geological and geomorphological characteristics with diverse lithologies and chaotic structure which determine its hydrogeological complexity including diffuse and conduit flow behaviors andreo et al 2016 the aim of this work is to enhance our knowledge of the hydrogeological functioning of evaporite karst systems by applying and analyzing the results obtained from routine monitoring of the natural response of a karst spring lower anzur time series of discharge rates physico chemical data e g electrical conductivity and water temperature major dissolved ions and isotopic signature were taken into account statistical treatment of the obtained dataset jointly analyzed with information derived from intrinsic fluorescence and tritium 3h determinations among others led us to new insight into the hydrogeological processes controlling the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical variations in the outlet based on these results a hydrogeological conceptual model of the system was constructed the ultimate aim would be to achieve a comprehensive understanding of groundwater flow behavior to be applied for water planning policies and the management of natural areas and regional water resources 2 location climate geological and hydrogeological setting the jarales site fig 1 is an evaporitic karst plateau of approximately 80 km2 located between two rivers in southern cordoba province andalusia spain the genil southwards and its tributary the anzur to the north the area ranges from 250 to 450 m a s l and the land is predominantly covered by extensive olive orchards characterized by bare soil the prevailing climate is temperate mediterranean with an uneven annual rainfall distribution mainly taking place from autumn to spring very often stormy the mean air temperature in jarales is 17 2 c while the historic annual rainfall 1963 64 to 2015 16 amounts to 508 mm gil márquez 2018 during the study period between the hydrological years 2013 14 and 2016 17 the annual precipitation ranged from 324 mm in 2014 15 to 403 mm in 2015 16 thus our research was carried out in clearly dry years though the previous ones were quite wet with up to 821 annual rainfall in 2012 13 and 913 mm in 2009 10 gil márquez 2018 from the geological standpoint the jarales area belongs to the chaotic subbetic complex csc a geological unit that extends along the northern sector of the so called subbetic domain in the betic cordillera the csc is essentially a megabreccia made up of multi colored triassic keuper clays and evaporite rocks gypsum anhydrite and halite in addition to blocks of other ages and diverse lithology including triassic and jurassic carbonates cretaceous marls and miocene sandstones vera and martín algarra 2004 gypsum can be found as massive rock or forming polygenic breccias though halite is absent at the surface as a consequence of its high solubility its existence at depth is deduced from the existence of brine springs draining the evaporitic system andreo et al 2016 as well as from some exploration boreholes carrasco 1986 calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 the csc underwent massive gravitational displacement during alpine orogeny and is consequently highly deformed pérez lópez and sanz de galdeano 1994 the original stratigraphic relationships are therefore seldom preserved from a geomorphological standpoint the study site is characterized by gentle hills a poorly defined drainage network and the existence of karst landforms related to the dissolution of evaporite rocks the most remarkable exo karst features are endorheic areas closed depressions some of which host wetlands of diverse size fig 1 and variable hydroperiod i e flooding duration as a result of hydraulic interactions with the subsurface water table in the northern sector of the study area the karst depressions are naturally drained through swallow holes fig 1 although their drainage capacity is limited giving rise to occasional flooding during wet periods gil márquez et al 2017a besides direct infiltration of runoff into swallow holes recharge is also produced by diffuse infiltration of rainwater through permeable outcrops gypsum carbonate rocks and probably through the bottom of wetlands and other endorheic depressions andreo et al 2016 gil márquez 2018 given the abundance of clay lithologies the csc presents a general aquitard behavior and groundwater predominantly flows within a diffuse type system based on water local table measurements flow lines are drawn in a radial divergent pattern from the central part of the plateau at higher positions to its borders fig 1 at lower ones thus natural discharge takes place via springs located close to the anzur and genil rivers although groundwater discharge is related to a diffuse flow system the outlets also show quick natural responses to recharge that are characteristic of karst aquifers this is even more remarkable in the lower anzur spring where a high variability of discharge rate and physico chemical components has been registered gil márquez 2018 a dye tracer test performed in 2016 gil márquez et al 2017a demonstrated the hydraulic connection between two karst swallow holes and the outlet fig 1 with a maximum flow velocity of 192 m h additionally the alignment of karst features along the n s direction suggests a high development of the conduit network in the northern part of the system making possible a hydrogeological connection between other karst depressions and the lower anzur spring 3 methods 3 1 field measurement and sampling a gauging station with a 60 v notch weir was equipped in the lower anzur spring hourly records of water temperature t electrical conductivity ec and water level variations in the spring were registered from february 2014 to september 2017 ec and t were logged using a wtw 350i multi parameter measuring instrument while water level lectures were recorded by an odyssey depth and temperature data logger 1 mm accuracy for the continuous discharge record the evolution of discharge rate was obtained by applying the rating curve of the gauging station gil márquez 2018 to the water level variation series occasionally rises in the anzur river produced complete flooding of the outlet area the runoff effect on the spring gauging station was deleted thanks to the flow rate data series registered 600 m upstream in the anzur river fig 1 by the automatic hydrologic information system saih of the guadalquivir river basin authority in situ measurements of discharge rate ott c2 flow meter ec and t wtw cond 3310 were also carried out in the lower anzur spring from september 2013 until the end of the study period the measurement accuracies were 2 for flow rate 0 1 ms cm for ec and 0 1 c for water temperature concurrently water samples 132 were collected in 150 ml amber glass bottles for subsequent chemical and isotopic analyses in the laboratory measurement and sampling periodicity were adapted to the hydrological conditions of the system recharge recession depletion from several times per day in high flow conditions to monthly during depletion periods additionally five spring water samples were taken in 1 litre pet bottles for tritium determination from september 2014 to december 2016 under diverse hydrodynamic conditions 3 2 analytical methods samples were mainly processed in the laboratory of the centre of hydrogeology of the university of malaga cehiuma hco3 was determined by volumetric titration with 0 02 n h2so4 to ph 4 45 metrohm 888 titrando major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 no3 were analyzed using high pressure liquid chromatography hplc metrohm compact 930 ic flex for cations and metrohm compact 881 ic pro for anions with 2 accuracy due to their high solute content samples were diluted to 1 ms cm and filtered 0 45 µm millipore filters before their introduction in the system filter in line and precolumn filter the accuracy of the chemical data was checked using the charge balance error cbe calculated as the difference among the sums of the equivalent concentrations of anions and cations σcations σanions divided by the sum of equivalent concentrations of all ions σcations σanions the mean cbe value for the whole sample set was 2 5 and samples with cbe outside 5 were discarded intrinsic fluorescence of samples is produced by dissolved organic matter and its presence in groundwater allows one to study recharge in karst aquifers birdwell and engel 2007 it was analyzed using a perkin elmer ls55 spectrofluorometer the excitation emission matrices eems were obtained by means of the simultaneous scan of excitation and emission wavelengths from 200 to 350 and from 250 to 550 nm respectively with intervals of 5 nm in both cases a 5 nm slit was used with a scanning rate of 500 nm min the raman peak of deionized water measured at an excitation wavelength of 348 nm and with emission monitored at 390 395 nm was used to determine the stability of the instrument lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the maximum fluorescence intensity of each peak was therefore referred to as raman units ru peak a produced by humic acids appears between 230 and 250 nm excitation wavelengths and from 405 to 445 nm emission wavelengths whereas peak c related to fulvic acids is found between excitation wavelengths 300 335 nm and emission wavelengths 400 440 nm water isotopes δ18o and δ2h were determined by means of isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms in the central laboratory of the university of malaga scai corrected data were referred to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow due to the fractionation between free water molecules and those associated with the hydration sphere of cations in water solution the isotope activity ratios of brine samples differ from their isotope concentration ratios taube 1954 horita 1989 hence δ18o and δ2h data were converted from activity scale to concentration scale by applying the activity correction defined by sofer and gat 1972 1975 δ δ 2 h m n a c l 0 4 m m g c l 2 5 1 m c a c l 2 6 1 m k c l 2 4 δ δ 18 o m m g c l 2 1 11 m c a c l 2 0 47 m k c l 0 16 where m is the molality of the respective ions and δδ18o and δδ2h are the activity corrections which are the differences between the δ values on the concentration scale and those on the activity scale tritium 3h analysis was carried out in the department of oceanography of the institute of environmental physics university of bremen based on the 3he ingrowth method clarke et al 1976 first 500 g of degassed water samples were stored in gas free glass bulbs for the production and accumulation of 3he the decay product of 3h after 4 6 months of storage 3he was extracted from each sample and then separated from any other remaining or generated gases by means of a cryogenic system the 3he concentration was determined with the mass spectrometric system described in detail by sültenfuss et al 2009 the specific radioactive activity of 3h is expressed in tritium units tu 0 119 bq kg of h2o in order to make 3h values in groundwater samples comparable to those in precipitation the content of 3h determined in each sample was corrected according to its density enhanced by the high mineralization and then expressed as a concentration in freshwater water sample density and ion molalities used for salt correction of the isotope data were obtained based on their chemical composition using the software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 and the pitzer geochemical database plummer et al 1988 3 3 data processing the statistical treatment of the hydrochemical dataset was performed by means of the software xlstat v 7 5 2 by addinsoft principal component analysis pca was applied to aid interpretation of the hydrochemical response of the spring this method broadly used in karst hydrogeology bakalowicz 1979 mudry and blavoux 1986 reisenhofer et al 1998 hunkeler and mudry 2007 barberá and andreo 2011 sánchez et al 2015 makes it possible to reduce the variance of multidimensional data sets by means of principal components or factors melloul and collin 1992 to identify any significant trend in the natural responses of lower anzur spring during the study period the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was applied to the monthly data series of major dissolved ions ec and t as well as to the series obtained from the hourly records of ec and t this procedure is widely used to assess the existence of chemical trends in hydrological and hydrogeological studies helsel and hirsch 2002 yue and wang 2004 stuart et al 2007 wahlin and grimvall 2010 merchán et al 2013 urresti estala et al 2016 the test statistics τ and s indicate rising trends when positive whereas they reveal downward tendencies if negative the general variation of each parameter was quantified by sen s slope test sen 1968 hirsch et al 1991 it being less affected by major data error or outliers than linear regression methods sen s slope values are expressed as units of the analyzed parameter according to the periodicity of the time series and they were used to calculate the annual trend of each parameter only those analyses with a p value less than or equal to the significance level α of 0 05 were considered statistically significant 4 results 4 1 hydrodynamics the discharge rate of lower anzur spring varied from 1 l s to nearly 100 l s with an average value of approximately 5 l s tab 1 the spring hydrograph fig 2 a shows several floods per year in response to recharge events in general terms discharge peaks were sharp and occurred rapidly a few hours after the onset of rain differences in the magnitude of discharge fluctuations were observed depending on the amount and intensity of rainfall and also on the previous hydrodynamic conditions of the system fig 2 thus the first recharge episodes of each hydrological year october generally gave rise to flow peaks in the order of 30 40 l s while volumes up to 80 90 l s were reached as a response to other significant precipitation events occurring in autumn or winter fig 2a and having a greater magnitude or occurring during recession the corresponding decreases in discharge also took place very quickly whereas slow variations were recorded under depletion conditions the four unitary hydrographs displayed in fig 2 correspond to some of the greatest flood events of the hydrological years 2014 15 and 2015 16 for each the response lag time to the recharge event tl and the flood base time tb were calculated table 2 the first flood fig 2b started under recession conditions three days after a previous flood fig 2a outflow rose up to 80 l s in 19 h tl as a response to 22 mm of precipitation within 24 h recession started slowly afterward but it accelerated below 70 l s the flood base time tb from the beginning of the rising limb to the start of depletion was 4 days two weeks later 9 mm of precipitation caused a discharge peak of 66 l s fig 2c table 2 the tl was 22 h and the recession started rapidly after the peak during the study period the highest discharge value 99 l s was recorded in november 2015 fig 2d table 2 after the heaviest precipitation event registered 43 mm within 6 h the tl was 40 h while tb lasted 6 days the recession limb was gentle during the first three days then started to decrease rapidly after the discharge value reached 67 l s the last unitary hydrograph analyzed fig 2e table 2 had a peak of 51 l s after a 22 hour tl in response to 13 mm and the recession was quick 4 2 hydrochemistry table 1 summarizes the most significant statistical parameters of the physicochemical variables controlled in the lower anzur spring during the study period the clear prevalence of cl and na facies up to 113 6 and 70 0 g l respectively defines the hypersaline nature of the water drained by the outlet with an average ec value of 154 5 ms cm continuous record spring water also presented high mean contents of other ions such as so4 2 ca2 and k while hco3 and mg2 whose presence may be partially linked to evaporitic sources had lower concentrations table 1 the mean value of no3 is 21 mg l although it varied notably cv 91 as did fluorescence peaks a and c cv 36 the continuous record of water temperature ranged from 18 2 c to 21 6 c a few degrees above the mean annual air temperature at the pilot site 17 2 c gil márquez 2018 the time series of the hydrochemical parameters measured in the water drained by lower anzur spring during the study period are displayed in fig 3 together with the spring hydrograph and the daily rainfall recorded in a meteorological station located in the center of jarales area fig 1 great variability of the chemical composition of the spring water under different hydroclimatic situations is observed although generally increasing trends in some of the controlled parameters were also recorded observing depletion periods water mineralization and ec increased from values around 145 ms cm at the end of 2013 to approximately 165 ms cm in the summer of 2017 meanwhile the range of water temperature rose from 20 1 to 20 8 c in hydrological year 2013 14 to 20 4 21 5 c in 2016 17 such variations were statistically analyzed by means of the mann kendall test and sen s slope table 3 upward trends were identified in the series of ec t cl na and k sen s slope indicates that ec rose 4 35 4 59 ms cm annually while t increased between 0 12 c and 0 16 c each year the greatest variation in mineralization was related to the increase of cl 1710 mg year and na 3566 mg year contents the general hydrochemical evolution trends were disrupted in each recharge period by quick and sharp falls in water mineralization the magnitude of these dilutions depends directly on the amount and the intensity of rainfalls figs 3 and 4 variations in ec were clearly determined by changes in cl and na concentrations which evolved analogously to ec in addition so4 2 hco3 mg2 ca2 and k contents followed relatively similar patterns to that of ec whose values decreased during floods fig 3 the temporal evolution of no3 did not follow a clear pattern its concentration showing variable behavior during flood peaks in fact in november 2015 and august 2017 coinciding with great flood events no3 was not detected in the samples probably due to the magnitude of the dilutions water temperature presented slight fluctuations at low water conditions and significant and quick variations as a consequence of the main recharge events characterized by rapid rises followed by lagged pronounced falls fig 3 finally the intensity values of intrinsic fluorescence in the water samples were enhanced during the most significant floods fig 3 in general terms peaks a and c reached values near 20 ru and 12 ru respectively yet in the flood event of august 2017 dilution was accompanied by much greater intensity values peak a rose up to 43 ru and peak c up to 20 5 ru a detailed illustration of the temporal evolution of the spring water chemistry during some significant flood periods is displayed in fig 4 prior to water dilutions and coinciding with the flow rises slight increases in spring ec of up to 6 ms cm were observed fig 4 which were much lower than the subsequent decreases with maximum drops of nearly 40 ms cm november 2015 fig 4 both the hydrodynamic and the hydrochemical responses took place rapidly a few hours after the start of the precipitation event that originated them but there was a lag between flood peaks and dilution peaks fig 4 the latter normally occurred between 1 and 4 days after the former depending on the magnitude of the recharge return to the initial values of ec was much slower than the reestablishment of discharge rate because the flow decrease was prolonged in a time interval of several days while the mineralization recovery could take more than two months after the most pronounced dilutions figs 3 and 4 in turn the water temperature of the spring tended to be higher during flow peaks when slight rises in water mineralization were recorded and it fell as the spring moved into dilution conditions nevertheless the minimum temperature values were reached once mineralization was almost recovered figs 3 and 4 based on the chemical data of the samples taken in lower anzur spring a principal component analysis pca was carried out using the 10 variables in table 4 whose series showed a more continuous series fig 3 the generated correlation matrix reflects a highly positive relationship 0 9 of ec with cl and na and to a lesser extent with hco3 k and mg2 concentrations hco3 is also correlated with cl and na a positive relationship was also determined to a minor degree between each of the following cl na k so4 2 and mg2 the two main factors of the pca explain 71 of the hydrochemical variability of the sample set taken in lower anzur spring fig 5 the first f1 54 93 is defined by ec na and cl which are the main chemical species related to ec and to a lesser extent by hco3 mg2 k and so4 2 fig 5a therefore the first factor reflects water mineralization and residence time inside the aquifer however the variables that determine this factor are distributed in two different groups the first group is situated towards positive values of f2 and is formed by ec na cl and hco3 which are the variables having a higher influence in f1 and k this group would therefore be mainly related to the dissolution of halite nacl sylvite kcl and carbonates the second group has lower f1 values and is shifted to the negative side of f2 it is formed by mg2 so4 2 and ca2 derived mainly from the dissolution of gypsum anhydrite and evaporite minerals bearing mg2 such as epsomite mgso4 7h2o and hexahydrite mgso4 6h2o although the cations could also have their origin in calcite caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 forming the carbonate rocks the second factor f2 16 06 has a positive relationship with water temperature fig 5a which would be tied to drainage of the saturated zone and possibly to the ascent of deep flows given that the spring has a slight positive thermal anomaly fig 5b shows the observations i e water samples in the factorial plane defined by f1 and f2 classified according to the hydrological year and the hydrodynamic state the samples having greater mineralization are located on the positive side of the f1 axis while those related to dilution processes are located on the negative side along with f2 the samples are distributed from top to bottom as their temperature decreases in general terms samples that correspond to depletion situations are well grouped while those related to flood peaks and recessions present greater dispersion in the f1 f2 plane fig 5b waters drained during the spring depletions are characterized by high mineralization relatively low temperatures and the greatest values of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the whole set of observations samples corresponding to floods can be observed in the upper right quarter of fig 5 or scattered throughout its left half finally samples taken during recessions show low mineralization though with much variability and a wide range of temperature values fig 5b additionally the classification of samples according to the hydrological year in the factorial plane allows the year to year hydrochemical evolution of the waters drained by the lower anzur spring to be evaluated the progressive increase of ec and temperature values statistically quantified with the mann kendall test and sen s slope table 3 is again seen in fig 5 mainly in those samples taken during flood events and above all in those taken during depletion times from the first to the last year of observation depletion samples are displaced from the lower right quadrant more related to ca2 mg2 and so4 2 towards upper positions where the variables ec k na cl and hco3 are situated 4 3 isotope data the δ18o and δ2h values of the lower anzur samples respectively ranged between 7 1 and 5 5 and from 40 0 to 33 4 table 1 most samples taken during the summer season figs 3 and 4 when no precipitation was recorded and therefore no recharge existed had δ18o contents very similar to the weighted average of δ18o in the precipitation 5 5 of the study area gil márquez 2018 however groundwater sampled during the greatest floods had lower isotopic values such as in november and december 2016 figs 3 and 4 the isotopic signature of the precipitation events that gave rise to significant spring floods produced a decrease in the δ18o of the spring water yet of more reduced magnitude the samples collected for tritium analysis were taken during diverse hydrodynamic conditions yellow stars in fig 3 sample 1 was taken in september 2014 at the end of the summer depletion sample 2 was collected in october 2014 after the first recharge event of the hydrological year 2014 15 sample 3 coincided with another depletion period september 2015 finally samples 4 and 5 were taken during two different stages of floods a piston flow effect n 4 and a hydrochemical dilution n 5 tritium was found in the five water samples analyzed with values varying from 1 1 to 2 6 tu table 1 slightly lower than the available 3h data of precipitation in the area during the study period between 1 8 and 3 2 tu gil márquez 2018 and the range of 3h in the region 2 4 estimated by the spanish surveillance network of isotopes in precipitation castaño and rodríguez arevalo 2019 which is part of the gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation in fig 6 3h concentrations in the groundwater samples are compared to the corresponding values of flow rate water temperature and ec generally greater 3h values were found when the discharge rate was higher and the water temperature was lower although the relationship is stronger with the second parameter the relation between 3h and ec is less evident but sample n 5 presented a higher isotopic activity and the lowest mineralization and water temperature fig 6b c as it coincided with a hydrochemical dilution fig 3 the other flood sample n 4 was taken coinciding with rises in water temperature and ec and it had the second lowest value of 3h 1 95 tu table 1 this last sample n 4 decreases the correlation between flow rate and 3h fig 6a however the recession stage in the hydrogeological system from dilution flooding to depletion would be accompanied by a progressive decrease in the 3h values figs 5b 6a 5 discussion and interpretation the joint analysis of hydrodynamic hydrochemical hydrothermal and isotopic results described in the above section together with the background information available from previous works gil márquez et al 2017a gil márquez 2018 has provided deeper insights into the structure and flow dynamics within the vertically distributed reservoirs unsaturated and saturated zones found in the evaporite karst system taken as the pilot site the combined treatment of the hydrogeological information also advances our understanding of the storage capacities and residence times of groundwater in the system as well as in the water rock interactions and related hydrogeochemical processes quick rises in the flow rate after recharge events reveal the existence of a highly developed karst network which permits fast flows and short transit time of groundwater within the system from surface points of the epikarst where concentrated infiltration occurs i e swallow holes towards the spring similar behavior has been reported in other evaporite karst settings where allogenic recharge likewise produces rapid hydrodynamic responses calaforra et al 2002 chiesi et al 2010 bruthans et al 2017 d angeli et al 2017 vigna et al 2017 the morphologies of the hydrographs shown in fig 2 are closely related to the maximum flow value drained in each case the two major peaks considered fig 2 b d present a relative flat shape that extends until the flow rate reached values below 70 l s this reference value is higher than those recorded in the other two floods periods fig 2c e with better defined peaks the duration and flattening of the flow peaks coincided with periods in which the endorheic depressions uvala and polje south of the outlet fig 1 where karst swallow holes are located were flooded the decrease in discharge rate occurred more rapidly when the flooding of the swallow holes was finished fig 2 b d coinciding with a specific discharge value of approximetely 70 l s this together with the absence of hydrograph flattening and the lack of flooding in karst depressions for lower flow could suggest that the waterlogging of the swallow holes takes place due to a limitation of the karst network drainage capacity a similar conclusion was deduced after analyzing the results from a multi injection tracer test previously performed in the area gil márquez et al 2017a the existence of a narrow karst conduit network that becomes fully saturated in significant recharge events was inferred from that tracer experiment consequently the flow of recently infiltrated water would be impeded leading to the flooding of the endorheic areas this in turn would produce a sustained recharge over time giving rise to undefined flood peaks which are often related to the existence of overflow springs bonacci and bojanic 1991 barberá and andreo 2011 malard et al 2015 but are also characteristic of springs that are connected to the drainage of poljes bonacci 1993 ford and williams 2007 as is the case here the variations in water mineralization are mainly produced by changes in cl and na contents and to a lesser extent dissolved k they evolve analogously to ec and even present a similar upward trend fig 3 table 3 the positive correlation between both cations and cl table 4 suggests that the source of these chemical species must be related to the existence of halite and sylvite hidalgo and cruz sanjulián 2001 acero et al 2015 on the other hand the so4 2 ca2 mg2 and hco3 time series fig 4 follow patterns relatively similar to that of ec but they did not present an upward trend during the investigation period the origin of so4 2 and ca2 is associated with the dissolution of gypsum which is a part of the clayey evaporite matrix that constitutes the csc though it is also present as massive gypsiferous bodies where karst networks are better developed calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 however so4 2 and ca2 present a poor correlation table 3 indicating that additional sources of one of these ions must exist thus the content of ca2 as well as those of mg2 and hco3 would be linked to the dissolution of the carbonate olistoliths in the jarales area fig 1 additionally the high correlation between hco3 and na and cl indicates that the dissolution of carbonates is somehow related to the concentration of halite derived solutes the observed correlations can be explained by the effect of high ionic strength solutions e g brine water that enhances calcite solubility mucci 1983 appelo and postma 2005 lastly the relatively high correlation between so4 2 and mg2 could be caused not only by the dissolution of evaporite minerals but might also derive from dedolomitization wigley 1973 therefore the first group of variables ec cl na k and hco3 related to f1 in the pca fig 5a would be related to groundwater flowing in deep areas within the saturated zone of the system this is in agreement with the absence of halite and sylvite in outcrops and in explored karst conduits near the surface calaforra et al 2002 aljama martínez 2017 besides this group of variables is situated towards positive values of f2 defined by water temperature the ascent of relative deep flows would explain the positive thermal anomaly observed in the spring water to the contrary the rest of the chemical variables that define f1 so4 2 mg2 and ca2 have a negative factor loading in f2 hence they could proceed from the whole system both saturated and unsaturated zones their presence in groundwater being explained by the dissolution of rocks that are present in surface and at depth records of ec water temperature and most of the main dissolved ions generally showed lower values after recharge events figs 3 and 4 and higher ones during depletion conditions such chemical dilution and water cooling are caused by the arrival of recently infiltrated water through swallow holes as suggested by recent infiltration tracers intrinsic fluorescence of the organic matter from the soil is considered as a natural recharge tracer in carbonate aquifers birdwell and engel 2007 lapworth et al 2009 mudarra et al 2011 the quick rises of a and c fluorescent peaks related to organic matter of edaphic origin during chemical dilutions figs 3 and 4 demonstrate that runoff water infiltrated through karst swallow holes reached the outlet rapidly meanwhile the depletion of δ18o values observed in the spring water in some flood events is smoothed when compared with the isotopic variations of recharge rainwater this indicates the mixing of recently infiltrated water i e via conduit flow with groundwater previously stored in the saturated zone whose isotopic signal is close to that of the weighted mean values of precipitation figs 3 and 4 similarly the rise of the 3h activity registered after the flow peaks sample n 5 figs 2 and 6 with values close to those of precipitation gil márquez 2018 castaño and rodríguez arevalo 2019 in addition to a decrease of water temperature and mineralization is the result of the arrival of infiltrated water through the karst network in turn the temporal evolution of no3 contents observed in the spring water figs 3 and 4 could be related to the seasonal fertilization cycle of the olive orchards the use of n fertilizers in the area partially occurs in autumn and may be linked to the increases of no3 concentration in the floods registered in november 2014 and december 2016 however in other flood events no3 contents vary differently even dilutes the runoff water that infiltrates through the swallow holes would have previously washed out part of the no3 from the soil hence lower or no no3 content is mobilized in subsequent recharge events if no additional fertilization is applied despite no3 having a clear origin at the surface it cannot be properly used as soil tracer without precisely knowing the fertilization practices in the study area however the arrival of recently infiltrated flows to the spring does not occur at the beginning of the floods but after a rise in mineralization the recharge through swallow holes initially mobilized groundwater with higher temperatures up to 3 5 c above the mean annual air temperature and mineralization particularly na cl k and hco3 as deduced from the temporal evolution fig 4 and the pca fig 5 such hydrochemical behavior is associated with a piston flow effect which has been documented in other evaporite karst springs chiesi et al 2010 frank et al 2019 this means that groundwater previously stored in the saturated zone of the system having higher temperature and mineralization is mobilized and drained through the outlet as a consequence of the pressure transfer derived from the hydraulic head rise produced by the recharge event a long water rock interaction within the system under saturated conditions could explain the rise of mineralization as suggested by the observed drop of 3h in piston flow effect sample n 4 figs 2 and 6 an arrival of groundwater recharged before 1953 i e tritium free may have caused the descent of 3h activity at the spring the increase in temperature in turn might be related to the ascending of deeper groundwater flows in a previous tracing experiment gil márquez et al 2017a it was demonstrated that artificial dyes injected at the beginning of the recharge event reached the spring when mineralization and water temperature had begun to decrease after the piston flow effect afterwards the arrival of recently infiltrated groundwater to the spring via the karst conduit network would give rise to the onset of chemical dilution and cooling of the water drained by the lower anzur spring the lag time observed from the flow peaks to the minimum values of mineralization from 2 to 6 days figs 3 and 4 can be attributed to the delay between the pressure head transfer which causes the discharge peak and arrival to the outlet of fresh recharge water from the surface via the karst network leading to dilution of the spring water the lag would also be conditioned by the hydrodynamic state of the system prior to the recharge event the joint representation of the variations of ec and discharge during unitary flood events draws counter clockwise cycles fig 7 that help to understand the functioning of the system drained by the lower anzur spring regardless of the magnitude of the flow peak the initial increase in discharge rate is accompanied by slight rises in ec values accompanied by increases in water temperature figs 3 4 and 7 this process piston flow effect approximately coincides with flow peaks in medium magnitude floods q 35 70 l s like the one observed in february 2016 fig 7 followed by a rapid decrease in mineralization and a more moderate recession in contrast during the greatest flood events with flattened hydrograph peaks q 70 l s like the one registered in november 2015 figs 4 and 7 the discharge rate continued to increase after the piston flow effect yet more gently contrary to ec and temperature values which began to fall this pattern is most likely linked to the flooding of karst depressions hosting swallow holes causing a sustained recharge over time in both flooding events the maximum dilutions occurred during recession much earlier than the minimum value of temperature at depletion when mineralization recovered the initial values on the contrary during the only flood that took place in summer august 2017 the drop in water temperature was slight comparable to that of a winter flood with a lower flow february 2016 though the peak flow was much greater fig 7 the key would lie in the air temperature too high in august to allow cooling of the spring water the decrease in water temperature in the outlet during floods is therefore due to the mixing of groundwater previously stored in the saturated zone with recent infiltrated water and this process is partially dependent on the atmospheric temperature in line with a rapid hydrogeological connection between the recharge area and the outlet the influence of air temperature in spring water was even more marked during the long lasting recharge events that took place when the karst depressions with swallow holes were flooded under such conditions the effect of recharge in the spring water temperature was lagged until the end of the recession as seen for november 2015 december 2016 and august 2017 figs 4 and 7 nonetheless because the groundwater flow slows down towards the end of the recession phase the recently infiltrated water could dissolve higher solute contents given a longer water rock interaction this mechanism together with a drop of the recently infiltrated fraction in the mixed water that is drained permits the recovery of previous ec values much sooner than the water temperature is re established figs 4 and 7 in some carbonate karst springs short delays of the response peaks a few hours of temperature with respect to those of mineralization have been reported birk et al 2006 luhmann et al 2012 mudarra et al 2014 as a consequence of the lag of the heat transfer due to the interaction of water and the conduit walls covington et al 2011 the process occurring in the studied system is rather peculiar however as the recovery of ec started several days or even weeks before the minimum temperature values were registered in the spring water fig 4 interpreted as a consequence of the rapid kinetics of the dissolution of evaporite minerals this may constitute a distinctive feature of evaporitic karst systems at any rate such a complex process deserves investigation in further studies the sustained rise of temperature and mineralization throughout our study period was statistically deduced by means of the mann kendall test and sen s slope table 3 yet it is also visible in the right displacement of the successive ec discharge cycles in fig 7 as well as in the position of depletion and flood samples towards higher values of f1 and f2 in fig 5 during recharge episodes the hydraulic head in the main karst conduits would be higher than in the surrounding matrix this favors the transfer of part of the groundwater flowing through the conduit into the matrix the later drop in the hydraulic head of the conduit network allows groundwater stored in the matrix to flow back towards the conduits after dissolving a greater amount of solutes a similar process has been described in other evaporite karst areas for single flooding events frank et al 2019 but the system drained by the lower anzur spring displays an inter annual trend table 3 in wet periods e g the hydrogeological years from 2009 10 to 2012 13 continuous recharge events would hardly allow the groundwater pushed into the matrix to go back to the conduit in a short time hence the groundwater table would rise in addition the succession of several dry years 2013 14 2016 17 would have caused the descent of annual recharge and therefore more and more groundwater would be displaced from the matrix to the conduits as a result in the mixing drained by the outlet the fraction of water coming from the matrix of the saturated zone would gradually grow which implies longer residence time within the media tritium free higher temperature from relatively deeper areas of the system and mineralization it must be underlined that there is a difference of 1 tu between the two depletion samples fig 6 the fact that the depletion sample collected in 2015 had less 3h activity than the sample of 2014 could be indicative of a higher fraction of older groundwater in the mixing perhaps due to the reduced recharge during the study period this interpretation is in agreement with the positive trends of mineralization and water temperature over a period of dry years the low 3h value measured in 2015 during low water conditions cannot be explained by depleted values of the historical 3h in precipitation gil márquez 2018 and therefore the existence of tritium free groundwater in the system is certain the rise of mineralization is known to be a consequence of the contribution of groundwater flow of greater residence time and is common in karst aquifers featuring evaporite layers wu et al 2009 carucci et al 2012 barbieri et al 2017 bruthans et al 2017 studied different evaporite diapirs drained by brine spring in the zagros mountain range sw iran they found that 3h values were lower in the outlets emplaced in diapirs where diffuse flow predominates whereas 3h activity was higher in diapirs having a well developed exokarst based on lumped parameter models the above authors concluded that groundwater recharged before 1950 dominates in the former type of diapirs the system studied in the present work is quite complex including both conduit and diffuse flow behaviors as suggested by chemical and isotopic data including 3h while conduit flow is related to recent recharge the spring baseflow would be associated with gravity driving regional diffusive flows tóth 1963 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 originated by recharge through permeable outcrops if the average 3h measured in precipitation 2 44 tu is considered to be representative of the younger fraction of the system and the old component has 0 tu the mean 3h activity measured in the spring water 2 00 tu table 1 would indicate that approximately a 20 of the groundwater drained through the spring is old the old fraction would change depending on the hydrodynamic state and could reach 55 explaining the lowest 3h value measured 1 1 tu granted this is a rough estimate based on very simple assumptions further attempts at groundwater dating must be performed involving additional techniques so as to confirm the existence of the old groundwater component evoked and its actual contribution our joint analysis of the results put forth here leads us to characterize the hydrogeological functioning of the system drained by the lower anzur spring and develop the conceptual model displayed in fig 8 it can be defined as a complex karst system in which groundwater flows through conduits but also diffusively through the clayey evaporite matrix where storage mainly resides autogenic recharge can take place in permeable outcrops whereas allogenic infiltration via karst swallow holes plays a relevant role in feeding the system concentrated recharge produces a pressure head transfer that mobilizes groundwater from relatively deep areas in the saturated zone warm mineralized of great residence time producing a piston flow effect the arrival of recently infiltrated groundwater to the outlet favors chemical dilution and cooling of the groundwater drained by the spring when a rainfall event is heavy enough 20 mm the karst network becomes fully saturated and its drainage capacity is surpassed as a consequence runoff accumulates when it reaches the swallow holes meaning a subsequent flooding of the depressions where they are located fig 8 the above process provokes a long lasting recharge whose duration will determine the magnitude of dilutions and the length of spring floods during wet periods the overlap of recharge episodes would cause a situation in which the hydraulic head in the conduit network lies above the general groundwater table in the system the latter given the limited drainage capacity of the conduit network would push the groundwater from the conduits into the surrounding matrix fig 8 in other words dry periods entailing fewer recharge events produce a drop of the hydraulic head and this mobilizes the groundwater stored in the matrix it is pushed back into the conduits but now with higher mineralization and if coming from deeper areas also warmer in addition to the conduit flow there must be a regional component that provides old groundwater recharged before 1953 to the water drained at the outlet which is responsible for the spring base flow observed in depletion times fig 8 it could be traced to autogenic recharge and would flow diffusively towards the outlet the greater residence time of such a groundwater component in the media means a greater dissolution of solutes along its flowpath resulting from a longer water rock interaction than the one produced in conduits 6 conclusions a multi criteria approach combining hydrodynamic hydrochemical and isotopic tools has proven useful to investigate the structure and flow dynamics of evaporite karst aquifers and may be useful in similar settings worldwide the qualitative and statistical analyses pca trend analysis of the time series of discharge rate and physicochemical data for four years together with the information derived from other techniques intrinsic fluorescence stable isotopes tritium determination contributed to a comprehensive knowledge of the functioning of this complex hydrogeological system the advances presented here support a hydrogeological conceptual model to explain the observed hydrological and geochemical processes some unlike those of traditional karst aquifers including a faster geochemical evolution of the recently infiltrated groundwater local and regional flowpaths and interaction between the matrix and conduit network this interpretation highlights the importance of applying several methods in karst studies and particularly in evaporite media as altogether they permit one to focus on different areas and aspects of the systems and then to reinforce the conclusions drawn still additional scientific efforts are needed to acquire in depth knowledge about evaporite karst hydrogeology groundwater dating techniques now being applied shed light on the groundwater flowpath system inferred here so as to quantify residence times and estimate the mixing fractions in the groundwater drained at the lower anzur spring moreover the development of process based karst numerical models makes it possible to simulate the natural response of the system these recent developments in the field will serve to confirm the interpretation presented here

6294,this work adopts a multicriteria approach combining diverse karst hydrogeology techniques to investigate the functioning of evaporite karst systems which are normally less studied due to the poor quality of their water resources the applicability of using several methods was also verified in view of previous experience at a pilot site within southern spain the natural responses of the main discharge point of the system of study lower anzur spring were controlled by continuous monitoring of the discharge rate water temperature and electrical conductivity water samples were collected for chemical analysis and for the determination of intrinsic fluorescence water stable isotopes δ18o δ2h and tritium 3h concentrations physico chemical data were statistically examined applying principal component analysis pca and trend analysis tests mann kendall and sen s slope the system shows a clear karstic functioning highly dependent on concentrated recharge and influenced by a limited drainage capacity of the conduit network the piston flow effects at the beginning of floods indicate a contribution to the drainage of deep ascending flows through the saturated zone subsequent drops in temperature and mineralization values in the water drained by the spring as well as a recent infiltration deduced from the signature of intrinsic fluorescence and stable isotopes point to a good hydrogeological connection from the recharge areas to the spring later restoration of the initial values of mineralization in a much shorter time than those of temperature reveals a faster geochemical evolution of the recently infiltrated groundwater which may be a distinctive trait of evaporite karst aquifers lastly the high solute content of the spring water in depletion conditions with ascending trends of mineralization and temperature observed during several dry years as a consequence of lower recharge contribution together with the tritium activity of selected samples suggest the existence of an old component partly responsible for the spring base flow thus groundwater would be linked to gravity driven regional flows but also to recent conduit flows all the results obtained led us to devise a hydrogeological conceptual model to precisely reflect the functioning of the studied system the results presented here demonstrate the advantages of using diverse techniques when

was monitored for four hydrological years september 2013 october 2017 as a pilot site to investigate the hydrogeological behavior of evaporite karst systems in temperate climatic conditions this outlet has significant environmental and social implications as it drains groundwater with high solute content annually transporting about 20 000 tons of nacl gil márquez 2018 the water drained by the spring together with the surface runoff water flowing into the nearby anzur river is retained by a dam some 15 km downstream consequently the reservoir water is brackish and cannot be used for urban supply only for energy generation and irrigation purposes there are moreover several endorheic areas in the catchment area of the pilot evaporitic system many constituting ephemeral lakes and groundwater dependent wetlands of variable size but of great environmental value some listed in the ramsar convention of wetlands on the whole the system drained by the lower anzur spring is of vast scientific interest given its geological and geomorphological characteristics with diverse lithologies and chaotic structure which determine its hydrogeological complexity including diffuse and

southern cordoba province andalusia spain the genil southwards and its tributary the anzur to the north the area ranges from 250 to 450 m a s l and the land is predominantly covered by extensive olive orchards characterized by bare soil the prevailing climate is temperate mediterranean with an uneven annual rainfall distribution mainly taking place from autumn to spring very often stormy the mean air temperature in jarales is 17 2 c while the historic annual rainfall 1963 64 to 2015 16 amounts to 508 mm gil márquez 2018 during the study period between the hydrological years 2013 14 and 2016 17 the annual precipitation ranged from 324 mm in 2014 15 to 403 mm in 2015 16 thus our research was carried out in clearly dry years though the previous ones were quite wet with up to 821 annual rainfall in 2012 13 and 913 mm in 2009 10 gil márquez 2018 from the geological standpoint the jarales area belongs to the chaotic subbetic complex csc a geological unit that extends along the northern sector of the so called subbetic domain in the betic cordillera the csc is essentially a megabreccia made up of multi colored triassic keuper clays and evaporite rocks gypsum anhydrite and halite in addition to blocks of other ages and diverse lithology including triassic and jurassic carbonates cretaceous marls and miocene sandstones vera and martín algarra 2004 gypsum can be found as massive rock or forming polygenic breccias though halite is absent at the surface as a consequence of its high solubility its existence at depth is deduced from the existence of brine springs draining the evaporitic system andreo et al 2016 as well as from some exploration boreholes carrasco 1986 calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 the csc underwent massive gravitational displacement during alpine orogeny and is consequently highly deformed pérez lópez and sanz de galdeano 1994 the original stratigraphic relationships are therefore seldom preserved from a geomorphological standpoint the study site is characterized by gentle hills a poorly defined drainage network and the existence of karst landforms related to the dissolution of evaporite rocks the most remarkable exo karst features are endorheic areas closed depressions some of which host wetlands of diverse size fig 1 and variable hydroperiod i e flooding duration as a result of hydraulic interactions with the subsurface water table in the northern sector of the study area the karst depressions are naturally drained through swallow holes fig 1 although their drainage capacity is limited giving rise to occasional flooding during wet periods gil márquez et al 2017a besides direct infiltration of runoff into swallow holes recharge is also produced by diffuse infiltration of rainwater through permeable outcrops gypsum carbonate rocks and probably through the bottom of wetlands and other endorheic depressions andreo et al 2016 gil márquez 2018 given the abundance of clay lithologies the csc presents a general aquitard behavior and groundwater predominantly flows within a diffuse type system based on water local table measurements flow lines are drawn in a radial divergent pattern from the central part of the plateau at higher positions to its borders fig 1 at lower ones thus natural discharge takes place via springs located close to the anzur and genil rivers although groundwater discharge is related to a diffuse flow system the outlets also show quick natural responses to recharge that are characteristic of karst aquifers this is even more remarkable in the lower anzur spring where a high variability of discharge rate and physico chemical components has been registered gil márquez 2018 a dye tracer test performed in 2016 gil márquez et al 2017a demonstrated the hydraulic connection between two karst swallow holes and the outlet fig 1 with a maximum flow velocity of 192 m h additionally the alignment of karst features along the n s direction suggests a high development of the conduit network in the northern part of the system making possible a hydrogeological connection between other karst depressions and the lower anzur spring 3 methods 3 1 field measurement and sampling a gauging station with a 60 v notch weir was equipped in the lower anzur spring hourly records of water temperature t electrical conductivity ec and water level variations in the spring were registered from february 2014 to september 2017 ec and t were logged using a wtw 350i multi parameter measuring instrument while water level lectures were recorded by an odyssey depth and temperature data logger 1 mm accuracy for the continuous discharge record the evolution of discharge rate was obtained by applying the rating curve of the gauging station gil márquez 2018 to the water level variation series occasionally rises in the anzur river produced complete flooding of the outlet area the runoff effect on the spring gauging station was deleted thanks to the flow rate data series registered 600 m upstream in the anzur river fig 1 by the automatic hydrologic information system saih of the guadalquivir river basin authority in situ measurements of discharge rate ott c2 flow meter ec and t wtw cond 3310 were also carried out in the lower anzur spring from september 2013 until the end of the study period the measurement accuracies were 2 for flow rate 0 1 ms cm for ec and 0 1 c for water temperature concurrently water samples 132 were collected in 150 ml amber glass bottles for subsequent chemical and isotopic analyses in the laboratory measurement and sampling periodicity were adapted to the hydrological conditions of the system recharge recession depletion from several times per day in high flow conditions to monthly during depletion periods additionally five spring water samples were taken in 1 litre pet bottles for tritium determination from september 2014 to december 2016 under diverse hydrodynamic conditions 3 2 analytical methods samples were mainly processed in the laboratory of the centre of hydrogeology of the university of malaga cehiuma hco3 was determined by volumetric titration with 0 02 n h2so4 to ph 4 45 metrohm 888 titrando major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 no3 were analyzed using high pressure liquid chromatography hplc metrohm compact 930 ic flex for cations and metrohm compact 881 ic pro for anions with 2 accuracy due to their high solute content samples were diluted to 1 ms cm and filtered 0 45 µm millipore filters before their introduction in the system filter in line and precolumn filter the accuracy of the chemical data was checked using the charge balance error cbe calculated as the difference among the sums of the equivalent concentrations of anions and cations σcations σanions divided by the sum of equivalent concentrations of all ions σcations σanions the mean cbe value for the whole sample set was 2 5 and samples with cbe outside 5 were discarded intrinsic fluorescence of samples is produced by dissolved organic matter and its presence in groundwater allows one to study recharge in karst aquifers birdwell and engel 2007 it was analyzed using a perkin elmer ls55 spectrofluorometer the excitation emission matrices eems were obtained by means of the simultaneous scan of excitation and emission wavelengths from 200 to 350 and from 250 to 550 nm respectively with intervals of 5 nm in both cases a 5 nm slit was used with a scanning rate of 500 nm min the raman peak of deionized water measured at an excitation wavelength of 348 nm and with emission monitored at 390 395 nm was used to determine the stability of the instrument lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the maximum fluorescence intensity of each peak was therefore referred to as raman units ru peak a produced by humic acids appears between 230 and 250 nm excitation wavelengths and from 405 to 445 nm emission wavelengths whereas peak c related to fulvic acids is found between excitation wavelengths 300 335 nm and emission wavelengths 400 440 nm water isotopes δ18o and δ2h were determined by means of isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms in the central laboratory of the university of malaga scai corrected data were referred to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow due to the fractionation between free water molecules and those associated with the hydration sphere of cations in water solution the isotope activity ratios of brine samples differ from their isotope concentration ratios taube 1954 horita 1989 hence δ18o and δ2h data were converted from activity scale to concentration scale by applying the activity correction defined by sofer and gat 1972 1975 δ δ 2 h m n a c l 0 4 m m g c l 2 5 1 m c a c l 2 6 1 m k c l 2 4 δ δ 18 o m m g c l 2 1 11 m c a c l 2 0 47 m k c l 0 16 where m is the molality of the respective ions and δδ18o and δδ2h are the activity corrections which are the differences between the δ values on the concentration scale and those on the activity scale tritium 3h analysis was carried out in the department of oceanography of the institute of environmental physics university of bremen based on the 3he ingrowth method clarke et al 1976 first 500 g of degassed water samples were stored in gas free glass bulbs for the production and accumulation of 3he the decay product of 3h after 4 6 months of storage 3he was extracted from each sample and then separated from any other remaining or generated gases by means of a cryogenic system the 3he concentration was determined with the mass spectrometric system described in detail by sültenfuss et al 2009 the specific radioactive activity of 3h is expressed in tritium units tu 0 119 bq kg of h2o in order to make 3h values in groundwater samples comparable to those in precipitation the content of 3h determined in each sample was corrected according to its density enhanced by the high mineralization and then expressed as a concentration in freshwater water sample density and ion molalities used for salt correction of the isotope data were obtained based on their chemical composition using the software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 and the pitzer geochemical database plummer et al 1988 3 3 data processing the statistical treatment of the hydrochemical dataset was performed by means of the software xlstat v 7 5 2 by addinsoft principal component analysis pca was applied to aid interpretation of the hydrochemical response of the spring this method broadly used in karst hydrogeology bakalowicz 1979 mudry and blavoux 1986 reisenhofer et al 1998 hunkeler and mudry 2007 barberá and andreo 2011 sánchez et al 2015 makes it possible to reduce the variance of multidimensional data sets by means of principal components or factors melloul and collin 1992 to identify any significant trend in the natural responses of lower anzur spring during the study period the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was applied to the monthly data series of major dissolved ions ec and t as well as to the series obtained from the hourly records of ec and t this procedure is widely used to assess the existence of chemical trends in hydrological and hydrogeological studies helsel and hirsch 2002 yue and wang 2004 stuart et al 2007 wahlin and grimvall 2010 merchán et al 2013 urresti estala et al 2016 the test statistics τ and s indicate rising trends when positive whereas they reveal downward tendencies if negative the general variation of each parameter was quantified by sen s slope test sen 1968 hirsch et al 1991 it being less affected by major data error or outliers than linear regression methods sen s slope values are expressed as units of the analyzed parameter according to the periodicity of the time series and they were used to calculate the annual trend of each parameter only those analyses with a p value less than or equal to the significance level α of 0 05 were considered statistically significant 4 results 4 1 hydrodynamics the discharge rate of lower anzur spring varied from 1 l s to nearly 100 l s with an average value of approximately 5 l s tab 1 the spring hydrograph fig 2 a shows several floods per year in response to recharge events in general terms discharge peaks were sharp and occurred rapidly a few hours after the onset of rain differences in the magnitude of discharge fluctuations were observed depending on the amount and intensity of rainfall and also on the previous hydrodynamic conditions of the system fig 2 thus the first recharge episodes of each hydrological year october generally gave rise to flow peaks in the order of 30 40 l s while volumes up to 80 90 l s were reached as a response to other significant precipitation events occurring in autumn or winter fig 2a and having a greater magnitude or occurring during recession the corresponding decreases in discharge also took place very quickly whereas slow variations were recorded under depletion conditions the four unitary hydrographs displayed in fig 2 correspond to some of the greatest flood events of the hydrological years 2014 15 and 2015 16 for each the response lag time to the recharge event tl and the flood base time tb were calculated table 2 the first flood fig 2b started under recession conditions three days after a previous flood fig 2a outflow rose up to 80 l s in 19 h tl as a response to 22 mm of precipitation within 24 h recession started slowly afterward but it accelerated below 70 l s the flood base time tb from the beginning of the rising limb to the start of depletion was 4 days two weeks later 9 mm of precipitation caused a discharge peak of 66 l s fig 2c table 2 the tl was 22 h and the recession started rapidly after the peak during the study period the highest discharge value 99 l s was recorded in november 2015 fig 2d table 2 after the heaviest precipitation event registered 43 mm within 6 h the tl was 40 h while tb lasted 6 days the recession limb was gentle during the first three days then started to decrease rapidly after the discharge value reached 67 l s the last unitary hydrograph analyzed fig 2e table 2 had a peak of 51 l s after a 22 hour tl in response to 13 mm and the recession was quick 4 2 hydrochemistry table 1 summarizes the most significant statistical parameters of the physicochemical variables controlled in the lower anzur spring during the study period the clear prevalence of cl and na facies up to 113 6 and 70 0 g l respectively defines the hypersaline nature of the water drained by the outlet with an average ec value of 154 5 ms cm continuous record spring water also presented high mean contents of other ions such as so4 2 ca2 and k while hco3 and mg2 whose presence may be partially linked to evaporitic sources had lower concentrations table 1 the mean value of no3 is 21 mg l although it varied notably cv 91 as did fluorescence peaks a and c cv 36 the continuous record of water temperature ranged from 18 2 c to 21 6 c a few degrees above the mean annual air temperature at the pilot site 17 2 c gil márquez 2018 the time series of the hydrochemical parameters measured in the water drained by lower anzur spring during the study period are displayed in fig 3 together with the spring hydrograph and the daily rainfall recorded in a meteorological station located in the center of jarales area fig 1 great variability of the chemical composition of the spring water under different hydroclimatic situations is observed although generally increasing trends in some of the controlled parameters were also recorded observing depletion periods water mineralization and ec increased from values around 145 ms cm at the end of 2013 to approximately 165 ms cm in the summer of 2017 meanwhile the range of water temperature rose from 20 1 to 20 8 c in hydrological year 2013 14 to 20 4 21 5 c in 2016 17 such variations were statistically analyzed by means of the mann kendall test and sen s slope table 3 upward trends were identified in the series of ec t cl na and k sen s slope indicates that ec rose 4 35 4 59 ms cm annually while t increased between 0 12 c and 0 16 c each year the greatest variation in mineralization was related to the increase of cl 1710 mg year and na 3566 mg year contents the general hydrochemical evolution trends were disrupted in each recharge period by quick and sharp falls in water mineralization the magnitude of these dilutions depends directly on the amount and the intensity of rainfalls figs 3 and 4 variations in ec were clearly determined by changes in cl and na concentrations which evolved analogously to ec in addition so4 2 hco3 mg2 ca2 and k contents followed relatively similar patterns to that of ec whose values decreased during floods fig 3 the temporal evolution of no3 did not follow a clear pattern its concentration showing variable behavior during flood peaks in fact in november 2015 and august 2017 coinciding with great flood events no3 was not detected in the samples probably due to the magnitude of the dilutions water temperature presented slight fluctuations at low water conditions and significant and quick variations as a consequence of the main recharge events characterized by rapid rises followed by lagged pronounced falls fig 3 finally the intensity values of intrinsic fluorescence in the water samples were enhanced during the most significant floods fig 3 in general terms peaks a and c reached values near 20 ru and 12 ru respectively yet in the flood event of august 2017 dilution was accompanied by much greater intensity values peak a rose up to 43 ru and peak c up to 20 5 ru a detailed illustration of the temporal evolution of the spring water chemistry during some significant flood periods is displayed in fig 4 prior to water dilutions and coinciding with the flow rises slight increases in spring ec of up to 6 ms cm were observed fig 4 which were much lower than the subsequent decreases with maximum drops of nearly 40 ms cm november 2015 fig 4 both the hydrodynamic and the hydrochemical responses took place rapidly a few hours after the start of the precipitation event that originated them but there was a lag between flood peaks and dilution peaks fig 4 the latter normally occurred between 1 and 4 days after the former depending on the magnitude of the recharge return to the initial values of ec was much slower than the reestablishment of discharge rate because the flow decrease was prolonged in a time interval of several days while the mineralization recovery could take more than two months after the most pronounced dilutions figs 3 and 4 in turn the water temperature of the spring tended to be higher during flow peaks when slight rises in water mineralization were recorded and it fell as the spring moved into dilution conditions nevertheless the minimum temperature values were reached once mineralization was almost recovered figs 3 and 4 based on the chemical data of the samples taken in lower anzur spring a principal component analysis pca was carried out using the 10 variables in table 4 whose series showed a more continuous series fig 3 the generated correlation matrix reflects a highly positive relationship 0 9 of ec with cl and na and to a lesser extent with hco3 k and mg2 concentrations hco3 is also correlated with cl and na a positive relationship was also determined to a minor degree between each of the following cl na k so4 2 and mg2 the two main factors of the pca explain 71 of the hydrochemical variability of the sample set taken in lower anzur spring fig 5 the first f1 54 93 is defined by ec na and cl which are the main chemical species related to ec and to a lesser extent by hco3 mg2 k and so4 2 fig 5a therefore the first factor reflects water mineralization and residence time inside the aquifer however the variables that determine this factor are distributed in two different groups the first group is situated towards positive values of f2 and is formed by ec na cl and hco3 which are the variables having a higher influence in f1 and k this group would therefore be mainly related to the dissolution of halite nacl sylvite kcl and carbonates the second group has lower f1 values and is shifted to the negative side of f2 it is formed by mg2 so4 2 and ca2 derived mainly from the dissolution of gypsum anhydrite and evaporite minerals bearing mg2 such as epsomite mgso4 7h2o and hexahydrite mgso4 6h2o although the cations could also have their origin in calcite caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 forming the carbonate rocks the second factor f2 16 06 has a positive relationship with water temperature fig 5a which would be tied to drainage of the saturated zone and possibly to the ascent of deep flows given that the spring has a slight positive thermal anomaly fig 5b shows the observations i e water samples in the factorial plane defined by f1 and f2 classified according to the hydrological year and the hydrodynamic state the samples having greater mineralization are located on the positive side of the f1 axis while those related to dilution processes are located on the negative side along with f2 the samples are distributed from top to bottom as their temperature decreases in general terms samples that correspond to depletion situations are well grouped while those related to flood peaks and recessions present greater dispersion in the f1 f2 plane fig 5b waters drained during the spring depletions are characterized by high mineralization relatively low temperatures and the greatest values of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the whole set of observations samples corresponding to floods can be observed in the upper right quarter of fig 5 or scattered throughout its left half finally samples taken during recessions show low mineralization though with much variability and a wide range of temperature values fig 5b additionally the classification of samples according to the hydrological year in the factorial plane allows the year to year hydrochemical evolution of the waters drained by the lower anzur spring to be evaluated the progressive increase of ec and temperature values statistically quantified with the mann kendall test and sen s slope table 3 is again seen in fig 5 mainly in those samples taken during flood events and above all in those taken during depletion times from the first to the last year of observation depletion samples are displaced from the lower right quadrant more related to ca2 mg2 and so4 2 towards upper positions where the variables ec k na cl and hco3 are situated 4 3 isotope data the δ18o and δ2h values of the lower anzur samples respectively ranged between 7 1 and 5 5 and from 40 0 to 33 4 table 1 most samples taken during the summer season figs 3 and 4 when no precipitation was recorded and therefore no recharge existed had δ18o contents very similar to the weighted average of δ18o in the precipitation 5 5 of the study area gil márquez 2018 however groundwater sampled during the greatest floods had lower isotopic values such as in november and december 2016 figs 3 and 4 the isotopic signature of the precipitation events that gave rise to significant spring floods produced a decrease in the δ18o of the spring water yet of more reduced magnitude the samples collected for tritium analysis were taken during diverse hydrodynamic conditions yellow stars in fig 3 sample 1 was taken in september 2014 at the end of the summer depletion sample 2 was collected in october 2014 after the first recharge event of the hydrological year 2014 15 sample 3 coincided with another depletion period september 2015 finally samples 4 and 5 were taken during two different stages of floods a piston flow effect n 4 and a hydrochemical dilution n 5 tritium was found in the five water samples analyzed with values varying from 1 1 to 2 6 tu table 1 slightly lower than the available 3h data of precipitation in the area during the study period between 1 8 and 3 2 tu gil márquez 2018 and the range of 3h in the region 2 4 estimated by the spanish surveillance network of isotopes in precipitation castaño and rodríguez arevalo 2019 which is part of the gnip global network of isotopes in precipitation in fig 6 3h concentrations in the groundwater samples are compared to the corresponding values of flow rate water temperature and ec generally greater 3h values were found when the discharge rate was higher and the water temperature was lower although the relationship is stronger with the second parameter the relation between 3h and ec is less evident but sample n 5 presented a higher isotopic activity and the lowest mineralization and water temperature fig 6b c as it coincided with a hydrochemical dilution fig 3 the other flood sample n 4 was taken coinciding with rises in water temperature and ec and it had the second lowest value of 3h 1 95 tu table 1 this last sample n 4 decreases the correlation between flow rate and 3h fig 6a however the recession stage in the hydrogeological system from dilution flooding to depletion would be accompanied by a progressive decrease in the 3h values figs 5b 6a 5 discussion and interpretation the joint analysis of hydrodynamic hydrochemical hydrothermal and isotopic results described in the above section together with the background information available from previous works gil márquez et al 2017a gil márquez 2018 has provided deeper insights into the structure and flow dynamics within the vertically distributed reservoirs unsaturated and saturated zones found in the evaporite karst system taken as the pilot site the combined treatment of the hydrogeological information also advances our understanding of the storage capacities and residence times of groundwater in the system as well as in the water rock interactions and related hydrogeochemical processes quick rises in the flow rate after recharge events reveal the existence of a highly developed karst network which permits fast flows and short transit time of groundwater within the system from surface points of the epikarst where concentrated infiltration occurs i e swallow holes towards the spring similar behavior has been reported in other evaporite karst settings where allogenic recharge likewise produces rapid hydrodynamic responses calaforra et al 2002 chiesi et al 2010 bruthans et al 2017 d angeli et al 2017 vigna et al 2017 the morphologies of the hydrographs shown in fig 2 are closely related to the maximum flow value drained in each case the two major peaks considered fig 2 b d present a relative flat shape that extends until the flow rate reached values below 70 l s this reference value is higher than those recorded in the other two floods periods fig 2c e with better defined peaks the duration and flattening of the flow peaks coincided with periods in which the endorheic depressions uvala and polje south of the outlet fig 1 where karst swallow holes are located were flooded the decrease in discharge rate occurred more rapidly when the flooding of the swallow holes was finished fig 2 b d coinciding with a specific discharge value of approximetely 70 l s this together with the absence of hydrograph flattening and the lack of flooding in karst depressions for lower flow could suggest that the waterlogging of the swallow holes takes place due to a limitation of the karst network drainage capacity a similar conclusion was deduced after analyzing the results from a multi injection tracer test previously performed in the area gil márquez et al 2017a the existence of a narrow karst conduit network that becomes fully saturated in significant recharge events was inferred from that tracer experiment consequently the flow of recently infiltrated water would be impeded leading to the flooding of the endorheic areas this in turn would produce a sustained recharge over time giving rise to undefined flood peaks which are often related to the existence of overflow springs bonacci and bojanic 1991 barberá and andreo 2011 malard et al 2015 but are also characteristic of springs that are connected to the drainage of poljes bonacci 1993 ford and williams 2007 as is the case here the variations in water mineralization are mainly produced by changes in cl and na contents and to a lesser extent dissolved k they evolve analogously to ec and even present a similar upward trend fig 3 table 3 the positive correlation between both cations and cl table 4 suggests that the source of these chemical species must be related to the existence of halite and sylvite hidalgo and cruz sanjulián 2001 acero et al 2015 on the other hand the so4 2 ca2 mg2 and hco3 time series fig 4 follow patterns relatively similar to that of ec but they did not present an upward trend during the investigation period the origin of so4 2 and ca2 is associated with the dissolution of gypsum which is a part of the clayey evaporite matrix that constitutes the csc though it is also present as massive gypsiferous bodies where karst networks are better developed calaforra and pulido bosch 1999 however so4 2 and ca2 present a poor correlation table 3 indicating that additional sources of one of these ions must exist thus the content of ca2 as well as those of mg2 and hco3 would be linked to the dissolution of the carbonate olistoliths in the jarales area fig 1 additionally the high correlation between hco3 and na and cl indicates that the dissolution of carbonates is somehow related to the concentration of halite derived solutes the observed correlations can be explained by the effect of high ionic strength solutions e g brine water that enhances calcite solubility mucci 1983 appelo and postma 2005 lastly the relatively high correlation between so4 2 and mg2 could be caused not only by the dissolution of evaporite minerals but might also derive from dedolomitization wigley 1973 therefore the first group of variables ec cl na k and hco3 related to f1 in the pca fig 5a would be related to groundwater flowing in deep areas within the saturated zone of the system this is in agreement with the absence of halite and sylvite in outcrops and in explored karst conduits near the surface calaforra et al 2002 aljama martínez 2017 besides this group of variables is situated towards positive values of f2 defined by water temperature the ascent of relative deep flows would explain the positive thermal anomaly observed in the spring water to the contrary the rest of the chemical variables that define f1 so4 2 mg2 and ca2 have a negative factor loading in f2 hence they could proceed from the whole system both saturated and unsaturated zones their presence in groundwater being explained by the dissolution of rocks that are present in surface and at depth records of ec water temperature and most of the main dissolved ions generally showed lower values after recharge events figs 3 and 4 and higher ones during depletion conditions such chemical dilution and water cooling are caused by the arrival of recently infiltrated water through swallow holes as suggested by recent infiltration tracers intrinsic fluorescence of the organic matter from the soil is considered as a natural recharge tracer in carbonate aquifers birdwell and engel 2007 lapworth et al 2009 mudarra et al 2011 the quick rises of a and c fluorescent peaks related to organic matter of edaphic origin during chemical dilutions figs 3 and 4 demonstrate that runoff water infiltrated through karst swallow holes reached the outlet rapidly meanwhile the depletion of δ18o values observed in the spring water in some flood events is smoothed when compared with the isotopic variations of recharge rainwater this indicates the mixing of recently infiltrated water i e via conduit flow with groundwater previously stored in the saturated zone whose isotopic signal is close to that of the weighted mean values of precipitation figs 3 and 4 similarly the rise of the 3h activity registered after the flow peaks sample n 5 figs 2 and 6 with values close to those of precipitation gil márquez 2018 castaño and rodríguez arevalo 2019 in addition to a decrease of water temperature and mineralization is the result of the arrival of infiltrated water through the karst network in turn the temporal evolution of no3 contents observed in the spring water figs 3 and 4 could be related to the seasonal fertilization cycle of the olive orchards the use of n fertilizers in the area partially occurs in autumn and may be linked to the increases of no3 concentration in the floods registered in november 2014 and december 2016 however in other flood events no3 contents vary differently even dilutes the runoff water that infiltrates through the swallow holes would have previously washed out part of the no3 from the soil hence lower or no no3 content is mobilized in subsequent recharge events if no additional fertilization is applied despite no3 having a clear origin at the surface it cannot be properly used as soil tracer without precisely knowing the fertilization practices in the study area however the arrival of recently infiltrated flows to the spring does not occur at the beginning of the floods but after a rise in mineralization the recharge through swallow holes initially mobilized groundwater with higher temperatures up to 3 5 c above the mean annual air temperature and mineralization particularly na cl k and hco3 as deduced from the temporal evolution fig 4 and the pca fig 5 such hydrochemical behavior is associated with a piston flow effect which has been documented in other evaporite karst springs chiesi et al 2010 frank et al 2019 this means that groundwater previously stored in the saturated zone of the system having higher temperature and mineralization is mobilized and drained through the outlet as a consequence of the pressure transfer derived from the hydraulic head rise produced by the recharge event a long water rock interaction within the system under saturated conditions could explain the rise of mineralization as suggested by the observed drop of 3h in piston flow effect sample n 4 figs 2 and 6 an arrival of groundwater recharged before 1953 i e tritium free may have caused the descent of 3h activity at the spring the increase in temperature in turn might be related to the ascending of deeper groundwater flows in a previous tracing experiment gil márquez et al 2017a it was demonstrated that artificial dyes injected at the beginning of the recharge event reached the spring when mineralization and water temperature had begun to decrease after the piston flow effect afterwards the arrival of recently infiltrated groundwater to the spring via the karst conduit network would give rise to the onset of chemical dilution and cooling of the water drained by the lower anzur spring the lag time observed from the flow peaks to the minimum values of mineralization from 2 to 6 days figs 3 and 4 can be attributed to the delay between the pressure head transfer which causes the discharge peak and arrival to the outlet of fresh recharge water from the surface via the karst network leading to dilution of the spring water the lag would also be conditioned by the hydrodynamic state of the system prior to the recharge event the joint representation of the variations of ec and discharge during unitary flood events draws counter clockwise cycles fig 7 that help to understand the functioning of the system drained by the lower anzur spring regardless of the magnitude of the flow peak the initial increase in discharge rate is accompanied by slight rises in ec values accompanied by increases in water temperature figs 3 4 and 7 this process piston flow effect approximately coincides with flow peaks in medium magnitude floods q 35 70 l s like the one observed in february 2016 fig 7 followed by a rapid decrease in mineralization and a more moderate recession in contrast during the greatest flood events with flattened hydrograph peaks q 70 l s like the one registered in november 2015 figs 4 and 7 the discharge rate continued to increase after the piston flow effect yet more gently contrary to ec and temperature values which began to fall this pattern is most likely linked to the flooding of karst depressions hosting swallow holes causing a sustained recharge over time in both flooding events the maximum dilutions occurred during recession much earlier than the minimum value of temperature at depletion when mineralization recovered the initial values on the contrary during the only flood that took place in summer august 2017 the drop in water temperature was slight comparable to that of a winter flood with a lower flow february 2016 though the peak flow was much greater fig 7 the key would lie in the air temperature too high in august to allow cooling of the spring water the decrease in water temperature in the outlet during floods is therefore due to the mixing of groundwater previously stored in the saturated zone with recent infiltrated water and this process is partially dependent on the atmospheric temperature in line with a rapid hydrogeological connection between the recharge area and the outlet the influence of air temperature in spring water was even more marked during the long lasting recharge events that took place when the karst depressions with swallow holes were flooded under such conditions the effect of recharge in the spring water temperature was lagged until the end of the recession as seen for november 2015 december 2016 and august 2017 figs 4 and 7 nonetheless because the groundwater flow slows down towards the end of the recession phase the recently infiltrated water could dissolve higher solute contents given a longer water rock interaction this mechanism together with a drop of the recently infiltrated fraction in the mixed water that is drained permits the recovery of previous ec values much sooner than the water temperature is re established figs 4 and 7 in some carbonate karst springs short delays of the response peaks a few hours of temperature with respect to those of mineralization have been reported birk et al 2006 luhmann et al 2012 mudarra et al 2014 as a consequence of the lag of the heat transfer due to the interaction of water and the conduit walls covington et al 2011 the process occurring in the studied system is rather peculiar however as the recovery of ec started several days or even weeks before the minimum temperature values were registered in the spring water fig 4 interpreted as a consequence of the rapid kinetics of the dissolution of evaporite minerals this may constitute a distinctive feature of evaporitic karst systems at any rate such a complex process deserves investigation in further studies the sustained rise of temperature and mineralization throughout our study period was statistically deduced by means of the mann kendall test and sen s slope table 3 yet it is also visible in the right displacement of the successive ec discharge cycles in fig 7 as well as in the position of depletion and flood samples towards higher values of f1 and f2 in fig 5 during recharge episodes the hydraulic head in the main karst conduits would be higher than in the surrounding matrix this favors the transfer of part of the groundwater flowing through the conduit into the matrix the later drop in the hydraulic head of the conduit network allows groundwater stored in the matrix to flow back towards the conduits after dissolving a greater amount of solutes a similar process has been described in other evaporite karst areas for single flooding events frank et al 2019 but the system drained by the lower anzur spring displays an inter annual trend table 3 in wet periods e g the hydrogeological years from 2009 10 to 2012 13 continuous recharge events would hardly allow the groundwater pushed into the matrix to go back to the conduit in a short time hence the groundwater table would rise in addition the succession of several dry years 2013 14 2016 17 would have caused the descent of annual recharge and therefore more and more groundwater would be displaced from the matrix to the conduits as a result in the mixing drained by the outlet the fraction of water coming from the matrix of the saturated zone would gradually grow which implies longer residence time within the media tritium free higher temperature from relatively deeper areas of the system and mineralization it must be underlined that there is a difference of 1 tu between the two depletion samples fig 6 the fact that the depletion sample collected in 2015 had less 3h activity than the sample of 2014 could be indicative of a higher fraction of older groundwater in the mixing perhaps due to the reduced recharge during the study period this interpretation is in agreement with the positive trends of mineralization and water temperature over a period of dry years the low 3h value measured in 2015 during low water conditions cannot be explained by depleted values of the historical 3h in precipitation gil márquez 2018 and therefore the existence of tritium free groundwater in the system is certain the rise of mineralization is known to be a consequence of the contribution of groundwater flow of greater residence time and is common in karst aquifers featuring evaporite layers wu et al 2009 carucci et al 2012 barbieri et al 2017 bruthans et al 2017 studied different evaporite diapirs drained by brine spring in the zagros mountain range sw iran they found that 3h values were lower in the outlets emplaced in diapirs where diffuse flow predominates whereas 3h activity was higher in diapirs having a well developed exokarst based on lumped parameter models the above authors concluded that groundwater recharged before 1950 dominates in the former type of diapirs the system studied in the present work is quite complex including both conduit and diffuse flow behaviors as suggested by chemical and isotopic data including 3h while conduit flow is related to recent recharge the spring baseflow would be associated with gravity driving regional diffusive flows tóth 1963 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 originated by recharge through permeable outcrops if the average 3h measured in precipitation 2 44 tu is considered to be representative of the younger fraction of the system and the old component has 0 tu the mean 3h activity measured in the spring water 2 00 tu table 1 would indicate that approximately a 20 of the groundwater drained through the spring is old the old fraction would change depending on the hydrodynamic state and could reach 55 explaining the lowest 3h value measured 1 1 tu granted this is a rough estimate based on very simple assumptions further attempts at groundwater dating must be performed involving additional techniques so as to confirm the existence of the old groundwater component evoked and its actual contribution our joint analysis of the results put forth here leads us to characterize the hydrogeological functioning of the system drained by the lower anzur spring and develop the conceptual model displayed in fig 8 it can be defined as a complex karst system in which groundwater flows through conduits but also diffusively through the clayey evaporite matrix where storage mainly resides autogenic recharge can take place in permeable outcrops whereas allogenic infiltration via karst swallow holes plays a relevant role in feeding the system concentrated recharge produces a pressure head transfer that mobilizes groundwater from relatively deep areas in the saturated zone warm mineralized of great residence time producing a piston flow effect the arrival of recently infiltrated groundwater to the outlet favors chemical dilution and cooling of the groundwater drained by the spring when a rainfall event is heavy enough 20 mm the karst network becomes fully saturated and its drainage capacity is surpassed as a consequence runoff accumulates when it reaches the swallow holes meaning a subsequent flooding of the depressions where they are located fig 8 the above process provokes a long lasting recharge whose duration will determine the magnitude of dilutions and the length of spring floods during wet periods the overlap of recharge episodes would cause a situation in which the hydraulic head in the conduit network lies above the general groundwater table in the system the latter given the limited drainage capacity of the conduit network would push the groundwater from the conduits into the surrounding matrix fig 8 in other words dry periods entailing fewer recharge events produce a drop of the hydraulic head and this mobilizes the groundwater stored in the matrix it is pushed back into the conduits but now with higher mineralization and if coming from deeper areas also warmer in addition to the conduit flow there must be a regional component that provides old groundwater recharged before 1953 to the water drained at the outlet which is responsible for the spring base flow observed in depletion times fig 8 it could be traced to autogenic recharge and would flow diffusively towards the outlet the greater residence time of such a groundwater component in the media means a greater dissolution of solutes along its flowpath resulting from a longer water rock interaction than the one produced in conduits 6 conclusions a multi criteria approach combining hydrodynamic hydrochemical and isotopic tools has proven useful to investigate the structure and flow dynamics of evaporite karst aquifers and may be useful in similar settings worldwide the qualitative and statistical analyses pca trend analysis of the time series of discharge rate and physicochemical data for four years together with the information derived from other techniques intrinsic fluorescence stable isotopes tritium determination contributed to a comprehensive knowledge of the functioning of this complex hydrogeological system the advances presented here support a hydrogeological conceptual model to explain the observed hydrological and geochemical processes some unlike those of traditional karst aquifers including a faster geochemical evolution of the recently infiltrated groundwater local and regional flowpaths and interaction between the matrix and conduit network this interpretation highlights the importance of applying several methods in karst studies and particularly in evaporite media as altogether they permit one to focus on different areas and aspects of the systems and then to reinforce the conclusions drawn still additional scientific efforts are needed to acquire in depth knowledge about evaporite karst hydrogeology groundwater dating techniques now being applied shed light on the groundwater flowpath system inferred here so as to quantify residence times and estimate the mixing fractions in the groundwater drained at the lower anzur spring moreover the development of process based karst numerical models makes it possible to simulate the natural response of the system these recent developments in the field will serve to confirm the interpretation presented here
