treatment of tannery effluents te particular emphasis was given to cr vi adsorption when varying equilibration time effluent ph initial concentration of cr vi and temperature the adsorbents characteristics suggested significant cr vi accumulation onto the adsorbent s surface whereas adsorption modelling recommended pseudo second order pso and langmuir models fitted well with the experimental data based on the regression coefficient r2 values with minimum errors the surface complexation model scm indicated that speciation of cr vi sorbed complexes formed an inner sphere compound dominated by acidic ph validated by phpzc the maximum adsorption capacities q max of cr vi were accounted to be 295 and 280 mg g for hap and mmac correspondingly interestingly both adsorbents effectively removed other metallic ions fe pd cu and zn removal was 85 while cd ni and mn removal was 70 the cr vi adsorption processes followed chemisorption mechanisms dominated by the surface complexation phenomenon the performance of a 100 l packed bed reactor was evaluated and the breakthrough time of cr vi adsorption for both adsorbents was 15 min the adsorbents had splendid regeneration capacities and could be re used numerous times in essence the present study concludes that both adsorbents are highly effective at removing cr vi and other contaminants the adsorbents are

thermogravimetric analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction leather tanning is one of the most significant industrial sectors contributing to usd 167 billion year worldwide 1 tanning the conversion of natural hides into a usable product is the essential step in leather processing the leather tanning industry has been highlighted as an intensive source of environmental pollution it was reported that 20 000 m3 of tannery wastewater had been discharged into the waterways of bangladesh every day containing an excessive amount of total dissolved solids tds biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and trace metallic constituents such as chromium cr copper cu lead pb mercury hg iron fe zinc zn and nickel ni to name but a few 2 3 globally 7 9 billion tons of tannery waste year have been discarded in the environment without proper treatment 4 however the discharge of cr contaminated waste generated as a by product of tanning processes is considered a rising global environmental issue chromium is a harmful transitional metal ion found in groundwater and surface water predominantly due to industrial processes such as leather tanning electroplating and metallurgy 5 once in contact with the environment it exists in two stable oxidation states hexavalent cr vi and trivalent cr iii 6 trivalent chromium is considered an essential nutrient to the metabolic systems of humans and animals at an optimum concentration whereas cr vi can be regarded as a potentially life threatening chemical withwidespread ecological and human health risks 7 cr vi has more teratogenic and carcinogenic effects than cr iii in addition it can transport faster than cr iii in the biological systems of humans and animals 8 many processes have been explored to remove cr vi from effluent including chlorine based solvents chemical precipitation solvent extraction ion exchange electrochemical separation and membrane processes 9 12 most of these methods are expensive and energy intensive generating toxic secondary wastes 13 14 however adsorption technology has garnered considerable attention in environmental remediation research due to biomaterials availability and recycling potential cost effectiveness and high efficiency cellulose and lignin based materials have drawn particular attention to the scientific community to study the biosorption process because of various surface ligands agricultural wastes such as tea waste turmeric waste rice husk coconut husk jatropha curcus citrus peel lemon peel vegetable peel and banana peel are commonly utilized as prominent bio sorbents to remove pollutants from the aquatic environment 15 18 eggshell es is now utilized as an effective bio sorbent because of its chemical components 94 caco3 and porosity which can produce nano powder called hydroxyapatite hydroxyapatite a hexagonally structured biomaterial ca10 po4 6 oh 2 that is being utilized as an effective bio sorbent particularly for its superior metal adsorption capability in 2018 worldwide egg production reached 78 million tons mt resulting in an estimated 8 58 million metric tons of es which are generally dumped as waste materials in the environment 19 20 when discharged into the environment es are waste materials without discernible uses causing odor pollution in the elimination process of heavy metals following adsorption by hydroxyapatite crystallinity plays a crucial role 21 because of its unique crystalline surface morphology hydroxyapatite has gained significant attention as a suitable modifier in adsorption studies 22 the seeds of moringa oleifera have been recognized as the most promising adsorbent for wastewater treatment polypeptides the principal flocculant molecules are present in m oleifera seeds 12 the lignocellulosic and elemental composition of m oleifera seeds have been presented in table 1 the production of m oleifera has been found in asia and africa where locals use them to clean their domestic wastewater 24 these seeds provide financial incentives for producers and assist in managing environmental pollution 25 activated carbon ac is widely used in water remediation for its low prices and good adsorption capacity particularly in organic molecules a recent study has reported moringa modified activated carbon as a bio sorbent of low cost with high adsorption capacity i e 121 95 mg g to treat oil from tannery effluent 26 27 considering the present challenges of removal technologies for the treatment of cr vi from wastewater es waste management as well as the proper use of m oleifera seeds this investigation aimed to i fabricate two cost effective novel adsorbents hydroxyapatite powder hap from es and ac from m oleifera seeds to remediate cr vi and other pollutants from tannery wastewater ii characterize the proposed adsorbents to study the cr vi biosorption process iii examine several adsorption models such as isotherms kinetics thermodynamics surface complexation scm and artificial neural network ann models iv study the regeneration potentials of the adsorbents and finally v undertake a pilot scale performance evaluation of the bio sorbents in a packed column to the best of our knowledge and from the scientific literature this is the first comprehensive study where agricultural by products have been explored to treat complex tannery wastewater by employing macroscopic data spectroscopic investigations and empirical modelling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sigma aldrich switzerland provided the analytical grade chemicals 98 purity for this experiment including potassium dichromate k₂cr₂o₇ 1 5 diphenylcarbazide c13h14n4o 85 phosphoric acid h₃po₄ 5 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 mw 100 deionized water diw was used to prepare the reagents and solution throughout the experiments 2 2 analytical techniques and characterization of tannery effluents te the standard stock solution of cr vi 10 000 mg l was prepared by dissolving 28 28 g of k2cr2o7 in 1000 ml diw water various concentrations of diluted solution were generated from the stock solution for further use te was collected from the equalization basin of a tannery located in dhaka bangladesh according to standard sampling procedure 1060 28 the te was characterized by determining the ph chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss electrical conductivity ec and heavy metals such as cr vi lead pb nickel ni zinc zn iron fe and copper cu the physico chemical characteristics of te including ec tds tss and ph were measured with the help of a digital multimeter model dt830d brand sibass india whereas bod and cod were analyzed by a standard 5 days bod test and a closed reflux colorimetric technique respectively 29 31 the heavy metals except cr vi were determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes agilent 7900 agilent technologies inc the characterization profile of te has been summarized in table 2 2 3 fabrication of the adsorbents 2 3 1 synthesis of hydroxyapatite hap the es was collected from restaurants and residential houses washed with diw and dried at 80 c for 3 h to eliminate the contaminants the interference matrices such as collagen have been removed following the methods of ma et al 32 in which 5 edta was exploited the material was crushed and sieved 180 μm after cooling at room temperature to get fine eggshell powder fesp 33 the fesp was calcined for 2 h at 900 c in a muffle furnace model jsmf 30t korea under the nitrogen flow rate of 15 stp cm3 min and a heating rate of 5 c min 34 the modified chemical precipitation methods of mobarak et al 35 were used to make hydroxyapatite powder hap from fesp in brief 50 ml of diw was mixed with 24 5 g of calcined fesp the ph was then adjusted to 8 5 by adding 0 3 m phosphoric acid h3po4 to the solution the solution was stirred for 30 min using a magnetic stirrer model jshs 18d korea and left for 24 h to allow precipitate formation the solution was then filtered and rinsed with diw water before being dried for 2 h at 120 c to make the hap the dried precipitates were calcined again in the furnace at 900 c 2 3 2 synthesis of moringa modified activated carbon mmac m oleifera seeds used in this experiment were collected from local farmers the seeds were carefully extracted from the pod peeled then washed with diw to remove impurities and dried for 22 h at 120 c the dried seeds were subsequently ground and then finally sieved 180 μm to prepare fine powder which was used as the raw material for activated carbon ac production 26 to extract the inner oil from the seeds 630 ml of hexane was poured into 30 g of m oleifera powder for 12 h by soxhlet extraction model eam9203 03 korea methods the moringa seed powder msp 30 g underwent pyrolysis at 580 c for 1 h once the reactor s pt t1200 pgep china temperature surpassed the pyrolysis threshold and steady pace of heating 30 c min with a n2 flow of 5 ml min this pyrolysis conditions are considered to be optimal for increasing the surface area of ac together with a uniform porous structure 25 after that the msp was soaked in 1 m solution of naoh for 150 min in a chemical activation method then magnetically stirred and dried at 150 c for 3 h this mixture was placed in a muffle furnace model jsmf 30t korea at 600 c for 1 h for the reduction of ash content to some extent as well as strengthening the surface area of ac 36 after cooling at room temperature msp was treated with 0 1 hcl to remove soluble ash and rinsed with diw until neutral ph 7 membrane filters were used to separate the ac during the washing process the recovered carbon was dried at 105 c providing black color powder termed moringa modified activated carbon mmac and stored in closed vials the present study used naoh for the activation of mmac because naoh activation is one of the most popular chemical activation methods which is simple but efficient and involves a low cost approach to the biochar activated carbon activation processes 37 in previous studies sewage sludge activated with naoh was recorded to be more efficient in removing methylene blue mb dye at a maximum adsorption capacity of 113 mg g 38 it was reported that naoh activated biochar derived from camphor leaves cinnamomum camphora was efficient in removing pb2 at 90 09 mg g adsorption capacity 39 in the present study the selection of naoh as a chemical activating agent for the preparation of mmac had several reasons naoh has a low cost and is considered environmentally friendly compared to other activating agents such as acid activation with h2so4 hcl while generating significant recovery of adsorbate 40 moreover naoh has the capability to generate mesoporous structures and increase the surface area of the adsorbents by the synergistic effects among chemical activation physical activation and metallic intercalation to ultimately reveal the dynamic adsorption sites 41 42 in addition naoh promotes an expanding number of surface functional groups of biomaterials especially oh through carbon oxygen and alkaline bonding 43 these are the advantageous attributes of naoh as an activating agent of mmac in this study the schematic presentation of hap and mmac development is shown in fig 1 2 4 characterization of the adsorbents fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy model ft ir 4000 jasco japan was used to characterize the functional groups present on the surfaces of the adsorbents the morpho chemical properties of the adsorbents were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectrometer fesem edx model jsm 7610f jeol japan methods brunauer emmett teller bet method model belsorp mini ii japan was performed to analyze the specific surface area with pore volume and diameter of the adsorbents to observe the thermal stability of the adsorbents thermogravimetric analysis tga model perkinelmer tga 8000 india was undertaken 20 2 5 batch adsorption experiments the batch adsorption studies were performed with a multifactorial design in a rotary shaker with an agitation speed of 200 rpm 200 ml of te was placed in a 1000 ml erlenmeyer flask with 1 3 g l adsorbents dosage 300 mg l of cr vi concentration 0 90 dilution varying contact time 3 90 min and at ph 1 9 the solution ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh at the predetermined time intervals the materials in the flask were centrifuged and the filtrates were analyzed for residual cr vi concentrations by 1 5 diphenylcarbazide methods 44 47 using a uv visible spectrophotometer model emc 61pc uv emc lab germany whereas the concentration of other metallic constituents was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes agilent 7900 agilent technologies inc the percentages of cr vi removal and the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents were described in the supplementary data s1 2 6 column experiments a fixed bed reactor fbr was constructed using an empty and refillable water filter cartridge as a column size 6 35 cm 25 4 cm grounded with 0 5 mm glass wool and 2 cm sandstones to promote flow circulation and avoid a shortage of the adsorbents 48 the schematic representation of the fbr is presented in fig s1 with a working volume of 100 l te the fixed bed column was packed with 150 g hap and mmac adsorbents with a feed concentration of 0 90 at ph 4 and temperatures ranged from 25 to 30 c using a diaphragm booster pump dew italy the initial cr vi feeding flow rate was adjusted to 300 ml min after 5 5 h te samples were taken from the column s outlet for the spectrophotometric testing of residual cr vi ions using dpc methods as illustrated in section 2 5 2 7 modelling and statistical analysis in this experiment the five classical adsorption models i e isotherms kinetics thermodynamic surface complexation model scm and artificial neural network ann models were apprised to understand the cr vi adsorption process scm was performed by winsgw version 4 2 10 software a double layer model dlm was applied in scm to simulate cr vi adsorption onto hap and mmac over the protonation deprotonation equilibrium constant of the surface sites at 25 c to determine the best fitted values 49 the r2 values for the regression coefficients obtained from the adsorption models the error value i e marquardt s percent standard deviation mpsd and root mean squared error rmse were assessed 50 to evaluate the most robust model for predicting cr vi elimination based on the experimental data have been summarized in the supplementary data s2 2 8 reusability study for regeneration studies 1 g of hap and mmac has been added with 100 ml te containing cr vi 300 mg l following the bio sorption phase the materials were filtered and the filtrate was thoroughly washed with diw to eliminate residual cr vi after adsorption the remaining wash water was tested again to determine whether cr vi existed or not desorption experiments were carried out using 100 ml of various eluents 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m hno3 0 1 m hcl diw and 0 5 m koh after washing the adsorbents they were placed in the prepared desorption solution and shaken overnight after desorption the filtrates were examined to determine the concentration of cr vi using the dpc methods described in section 2 5 the following equation assessed the desorption percentages 1 the percentage of desorption desorption of the quantity of metal ions quantity of adsorbed metal ions 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents tga analysis was used to examine the thermal stability and weight loss of the adsorbents illustrated in fig 2 the result of tga demonstrated a mass loss of 8 24 and 9 33 for hap and mmac respectively below 400 c attributed to the humid condition of the adsorbents interestingly a significant mass loss accounted for 59 94 of mmac at 400 800 c indicating the decarboxylation of caco3 linked to the release of co2 and formation of cao due to the oxidation of the aliphatic and aromatic organic matter 51 52 after 800 c weight loss of hap and mmac was observed at 3 2 and 12 32 respectively due to the conversion of co from cao and the materials were found stable up to 1000 c the fesem micrographs were used to examine the surface morphology of esp hap msp and mmac adsorbents the results are presented in fig 3 esp appeared to have a smooth and homogenous micro porous structure with flake like appearances indicating a highly agglomerated particle fig 3a after adsorption the presence of irregular structures of hap represented the accessible pores to be entrapped by cr vi fig 3b which caused saturation of the adsorption sites influenced by chemical precipitation and second calcination processes most agglomerations recorded in hap were 2 10 mm at lower temperatures but larger aggregations 10 15 mm were found as temperature increased according to goloshchapov et al 53 the highest amount of particle agglomeration made increased in particle sizes with increasing temperatures ou et al 54 and ramirez gutierrez et al 55 also reported similar structures of irregular particle sizes of hap however the fesem analysis characterizing the microstructures of msp as shown in fig 3c revealed that the carbon surface displayed porous patterns without the naoh activation due to devolatilization similar results were noted in previous studies i e msp produced ac with high porosity 26 56 fig 3d exhibited the mmac surface s irregular surface shape displaying pores with different thicknesses after naoh activation many larger pores formed on the mmac surface which aided the expansion of its meso micropore surface this interconnected meso microporous structure could accelerate mass transfer and increase adsorption capacity by permitting cr vi routes to micro and mesopores inside mmac adsorbent 16 additionally fig s2 represented the eds data that proved the existence of cr vi in hap 0 22 and mmac 0 63 after adsorption with the presence of significant levels of c and o molecules improving the adsorption capacity by acting as a reducing and capping agent for both adsorbents 17 to identify the characteristic functional groups of the adsorbents ftir spectra were measured in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 fig 4 the results showed multiple adsorption peaks that are similar for different functional groups indicating that cr vi adsorption could be occurred 26 the oh bond stretching exhibits a slight peak in the ftir spectra for esp at 3313 cm 1 the prominent peak in the 900 1200 cm 1 wavelength region revealed the existence of co stretching vibrations in alcohols and carboxylic groups of esp the co stretching for aliphatic amines and alcohols were reported in the biosorption process of cr vi 57 59 however the msp exhibits an enhanced peak at 2513 cm 1 attributed to the oh stretching vibrations in a carboxylic group numerous studies have revealed that oxygen containing functional groups such as cooh and oh have a high affinity for aromatic structures via n interaction and hydrogen bonding formation 60 63 the presence of these groups on msp surface may promote the adsorption of cr vi 46 62 63 when comparing the ftir spectra of esp and msp it is conceivable to have seen variations and fluctuations in the strength of various absorption bands the results revealed the presence of nh and oh stretching of amino and hydroxyl groups for both adsorbents at 3200 3500 cm 1 46 64 besides some other stretching such as co nh cn and oh in ester saturated aliphatic aliphatic amines and carboxylic groups were also recorded at the wavelength range 1735 1033 948 and 896 cm 1 for hap and 2854 1750 1633 and 1242 cm 1 for mmac 16 60 the presence of cr vi on hap was further demonstrated by the appearance of additional peaks at 601 1056 and 1665 cm 1 indicative of the cbr cn and cc stretching vibrations of the alcohol phenol and aromatic benzene rings respectively significant peaks were found for mmac after adsorption with co cc oh stretching vibrations of the aromatic hexavalent benzene ring at 3352 1734 and 1035 cm 1 regions 65 these occurrences demonstrated that cr vi was successfully absorbed into the mmac surface according to kabir et al 44 45 the negatively charged chromium species cro4 2 and hcro4 could bind to the maximum sharp peaks of acidic functional clusters co oh and cc for hap and oh and co nh cooh and cc for mmac on the adsorbent surfaces significantly increasing cr vi adsorption capacity from te the pore volume and the pore size measured for hap and mmac were 0 98 and 0 47 cm3 g and 22 61 and 16 67 nm respectively these findings supported the mesoporous structures of the adsorbents because this type of structures have pore volume and pore size in the range of 0 1 1 0 cm3 g and 2 50 nm respectively 26 the phpzc refers a specific level of ph at which the net surface charge of the materials is regarded as zero the phpzc in this experiment was determined to be 4 8 and 5 9 for hap and mmac respectively as shown in fig 5c below this ph protonation occurs in the adsorbent surface which produced hcro4 whereas above this ph deprotonation occurred by generating cro4 2 and oh thus the cr vi removal percentage increased due to its electrostatic attraction repulsion force of the positive negative charges of ph 60 65 3 2 effectiveness of hexavalent chromium adsorption under key experimental context the development of novel environmentally valuable and economic adsorbents for removing contaminants from wastewater is considered a significant challenge to compare with other naturally modified and chemically synthesized adsorbents table 3 lists the adsorption effectiveness of hap and mmac under various operating conditions which revealed hap and mmac have remarkable removal efficiencies of cr vi the present study concentrated on cr vi removal by both adsorbents in different time frames varying from 0 to 90 min fig s3a initially the adsorption was fast and the equilibrium time for both adsorbents was 30 min from equilibration time the removal percentage showed a decreasing pattern and seemed to be stable due to the lack of accessible gaps and porosity on the adsorbent s surface 66 solution ph significantly influences the cr vi adsorption process in this experiment the effect of solution ph was investigated ranging from 1 to 9 and the removal efficiency was observed to be maximum in acidic conditions as seen in fig s3b the highest cr vi removal achieved was 98 83 and 96 90 for hap and mmac respectively at ph 3 99 and 5 the removal efficiency was gradually decreased with increasing ph values for both adsorbents the electrostatic attraction and electro repulsive forces provided acidic ph to be optimal for effective cr vi removal from te which was also supported by the findings of phpzc 102 removal efficiency increased with increasing dosages of 1 to 5 g l as shown in fig s3c the results show that the optimal adsorption dosage for this experiment was 3 g l for both adsorbents this adsorption pattern allowed more cr vi to be binded to the surface of adsorbents because of the presence of more surface binding sites due to the micro porous structure of the adsorbent as validated by fesem and bet characterization 60 however further dose increases above 3 g l may cover the available adsorption sites leading to decreased cr vi adsorption similar findings were reported by kumar and meikap 67 and mondal and chakraborty 103 the adsorption experiment was carried out under optimal conditions adsorbent dosage of 3 g l solution ph of 3 99 after te was diluted using tap water in varied ratios i e 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 v v the results are displayed in fig s3d which shows a continual increase of cr vi removal with increasing te dilution up to 90 when the dilution was 90 the amount of cr vi elimination increased from 55 7 to 98 83 and that might be due to the saturation of the adsorbent s sorption sites which lowers the efficiency of cr vi adsorption 52 additionally the efficacy of cr vi adsorption from te was investigated by hap and mmac in the presence of different metal ions in table 1 a comparison of the characteristics of untreated and treated te has been assessed for specific quality parameters under optimal conditions it was observed that the cr vi concentration in te decreased 98 83 from 300 01 to 3 5 mg l while other metallic ions such as fe pd cu and zn were eliminated to the extent of up to 85 on the contrary cd ni and mn were reduced by up to 70 the maximum reduction of bod and cod was recorded at 80 77 and 71 6 respectively and the elimination of ts and tds was 36 03 and 63 25 respectively moreover ec dropped to 62 81 while turbidity decreased to 90 11 3 3 adsorption modelling the experimental equilibrium data for cr vi adsorption onto hap and mmac were modelled by four classical isotherm models i e langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich dr model these models parameter values are shown in table 4 along with their fitting behavior in fig 6 the regression coefficient r2 was used to determine the models appropriateness the higher r2 value recommends that the model explicitly improve the adsorption process 68 the langmuir and freundlich models explained the experimental results better r2 0 997 for hap and r2 0 995 for mmac for both adsorbents along with lower rmse and mpsd values compared to temkin and dr isotherm models however based on the errors calculated in this study the langmuir model best described the cr vi sorption process the langmuir model is typically employed for monolayer sorption of metals on homogeneous adsorbent surfaces while the freundlich model is used when there is heterogeneity on the surface of the materials for multilayer adsorption 69 for the freundlich isotherm model the value n was determined to be 0 1 n 1 for this investigation suggesting favorable adsorption due to the heterogeneity of the adsorbents also validated by fesem s findings and dr model the maximum removal capacity q max by hap and mmac was found to be 297 65 and 280 23 mg g correspondingly according to the langmuir model which was proximate to experimental q e exp values the r l values for hap and mmac were 0 26 and 0 89 l mg respectively indicating favorable cr vi adsorption the isotherms shapes can be either unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 favorable 0 r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 depending on the value of r l 44 45 nonetheless the temkin model describes the pattern of adsorption processes as either physical or chemical the b t value was found to be b t 40 kj mol for both adsorbents resulting in chemisorption phenomena of cr vi adsorption 70 71 the adsorption rate of experimental data was described with pfo pso and ipd models table 5 listed the parameter s values for the kinetic models according to the r2 value the pso and ipd models were best fitted with the experimental results r2 0 98 with minimal error values compared to the pfo model demonstrating negligible differences between experimental and theoretical data it can be happened from a discrepancy in adsorbate movement rate between the initial and final steps of the adsorption processes 10 72 thermodynamic models were used to explore the impact of temperature on the cr vi adsorption process with the help of different parameters such as i e gibb s free energy enthalpy and entropy the model s results are summarized in table 6 the negative value of δg 0 revealed that the adsorption was more favorable at higher temperatures reflecting the adsorption process s feasibility and spontaneity the positive values of δh 0 ensure that the adsorption capacity is increased with increasing temperature indicating the endothermic nature of cr vi adsorption 73 the negative value of δs 0 suggested an interconnected mechanism demonstrating no significant changes in the internal structures of hap and mmac evidently favoring adsorption at high temperatures the surface complexation model exhibited chemical bonding and electrostatic interactions between cr vi ions hcro4 and cro4 2 from te and the adsorbent s surface as anticipated by the winsgw algorithm the speciation of chromate 0 1 mm in a 1 mm nano3 electrolyte solution is described in fig 7 according to the findings hcro4 is the dominating species at ph 6 and cro4 2 is the governing species at ph 6 5 hcro4 was more easily adsorbed on the surface active site owing to the low adsorption free energy compared with cro4 2 the scm model is comprised of one inner sphere surface complex soh2 cro4 2 and another outer sphere complex soh cro4 2 49 the speciation of cr vi sorbed complexes proposed in this study indicated that the inner sphere compound dominated at ph below 6 0 which was validated by the effect of solution ph and phpzc the tendency to develop the inner sphere complexes at low ph has also been found for cr vi adsorption onto birnessite ferrihydrite illite and kaolinite 51 the artificial neural network ann models were mainly used to develop a feed forward network for performance analysis of the process parameters for the cr vi adsorption process fig s4 displayed the regression graph for the neural network model the experimental findings were in the input layer of the ann model and the cr vi elimination percentage was shown in the output layer after several training cycles the data showed a strong correlation between the experimental and simulation results with the lowest mse and most outstanding r values i e 0 999 for hap and 0 998 for mmac 44 3 4 adsorption mechanisms our findings conclude that the cr vi adsorption process follows a complex mechanism based on the adsorbate adsorbent characteristics and other process parameters based on these interactions a proposed adsorptive mechanism of hap and mmac has been presented in fig 8 which is described in four consecutive pathways 1 morphological characteristics of the adsorbents suggested meso microporous features consisting of various types of layers and surfaces of the adsorbents which were validated by fesem and bet analysis in conjunction with ipd models 69 2 hydrogen bonding occurs between the functional groups of both adsorbents co oh ch for hap and oh co nh cooh cc for mmac and cr vi which contains cooh and oh group as an electron donor in aqueous media the hydrogen bonds of cr vi interacted with the oh groups existing at the surface of adsorbents to improve the adsorption performance 44 45 74 3 surface complexation reactions provided an electrostatic interaction between cr vi and the functional groups present in the adsorbents through the inner sphere surface complex soh2 cro4 2 and one outer sphere complex soh cro4 2 the adsorbent surfaces became more protonated due to the oxygen containing functional groups and acidic environments encourage electrostatic interaction between cr vi ions hcro4 and cro4 2 and the protonated surface oh of the adsorbents which is supported by scm and phpzc 49 4 according to kinetic models the chemisorption dominated the cr vi adsorption process resulting in rapid and irreversible adsorption the endothermic nature of adsorption was more effective at high temperatures supported by the temkin and thermodynamic models as well as tga analysis 70 71 3 5 regeneration and recyclability study recycling and regeneration of the adsorbents after desorption are crucial for economic viability and large scale industrial operations 75 without drastically changing the removal efficiency the adsorbents can be recycled the present study used five desorbing agents for cr vi desorption i e 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m hno3 0 1 m hcl diw and 0 5 m koh as presented in fig 9a h2so4 hcl and hno3 had the highest desorption capacities i e 98 7 97 9 and 95 4 for hap and 94 6 93 8 and 90 6 for mmac respectively while koh and diw had negligible desorption capacities the desorption percentage of cr vi ions from both adsorbents was significantly higher for h2so4 hcl and hno3 compared to other eluents such as diw and koh because these strong acids have a high affinity for cr vi ions and can effectively desorb them from the surfaces of the hap and mmac 75 76 the high ionic strength of these acids overcomes the electrostatic interactions and surface complexation phenomena between cr vi ions hcro4 and cro4 2 and the protonated surface of the adsorbents 77 78 moreover the hydroxyl oh and carboxylic cooh functional groups present in hap and mmac could make it amenable to easy desorption of cr vi ions in the acidic solutions by ion exchange interactions 79 81 leading to a higher desorption percentage several previous studies also reported the significant cr vi desorption capacity of h2so4 hcl and hno3 compared to other desorbing agents 76 82 88 fig 9b c illustrated the adsorption desorption cycles for hap and mmac after being eluted with 0 1 m h2so4 indicated both adsorbents have an excellent adsorptive efficiency 120 mg g for hap and 105 mg g for mmac up to the sixth cycle of re uses on the other hand beyond the seventh cycle there was a negligible amount of regeneration capacity which can be caused due to the reduction of functional groups and surface areas of the adsorbents 64 3 6 performance assessment of fixed bed columns in this experiment the breakthrough curve was utilized to assess cr vi removal performances from te in a packed bed reactor at an initial cr vi concentration of 300 mg l and different flow rates were shown in fig 10 the study was performed in 200 ml of each diluted cr vi solution with a dose of 3 g l at ph 3 99 the bed height was controlled at 180 mm for each experiment and the breakthrough time for both adsorbents was counted to be 15 min the calculated results exhibited an s shape breakthrough curve with early breakthrough and late time tailing revealing favorable adsorption for mmac and highly favorable for hap adsorbent 48 4 conclusions leather tanning industries cause significant environmental pollution due to the release of toxic cr vi and other contaminants the present study developed two novel innovative and economic adsorbents for the remediation of cr vi from te the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study the meso microporous surface of the adsorbents was observed supported by bet ipd and isotherm models the major functional groups involved in cr vi adsorption process were co oh ch for hap and oh co nh cooh and cc for mmac initially the adsorption rate was fast and the equilibrium time for both adsorbents was 30 min from equilibration time the removal percentage showed a decreasing pattern and seemed stable due to the lack of accessible gaps and porosity on the adsorbent s surface the adsorption of cr vi is ph dependent and the adsorbents exhibited large surface area and highest stability under acidic conditions leading to the improved cr vi adsorption under batch and column scale operations supported by scm and phpzc the maximum removal efficiency of cr vi was found to be 98 83 and 96 90 for hap and mmac respectively at ph 3 99 adsorbent dosage of 3 g l contact time of 30 min and 25 c temperature the findings of ann model showed a strong correlation between the experimental and calculated values of process parameters implying that the adsorbents are suitable for varying process conditions thermodynamic models advised the endothermic nature of cr vi adsorption providing feasibility and spontaneity of the process

removal was observed 90 11 the column study exhibited an s shaped breakthrough curve with early breakthrough and late time tailing revealing favorable adsorption for mmac and highly favorable for hap adsorbent electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding and redox reaction dominated by inner surface complexation processes were involved in cr vi adsorption process leading to chemisorption mechanisms

thermogravimetric analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction leather tanning is one of the most significant industrial sectors contributing to usd 167 billion year worldwide 1 tanning the conversion of natural hides into a usable product is the essential step in leather processing the leather tanning industry has been highlighted as an intensive source of environmental pollution it was reported that 20 000 m3 of tannery wastewater had been discharged into the waterways of bangladesh every day containing an excessive amount of total dissolved solids tds biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and trace metallic constituents such as chromium cr copper cu lead pb mercury hg iron fe zinc zn and nickel ni to name but a few 2 3 globally 7 9 billion tons of tannery waste year have been discarded in the environment without proper treatment 4 however the discharge of cr contaminated waste generated as a by product of tanning processes is considered a rising global environmental issue chromium is a harmful transitional metal ion found in groundwater and surface water predominantly due to industrial processes such as leather tanning electroplating and metallurgy 5 once in contact with the environment it exists in two stable oxidation states hexavalent cr vi and trivalent cr iii 6 trivalent chromium is considered an essential nutrient to the metabolic systems of humans and animals at an optimum concentration whereas cr vi can be regarded as a potentially life threatening chemical withwidespread ecological and human health risks 7 cr vi has more teratogenic and carcinogenic effects than cr iii in addition it can transport faster than cr iii in the biological systems of humans and animals 8 many processes have been explored to remove cr vi from effluent including chlorine based solvents chemical precipitation solvent extraction ion exchange electrochemical separation and membrane processes 9 12 most of these methods are expensive and energy intensive generating toxic secondary wastes 13 14 however adsorption technology has garnered considerable attention in environmental remediation research due to biomaterials availability and recycling potential cost effectiveness and high efficiency cellulose and lignin based materials have drawn particular attention to the scientific community to study the biosorption process because of various surface ligands agricultural wastes such as tea waste turmeric waste rice husk coconut husk jatropha curcus citrus peel lemon peel vegetable peel and banana peel are commonly utilized as prominent bio sorbents to remove pollutants from the aquatic environment 15 18 eggshell es is now utilized as an effective bio sorbent because of its chemical components 94 caco3 and porosity which can produce nano powder called hydroxyapatite hydroxyapatite a hexagonally structured biomaterial ca10 po4 6 oh 2 that is being utilized as an effective bio sorbent particularly for its superior metal adsorption capability in 2018 worldwide egg production reached 78 million tons mt resulting in an estimated 8 58 million metric tons of es which are generally dumped as waste materials in the environment 19 20 when discharged into the environment es are waste materials without discernible uses causing odor pollution in the elimination process of heavy metals following adsorption by hydroxyapatite crystallinity plays a crucial role 21 because of its unique crystalline surface morphology hydroxyapatite has gained significant attention as a suitable modifier in adsorption studies 22 the seeds of moringa oleifera have been recognized as the most promising adsorbent for wastewater treatment polypeptides the principal flocculant molecules are present in m oleifera seeds 12 the lignocellulosic and elemental composition of m oleifera seeds have been presented in table 1 the production of m oleifera has been found in asia and africa where locals use them to clean their domestic wastewater 24 these seeds provide financial incentives for producers and assist in managing environmental pollution 25 activated carbon ac is widely used in water remediation for its low prices and good adsorption capacity particularly in organic molecules a recent study has reported moringa modified activated carbon as a bio sorbent of low cost with high adsorption capacity i e 121 95 mg g to treat oil from tannery effluent 26 27 considering the present challenges of removal technologies for the treatment of cr vi from wastewater es waste management as well as the proper use of m oleifera seeds this investigation aimed to i fabricate two cost effective novel adsorbents hydroxyapatite powder hap from es and ac from m oleifera seeds to remediate cr vi and other pollutants from tannery wastewater ii characterize the proposed adsorbents to study the cr vi biosorption process iii examine several adsorption models such as isotherms kinetics thermodynamics surface complexation scm and artificial neural network ann models iv study the regeneration potentials of the adsorbents and finally v undertake a pilot scale performance evaluation of the bio sorbents in a packed column to the best of our knowledge and from the scientific literature this is the first comprehensive study where agricultural by products have been explored to treat complex tannery wastewater by employing macroscopic data spectroscopic investigations and empirical modelling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sigma aldrich switzerland provided the analytical grade chemicals 98 purity for this experiment including potassium dichromate k₂cr₂o₇ 1 5 diphenylcarbazide c13h14n4o 85 phosphoric acid h₃po₄ 5 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 mw 100 deionized water diw was used to prepare the reagents and solution throughout the experiments 2 2 analytical techniques and characterization of tannery effluents te the standard stock solution of cr vi 10 000 mg l was prepared by dissolving 28 28 g of k2cr2o7 in 1000 ml diw water various concentrations of diluted solution were generated from the stock solution for further use te was collected from the equalization basin of a tannery located in dhaka bangladesh according to standard sampling procedure 1060 28 the te was characterized by determining the ph chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss electrical conductivity ec and heavy metals such as cr vi lead pb nickel ni zinc zn iron fe and copper cu the physico chemical characteristics of te including ec tds tss and ph were measured with the help of a digital multimeter model dt830d brand sibass india whereas bod and cod were analyzed by a standard 5 days bod test and a closed reflux colorimetric technique respectively 29 31 the heavy metals except cr vi were determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes agilent 7900 agilent technologies inc the characterization profile of te has been summarized in table 2 2 3 fabrication of the adsorbents 2 3 1 synthesis of hydroxyapatite hap the es was collected from restaurants and residential houses washed with diw and dried at 80 c for 3 h to eliminate the contaminants the interference matrices such as collagen have been removed following the methods of ma et al 32 in which 5 edta was exploited the material was crushed and sieved 180 μm after cooling at room temperature to get fine eggshell powder fesp 33 the fesp was calcined for 2 h at 900 c in a muffle furnace model jsmf 30t korea under the nitrogen flow rate of 15 stp cm3 min and a heating rate of 5 c min 34 the modified chemical precipitation methods of mobarak et al 35 were used to make hydroxyapatite powder hap from fesp in brief 50 ml of diw was mixed with 24 5 g of calcined fesp the ph was then adjusted to 8 5 by adding 0 3 m phosphoric acid h3po4 to the solution the solution was stirred for 30 min using a magnetic stirrer model jshs 18d korea and left for 24 h to allow precipitate formation the solution was then filtered and rinsed with diw water before being dried for 2 h at 120 c to make the hap the dried precipitates were calcined again in the furnace at 900 c 2 3 2 synthesis of moringa modified activated carbon mmac m oleifera seeds used in this experiment were collected from local farmers the seeds were carefully extracted from the pod peeled then washed with diw to remove impurities and dried for 22 h at 120 c the dried seeds were subsequently ground and then finally sieved 180 μm to prepare fine powder which was used as the raw material for activated carbon ac production 26 to extract the inner oil from the seeds 630 ml of hexane was poured into 30 g of m oleifera powder for 12 h by soxhlet extraction model eam9203 03 korea methods the moringa seed powder msp 30 g underwent pyrolysis at 580 c for 1 h once the reactor s pt t1200 pgep china temperature surpassed the pyrolysis threshold and steady pace of heating 30 c min with a n2 flow of 5 ml min this pyrolysis conditions are considered to be optimal for increasing the surface area of ac together with a uniform porous structure 25 after that the msp was soaked in 1 m solution of naoh for 150 min in a chemical activation method then magnetically stirred and dried at 150 c for 3 h this mixture was placed in a muffle furnace model jsmf 30t korea at 600 c for 1 h for the reduction of ash content to some extent as well as strengthening the surface area of ac 36 after cooling at room temperature msp was treated with 0 1 hcl to remove soluble ash and rinsed with diw until neutral ph 7 membrane filters were used to separate the ac during the washing process the recovered carbon was dried at 105 c providing black color powder termed moringa modified activated carbon mmac and stored in closed vials the present study used naoh for the activation of mmac because naoh activation is one of the most popular chemical activation methods which is simple but efficient and involves a low cost approach to the biochar activated carbon activation processes 37 in previous studies sewage sludge activated with naoh was recorded to be more efficient in removing methylene blue mb dye at a maximum adsorption capacity of 113 mg g 38 it was reported that naoh activated biochar derived from camphor leaves cinnamomum camphora was efficient in removing pb2 at 90 09 mg g adsorption capacity 39 in the present study the selection of naoh as a chemical activating agent for the preparation of mmac had several reasons naoh has a low cost and is considered environmentally friendly compared to other activating agents such as acid activation with h2so4 hcl while generating significant recovery of adsorbate 40 moreover naoh has the capability to generate mesoporous structures and increase the surface area of the adsorbents by the synergistic effects among chemical activation physical activation and metallic intercalation to ultimately reveal the dynamic adsorption sites 41 42 in addition naoh promotes an expanding number of surface functional groups of biomaterials especially oh through carbon oxygen and alkaline bonding 43 these are the advantageous attributes of naoh as an activating agent of mmac in this study the schematic presentation of hap and mmac development is shown in fig 1 2 4 characterization of the adsorbents fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy model ft ir 4000 jasco japan was used to characterize the functional groups present on the surfaces of the adsorbents the morpho chemical properties of the adsorbents were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectrometer fesem edx model jsm 7610f jeol japan methods brunauer emmett teller bet method model belsorp mini ii japan was performed to analyze the specific surface area with pore volume and diameter of the adsorbents to observe the thermal stability of the adsorbents thermogravimetric analysis tga model perkinelmer tga 8000 india was undertaken 20 2 5 batch adsorption experiments the batch adsorption studies were performed with a multifactorial design in a rotary shaker with an agitation speed of 200 rpm 200 ml of te was placed in a 1000 ml erlenmeyer flask with 1 3 g l adsorbents dosage 300 mg l of cr vi concentration 0 90 dilution varying contact time 3 90 min and at ph 1 9 the solution ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh at the predetermined time intervals the materials in the flask were centrifuged and the filtrates were analyzed for residual cr vi concentrations by 1 5 diphenylcarbazide methods 44 47 using a uv visible spectrophotometer model emc 61pc uv emc lab germany whereas the concentration of other metallic constituents was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes agilent 7900 agilent technologies inc the percentages of cr vi removal and the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents were described in the supplementary data s1 2 6 column experiments a fixed bed reactor fbr was constructed using an empty and refillable water filter cartridge as a column size 6 35 cm 25 4 cm grounded with 0 5 mm glass wool and 2 cm sandstones to promote flow circulation and avoid a shortage of the adsorbents 48 the schematic representation of the fbr is presented in fig s1 with a working volume of 100 l te the fixed bed column was packed with 150 g hap and mmac adsorbents with a feed concentration of 0 90 at ph 4 and temperatures ranged from 25 to 30 c using a diaphragm booster pump dew italy the initial cr vi feeding flow rate was adjusted to 300 ml min after 5 5 h te samples were taken from the column s outlet for the spectrophotometric testing of residual cr vi ions using dpc methods as illustrated in section 2 5 2 7 modelling and statistical analysis in this experiment the five classical adsorption models i e isotherms kinetics thermodynamic surface complexation model scm and artificial neural network ann models were apprised to understand the cr vi adsorption process scm was performed by winsgw version 4 2 10 software a double layer model dlm was applied in scm to simulate cr vi adsorption onto hap and mmac over the protonation deprotonation equilibrium constant of the surface sites at 25 c to determine the best fitted values 49 the r2 values for the regression coefficients obtained from the adsorption models the error value i e marquardt s percent standard deviation mpsd and root mean squared error rmse were assessed 50 to evaluate the most robust model for predicting cr vi elimination based on the experimental data have been summarized in the supplementary data s2 2 8 reusability study for regeneration studies 1 g of hap and mmac has been added with 100 ml te containing cr vi 300 mg l following the bio sorption phase the materials were filtered and the filtrate was thoroughly washed with diw to eliminate residual cr vi after adsorption the remaining wash water was tested again to determine whether cr vi existed or not desorption experiments were carried out using 100 ml of various eluents 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m hno3 0 1 m hcl diw and 0 5 m koh after washing the adsorbents they were placed in the prepared desorption solution and shaken overnight after desorption the filtrates were examined to determine the concentration of cr vi using the dpc methods described in section 2 5 the following equation assessed the desorption percentages 1 the percentage of desorption desorption of the quantity of metal ions quantity of adsorbed metal ions 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents tga analysis was used to examine the thermal stability and weight loss of the adsorbents illustrated in fig 2 the result of tga demonstrated a mass loss of 8 24 and 9 33 for hap and mmac respectively below 400 c attributed to the humid condition of the adsorbents interestingly a significant mass loss accounted for 59 94 of mmac at 400 800 c indicating the decarboxylation of caco3 linked to the release of co2 and formation of cao due to the oxidation of the aliphatic and aromatic organic matter 51 52 after 800 c weight loss of hap and mmac was observed at 3 2 and 12 32 respectively due to the conversion of co from cao and the materials were found stable up to 1000 c the fesem micrographs were used to examine the surface morphology of esp hap msp and mmac adsorbents the results are presented in fig 3 esp appeared to have a smooth and homogenous micro porous structure with flake like appearances indicating a highly agglomerated particle fig 3a after adsorption the presence of irregular structures of hap represented the accessible pores to be entrapped by cr vi fig 3b which caused saturation of the adsorption sites influenced by chemical precipitation and second calcination processes most agglomerations recorded in hap were 2 10 mm at lower temperatures but larger aggregations 10 15 mm were found as temperature increased according to goloshchapov et al 53 the highest amount of particle agglomeration made increased in particle sizes with increasing temperatures ou et al 54 and ramirez gutierrez et al 55 also reported similar structures of irregular particle sizes of hap however the fesem analysis characterizing the microstructures of msp as shown in fig 3c revealed that the carbon surface displayed porous patterns without the naoh activation due to devolatilization similar results were noted in previous studies i e msp produced ac with high porosity 26 56 fig 3d exhibited the mmac surface s irregular surface shape displaying pores with different thicknesses after naoh activation many larger pores formed on the mmac surface which aided the expansion of its meso micropore surface this interconnected meso microporous structure could accelerate mass transfer and increase adsorption capacity by permitting cr vi routes to micro and mesopores inside mmac adsorbent 16 additionally fig s2 represented the eds data that proved the existence of cr vi in hap 0 22 and mmac 0 63 after adsorption with the presence of significant levels of c and o molecules improving the adsorption capacity by acting as a reducing and capping agent for both adsorbents 17 to identify the characteristic functional groups of the adsorbents ftir spectra were measured in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 fig 4 the results showed multiple adsorption peaks that are similar for different functional groups indicating that cr vi adsorption could be occurred 26 the oh bond stretching exhibits a slight peak in the ftir spectra for esp at 3313 cm 1 the prominent peak in the 900 1200 cm 1 wavelength region revealed the existence of co stretching vibrations in alcohols and carboxylic groups of esp the co stretching for aliphatic amines and alcohols were reported in the biosorption process of cr vi 57 59 however the msp exhibits an enhanced peak at 2513 cm 1 attributed to the oh stretching vibrations in a carboxylic group numerous studies have revealed that oxygen containing functional groups such as cooh and oh have a high affinity for aromatic structures via n interaction and hydrogen bonding formation 60 63 the presence of these groups on msp surface may promote the adsorption of cr vi 46 62 63 when comparing the ftir spectra of esp and msp it is conceivable to have seen variations and fluctuations in the strength of various absorption bands the results revealed the presence of nh and oh stretching of amino and hydroxyl groups for both adsorbents at 3200 3500 cm 1 46 64 besides some other stretching such as co nh cn and oh in ester saturated aliphatic aliphatic amines and carboxylic groups were also recorded at the wavelength range 1735 1033 948 and 896 cm 1 for hap and 2854 1750 1633 and 1242 cm 1 for mmac 16 60 the presence of cr vi on hap was further demonstrated by the appearance of additional peaks at 601 1056 and 1665 cm 1 indicative of the cbr cn and cc stretching vibrations of the alcohol phenol and aromatic benzene rings respectively significant peaks were found for mmac after adsorption with co cc oh stretching vibrations of the aromatic hexavalent benzene ring at 3352 1734 and 1035 cm 1 regions 65 these occurrences demonstrated that cr vi was successfully absorbed into the mmac surface according to kabir et al 44 45 the negatively charged chromium species cro4 2 and hcro4 could bind to the maximum sharp peaks of acidic functional clusters co oh and cc for hap and oh and co nh cooh and cc for mmac on the adsorbent surfaces significantly increasing cr vi adsorption capacity from te the pore volume and the pore size measured for hap and mmac were 0 98 and 0 47 cm3 g and 22 61 and 16 67 nm respectively these findings supported the mesoporous structures of the adsorbents because this type of structures have pore volume and pore size in the range of 0 1 1 0 cm3 g and 2 50 nm respectively 26 the phpzc refers a specific level of ph at which the net surface charge of the materials is regarded as zero the phpzc in this experiment was determined to be 4 8 and 5 9 for hap and mmac respectively as shown in fig 5c below this ph protonation occurs in the adsorbent surface which produced hcro4 whereas above this ph deprotonation occurred by generating cro4 2 and oh thus the cr vi removal percentage increased due to its electrostatic attraction repulsion force of the positive negative charges of ph 60 65 3 2 effectiveness of hexavalent chromium adsorption under key experimental context the development of novel environmentally valuable and economic adsorbents for removing contaminants from wastewater is considered a significant challenge to compare with other naturally modified and chemically synthesized adsorbents table 3 lists the adsorption effectiveness of hap and mmac under various operating conditions which revealed hap and mmac have remarkable removal efficiencies of cr vi the present study concentrated on cr vi removal by both adsorbents in different time frames varying from 0 to 90 min fig s3a initially the adsorption was fast and the equilibrium time for both adsorbents was 30 min from equilibration time the removal percentage showed a decreasing pattern and seemed to be stable due to the lack of accessible gaps and porosity on the adsorbent s surface 66 solution ph significantly influences the cr vi adsorption process in this experiment the effect of solution ph was investigated ranging from 1 to 9 and the removal efficiency was observed to be maximum in acidic conditions as seen in fig s3b the highest cr vi removal achieved was 98 83 and 96 90 for hap and mmac respectively at ph 3 99 and 5 the removal efficiency was gradually decreased with increasing ph values for both adsorbents the electrostatic attraction and electro repulsive forces provided acidic ph to be optimal for effective cr vi removal from te which was also supported by the findings of phpzc 102 removal efficiency increased with increasing dosages of 1 to 5 g l as shown in fig s3c the results show that the optimal adsorption dosage for this experiment was 3 g l for both adsorbents this adsorption pattern allowed more cr vi to be binded to the surface of adsorbents because of the presence of more surface binding sites due to the micro porous structure of the adsorbent as validated by fesem and bet characterization 60 however further dose increases above 3 g l may cover the available adsorption sites leading to decreased cr vi adsorption similar findings were reported by kumar and meikap 67 and mondal and chakraborty 103 the adsorption experiment was carried out under optimal conditions adsorbent dosage of 3 g l solution ph of 3 99 after te was diluted using tap water in varied ratios i e 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 v v the results are displayed in fig s3d which shows a continual increase of cr vi removal with increasing te dilution up to 90 when the dilution was 90 the amount of cr vi elimination increased from 55 7 to 98 83 and that might be due to the saturation of the adsorbent s sorption sites which lowers the efficiency of cr vi adsorption 52 additionally the efficacy of cr vi adsorption from te was investigated by hap and mmac in the presence of different metal ions in table 1 a comparison of the characteristics of untreated and treated te has been assessed for specific quality parameters under optimal conditions it was observed that the cr vi concentration in te decreased 98 83 from 300 01 to 3 5 mg l while other metallic ions such as fe pd cu and zn were eliminated to the extent of up to 85 on the contrary cd ni and mn were reduced by up to 70 the maximum reduction of bod and cod was recorded at 80 77 and 71 6 respectively and the elimination of ts and tds was 36 03 and 63 25 respectively moreover ec dropped to 62 81 while turbidity decreased to 90 11 3 3 adsorption modelling the experimental equilibrium data for cr vi adsorption onto hap and mmac were modelled by four classical isotherm models i e langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich dr model these models parameter values are shown in table 4 along with their fitting behavior in fig 6 the regression coefficient r2 was used to determine the models appropriateness the higher r2 value recommends that the model explicitly improve the adsorption process 68 the langmuir and freundlich models explained the experimental results better r2 0 997 for hap and r2 0 995 for mmac for both adsorbents along with lower rmse and mpsd values compared to temkin and dr isotherm models however based on the errors calculated in this study the langmuir model best described the cr vi sorption process the langmuir model is typically employed for monolayer sorption of metals on homogeneous adsorbent surfaces while the freundlich model is used when there is heterogeneity on the surface of the materials for multilayer adsorption 69 for the freundlich isotherm model the value n was determined to be 0 1 n 1 for this investigation suggesting favorable adsorption due to the heterogeneity of the adsorbents also validated by fesem s findings and dr model the maximum removal capacity q max by hap and mmac was found to be 297 65 and 280 23 mg g correspondingly according to the langmuir model which was proximate to experimental q e exp values the r l values for hap and mmac were 0 26 and 0 89 l mg respectively indicating favorable cr vi adsorption the isotherms shapes can be either unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 favorable 0 r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 depending on the value of r l 44 45 nonetheless the temkin model describes the pattern of adsorption processes as either physical or chemical the b t value was found to be b t 40 kj mol for both adsorbents resulting in chemisorption phenomena of cr vi adsorption 70 71 the adsorption rate of experimental data was described with pfo pso and ipd models table 5 listed the parameter s values for the kinetic models according to the r2 value the pso and ipd models were best fitted with the experimental results r2 0 98 with minimal error values compared to the pfo model demonstrating negligible differences between experimental and theoretical data it can be happened from a discrepancy in adsorbate movement rate between the initial and final steps of the adsorption processes 10 72 thermodynamic models were used to explore the impact of temperature on the cr vi adsorption process with the help of different parameters such as i e gibb s free energy enthalpy and entropy the model s results are summarized in table 6 the negative value of δg 0 revealed that the adsorption was more favorable at higher temperatures reflecting the adsorption process s feasibility and spontaneity the positive values of δh 0 ensure that the adsorption capacity is increased with increasing temperature indicating the endothermic nature of cr vi adsorption 73 the negative value of δs 0 suggested an interconnected mechanism demonstrating no significant changes in the internal structures of hap and mmac evidently favoring adsorption at high temperatures the surface complexation model exhibited chemical bonding and electrostatic interactions between cr vi ions hcro4 and cro4 2 from te and the adsorbent s surface as anticipated by the winsgw algorithm the speciation of chromate 0 1 mm in a 1 mm nano3 electrolyte solution is described in fig 7 according to the findings hcro4 is the dominating species at ph 6 and cro4 2 is the governing species at ph 6 5 hcro4 was more easily adsorbed on the surface active site owing to the low adsorption free energy compared with cro4 2 the scm model is comprised of one inner sphere surface complex soh2 cro4 2 and another outer sphere complex soh cro4 2 49 the speciation of cr vi sorbed complexes proposed in this study indicated that the inner sphere compound dominated at ph below 6 0 which was validated by the effect of solution ph and phpzc the tendency to develop the inner sphere complexes at low ph has also been found for cr vi adsorption onto birnessite ferrihydrite illite and kaolinite 51 the artificial neural network ann models were mainly used to develop a feed forward network for performance analysis of the process parameters for the cr vi adsorption process fig s4 displayed the regression graph for the neural network model the experimental findings were in the input layer of the ann model and the cr vi elimination percentage was shown in the output layer after several training cycles the data showed a strong correlation between the experimental and simulation results with the lowest mse and most outstanding r values i e 0 999 for hap and 0 998 for mmac 44 3 4 adsorption mechanisms our findings conclude that the cr vi adsorption process follows a complex mechanism based on the adsorbate adsorbent characteristics and other process parameters based on these interactions a proposed adsorptive mechanism of hap and mmac has been presented in fig 8 which is described in four consecutive pathways 1 morphological characteristics of the adsorbents suggested meso microporous features consisting of various types of layers and surfaces of the adsorbents which were validated by fesem and bet analysis in conjunction with ipd models 69 2 hydrogen bonding occurs between the functional groups of both adsorbents co oh ch for hap and oh co nh cooh cc for mmac and cr vi which contains cooh and oh group as an electron donor in aqueous media the hydrogen bonds of cr vi interacted with the oh groups existing at the surface of adsorbents to improve the adsorption performance 44 45 74 3 surface complexation reactions provided an electrostatic interaction between cr vi and the functional groups present in the adsorbents through the inner sphere surface complex soh2 cro4 2 and one outer sphere complex soh cro4 2 the adsorbent surfaces became more protonated due to the oxygen containing functional groups and acidic environments encourage electrostatic interaction between cr vi ions hcro4 and cro4 2 and the protonated surface oh of the adsorbents which is supported by scm and phpzc 49 4 according to kinetic models the chemisorption dominated the cr vi adsorption process resulting in rapid and irreversible adsorption the endothermic nature of adsorption was more effective at high temperatures supported by the temkin and thermodynamic models as well as tga analysis 70 71 3 5 regeneration and recyclability study recycling and regeneration of the adsorbents after desorption are crucial for economic viability and large scale industrial operations 75 without drastically changing the removal efficiency the adsorbents can be recycled the present study used five desorbing agents for cr vi desorption i e 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m hno3 0 1 m hcl diw and 0 5 m koh as presented in fig 9a h2so4 hcl and hno3 had the highest desorption capacities i e 98 7 97 9 and 95 4 for hap and 94 6 93 8 and 90 6 for mmac respectively while koh and diw had negligible desorption capacities the desorption percentage of cr vi ions from both adsorbents was significantly higher for h2so4 hcl and hno3 compared to other eluents such as diw and koh because these strong acids have a high affinity for cr vi ions and can effectively desorb them from the surfaces of the hap and mmac 75 76 the high ionic strength of these acids overcomes the electrostatic interactions and surface complexation phenomena between cr vi ions hcro4 and cro4 2 and the protonated surface of the adsorbents 77 78 moreover the hydroxyl oh and carboxylic cooh functional groups present in hap and mmac could make it amenable to easy desorption of cr vi ions in the acidic solutions by ion exchange interactions 79 81 leading to a higher desorption percentage several previous studies also reported the significant cr vi desorption capacity of h2so4 hcl and hno3 compared to other desorbing agents 76 82 88 fig 9b c illustrated the adsorption desorption cycles for hap and mmac after being eluted with 0 1 m h2so4 indicated both adsorbents have an excellent adsorptive efficiency 120 mg g for hap and 105 mg g for mmac up to the sixth cycle of re uses on the other hand beyond the seventh cycle there was a negligible amount of regeneration capacity which can be caused due to the reduction of functional groups and surface areas of the adsorbents 64 3 6 performance assessment of fixed bed columns in this experiment the breakthrough curve was utilized to assess cr vi removal performances from te in a packed bed reactor at an initial cr vi concentration of 300 mg l and different flow rates were shown in fig 10 the study was performed in 200 ml of each diluted cr vi solution with a dose of 3 g l at ph 3 99 the bed height was controlled at 180 mm for each experiment and the breakthrough time for both adsorbents was counted to be 15 min the calculated results exhibited an s shape breakthrough curve with early breakthrough and late time tailing revealing favorable adsorption for mmac and highly favorable for hap adsorbent 48 4 conclusions leather tanning industries cause significant environmental pollution due to the release of toxic cr vi and other contaminants the present study developed two novel innovative and economic adsorbents for the remediation of cr vi from te the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study the meso microporous surface of the adsorbents was observed supported by bet ipd and isotherm models the major functional groups involved in cr vi adsorption process were co oh ch for hap and oh co nh cooh and cc for mmac initially the adsorption rate was fast and the equilibrium time for both adsorbents was 30 min from equilibration time the removal percentage showed a decreasing pattern and seemed stable due to the lack of accessible gaps and porosity on the adsorbent s surface the adsorption of cr vi is ph dependent and the adsorbents exhibited large surface area and highest stability under acidic conditions leading to the improved cr vi adsorption under batch and column scale operations supported by scm and phpzc the maximum removal efficiency of cr vi was found to be 98 83 and 96 90 for hap and mmac respectively at ph 3 99 adsorbent dosage of 3 g l contact time of 30 min and 25 c temperature the findings of ann model showed a strong correlation between the experimental and calculated values of process parameters implying that the adsorbents are suitable for varying process conditions thermodynamic models advised the endothermic nature of cr vi adsorption providing feasibility and spontaneity of the process the maximum reduction of bod and cod was recorded 80 77 and 71 6 respectively whereas the elimination of ts and tds was 36 03 and 63 25 correspondingly moreover ec dropped to 62 81 while turbidity removal was observed 90 11 the column study exhibited an s shaped breakthrough curve with early breakthrough and late time tailing revealing favorable adsorption for mmac and highly favorable for hap adsorbent electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding and redox reaction dominated by inner surface complexation processes were involved in cr vi adsorption process leading to chemisorption mechanisms both adsorbents exhibited excellent regeneration and reusability capacity of cr vi removal up to the sixth cycle in essence the present study concludes that both adsorbents are highly effective at removing cr vi and other contaminants the adsorbents are novel and economical and can be a feasible option for treating cr vi and other contaminants in a large scale te moreover sustainable management

12606,the bright potential of microalgae as a biological phycoremediation agent could not only treat wastewater but also be feasible to be utilized as raw material for third generation biofuel however the ability of microalgae in treating different water sources varies owing to different water characteristics thus influencing the cost of water treatment this study aims to screen the best microalgae including chlorella vulgaris cv characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 chlorella sp ukm8 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 in performing phycoremediation efficiency to treat different water sources palm oil mill effluent pome municipal wastewater and polluted surface water the findings show that all microalgae could grow in all water sources with the maximum specific growth rate in the range of 0 24 0 44 day 1 results indicated that pome was the best water source for phycoremediation with highest removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp depending on the microalgae species with removal percentage in the range of 50 to 71 principal component analysis pca results showed that microalgae worked best in reducing cod tn and tp in pome while the highest lipid produced by ukm9 in conclusion pome provides substantial nutrients to support microalgae growth with an accumulation of metabolites that can be beneficial for further applications keywords phycoremediation pome wastewater treatment microalgae data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microalgae have been used in various applications all over the world due to its simplicity in structure and growth needs capability in surviving various environmental conditions and versatility in producing a wide range of end products in fact while producing the promising amount of valuable end products microalgae could remediate unwanted nutrients in polluted water bodies which in turn acts as a growth source for microalgae this includes the assimilation of nitrogen and phosphorus for growth which are abundant in wastewaters according to resdi et al 1 efficient nutrient recycling after secondary treatment is possible with microalgae s ability to utilize remaining nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus for growth hence negative impacts towards water flow including eutrophication due to the discharge of wastewater in the abundance of inorganic chemicals such as nitrogen and phosphorus could be avoided 2 3 the phycoremediation of water is crucial as it may lead to adverse effects towards water quality as well as surface water values especially for industrial recreational and fishing purposes depletion of non renewable energy sources including fossil fuels which release high risk gases such as carbon dioxide nitrogen oxide sulphur oxide and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere could be achieved 4 hence wastewater could be a good source of cheap substrate in producing valuable third generation renewable energy as a competitive substitute for non renewable energy sources microalgae biomass containing carbohydrates and lipids could be the suitable feedstock for biofuel production 5 microalgae cultivation in wastewater offers an alternative to conventional forms of wastewater treatments given that they could provide tertiary biotreatment coupled with biomass generation this step could lead to extensive economic saving impacts by avoiding high priced wastewater treatment approaches while producing a high economic value of algal biomass 6 8 in addition due to microalgae s nature to conceivably adjust natural toxins into cell constituents harvested microalgae biomass can be further processed for biofuel biogas fish feeds and renewable energy productions hence this could greatly accomplish pollutant removal in a more ecologically friendly manner while being one of the ways out for our traditional energy resources depletion 9 10 11 in addition according to pahazri et al 12 the phycoremediation efficiency of microalgae was observed to have a dual role in treating wastewater and biomass production since malaysia is the producer and exporter of palm oil goods in the world the number of palm oil mills and their effluent discharge increases each year about 50 of 5 5 7 tons of water used in sterilizing palm fruit bunches as well as clarifying extracted oil in producing one ton of crude palm oil turns into palm oil mill effluent pome 13 14 the current practice of conventional ponding systems ends up with high amounts of unwanted nutrients and greenhouse gas emissions ghg indeed this system requires a large surface area and long hydraulic retention time hrts 15 referring to previous research pome from clarifier overflow after anaerobic digester recorded bod cod total phosphorus and total nitrogen of 675 44 mg l 2046 167 mg l 292 16 mg l and 195 6 mg l respectively 16 these values require another treatment as they did not meet the required standard discharge limit according to 17 in malaysia on the other hand although municipal wastewater and sanitation companies cover and operate 51 79 of entire malaysia for a total population of 72 42 study on determining microalgae based treatment is scarce currently malaysian wastewater treatment companies operated based on extensive use of primary and secondary treatment system besides that both treatment system discharges effluents which is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus 18 according to ariffin and sulaiman 19 sewage pollution in malaysian rivers should be our utmost concern looking at the worrying situation this is because water quality and quantity stress have greatly increased with the industrialisation as well as urbanisation in various countries including malaysia which sadly impacted water resources 8 therefore the use of microalgae as phycoremediation agent could be greatly sustainable in removing nutrients in wastewater 20 moreover polluted pond and river water due to point originates from a single and identifiable source such as a discharge pipe from sewerage plant or a factory or nonpoint pollution that comes from all sorts of places sources also need to be considered 21 this is because the surface water is the habitat for many living organisms even though it was also utilized for recreational and fishing activities in this study the phycoremediation ability of microalgae was tested on the surface water at alur ilmu universiti kebangsaan malaysia it has been reported that the value of cod 58 2 mg l bod 10 8 mg l oil and grease 154 4 mg l as well as total kjedahl nitrogen 7 01 mg l in alur ilmu pond exceeded class iib limitation of national water quality standard in malaysia 63 hence the need for adequate water treatment is crucial in maintaining a healthy environment the commercial microalgae such as chlorella vulgaris cv and local microalgae isolates such as characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 chlorella sp ukm8 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 have been extensively used to treat pome 5 22 24 to the best of our knowledge no studies have been done on the local microalgae isolates in remediating municipal wastewater and surface water therefore this research will indicates the feasibility of microalgae to treat different water sources such as effluent from municipal wastewater mw and contaminated surface water from alur ilmu pond ai universiti kebangsaan malaysia in this study both water sources contained significant amounts of pollutants such as nutrients and organic carbon this knowledge could evaluate each microalgae s performance in remediating different water samples while producing lipid carbohydrate and protein as their by products which would be beneficial locally and internationally 2 materials and methods 2 1 acclimatisation of microalgae in different water samples prior to cultivation in different water samples microalgae inoculum was prepared by inoculation of 30 v v of microalgae species cv ukm1 ukm2 ukm8 and ukm9 independently in sterile bold basal media bbm bbm was prepared using 250 mg l nano3 75 mg l k2hpo4 175 mg l kh2po4 25 mg l nacl 75 mg l mgso4 7h2o 25 mg l cacl2 2h2o 4 98 mg l feso4 7h2o 11 42 mg l h3bo3 50 mg l edta

microalgae inoculums was cultured in the 1 l duran bottle in different water samples 700 ml water samples and 300 ml inoculums acclimatisation the acclimatisation is carried out to ensure the feasibility of each microalga to grow under different water sources the acclimatisation process was carried out at temperature 25 2 c supplied with compressed air on flow rate of 1 l min 1 at a continuous light intensity of 190 μmol m 2 s 1 5 each culture was grown until their optical density reached 0 8 prior for cultivation in different water samples the optical density was measured based on the absorbance of 689 nm for cv 685 nm for ukm1 690 nm for ukm2 and ukm8 as well as 683 nm for ukm9 the wavelengths for measurement of optical density for each microalga are different due to different optimal wavelengths for each microalga 2 2 microalgae culture and growth in different water sample about 30 v v of each acclimatised microalgae species cv ukm1 ukm2 ukm8 and ukm9 were cultivated in triplicates independently in different water samples pome mw and ai for 14 days in 1000 ml duran bottles aerated for 24 h under continuous light intensity of 190 μmol m 2 s 1 each culture was sampled out every two days for further analysis growth curves were plotted by determining microalgae biomass using dry cell weight dcw analysis the dcw and biomass yield ydcw analysis were carried out according to japar et al 5 the determination of dcw was carried out in triplicates the dcw was calculated using eq 1 1 dcw g l w 2 w 1 sample volume l 1000 where w2 is the weight of the filter paper with dried biomass and w1 is the weight of a blank filter paper the biomass yield ydcw was calculated using eq 2 2 y dcw g l x 2 x 1 where x2 is the microalgae dcw at the end of cultivation and x1 is the microalgae dcw at the beginning of cultivation 2 3 sampling and characterization of water sample a total of 10 l water samples from three different places were collected in a 10 l polypropylene bottle and stored in a cold room before use municipal wastewater mw sample was taken from the grit chamber of the wastewater treatment plant indah water konsortium bandar baru bangi selangor malaysia next pome was collected in an anaerobic tank at tennamaram palm oil mill bestari jaya selangor malaysia lastly the surface water sample was taken from alur ilmu ai near to the cafeteria of the faculty of science and technology fst universiti kebangsaan malaysia table 1 shows the characteristics of different water samples used in this study 2 4 growth kinetic determination maximum specific growth rate μmax was measured using a logistic equation model as shown in eq 3 5 growth curves data were obtained and plotted in the matlab r2013b 3 x x o x max e μmaxt x max x o x o e μmaxt where x o is initial biomass x max is maximum biomass and t is time 2 5 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured according to hach method 8000 10072 and 10127 respectively based on the manufacturer protocol carbohydrate analysis in microalgae was determined using modified phenol and sulphuric acid methods 26 protein and lipid analysis were performed using bradford and folch method respectively 27 28 carbohydrate protein and lipid were computed with the spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 495 595 and 520 nm respectively 2 6 statistical analysis spss statistics was used in determining the significant difference of phycoremediation efficiency and biomass composition the analysis of variance anova test was done in determining the independence and homogeneity besides that a post hoc test was conducted to measure the significance of means and level set at p 0 05 principal component analysis pca was performed and analysed by minitab 19 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth parameter of microalgae in different water sample alur ilmu ai is located in universiti kebangsaan malaysia ai is a large storm water channel that serves to store water and flows into langat river selangor malaysia it was also considered contaminated by previous study due to exceeding the standard limit 29 therefore ai was chosen as subject matter for this study the comparison of other different types of wastewater municipal wastewater and pome was done to see the differences of microalgae growth and bioremediation efficiency for the benefits of the locals or for further practices the approach was carried out for the purpose of resource management while being easily adaptable to the current environment although the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in the ai sample is low this water source still has an organic content which enables it to support the growth of microalgae table 1 growth parameters of microalgae grown in ai mw and pome have been measured for 14 days based on the dry cell weight dcw to construct respective growth curves as shown in fig 1 as for the growth of microalgae in mw and ai the lag phase was shorter than pome this might be due to better light penetrations for microalgae growth the turbidity of mw 4 62 ntu and ai 5 16 ntu are lower compared to pome 358 67 ntu table 1 hence more light penetration to microalgae in the respective water samples besides that different characteristics such that higher total cod suspended solid nitrogen and phosphorus as indicated in table 1 corresponded to slow lag phase in order for the microalgae to adapt to the high contaminant in the pome sample table 2 shows the biomass yield and maximum specific growth rate μmax of each microalgae species grown in ai mw and pome after fitted to the logistic models the overall biomass yield ydcw shows that more growth can be seen in the pome sample than ai and mw table 2 the reason behind this might be because microalgae cultured in pome are bound to mixotrophic conditions 5 hence microalgae cells are more flexible towards light utilization as they could obtain carbon and nitrogen from pome while utilizing light as energy as shown in table 1 pome sample contains higher carbon and nutrient based on the cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus values thus less energy is needed to accumulate larger biomass volume despite having brownish pome colour as one of the limiting factors furthermore japar et al 5 also reported that the utilization of pome as a cultivation medium could generate higher biomass yields compared to that in bold s basal media bbm which is a commercial medium for microalgae growth apart from that due to more prolonged lag phase in pome than mw and ai microalgae biomass cultured in pome required a longer time to reach the exponential point as the biomass at the end of the treatment is more important to ensure the reusability of biomass after completion of treatment and safe disposal while producing high value end products this is considered better than ai and mw as both samples have lower ydcw towards the end of the cultivation the lower ydcw content in ai and mw might happen due to low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the wastewater samples as these nutrients are important for microalgae productivity and growth 30 nitrogen 1 18 mg l and phosphorus 0 1 91 mg l in ai and mw might have been used for microalgae growth upon reaching the end of the cultivation period the abundance of suspended components in pome might be the cause of the dark colour which consequently reduced the microalgae growth performance on the other hand the abundant source of nutrients including high phosphorus and nitrogen could be highly beneficial for this study according to mohd et al 31 pome carries both micro and macronutrients that are crucial for microalgae growth however high amounts of nutrients in pome might not be suitable for certain microalgae species this is due to the low resistance of some microalgae species towards concentrated nutrients limitations on performance in nutrient removal and growth of microalgae could happen due to the longer time needed by microalgae to adapt to new environments with low light penetration and high nutrient load 22 nevertheless different microalgae have different tolerance towards high nutrient concentration in this study characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 performs slightly better than others in producing biomass with the ydcw values of 0 61 g l 0 78 g l and 0 57 g l respectively table 2 characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 were found in previous studies with the ability to tolerate harsh pome conditions including high nutrient loads 32 33 it can be observed that the ydcw for microalgae grown in ai water samples is lower than that in mw this is due to the lower concentration of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in ai as indicated in table 1 the growth of microalgae in ai shows an increasing trend at the beginning of the cultivation and dropped at the end of the cultivation due to the lack of nutrients fig 1a at the beginning of the cultivation period the growth of microalgae was also supported by the remaining traced bbm which was used to cultured microalgae during inoculum preparation and acclimatisation period the amount of inoculum fed in the culture medium is 30 v v which can be considered the highest inoculums concentration for microalgae growth 23 3 2 phycoremediation efficiency of microalgae in different water sample analysis of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were performed to determine the efficiency of different microalgae species in influencing phycoremediation processes in different water samples fig 2 shows the percentage of cod tn and tp removal by five microalgae species in treating respective water samples it can be observed that different microalgae species show different performance in cod removal as indicated in fig 2a the performance was dependent on the microalgae metabolism and the ability of each microalga in breaking down organic materials in wastewater microalgae metabolism mainly consists of transport and biochemical processes whereby each microalgae species differs in nutrients uptake and conversion into materials for reproduction defence and growth 64 for example chlorella sp ukm8 significantly reduced cod 73 13 when cultivated in ai on the other hand c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 successfully reduced cod level in pome with 72 42 66 55 and 72 18 respectively chlorella is a robust microalgae species which could adapt and withstand most wastewater conditions even with heavy metals chlorella species were also observed in previous studies to remove 50 of cod 34 hazman et al 16 stated that chlorella sp ukm8 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 could reduce cod up to 56 59 the study also indicates that both microalgae could reduce total nitrogen and total phosphorus up to 65 and 34 respectively as per a study by hadiyanto et al 13 stated that chlorella sp could still grow and reduce cod in highly concentrated pome owing to the presence of tannic acid due to the dark pome colour this acid could inhibit the self shading effect from ensuring better photosynthetic reaction and light intensity 35 on the other hand scenedesmus sp ukm9 is more prominent in sizes which could effectively assimilate organic materials in pome nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater are crucial as it can be harmful to the environment due to the eutrophication effect based on three water samples chlorella sp ukm8 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 were recorded with the highest total nitrogen reduction 77 36 and 78 43 in pome compared to ai and mw fig 2b however all five microalgae species grown in ai and mw are not feasible to remove the nitrogen and phosphorus content this is due to the low nitrogen and phosphorus content in both ai and mw table 1 total nitrogen consists of the measurement of the total amount of organic nitrogen nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and ammonia nh3 as nitrogen consumption indicates microalgae growth nitrogen reduction percentage of scenedesmus sp ukm9 is comparable with its specific growth rate μmax table 2 this shows that the higher nitrogen content in pome resulted in higher specific growth rate however nitrite might also be toxic to certain microalgae and need to be detoxified in the chloroplast 36 therefore the photosynthetic metabolism of certain microalgae might be interrupted due to the toxicity effect and influence the nitrogen takes up by microalgae therefore this might be the reason for the remaining amount of total nitrogen content in ai and mw as indicated in fig 2b in addition microalgae are greatly dependent on their large surface area for nutrients water as well as carbon dioxide co2 uptake 37 this might be the reason for the higher tn removal by scenedesmus sp ukm9 which is due to its bigger size and larger surface area out of all tested microalgae species scenedesmus sp ukm9 has the largest size ranges from 6 807 to 12 35 μm 38 it is comparable with the other microalgae species with the size of 5 301 1 535 μm 3 606 μm and 3 56 μm for characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 and chlorella sp ukm8 respectively other than nitrogen phosphorus is another significant element that needs to be removed from water bodies which could also act as a nutrient source for microalgae growth according to laliberte et al 39 the removal of phosphorus by microalgae in wastewater can be evaluated by two different mechanisms namely biological assimilation during microalgae growth and chemical precipitation along with the decrease in biomass concentration all species in this study showed higher dcw at the end of the experiment this finding is parallel with a study by kamarudin et al 40 which proved that phosphorus was consumed by microalgae for their growth during the cultivation period looking at the most efficient strain in reducing phosphorus composition in pome c vulgaris cv performed the best with a total of 82 08 phosphorus removal fig 2c this result shows that c vulgaris cv can best assimilate excess phosphorus which is then stored in the cells in the form of polyphosphate granules 41 the algal metabolism of c vulgaris cv in pome works best in reducing phosphorus concentration apart from the others this might be due to its higher cell concentration specific growth rate maximum cell productivity and biomass content which were cultivated in the mixotrophic regime while being a robust microalgae species similar to a study by o connell and wilkie 42 overall c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 are most efficient in phycoremediation especially in pome samples due to the high cod tn and tp removal although microalgae are considered as photoautotrophic organisms these species might be an exception as these microalgae could also grow mixotrophically with the aid of both light energy and carbon source this study shows that they can perform not only in the photoautotrophic growth regime but also heterotrophic 43 it has been stated that there are various advantages of mixotrophic growth including prolonged exponential growth phase higher growth rates than both heterotrophic and autotrophic growth reduced biomass loss from respiration during the dark period and able to switch cultivation growth regime easily 44 3 3 biochemical composition in microalgae biomass microalgae biomass is a light driven source as a feedstock for third generation biofuel biohydrogen and high value protein the inner cell structure of microalgae consists of lipid bilayer which is monogalactosylglycerol and digalactosylglycerol according to singer and nicolson 45 proteins which can be categorized as integral and peripheral are embedded in lipid bilayer and then formed as liquid mosaic within this fluid membrane matrix components in membranes are able to rapidly move laterally while changing topographic distributions 46 to look at the cell constituent microalgae could level up the biomass compositions up to 40 of glycerol 80 of hydrocarbons and 80 of fatty acids under favorable surroundings 47 hence understanding the biochemical composition in microalgae while treating wastewater is crucial as these value added products were attained by utilizing microalgae biomass furthermore this study could be a way out of the increasingly low level of raw materials in producing valuable products using wastewater to produce these products is a good approach as the cost of microalgae cultivation can be covered by the wastewater treatment plant capital hence this process could lower the environmental payoff in which the investment is geared towards wastewater utilization rather than freshwater 48 3 3 1 carbohydrate carbohydrate is the main product of photosynthesis using atp nadph and metabolic reactions of carbon distribution in the calvin cycle ho et al 49 mentioned that although carbohydrate content in microalgae is species dependent it generally contains specific polysaccharides such as pectin agar and alginate besides composition of carbohydrates in microalgae can reach up to 50 w w in the form of starch and cellulose 49 carbohydrate production may be affected by several factors which includes nutrient content temperature salt stress light intensity and metabolism polytrophic autotrophic and heterotrophic 50 in this study the water sample used has different ph amount of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus cod and turbidity table 1 fig 3 a shows the comparison of carbohydrate production by microalgae grown in different water samples after 14 days treatment based on the three water samples highest carbohydrate accumulation can be observed in chlorella sp ukm8 grown in pome with an amount of 0 08 g l this might be because chlorella sp is not only listed as highest yielding microalgae but could also best adapt to various factors as per mentioned the reason behind the lower carbohydrate accumulation in c vulgaris cv characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 in pome might be due to the darker colour of pome as opposed to ai and mw fig 3a instead of accumulating carbohydrate reserved energy in microalgae cells were diverted to accommodate energy required to grow in dark medium similar to a study by japar et al 5 carbohydrates production is lower during stationary and exponential phase this is due to the usage of energy and carbons for cell and nuclear division 5 hence lower carbohydrate productions are obtained in pome at the end of the 14 days treatment c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 works best in producing significant amount of carbohydrate in ai with the values range of 0 027 to 0 064 g l on the other hand all microalgae species cultured in mw has no significant differences in carbohydrate production with the total range of 0 019 to 0 05 g l carbohydrate the reason behind better carbohydrate production in ai and mw might be due to the physically clearer water sample than pome hence more energy could be converted to carbohydrate production despite that carbohydrate production by microalgae is mostly species dependent and majorly affected by nutrients hence each microalgae species produces different carbohydrate compositions depending on the water sample used as different water samples has different nutrient content which in return affects the biomass production by microalgae 3 3 2 lipid microalgae are now gaining more attention as one of the major sources of biofuel however the cost of mass production has not yet reached a reasonable economical level 51 hence microalgae cultured in wastewater may not only aid in phycoremediation but could also act as a low cost biofuel source lipid production in microalgae is usually influenced by several factors including temperature light and nutrient concentration especially nitrogen 52 the microalgal cells produce lipids by undergoing morphological changes this also includes patterns of growth as well as biochemical and physiological processes 53 other than that lipid content in biomass serves as a source of microalgae energy sugars glycerol or bases that were esterified to fatty acids with carbon numbers of c12 c22 are some of the components of algal lipids fig 3b shows the comparison of lipid production by microalgae in water samples from mw ai and pome at the end of the 14 days of treatment based on water samples used scenedesmus sp ukm9 produces the highest lipid in pome with a value of 0 09 g l this indicates that pome is the most suitable water sample for lipid production as nitrogen has been removed from pome by microalgae scenedesmus sp ukm9 could produce highest lipid concentration parallel with a study that found higher content of lipids as much as 54 with a lower concentration of sodium nitrate 54 kao et al 55 has also stated that low nitrogen concentration contributes to lipid accumulation lipid production by microalgae was dependent on species in addition according to japar et al 5 instead of absorbing energy from sunlight and organic compounds for lipid accumulations microalgae cells might redirect the energy for development of other compounds this might be the reason behind lower lipid production in other microalgae species and samples in addition based on fig 3b the highest lipid production by chlorella sp ukm2 in ai as well as c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 in mw with the yield of 0 004 0 007 g l might be due to the low level of nitrogen in each water sample it has been stated by widjaja et al 56 that c vulgaris has increased lipid content with lower nitrogen concentration in this case chlorella species happens to favor lipid production in deprived nitrogen concentration interestingly scenedesmus sp ukm9 has the ability to produce lipids in high nutrient media such as pome as opposed to others this might be because of the better adaptability as well as size and length of scenedesmus sp ukm9 supported by trainor and egan 57 the amount of lipid by scenedesmus sp is higher compared to the other species due to its pyrenoid shape in addition according to aratboni et al 58 the larger the cell size of the microalgae the more lipid globules can be accumulated in the cytosol chloroplasts and endoplasmic reticulum of microalgae microalgae are also microorganisms that depend on cell surface area for absorption and release of nutrients including the production of lipids in cells to conclude the ability to produce lipid by microalgae is greatly dependent on species and factors such lipid extraction nitrogen depletion and light penetration 13 in this study carbons fixed in photosynthesis are diverted from protein synthesis pathway to either lipid or carbohydrate synthesis pathway as overall total lipid composition is greater than protein composition 3 3 3 protein protein is a major component of microalgae biomass as some microalgae account for very high levels of protein typically about 40 60 of the total dry weight of the biomass 59 protein content in microalgae can be manipulated or influenced by several factors such as nitrogen supply light intensity and quality mineral insulation climate as well as cell life 60 fig 3c shows the composition of protein in microalgae grown in mw ai and pome after 14 days of treatment however based on the results there are no significant differences between microalgae species in all water samples protein concentration in pome ai and mw resulted in protein production ranging from 0 12 to 0 2 g l with no significant difference between species as nitrogen is the building blocks for protein nitrogen is vital in protein synthesis as well as functional and structural systems hence production of crude protein content is decreased along with the nitrogen reduction at the end of the treatment similar to a study by pancha et al 61 besides that wang et al 62 also stated that there are possibilities of suspended particles in wastewater to not be metabolized by microalgae which end up being remained in the slurry without being expressed as primary metabolites including proteins not only that a study by japar et al 5 also found that protein accumulations are not only affected by nitrogen concentration but also acclimatisation and prolonged photoperiod looking at this finding the day and time selected to harvest protein should also be taken into consideration to avoid prolonged photoperiod for better protein yield this is because the phycobilisomes which are crucial in light harvesting antennae might have been degraded due to these factors resulting in lower protein production 5 hence lower protein production is obtained at the end of the experiment with no significant differences across species 3 4 principal component analysis pca pca were conducted and analysed to clearly understand the correlations between factors and responses in this study water sample and microalgae act as factors while phycoremediation efficiency and biochemical composition are the responses pca is chosen due to its ability in providing the best perspective on observations as well as data assessment as shown in fig 4 overall accumulation of biochemical composition and carbon as well as nutrients removals were plotted in the score plots and loading plot score plot determines the data distribution whereas loading plot describes the direction of biomass composition cod as well as nutrients tp and tn removal looking at the first component of loading plot pc1 in fig 4a the responses were widely distributed along the horizontal direction yet cod tn and tp were closer to each other compared to protein carbohydrate and lipid the same result is obtained for the second component of loading plot pc2 results of the different water samples ai mw and pome towards responses could be obtained from the score plot in fig 4b pome is separately grouped from ai and mw this result not only shows that there is significant effect of water samples on cod tn and tp removal by microalgae yet pome was located nearest to the responses namely cod tn tp and lipid hence it can be concluded that microalgae removed cod nitrogen and phosphorus best in pome while producing lipid referring to fig 4c c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 works best in reducing cod tn and tp in pome as it is positioned near the four responses interestingly scenedesmus sp ukm9 is the only species that is located nearest to the lipid response in pome as for water sample ai lipids are best produced by chlorella sp ukm2 meanwhile in mw chlorella sp ukm8 produces protein the best scenedesmus sp ukm9 in ai produces the best carbohydrate as they were positioned near to carbohydrate response scenedesmus sp has gained attention as not only an efficient bioremediation agent yet it is aimed to be used as main component in biofuel productions scenedesmus sp has been proven to phycoremediate wastewaters in lowering the cod bod tn and tp content in the water bodies similarly it has also been proven by pca analyses that scenedesmus sp ukm9 could phycoremediate best in pome while producing significant amount of lipid chlorella species could survive in various environmental conditions while producing a significant amount of biochemical constituents and phycoremediate respective water bodies it has also been documented by hadiyanto et al 23 that chlorella sp could produce higher biomass yield with lower specific growth rate in this case looking at the pca result chlorella sp ukm8 might have produced high biomass yield in the form of protein hence it is proven that the types of water samples and microalgae strains are the factors that affect the biochemical composition and phycoremediation efficiency 4 conclusion based on the overall results of the study pome is the most suitable water sample used for phycoremediation process this is due to the higher nutrient content in pome on the other hand most suitable microalgae species for treating wastewater measured by cod tn and tp are c vulgaris cv 45 82 chlorella sp ukm2 49 70 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 58 78 in pome all microalgae species produce different biomass composition based on the water samples used chlorella sp ukm2 in ai and chlorella sp ukm8 in pome showed highest carbohydrate content scenedesmus sp ukm9 in pome on the other hand produced the highest amount of lipid there are no significant differences for protein accumulation in all microalgae species inoculated in all water samples these results were majorly influenced on microalgae species and nutrient contents in wastewaters as nutrients content is one of the most critical factors for microalgae biochemical composition productivity hence pome could be utilized for future phycoremediation processes and productions of valuable end products declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12606,the bright potential of microalgae as a biological phycoremediation agent could not only treat wastewater but also be feasible to be utilized as raw material for third generation biofuel however the ability of microalgae in treating different water sources varies owing to different water characteristics thus influencing the cost of water treatment this study aims to screen the best microalgae including chlorella vulgaris cv characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 chlorella sp ukm8 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 in performing phycoremediation efficiency to treat different water sources palm oil mill effluent pome municipal wastewater and polluted surface water the findings show that all microalgae could grow in all water sources with the maximum specific growth rate in the range of 0 24 0 44 day 1 results indicated that pome was the best water source for phycoremediation with highest removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp depending on the microalgae species with removal percentage in the range of 50 to 71 principal component analysis pca results showed that microalgae worked best in reducing cod tn and tp in pome while the highest lipid produced by ukm9 in conclusion pome provides substantial nutrients to support microalgae growth with an accumulation of metabolites that can be beneficial for further applications keywords phycoremediation pome wastewater treatment microalgae data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microalgae have been used in various applications all over the world due to its simplicity in structure and growth needs capability in surviving various environmental conditions and versatility in producing a wide range of end products in fact while producing the promising amount of valuable end products microalgae could remediate unwanted nutrients in polluted water bodies which in turn acts as a growth source for microalgae this includes the assimilation of nitrogen and phosphorus for growth which are abundant in wastewaters according to resdi et al 1 efficient nutrient recycling after secondary treatment is possible with microalgae s ability to utilize remaining nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus for growth hence negative impacts towards water flow including eutrophication due to the discharge of wastewater in the abundance of inorganic chemicals such as nitrogen and phosphorus could be avoided 2 3 the phycoremediation of water is crucial as it may lead to adverse effects towards water quality as well as surface water values especially for industrial recreational and fishing purposes depletion of non renewable energy sources including fossil fuels which release high risk gases such as carbon dioxide nitrogen oxide sulphur oxide and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere could be achieved 4 hence wastewater could be a good source of cheap substrate in producing valuable third generation renewable energy as a competitive substitute for non renewable energy sources microalgae biomass containing carbohydrates and lipids could be the suitable feedstock for biofuel production 5 microalgae cultivation in wastewater offers an alternative to conventional forms of wastewater treatments given that they could provide tertiary biotreatment coupled with biomass generation this step could lead to extensive economic saving impacts by avoiding high priced wastewater treatment approaches while producing a high economic value of algal biomass 6 8 in addition due to microalgae s nature to conceivably adjust natural toxins into cell constituents harvested microalgae biomass can be further processed for biofuel biogas fish feeds and renewable energy productions hence this could greatly accomplish pollutant removal in a more ecologically friendly manner while being one of the ways out for our traditional energy resources depletion 9 10 11 in addition according to pahazri et al 12 the phycoremediation efficiency of microalgae was observed to have a dual role in treating wastewater and biomass production since malaysia is the producer and exporter of palm oil goods in the world the number of palm oil mills and their effluent discharge increases each year about 50 of 5 5 7 tons of water used in sterilizing palm fruit bunches as well as clarifying extracted oil in producing one ton of crude palm oil turns into palm oil mill effluent pome 13 14 the current practice of conventional ponding systems ends up with high amounts of unwanted nutrients and greenhouse gas emissions ghg indeed this system requires a large surface area and long hydraulic retention time hrts 15 referring to previous research pome from clarifier overflow after anaerobic digester recorded bod cod total phosphorus and total nitrogen of 675 44 mg l 2046 167 mg l 292 16 mg l and 195 6 mg l respectively 16 these values require another treatment as they did not meet the required standard discharge limit according to 17 in malaysia on the other hand although municipal wastewater and sanitation companies cover and operate 51 79 of entire malaysia for a total population of 72 42 study on determining microalgae based treatment is scarce currently malaysian wastewater treatment companies operated based on extensive use of primary and secondary treatment system besides that both treatment system discharges effluents which is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus 18 according to ariffin and sulaiman 19 sewage pollution in malaysian rivers should be our utmost concern looking at the worrying situation this is because water quality and quantity stress have greatly increased with the industrialisation as well as urbanisation in various countries including malaysia which sadly impacted water resources 8 therefore the use of microalgae as phycoremediation agent could be greatly sustainable in removing nutrients in wastewater 20 moreover polluted pond and river water due to point originates from a single and identifiable source such as a discharge pipe from sewerage plant or a factory or nonpoint pollution that comes from all sorts of places sources also need to be considered 21 this is because the surface water is the habitat for many living organisms even though it was also utilized for recreational and fishing activities in this study the phycoremediation ability of microalgae was tested on the surface water at alur ilmu universiti kebangsaan malaysia it has been reported that the value of cod 58 2 mg l bod 10 8 mg l oil and grease 154 4 mg l as well as total kjedahl nitrogen 7 01 mg l in alur ilmu pond exceeded class iib limitation of national water quality standard in malaysia 63 hence the need for adequate water treatment is crucial in maintaining a healthy environment the commercial microalgae such as chlorella vulgaris cv and local microalgae isolates such as characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 chlorella sp ukm8 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 have been extensively used to treat pome 5 22 24 to the best of our knowledge no studies have been done on the local microalgae isolates in remediating municipal wastewater and surface water therefore this research will indicates the feasibility of microalgae to treat different water sources such as effluent from municipal wastewater mw and contaminated surface water from alur ilmu pond ai universiti kebangsaan malaysia in this study both water sources contained significant amounts of pollutants such as nutrients and organic carbon this knowledge could evaluate each microalgae s performance in remediating different water samples while producing lipid carbohydrate and protein as their by products which would be beneficial locally and internationally 2 materials and methods 2 1 acclimatisation of microalgae in different water samples prior to cultivation in different water samples microalgae inoculum was prepared by inoculation of 30 v v of microalgae species cv ukm1 ukm2 ukm8 and ukm9 independently in sterile bold basal media bbm bbm was prepared using 250 mg l nano3 75 mg l k2hpo4 175 mg l kh2po4 25 mg l nacl 75 mg l mgso4 7h2o 25 mg l cacl2 2h2o 4 98 mg l feso4 7h2o 11 42 mg l h3bo3 50 mg l edta

microalgae inoculums was cultured in the 1 l duran bottle in different water samples 700 ml water samples and 300 ml inoculums acclimatisation the acclimatisation is carried out to ensure the feasibility of each microalga to grow under different water sources the acclimatisation process was carried out at temperature 25 2 c supplied with compressed air on flow rate of 1 l min 1 at a continuous light intensity of 190 μmol m 2 s 1 5 each culture was grown until their optical density reached 0 8 prior for cultivation in different water samples the optical density was measured based on the absorbance of 689 nm for cv 685 nm for ukm1 690 nm for ukm2 and ukm8 as well as 683 nm for ukm9 the wavelengths for measurement of optical density for each microalga are different due to different optimal wavelengths for each microalga 2 2 microalgae culture and growth in different water sample about 30 v v of each acclimatised microalgae species cv ukm1 ukm2 ukm8 and ukm9 were cultivated in triplicates independently in different water samples pome mw and ai for 14 days in 1000 ml duran bottles aerated for 24 h under continuous light intensity of 190 μmol m 2 s 1 each culture was sampled out every two days for further analysis growth curves were plotted by determining microalgae biomass using dry cell weight dcw analysis the dcw and biomass yield ydcw analysis were carried out according to japar et al 5 the determination of dcw was carried out in triplicates the dcw was calculated using eq 1 1 dcw g l w 2 w 1 sample volume l 1000 where w2 is the weight of the filter paper with dried biomass and w1 is the weight of a blank filter paper the biomass yield ydcw was calculated using eq 2 2 y dcw g l x 2 x 1 where x2 is the microalgae dcw at the end of cultivation and x1 is the microalgae dcw at the beginning of cultivation 2 3 sampling and characterization of water sample a total of 10 l water samples from three different places were collected in a 10 l polypropylene bottle and stored in a cold room before use municipal wastewater mw sample was taken from the grit chamber of the wastewater treatment plant indah water konsortium bandar baru bangi selangor malaysia next pome was collected in an anaerobic tank at tennamaram palm oil mill bestari jaya selangor malaysia lastly the surface water sample was taken from alur ilmu ai near to the cafeteria of the faculty of science and technology fst universiti kebangsaan malaysia table 1 shows the characteristics of different water samples used in this study 2 4 growth kinetic determination maximum specific growth rate μmax was measured using a logistic equation model as shown in eq 3 5 growth curves data were obtained and plotted in the matlab r2013b 3 x x o x max e μmaxt x max x o x o e μmaxt where x o is initial biomass x max is maximum biomass and t is time 2 5 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured according to hach method 8000 10072 and 10127 respectively based on the manufacturer protocol carbohydrate analysis in microalgae was determined using modified phenol and sulphuric acid methods 26 protein and lipid analysis were performed using bradford and folch method respectively 27 28 carbohydrate protein and lipid were computed with the spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 495 595 and 520 nm respectively 2 6 statistical analysis spss statistics was used in determining the significant difference of phycoremediation efficiency and biomass composition the analysis of variance anova test was done in determining the independence and homogeneity besides that a post hoc test was conducted to measure the significance of means and level set at p 0 05 principal component analysis pca was performed and analysed by minitab 19 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth parameter of microalgae in different water sample alur ilmu ai is located in universiti kebangsaan malaysia ai is a large storm water channel that serves to store water and flows into langat river selangor malaysia it was also considered contaminated by previous study due to exceeding the standard limit 29 therefore ai was chosen as subject matter for this study the comparison of other different types of wastewater municipal wastewater and pome was done to see the differences of microalgae growth and bioremediation efficiency for the benefits of the locals or for further practices the approach was carried out for the purpose of resource management while being easily adaptable to the current environment although the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in the ai sample is low this water source still has an organic content which enables it to support the growth of microalgae table 1 growth parameters of microalgae grown in ai mw and pome have been measured for 14 days based on the dry cell weight dcw to construct respective growth curves as shown in fig 1 as for the growth of microalgae in mw and ai the lag phase was shorter than pome this might be due to better light penetrations for microalgae growth the turbidity of mw 4 62 ntu and ai 5 16 ntu are lower compared to pome 358 67 ntu table 1 hence more light penetration to microalgae in the respective water samples besides that different characteristics such that higher total cod suspended solid nitrogen and phosphorus as indicated in table 1 corresponded to slow lag phase in order for the microalgae to adapt to the high contaminant in the pome sample table 2 shows the biomass yield and maximum specific growth rate μmax of each microalgae species grown in ai mw and pome after fitted to the logistic models the overall biomass yield ydcw shows that more growth can be seen in the pome sample than ai and mw table 2 the reason behind this might be because microalgae cultured in pome are bound to mixotrophic conditions 5 hence microalgae cells are more flexible towards light utilization as they could obtain carbon and nitrogen from pome while utilizing light as energy as shown in table 1 pome sample contains higher carbon and nutrient based on the cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus values thus less energy is needed to accumulate larger biomass volume despite having brownish pome colour as one of the limiting factors furthermore japar et al 5 also reported that the utilization of pome as a cultivation medium could generate higher biomass yields compared to that in bold s basal media bbm which is a commercial medium for microalgae growth apart from that due to more prolonged lag phase in pome than mw and ai microalgae biomass cultured in pome required a longer time to reach the exponential point as the biomass at the end of the treatment is more important to ensure the reusability of biomass after completion of treatment and safe disposal while producing high value end products this is considered better than ai and mw as both samples have lower ydcw towards the end of the cultivation the lower ydcw content in ai and mw might happen due to low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the wastewater samples as these nutrients are important for microalgae productivity and growth 30 nitrogen 1 18 mg l and phosphorus 0 1 91 mg l in ai and mw might have been used for microalgae growth upon reaching the end of the cultivation period the abundance of suspended components in pome might be the cause of the dark colour which consequently reduced the microalgae growth performance on the other hand the abundant source of nutrients including high phosphorus and nitrogen could be highly beneficial for this study according to mohd et al 31 pome carries both micro and macronutrients that are crucial for microalgae growth however high amounts of nutrients in pome might not be suitable for certain microalgae species this is due to the low resistance of some microalgae species towards concentrated nutrients limitations on performance in nutrient removal and growth of microalgae could happen due to the longer time needed by microalgae to adapt to new environments with low light penetration and high nutrient load 22 nevertheless different microalgae have different tolerance towards high nutrient concentration in this study characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 performs slightly better than others in producing biomass with the ydcw values of 0 61 g l 0 78 g l and 0 57 g l respectively table 2 characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 were found in previous studies with the ability to tolerate harsh pome conditions including high nutrient loads 32 33 it can be observed that the ydcw for microalgae grown in ai water samples is lower than that in mw this is due to the lower concentration of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in ai as indicated in table 1 the growth of microalgae in ai shows an increasing trend at the beginning of the cultivation and dropped at the end of the cultivation due to the lack of nutrients fig 1a at the beginning of the cultivation period the growth of microalgae was also supported by the remaining traced bbm which was used to cultured microalgae during inoculum preparation and acclimatisation period the amount of inoculum fed in the culture medium is 30 v v which can be considered the highest inoculums concentration for microalgae growth 23 3 2 phycoremediation efficiency of microalgae in different water sample analysis of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were performed to determine the efficiency of different microalgae species in influencing phycoremediation processes in different water samples fig 2 shows the percentage of cod tn and tp removal by five microalgae species in treating respective water samples it can be observed that different microalgae species show different performance in cod removal as indicated in fig 2a the performance was dependent on the microalgae metabolism and the ability of each microalga in breaking down organic materials in wastewater microalgae metabolism mainly consists of transport and biochemical processes whereby each microalgae species differs in nutrients uptake and conversion into materials for reproduction defence and growth 64 for example chlorella sp ukm8 significantly reduced cod 73 13 when cultivated in ai on the other hand c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 successfully reduced cod level in pome with 72 42 66 55 and 72 18 respectively chlorella is a robust microalgae species which could adapt and withstand most wastewater conditions even with heavy metals chlorella species were also observed in previous studies to remove 50 of cod 34 hazman et al 16 stated that chlorella sp ukm8 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 could reduce cod up to 56 59 the study also indicates that both microalgae could reduce total nitrogen and total phosphorus up to 65 and 34 respectively as per a study by hadiyanto et al 13 stated that chlorella sp could still grow and reduce cod in highly concentrated pome owing to the presence of tannic acid due to the dark pome colour this acid could inhibit the self shading effect from ensuring better photosynthetic reaction and light intensity 35 on the other hand scenedesmus sp ukm9 is more prominent in sizes which could effectively assimilate organic materials in pome nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater are crucial as it can be harmful to the environment due to the eutrophication effect based on three water samples chlorella sp ukm8 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 were recorded with the highest total nitrogen reduction 77 36 and 78 43 in pome compared to ai and mw fig 2b however all five microalgae species grown in ai and mw are not feasible to remove the nitrogen and phosphorus content this is due to the low nitrogen and phosphorus content in both ai and mw table 1 total nitrogen consists of the measurement of the total amount of organic nitrogen nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and ammonia nh3 as nitrogen consumption indicates microalgae growth nitrogen reduction percentage of scenedesmus sp ukm9 is comparable with its specific growth rate μmax table 2 this shows that the higher nitrogen content in pome resulted in higher specific growth rate however nitrite might also be toxic to certain microalgae and need to be detoxified in the chloroplast 36 therefore the photosynthetic metabolism of certain microalgae might be interrupted due to the toxicity effect and influence the nitrogen takes up by microalgae therefore this might be the reason for the remaining amount of total nitrogen content in ai and mw as indicated in fig 2b in addition microalgae are greatly dependent on their large surface area for nutrients water as well as carbon dioxide co2 uptake 37 this might be the reason for the higher tn removal by scenedesmus sp ukm9 which is due to its bigger size and larger surface area out of all tested microalgae species scenedesmus sp ukm9 has the largest size ranges from 6 807 to 12 35 μm 38 it is comparable with the other microalgae species with the size of 5 301 1 535 μm 3 606 μm and 3 56 μm for characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 and chlorella sp ukm8 respectively other than nitrogen phosphorus is another significant element that needs to be removed from water bodies which could also act as a nutrient source for microalgae growth according to laliberte et al 39 the removal of phosphorus by microalgae in wastewater can be evaluated by two different mechanisms namely biological assimilation during microalgae growth and chemical precipitation along with the decrease in biomass concentration all species in this study showed higher dcw at the end of the experiment this finding is parallel with a study by kamarudin et al 40 which proved that phosphorus was consumed by microalgae for their growth during the cultivation period looking at the most efficient strain in reducing phosphorus composition in pome c vulgaris cv performed the best with a total of 82 08 phosphorus removal fig 2c this result shows that c vulgaris cv can best assimilate excess phosphorus which is then stored in the cells in the form of polyphosphate granules 41 the algal metabolism of c vulgaris cv in pome works best in reducing phosphorus concentration apart from the others this might be due to its higher cell concentration specific growth rate maximum cell productivity and biomass content which were cultivated in the mixotrophic regime while being a robust microalgae species similar to a study by o connell and wilkie 42 overall c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 are most efficient in phycoremediation especially in pome samples due to the high cod tn and tp removal although microalgae are considered as photoautotrophic organisms these species might be an exception as these microalgae could also grow mixotrophically with the aid of both light energy and carbon source this study shows that they can perform not only in the photoautotrophic growth regime but also heterotrophic 43 it has been stated that there are various advantages of mixotrophic growth including prolonged exponential growth phase higher growth rates than both heterotrophic and autotrophic growth reduced biomass loss from respiration during the dark period and able to switch cultivation growth regime easily 44 3 3 biochemical composition in microalgae biomass microalgae biomass is a light driven source as a feedstock for third generation biofuel biohydrogen and high value protein the inner cell structure of microalgae consists of lipid bilayer which is monogalactosylglycerol and digalactosylglycerol according to singer and nicolson 45 proteins which can be categorized as integral and peripheral are embedded in lipid bilayer and then formed as liquid mosaic within this fluid membrane matrix components in membranes are able to rapidly move laterally while changing topographic distributions 46 to look at the cell constituent microalgae could level up the biomass compositions up to 40 of glycerol 80 of hydrocarbons and 80 of fatty acids under favorable surroundings 47 hence understanding the biochemical composition in microalgae while treating wastewater is crucial as these value added products were attained by utilizing microalgae biomass furthermore this study could be a way out of the increasingly low level of raw materials in producing valuable products using wastewater to produce these products is a good approach as the cost of microalgae cultivation can be covered by the wastewater treatment plant capital hence this process could lower the environmental payoff in which the investment is geared towards wastewater utilization rather than freshwater 48 3 3 1 carbohydrate carbohydrate is the main product of photosynthesis using atp nadph and metabolic reactions of carbon distribution in the calvin cycle ho et al 49 mentioned that although carbohydrate content in microalgae is species dependent it generally contains specific polysaccharides such as pectin agar and alginate besides composition of carbohydrates in microalgae can reach up to 50 w w in the form of starch and cellulose 49 carbohydrate production may be affected by several factors which includes nutrient content temperature salt stress light intensity and metabolism polytrophic autotrophic and heterotrophic 50 in this study the water sample used has different ph amount of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus cod and turbidity table 1 fig 3 a shows the comparison of carbohydrate production by microalgae grown in different water samples after 14 days treatment based on the three water samples highest carbohydrate accumulation can be observed in chlorella sp ukm8 grown in pome with an amount of 0 08 g l this might be because chlorella sp is not only listed as highest yielding microalgae but could also best adapt to various factors as per mentioned the reason behind the lower carbohydrate accumulation in c vulgaris cv characium sp ukm1 chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 in pome might be due to the darker colour of pome as opposed to ai and mw fig 3a instead of accumulating carbohydrate reserved energy in microalgae cells were diverted to accommodate energy required to grow in dark medium similar to a study by japar et al 5 carbohydrates production is lower during stationary and exponential phase this is due to the usage of energy and carbons for cell and nuclear division 5 hence lower carbohydrate productions are obtained in pome at the end of the 14 days treatment c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 works best in producing significant amount of carbohydrate in ai with the values range of 0 027 to 0 064 g l on the other hand all microalgae species cultured in mw has no significant differences in carbohydrate production with the total range of 0 019 to 0 05 g l carbohydrate the reason behind better carbohydrate production in ai and mw might be due to the physically clearer water sample than pome hence more energy could be converted to carbohydrate production despite that carbohydrate production by microalgae is mostly species dependent and majorly affected by nutrients hence each microalgae species produces different carbohydrate compositions depending on the water sample used as different water samples has different nutrient content which in return affects the biomass production by microalgae 3 3 2 lipid microalgae are now gaining more attention as one of the major sources of biofuel however the cost of mass production has not yet reached a reasonable economical level 51 hence microalgae cultured in wastewater may not only aid in phycoremediation but could also act as a low cost biofuel source lipid production in microalgae is usually influenced by several factors including temperature light and nutrient concentration especially nitrogen 52 the microalgal cells produce lipids by undergoing morphological changes this also includes patterns of growth as well as biochemical and physiological processes 53 other than that lipid content in biomass serves as a source of microalgae energy sugars glycerol or bases that were esterified to fatty acids with carbon numbers of c12 c22 are some of the components of algal lipids fig 3b shows the comparison of lipid production by microalgae in water samples from mw ai and pome at the end of the 14 days of treatment based on water samples used scenedesmus sp ukm9 produces the highest lipid in pome with a value of 0 09 g l this indicates that pome is the most suitable water sample for lipid production as nitrogen has been removed from pome by microalgae scenedesmus sp ukm9 could produce highest lipid concentration parallel with a study that found higher content of lipids as much as 54 with a lower concentration of sodium nitrate 54 kao et al 55 has also stated that low nitrogen concentration contributes to lipid accumulation lipid production by microalgae was dependent on species in addition according to japar et al 5 instead of absorbing energy from sunlight and organic compounds for lipid accumulations microalgae cells might redirect the energy for development of other compounds this might be the reason behind lower lipid production in other microalgae species and samples in addition based on fig 3b the highest lipid production by chlorella sp ukm2 in ai as well as c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 in mw with the yield of 0 004 0 007 g l might be due to the low level of nitrogen in each water sample it has been stated by widjaja et al 56 that c vulgaris has increased lipid content with lower nitrogen concentration in this case chlorella species happens to favor lipid production in deprived nitrogen concentration interestingly scenedesmus sp ukm9 has the ability to produce lipids in high nutrient media such as pome as opposed to others this might be because of the better adaptability as well as size and length of scenedesmus sp ukm9 supported by trainor and egan 57 the amount of lipid by scenedesmus sp is higher compared to the other species due to its pyrenoid shape in addition according to aratboni et al 58 the larger the cell size of the microalgae the more lipid globules can be accumulated in the cytosol chloroplasts and endoplasmic reticulum of microalgae microalgae are also microorganisms that depend on cell surface area for absorption and release of nutrients including the production of lipids in cells to conclude the ability to produce lipid by microalgae is greatly dependent on species and factors such lipid extraction nitrogen depletion and light penetration 13 in this study carbons fixed in photosynthesis are diverted from protein synthesis pathway to either lipid or carbohydrate synthesis pathway as overall total lipid composition is greater than protein composition 3 3 3 protein protein is a major component of microalgae biomass as some microalgae account for very high levels of protein typically about 40 60 of the total dry weight of the biomass 59 protein content in microalgae can be manipulated or influenced by several factors such as nitrogen supply light intensity and quality mineral insulation climate as well as cell life 60 fig 3c shows the composition of protein in microalgae grown in mw ai and pome after 14 days of treatment however based on the results there are no significant differences between microalgae species in all water samples protein concentration in pome ai and mw resulted in protein production ranging from 0 12 to 0 2 g l with no significant difference between species as nitrogen is the building blocks for protein nitrogen is vital in protein synthesis as well as functional and structural systems hence production of crude protein content is decreased along with the nitrogen reduction at the end of the treatment similar to a study by pancha et al 61 besides that wang et al 62 also stated that there are possibilities of suspended particles in wastewater to not be metabolized by microalgae which end up being remained in the slurry without being expressed as primary metabolites including proteins not only that a study by japar et al 5 also found that protein accumulations are not only affected by nitrogen concentration but also acclimatisation and prolonged photoperiod looking at this finding the day and time selected to harvest protein should also be taken into consideration to avoid prolonged photoperiod for better protein yield this is because the phycobilisomes which are crucial in light harvesting antennae might have been degraded due to these factors resulting in lower protein production 5 hence lower protein production is obtained at the end of the experiment with no significant differences across species 3 4 principal component analysis pca pca were conducted and analysed to clearly understand the correlations between factors and responses in this study water sample and microalgae act as factors while phycoremediation efficiency and biochemical composition are the responses pca is chosen due to its ability in providing the best perspective on observations as well as data assessment as shown in fig 4 overall accumulation of biochemical composition and carbon as well as nutrients removals were plotted in the score plots and loading plot score plot determines the data distribution whereas loading plot describes the direction of biomass composition cod as well as nutrients tp and tn removal looking at the first component of loading plot pc1 in fig 4a the responses were widely distributed along the horizontal direction yet cod tn and tp were closer to each other compared to protein carbohydrate and lipid the same result is obtained for the second component of loading plot pc2 results of the different water samples ai mw and pome towards responses could be obtained from the score plot in fig 4b pome is separately grouped from ai and mw this result not only shows that there is significant effect of water samples on cod tn and tp removal by microalgae yet pome was located nearest to the responses namely cod tn tp and lipid hence it can be concluded that microalgae removed cod nitrogen and phosphorus best in pome while producing lipid referring to fig 4c c vulgaris cv chlorella sp ukm2 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 works best in reducing cod tn and tp in pome as it is positioned near the four responses interestingly scenedesmus sp ukm9 is the only species that is located nearest to the lipid response in pome as for water sample ai lipids are best produced by chlorella sp ukm2 meanwhile in mw chlorella sp ukm8 produces protein the best scenedesmus sp ukm9 in ai produces the best carbohydrate as they were positioned near to carbohydrate response scenedesmus sp has gained attention as not only an efficient bioremediation agent yet it is aimed to be used as main component in biofuel productions scenedesmus sp has been proven to phycoremediate wastewaters in lowering the cod bod tn and tp content in the water bodies similarly it has also been proven by pca analyses that scenedesmus sp ukm9 could phycoremediate best in pome while producing significant amount of lipid chlorella species could survive in various environmental conditions while producing a significant amount of biochemical constituents and phycoremediate respective water bodies it has also been documented by hadiyanto et al 23 that chlorella sp could produce higher biomass yield with lower specific growth rate in this case looking at the pca result chlorella sp ukm8 might have produced high biomass yield in the form of protein hence it is proven that the types of water samples and microalgae strains are the factors that affect the biochemical composition and phycoremediation efficiency 4 conclusion based on the overall results of the study pome is the most suitable water sample used for phycoremediation process this is due to the higher nutrient content in pome on the other hand most suitable microalgae species for treating wastewater measured by cod tn and tp are c vulgaris cv 45 82 chlorella sp ukm2 49 70 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 58 78 in pome all microalgae species produce different biomass composition based on the water samples used chlorella sp ukm2 in ai and chlorella sp ukm8 in pome showed highest carbohydrate content scenedesmus sp ukm9 in pome on the other hand produced the highest amount of lipid there are no significant differences for protein accumulation in all microalgae species inoculated in all water samples these results were majorly influenced on microalgae species and nutrient contents in wastewaters as nutrients content is one of the most critical factors for microalgae biochemical composition productivity hence pome could be utilized for future phycoremediation processes and productions of valuable end products declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

nutrients accumulation attributed to the growth of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea the study presents a low cost promising future for fostering a sustainable technology for treatment of dairy effluent graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phytoaccumulation floating hydroponic process data availability some or all data models or code generated or used during the study are proprietary or confidential in nature and may only be provided with restrictions 1 introduction fresh water plays a vital role in maintaining ecosystem increase in industrialization urbanization and rise in population enhances global fresh water scarcity 1 industrialization increases the demand of water dairy industry is one of the leading water consuming industries study found that production of 1 m3 of milk requires approximately 1 to 10 m3 of fresh water 2 hence dairy industry produces huge volume of wastewater containing 60 80 of inorganic and organic pollutants 3 tertiary treatment methods such as coagulation adsorption advanced oxidation filtration through membrane can be used for the recovery of nutrients from dairy wastewater due to complications high cost 4 and large volume of sludge production from tertiary treatment 5 hydroponic phytoremediation has been considered as one of the low cost efficient biological methods to treat wastewater hydroponic constructed wetland is a type of engineered natural technique that works on phytoremediation it has significant removal potential for treatment of industrial and domestic effluents 6 7 the wetland effectively reduces organic matter inorganic matter metals and even color present in wastewater this floating wetland treatment system is preferred due to its simplicity and low cost than conventional constructed wetlands 8 11 in floating hydroponic system a biopontoon is used to support the plant over outer surface of effluent this facilitates the rhizosphere for optimum contact with wastewater during removal 12 fundamental factors that are responsible for the growth of attached biofilm are large surface area and roots entanglement of small suspended solids and nutrient uptake in the column containing liquids 13 14 photosynthesis of plants enables root to diffuse oxygen that affects the redox potential of column s liquid this provides high implication for transformation of nitrogen phytotoxins oxidation and aerobic degradation by microorganisms 15 in the process of remediation the plants and rhizosphere play crucial role and hence the vegetation that is to be used should have high tolerance level of toxins substances about 400 species have been identified 9 14 16 that can be used for remediation from soil and water while only few species of plants were examined with dairy wastewater portulaca oleracea is a perennial type of plant with a habit of creeping when these types of plants come in contact with soil or water they easily propagate and give rise to new adventitious root system researchers have found that hydroponic with portulaca oleracea can be an innovative treatment process for various wastewater as it is a low cost and sustainable method 17 19 portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides are chosen for the first time to treat dairy effluent coleus scutellarioides is selected for treatment of dairy wastewater to make hydroponic treatment system a better and natural method to treat wastewater using locally available aquatic weed successfully coleus scutellarioides able to remove organics and nutrients from dairy wastewater and it became a comparable plant in the study with portulaca oleracea the novelty of the study is the plants that are used for the treatment of dairy wastewater also the process is sustainable low operation cost and natural various researches 20 22 have been done with combining floating wetlands treatment in addition to aeration by air diffusion process to remove odor and promote the root system of macrophyte relatively less energy is consumed as surface area reduced for aerating the floating hydroponic wetland 23 study 24 also found that reduction of biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod takes 2 4 days in aeration floating wetland to attain discharge standard whereas it takes 7 8 days for non aerated treatment system a table scale experimental setup was initiated by rhizofiltation of floating hydroponic process fhp using portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides and also with aeration on raw wastewater re and treated wastewater te from dairy industry 2 materials and methodology 2 1

10 l wastewater for 60 d because by this duration plant may attain their mature stage henceforth removal is not significant and also accumulation of nutrients and organics remain same the floating hydroponic system was kept under normal atmospheric condition during treatment process so maximum treatment duration is selected as 60 d fig 1 b shows experimental setup of system and aerated treatment system is shown in fig 1 c 2 3 table scale setup of treatment system the coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea biometrics were analyzed at initial 0th day and end 60th day of the experiment 25 shoot and root of the plants from the top region were measured in centimeter and also the increase of growth of plant was recorded root and shoot of the portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides were reaped on the 60th day then oven dried at 60 c at the end of experiment i e on 60th day water was collected from both the setup uptake of nutrients in the portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides root and shoot was calculated by using eq 1 25 1 pdm x nc nu where pdm is production of dry matter nc is nutrient content nu is nutrient uptake 3 analytical procedure treated wastewater samples from experimental setup of hydroponic system were collected for analysis at an interval of 5 d various physical chemical characterizations such as ph tss total suspended solids tds total dissolved solids do dissolved oxygen bod biochemical oxygen demand cod chemical oxygen demand tp total phosphorous phosphate tn total nitrogen were performed removal efficiency of pollutants was calculated by using eq 2 2 removal inlet conc outlet conc inlet conc 100 inlet conc and outlet conc signifies initial concentration of influent and final concentration of effluent respectively 3 1 sem analysis the scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edax analysis of samples were conducted using sem machine nova nanosem 450 the morphological variations of the root and shoot for coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea were examined by sem also using edax the accumulation of nutrients and pollutants in shoot and root of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides were analyzed 26 samples were dried naturally and mounted on specimen holder for sem and edax the mount were allowed to dry under high vacuum and coated with platinum and gold observations were made on various magnifications as shown in figs 2 3 and 4 3 2 uv vis analysis of dairy wastewater the uv vis spectra was measured by using uv vis spectrometer lambda 35s perkinelmer uv vis the parameter of uv vis was set as scanning speed 150 nm min 1 wavelength 200 900 nm slit width 1 nm 3 3 ftir analysis the ftir was used for measuring the infrared spectra shimadzu ir prestige 21 in ftir the ph of liquid sample after treatment and before treatment was maintained as 6 5 or more for analysis for ftir characterization the residual solid were obtained from liquid sample before and after treatment solid samples were obtained by drying and evaporating processes the wavelength range of spectrophotometer for analysis was set as 4000 to 500 cm 1 3 4 statistical analysis the anova one way analysis of variance was done to measure the variance of each parameters of dairy wastewater using spss version 24 0 the significant value of spss p was maintained below 0 05 4 results and discussion 4 1 tolerance and growth of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides continuous growth of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides was observed up to the retention time 60th day of experiment study during this period plants adaptability and tolerance towards dairy wastewater is observed the coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea with optimum growth potential was found in te c a and te p a maximum root and shoot length of portulaca oleracea are found to be 5 8 cm and 45 cm respectively whereas maximum growth of root and shoot length of coleus scutellarioides are 8 cm and 35 cm respectively however the minimal growth was found in re p wa and re c wa the minimum growth of root and shoot length of portulaca oleracea are 28 cm and 2 6 cm respectively the minimum growth of root and shoot of coleus scutellarioides are found to be 3 2 cm and 13 7 cm respectively it is found that number of leaves is more in te c a and te p a as compared to re p wa and re c wa dry matter production of all plants in different experimental setup is summarized in table 1 total plant productivity indicates the total production of dry matter of plants plant suitability for phytoremediation is verified by production of high dry matter of plant even under stressful condition it was found that the dry matter yield of shoot for portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides were up to 87 g and 65 g per hydroponic pot with maximum uptake of phosphorus content 27 study found that aerated hydroponic system shows a positive impact on production of dry matter of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea along with dairy effluent through hydroponic phytoremediation as summarized in table 1 4 2 analysis of protein and amino acids the growth of floating hydroponic plant system is directly proportional to amino acid content 28 stress caused in plants is due to the wastewater concentration to which it is exposed research studies reported that the content of amino acid increases with an increase in heavy metals organics and nutrient concentration present in wastewater 28 29 raw dairy effluent constitute more salts organics nutrients than treated effluent which may cause variation in amino acid content in the plant system lowest amino acid content was observed in tcw 0 66 μg g tpw 1 53 μg g and highest amino acid content was observed in rca 3 69 μg g rpa 4 78 μg g of treatment system the tcw and tpw show least stress among all the treatment system in table 1 this corresponds to the fact that coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea treatment system with aeration can accumulate nutrients and organics to produce more yield soluble protein in root of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea signifies the production of osmolyte potential and hence the capacity to adapt stress condition 4 3 sem analysis the sem analysis has been performed for top view of leaf and transverse view of root of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides as shown in fig 2 the sem analysis gives a brief idea about the changes in morphology xylem and phloem observed in both the plants may be due to stress factor occurred by variation in ph nutrients and organics present in dairy effluent difference in stomata has also been observed in top surface of leaf of portulaca oleracea that resembles sunken and partially close state this might be caused due to the influence of dairy wastewater partial close state affect the process of respiration and transpiration of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea leaves 30 transverse and top sections of root and leaf were analyzed for edax images as shown in figs 3 and 4 the percentage of element accumulation was recorded in root portion of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea which is higher than shoot because of extensive biomass of root and its surface area that enhance the process of phytoaccumulation property of rhizofiltration in root of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea prevents the toxic substances to transfer to trophic levels of plants and make coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea an appealing possibility for phytoaccumulation removal performances of both treatment systems are summarized in table 2 effect of oxygen demand by both the plants is depicted in fig 5 4 4 performance of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides treatment system analysis of different parameter of wastewater during the period of experiment it provides a deep understanding on the potential of plant system and aeration in treatment of dairy wastewater in table 2 the ph of dairy effluent decides the efficiency of treatment process treatment process along the aeration or with plants rca rpa tca tpa rcw tcw rpw tpw increases ph because of liberation of hydroxide ions from biocarbonate 31 tca and tpa were recorded with an increase of ph i e 2 40 and 5 20 followed by rca rpa treatment system with 19 32 21 99 this ph increase is attributed to the portulaca oleracea s and coleus scutellarioides s release of root exudates increase of do is also observed in the treatment system but in control the increase of do is not sufficient to breakdown biological and chemical oxygen demand the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen naturally in the surface of effluent results in increase of oxygen plants coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea and aeration in the treatment system have surely affected the exchange of oxygen that leads to increase of oxygen content in the system tca tpa tcw tpw rca rpa rcw rpw than control as in fig 5 a the bod removal increases with increase of do in the system highest reduction were observed in rpa 82 36 rca 73 63 followed by tca 73 08 tpa 77 16 but lowest removal rate of bod was reported by tcw 60 62 tpw 68 42 rpw 61 22 rcw 60 42 all the result of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea treatment system shows the evidence of better treatment system as aeration enhance the treatment efficiency through hydroponic approach with the growth of plants and with respect to time the removal of bod and cod increases as shown in fig 5 b c the reason may be due to increase of oxygen in wastewater by plant roots and diffusion of oxygen from atmosphere and supplied aeration to system also ability of plants to extract the organics from water to survive highest cod reduction was observed in rpa 81 86 rca 76 16 and also the lowest cod reduction value observed in rpw 48 74 and rcw 46 03 the aeration in the treatment process of rca tca rpa tpa and reduction of bod cod results in removal of salt and other solids which indicates low tds tss the reason for increase of tds and tss in control is activity of microbial community and evaporation respectively the coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea are advantageous up to 60th day of experiment by removing tds with removal percentage of 39 41 in rcw 41 47 in rpw 45 68 in tcw and 50 10 in tpw but tca tpa rca rpa showed better result in removal rate of tds with 55 36 65 76 48 08 64 36 respectively the total removal of suspended solid is reported by the system tca tpa rca rpa are 43 47 70 49 51 42 79 43 respectively potential of portulaca oleracea in treatment of wastewater has been studied by many researchers the validation of potential of portulaca reduces cod bod tds tss 57 45 77 24 respectively in textile effluent also the portulaca oleracea showed the potential with simulated mixture dye in reducing cod bod tds tss 49 62 71 33 respectively within 60 h 32 study related to the treatment of wastewater by coleus scutellarioides has yet not validated some macrophytes coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea float in water because of their tissue called aerenchyma 33 this tissue provides buoyancy force to macrophyte to remain in floating condition root of this type of macrophyte is hanging below water level and meshy structured young roots of plants excrete oxygen in small amount to wastewater hence they are used by leaves 34 35 wastewater present around the root mesh are oxygenated and provide favourable condition for growth of aerobic bacteria roots of these plants provide large surface area for different microorganisms for colonization and attachment roots releases various exudates such as amino acids citrate malate oxalate etc as shown in fig 6 these act as carbon source for microorganisms and help in the process of proliferation and stimulation 36 38 as population of microbes increases biofilm layer becomes sticky the suspended solids and organics present in effluent get attach to the biofilm layer inside water and easily degrade aerobically by microorganism or uptake by plants as described in fig 7 aeration and diffusion of atmospheric oxygen to wastewater is the major source of oxygen to maintain aerobic condition nutrients concentrations including their removal efficiencies are summarized in table 3 4 5 removal of nutrients initially the concentration of nutrients in influent was measured before the treatment and also after 60th day of experiment as summarized in table 3 influent nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations reduce due to uptake by plant system concentration of total nitrogen was found to be lowest in tcw 28 05 tpw 32 67 followed by tca 43 97 tpa 51 99 hence removal efficiency of total nitrogen in hydroponic treatment system rca 72 29 rpa 74 67 rcw 71 08 rpw 73 29 was higher because of the growth potential of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea total phosphorus reduction efficiency was observed lowest in tcw 28 26 tpw 35 72 whereas highest in rca 72 06 rpa 75 55 also removal efficiency of phosphate was found lowest in tcw 41 25 tpw 45 50 and highest in rca 71 47 rpa 74 24 uptake of tn tp phosphate by coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea leads to reduction of nutrients in the wastewater shown in fig 8 a also the remediation of tp phosphate tn from dairy wastewater is high after 30 days shown fig 8 b c d the removal of total phosphorus in the raw wastewater is significantly increased after 30 d of treatment as shown in fig 8 b it is may be due to need of phosphorus for converting sun s energy into biomolecules for their growth also may be reduction of phosphorus slowly increases after 15 d as the plant get acclimatized in new environment the reduction of phosphate in the raw wastewater gradually increases with time but after 25 d the reduction is significant as shown in fig 8 c it is may be due to increase in the growth of plant shoot root leaves and flowering is noticed in portulaca oleracea the gradual decrease of total nitrogen is marked after 20 d but the increase in reduction is noticed after 30 d as shown fig 8 d the plant require nitrogen may be for their growth of leaves and flowers and utilize it as a source of plant protein and enzymes reasons for the removal of nutrients may be mature growth of plants and roots plant tolerance towards toxicity of wastewater rhizosphere also absorb nutrients to sustain and form biofilm this process of reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen content in portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides grown in wastewater confirm the reduction mechanism is rhizofiltration which is also known as phytoaccumulation 39 4 6 statistical analysis the inter relationship of different parameters present in wastewater is summarized in table 4 correlation between the parameters has been analyzed by spss version 24 0 the spss analysis shows that all the parameters are highly correlated with each other correlation coefficient r of do with other parameter was found to be high study found that increase of do the bod and cod removal also increases increase of do in the system may be due to aeration atmospheric diffusion of oxygen oxygen from rhizosphere of plant root helps to decompose biological and chemical organics present in dairy wastewater 40 this supports the high correlation coefficient r of tp with phosphate and tn it may be due to uptake of nutrients by plants for their growth this correlation analysis is helpful in the wastewater treatment process to understand the impact of variation of one parameter on other parameter present in dairy effluent the regression equation and pearson correlation coefficient r for different parameters with significant value of correlation are shown in table 5 categorization of correlation between the parameter are considered as 0 8 to 1 0 strong 0 5 to 0 8 moderate 0 0 to 0 5 weak 41 the regression equation do 22 901 0 585 bod is written in form of y a bx where x and y are independent and dependent variables respectively a slope of line and b is intercept on y axis the r2 value of do bod do cod tp phosphate and tp tn are 0 46 0 52 0 92 and 0 96 respectively 5 analytical characterization 5 1 uv vis analysis generally dairy wastewater contains aliphatic molecules aromatic compounds protein amino acids and n containing compounds the range for detection of pollutant was set to 200 900 nm and uv vis analysis of dairy wastewater treatment system as depicted in fig 9 in the initial stage a series of experiments were conducted with various dilutions of wastewater and finally with best obtained peak fig 9 was considered for further analysis 42 43 the absorbance spectra during before and after treatment of dairy wastewater is explained in fig 9 it explains the remediation potential of soluble organic pollutants dissolved organics in the treated dairy wastewater absorb uv light at wavelength from 200 to 800 nm 44 since this method provides fast analytical response it is often applicable in wastewater treatment plant as shown in fig 9 the dairy wastewater has strong absorption peak at 250 400 nm which attribute presence of various compound in wastewater absorbance at 210 250 nm attribute presence of aliphatic molecules n containing compounds lipid concentration 43 45 the absorption peak around 250 300 nm attribute protein aromatic side chain phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan in dairy wastewater 46 the strong peak at 280 nm attribute amino acids it is observed that higher the absorbance at 280 nm had greatest protein concentration in wastewater also the peak centered at 280 nm is the result of absorbance by aromatic ring 43 the peak at lower wavelength caused by absorbance of peptide and carboxylic acid in wastewater 44 this analysis validate the qualitative evaluation of treated wastewater after treatment the absorbance spectra decreases considerably at all scanned wavelength 200 900 nm this confirms the removal potential of the floating hydroponic system for oxidation of organic compounds this helps to confirm the reduction of pollutant after treatment in a fast analytical response therefore can be applied for industrial system 5 2 ftir analysis the organic matter in dairy wastewater include carbon chain of carbohydrate fats proteins lipids 47 raw extracted solid dairy wastewater were analyzed by ftir technique to identify strong vibration caused due to the presence of various organic pollutant shown in fig 10 a in this experiment dairy wastewater were analyzed by ftir technique before and after treatment by floating hydroponic system as shown in fig 10 b study found that some of the intensity of the peaks reduces after treatment and few new peaks are developed the presence of lipid protein and carbohydrate were identified in the range of 3415 10 3218 94 cm 1 as shown in fig 10 a this small vibration may be due to stretching vibration of oh nh nh2 the stretch of oh is from water in case of liquid sample or carbohydrate in case of extracted solid sample in dairy wastewater the strong vibration in 2913 57 cm 1 is may be due to presence of ch group in carbon chain of proteins fats carbohydrate the nh vibration stretch may be due to peptide nh of protein strong peak at 1690 61 cm 1 attribute peptide co bond of protein co nh peak in range 1547 60 cm 1 1242 61 cm 1 may correspond either to co polymer of carbohydrate or co stretch of fatty acid cn stretch of amino acid in protein 47 peak of 1116 50 cm 1 attribute the characteristics of co bond in glycerol which confirms the presence of fatty acid in dairy wastewater 48 but in case of liquid dairy wastewater the peaks are not as strong as it is in diluted form as well as the reduction of pollutant after treatment causes problem in the process of extraction of treated wastewater in solid form the ftir spectra analysis indicates presence of lipid protein carbohydrate fatty acid amino acid in influent of dairy wastewater sample before treatment after floating hydroponic treatment absorption peak intensity reduces which indicates the effective removal of pollutants from wastewater 6 conclusion and future perspective present study outcome confirms efficient removal of nutrients by coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea system with aeration of dairy effluent treatment air circulation empowered the treatment process to dwindle bod 82 36 cod 81 86 total phosphorous 75 55 phosphate 74 24 and total nitrogen 74 67 concentration moreover quality of wastewater attain the permissible limit for irrigation fao 1994 and for discharge into public sewer is 2490 1981 after treating the raw dairy wastewater by coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea hydroponic and aerated system portulaca oleracea gives better result in degradation of high cod bod tds tss tp phosphate and tn portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides aquatic macrophyte play a potential role in absorbing or treating nutrients and other contaminants because of their capacity to reproduce invasive character and nature of ubiquitous diffuse system of root in coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea foster an interaction zone close to region of rhizosphere of wastewater and root which can be utilized for onsite treatment system of various industrial wastewater hydroponic and propagated coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea aerated system can be installed for pre primary clarification portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides system of hydroponic phytoremediation is a cost effective eco friendly easy to access and revamp with minimum technological challenges however retention time for the treatment of effluent is high further more research need to be done in design to improve the performance of treatment system the reduction of complex substances and load of chemical and tertiary treatment can be overcome by utilizing constructed wetland with integrated system hence the hydroponic cum coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea system of treatment utilized in this study confirmed environmentally green and sustainable method simple and cost effective solution presently there is no definite and approved design basis accessible for floating hydroponic process and particularly to remove various contaminants present in floating hydroponic process declaration of competing interest the authors declare they have no

dairy effluent graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phytoaccumulation floating hydroponic process data availability some or all data models or code generated or used during the study are proprietary or confidential in nature and may only be provided with restrictions 1 introduction fresh water plays a vital role in maintaining ecosystem increase in industrialization urbanization and rise in population enhances global fresh water scarcity 1 industrialization increases the demand of water dairy industry is one of the leading water consuming industries study found that production of 1 m3 of milk requires approximately 1 to 10 m3 of fresh water 2 hence dairy industry produces huge volume of wastewater containing 60 80 of inorganic and organic pollutants 3 tertiary treatment methods such as coagulation adsorption advanced oxidation filtration through membrane can be used for the recovery of nutrients from dairy wastewater due to complications high cost 4 and large volume of sludge production from tertiary treatment 5 hydroponic phytoremediation has been considered as one of the low cost efficient biological methods to treat wastewater hydroponic constructed wetland is a type of engineered natural technique that works on phytoremediation it has significant removal potential for treatment of industrial and domestic effluents 6 7 the wetland effectively reduces organic matter inorganic matter metals and even color present in wastewater this floating wetland treatment system is preferred due to its simplicity and low cost than conventional constructed wetlands 8 11 in floating hydroponic system a biopontoon is used to support the plant over outer surface of effluent this facilitates the rhizosphere for optimum contact with wastewater during removal 12 fundamental factors that are responsible for the growth of attached biofilm are large surface area and roots entanglement of small suspended solids and nutrient uptake in the column containing liquids 13 14 photosynthesis of plants enables root to diffuse oxygen that affects the redox potential of column s liquid this provides high implication for transformation of nitrogen phytotoxins oxidation and aerobic degradation by microorganisms 15 in the process of remediation the plants and rhizosphere play crucial role and hence the vegetation that is to be used should have high tolerance level of toxins substances about 400 species have been identified 9 14 16 that can be used for remediation from soil and water while only few species of plants were examined with dairy wastewater portulaca oleracea is a perennial type of plant with a habit of creeping when these types of plants come in contact with soil or water they easily propagate and give rise to new adventitious root system researchers have found that hydroponic with portulaca oleracea can be an innovative treatment process for various wastewater as it is a low cost and sustainable method 17 19 portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides are chosen for the first time to treat dairy effluent coleus scutellarioides is selected for treatment of dairy wastewater to make hydroponic treatment system a better and natural method to treat wastewater using locally available aquatic weed successfully coleus scutellarioides able to remove organics and nutrients from dairy wastewater and it became a comparable plant in the study with portulaca oleracea the novelty of the study is the plants that are used for the treatment of dairy wastewater also the process is sustainable low operation cost and natural various researches 20 22 have been done with combining floating wetlands treatment in addition to aeration by air diffusion process to remove odor and promote the root system of macrophyte relatively less energy is consumed as surface area reduced for aerating the floating hydroponic wetland 23 study 24 also found that reduction of biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod takes 2 4 days in aeration floating wetland to attain discharge standard whereas it takes 7 8 days for non aerated treatment system a table scale experimental setup was initiated by rhizofiltation of floating hydroponic process fhp using portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides and also with aeration on raw wastewater re and treated wastewater te from dairy industry 2 materials and methodology 2 1

10 l wastewater for 60 d because by this duration plant may attain their mature stage henceforth removal is not significant and also accumulation of nutrients and organics remain same the floating hydroponic system was kept under normal atmospheric condition during treatment process so maximum treatment duration is selected as 60 d fig 1 b shows experimental setup of system and aerated treatment system is shown in fig 1 c 2 3 table scale setup of treatment system the coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea biometrics were analyzed at initial 0th day and end 60th day of the experiment 25 shoot and root of the plants from the top region were measured in centimeter and also the increase of growth of plant was recorded root and shoot of the portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides were reaped on the 60th day then oven dried at 60 c at the end of experiment i e on 60th day water was collected from both the setup uptake of nutrients in the portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides root and shoot was calculated by using eq 1 25 1 pdm x nc nu where pdm is production of dry matter nc is nutrient content nu is nutrient uptake 3 analytical procedure treated wastewater samples from experimental setup of hydroponic system were collected for analysis at an interval of 5 d various physical chemical characterizations such as ph tss total suspended solids tds total dissolved solids do dissolved oxygen bod biochemical oxygen demand cod chemical oxygen demand tp total phosphorous phosphate tn total nitrogen were performed removal efficiency of pollutants was calculated by using eq 2 2 removal inlet conc outlet conc inlet conc 100 inlet conc and outlet conc signifies initial concentration of influent and final concentration of effluent respectively 3 1 sem analysis the scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edax analysis of samples were conducted using sem machine nova nanosem 450 the morphological variations of the root and shoot for coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea were examined by sem also using edax the accumulation of nutrients and pollutants in shoot and root of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides were analyzed 26 samples were dried naturally and mounted on specimen holder for sem and edax the mount were allowed to dry under high vacuum and coated with platinum and gold observations were made on various magnifications as shown in figs 2 3 and 4 3 2 uv vis analysis of dairy wastewater the uv vis spectra was measured by using uv vis spectrometer lambda 35s perkinelmer uv vis the parameter of uv vis was set as scanning speed 150 nm min 1 wavelength 200 900 nm slit width 1 nm 3 3 ftir analysis the ftir was used for measuring the infrared spectra shimadzu ir prestige

and after treatment solid samples were obtained by drying and evaporating processes the wavelength range of spectrophotometer for analysis was set as 4000 to 500 cm 1 3 4 statistical analysis the anova one way analysis of variance was done to measure the variance of each parameters of dairy wastewater using spss version 24 0 the significant value of spss p was maintained below 0 05 4 results and discussion 4 1 tolerance and growth of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides continuous growth of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides was observed up to the retention time 60th day of experiment study during this period plants adaptability and tolerance towards dairy wastewater is observed the coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea with optimum growth potential was found in te c a and te p a maximum root and shoot length of portulaca oleracea are found to be 5 8 cm and 45 cm respectively whereas maximum growth of root and shoot length of coleus scutellarioides are 8 cm and 35 cm respectively however the minimal growth was found in re p wa and re c wa the minimum growth of root and shoot length of portulaca oleracea are 28 cm and 2 6 cm respectively the minimum growth of root and shoot of coleus scutellarioides are found to be 3 2 cm and 13 7 cm respectively it is found that number of leaves is more in te c a and te p a as compared to re p wa and re c wa dry matter production of all plants in different experimental setup is summarized in table 1 total plant productivity indicates the total production of dry matter of plants plant suitability for phytoremediation is verified by production of high dry matter of plant even under stressful condition it was found that the dry matter yield of shoot for portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides were up to 87 g and 65 g per hydroponic pot with maximum uptake of phosphorus content 27 study found that aerated hydroponic system shows a positive impact on production of dry matter of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea along with dairy effluent through hydroponic phytoremediation as summarized in table 1 4 2 analysis of protein and amino acids the growth of floating hydroponic plant system is directly proportional to amino acid content 28 stress caused in plants is due to the wastewater concentration to which it is exposed research studies reported that the content of amino acid increases with an increase in heavy metals organics and nutrient concentration present in wastewater 28 29 raw dairy effluent constitute more salts organics nutrients than treated effluent which may cause variation in amino acid content in the plant system lowest amino acid content was observed in tcw 0 66 μg g tpw 1 53 μg g and highest amino acid content was observed in rca 3 69 μg g rpa 4 78 μg g of treatment system the tcw and tpw show least stress among all the treatment system in table 1 this corresponds to the fact that coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea treatment system with aeration can accumulate nutrients and organics to produce more yield soluble protein in root of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea signifies the production of osmolyte potential and hence the capacity to adapt stress condition 4 3 sem analysis the sem analysis has been performed for top view of leaf and transverse view of root of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides as shown in fig 2 the sem analysis gives a brief idea about the changes in morphology xylem and phloem observed in both the plants may be due to stress factor occurred by variation in ph nutrients and organics present in dairy effluent difference in stomata has also been observed in top surface of leaf of portulaca oleracea that resembles sunken and partially close state this might be caused due to the influence of dairy wastewater partial close state affect the process of respiration and transpiration of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea leaves 30 transverse and top sections of root and leaf were analyzed for edax images as shown in figs 3 and 4 the percentage of element accumulation was recorded in root portion of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea which is higher than shoot because of extensive biomass of root and its surface area that enhance the process of phytoaccumulation property of rhizofiltration in root of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea prevents the toxic substances to transfer to trophic levels of plants and make coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea an appealing possibility for phytoaccumulation removal performances of both treatment systems are summarized in table 2 effect of oxygen demand by both the plants is depicted in fig 5 4 4 performance of portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides treatment system analysis of different parameter of wastewater during the period of experiment it provides a deep understanding on the potential of plant system and aeration in treatment of dairy wastewater in table 2 the ph of dairy effluent decides the efficiency of treatment process treatment process along the aeration or with plants rca rpa tca tpa rcw tcw rpw tpw increases ph because of liberation of hydroxide ions from biocarbonate 31 tca and tpa were recorded with an increase of ph i e 2 40 and 5 20 followed by rca rpa treatment system with 19 32 21 99 this ph increase is attributed to the portulaca oleracea s and coleus scutellarioides s release of root exudates increase of do is also observed in the treatment system but in control the increase of do is not sufficient to breakdown biological and chemical oxygen demand the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen naturally in the surface of effluent results in increase of oxygen plants coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea and aeration in the treatment system have surely affected the exchange of oxygen that leads to increase of oxygen content in the system tca tpa tcw tpw rca rpa rcw rpw than control as in fig 5 a the bod removal increases with increase of do in the system highest reduction were observed in rpa 82 36 rca 73 63 followed by tca 73 08 tpa 77 16 but lowest removal rate of bod was reported by tcw 60 62 tpw 68 42 rpw 61 22 rcw 60 42 all the result of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea treatment system shows the evidence of better treatment system as aeration enhance the treatment efficiency through hydroponic approach with the growth of plants and with respect to time the removal of bod and cod increases as shown in fig 5 b c the reason may be due to increase of oxygen in wastewater by plant roots and diffusion of oxygen from atmosphere and supplied aeration to system also ability of plants to extract the organics from water to survive highest cod reduction was observed in rpa 81 86 rca 76 16 and also the lowest cod reduction value observed in rpw 48 74 and rcw 46 03 the aeration in the treatment process of rca tca rpa tpa and reduction of bod cod results in removal of salt and other solids which indicates low tds tss the reason for increase of tds and tss in control is activity of microbial community and evaporation respectively the coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea are advantageous up to 60th day of experiment by removing tds with removal percentage of 39 41 in rcw 41 47 in rpw 45 68 in tcw and 50 10 in tpw but tca tpa rca rpa showed better result in removal rate of tds with 55 36 65 76 48 08 64 36 respectively the total removal of suspended solid is reported by the system tca tpa rca rpa are 43 47 70 49 51 42 79 43 respectively potential of portulaca oleracea in treatment of wastewater has been studied by many researchers the validation of potential of portulaca reduces cod bod tds tss 57 45 77 24 respectively in textile effluent also the portulaca oleracea showed the potential with simulated mixture dye in reducing cod bod tds tss 49 62 71 33 respectively within 60 h 32 study related to the treatment of wastewater by coleus scutellarioides has yet not validated some macrophytes coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea float in water because of their tissue called aerenchyma 33 this tissue provides buoyancy force to macrophyte to remain in floating condition root of this type of macrophyte is hanging below water level and meshy structured young roots of plants excrete oxygen in small amount to wastewater hence they are used by leaves 34 35 wastewater present around the root mesh are oxygenated and provide favourable condition for growth of aerobic bacteria roots of these plants provide large surface area for different microorganisms for colonization and attachment roots releases various exudates such as amino acids citrate malate oxalate etc as shown in fig 6 these act as carbon source for microorganisms and help in the process of proliferation and stimulation 36 38 as population of microbes increases biofilm layer becomes sticky the suspended solids and organics present in effluent get attach to the biofilm layer inside water and easily degrade aerobically by microorganism or uptake by plants as described in fig 7 aeration and diffusion of atmospheric oxygen to wastewater is the major source of oxygen to maintain aerobic condition nutrients concentrations including their removal efficiencies are summarized in table 3 4 5 removal of nutrients initially the concentration of nutrients in influent was measured before the treatment and also after 60th day of experiment as summarized in table 3 influent nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations reduce due to uptake by plant system concentration of total nitrogen was found to be lowest in tcw 28 05 tpw 32 67 followed by tca 43 97 tpa 51 99 hence removal efficiency of total nitrogen in hydroponic treatment system rca 72 29 rpa 74 67 rcw 71 08 rpw 73 29 was higher because of the growth potential of coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea total phosphorus reduction efficiency was observed lowest in tcw 28 26 tpw 35 72 whereas highest in rca 72 06 rpa 75 55 also removal efficiency of phosphate was found lowest in tcw 41 25 tpw 45 50 and highest in rca 71 47 rpa 74 24 uptake of tn tp phosphate by coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea leads to reduction of nutrients in the wastewater shown in fig 8 a also the remediation of tp phosphate tn from dairy wastewater is high after 30 days shown fig 8 b c d the removal of total phosphorus in the raw wastewater is significantly increased after 30 d of treatment as shown in fig 8 b it is may be due to need of phosphorus for converting sun s energy into biomolecules for their growth also may be reduction of phosphorus slowly increases after 15 d as the plant get acclimatized in new environment the reduction of phosphate in the raw wastewater gradually increases with time but after 25 d the reduction is significant as shown in fig 8 c it is may be due to increase in the growth of plant shoot root leaves and flowering is noticed in portulaca oleracea the gradual decrease of total nitrogen is marked after 20 d but the increase in reduction is noticed after 30 d as shown fig 8 d the plant require nitrogen may be for their growth of leaves and flowers and utilize it as a source of plant protein and enzymes reasons for the removal of nutrients may be mature growth of plants and roots plant tolerance towards toxicity of wastewater rhizosphere also absorb nutrients to sustain and form biofilm this process of reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen content in portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides grown in wastewater confirm the reduction mechanism is rhizofiltration which is also known as phytoaccumulation 39 4 6 statistical analysis the inter relationship of different parameters present in wastewater is summarized in table 4 correlation between the parameters has been analyzed by spss version 24 0 the spss analysis shows that all the parameters are highly correlated with each other correlation coefficient r of do with other parameter was found to be high study found that increase of do the bod and cod removal also increases increase of do in the system may be due to aeration atmospheric diffusion of oxygen oxygen from rhizosphere of plant root helps to decompose biological and chemical organics present in dairy wastewater 40 this supports the high correlation coefficient r of tp with phosphate and tn it may be due to uptake of nutrients by plants for their growth this correlation analysis is helpful in the wastewater treatment process to understand the impact of variation of one parameter on other parameter present in dairy effluent the regression equation and pearson correlation coefficient r for different parameters with significant value of correlation are shown in table 5 categorization of correlation between the parameter are considered as 0 8 to 1 0 strong 0 5 to 0 8 moderate 0 0 to 0 5 weak 41 the regression equation do 22 901 0 585 bod is written in form of y a bx where x and y are independent and dependent variables respectively a slope of line and b is intercept on y axis the r2 value of do bod do cod tp phosphate and tp tn are 0 46 0 52 0 92 and 0 96 respectively 5 analytical characterization 5 1 uv vis analysis generally dairy wastewater contains aliphatic molecules aromatic compounds protein amino acids and n containing compounds the range for detection of pollutant was set to 200 900 nm and uv vis analysis of dairy wastewater treatment system as depicted in fig 9 in the initial stage a series of experiments were conducted with various dilutions of wastewater and finally with best obtained peak fig 9 was considered for further analysis 42 43 the absorbance spectra during before and after treatment of dairy wastewater is explained in fig 9 it explains the remediation potential of soluble organic pollutants dissolved organics in the treated dairy wastewater absorb uv light at wavelength from 200 to 800 nm 44 since this method provides fast analytical response it is often applicable in wastewater treatment plant as shown in fig 9 the dairy wastewater has strong absorption peak at 250 400 nm which attribute presence of various compound in wastewater absorbance at 210 250 nm attribute presence of aliphatic molecules n containing compounds lipid concentration 43 45 the absorption peak around 250 300 nm attribute protein aromatic side chain phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan in dairy wastewater 46 the strong peak at 280 nm attribute amino acids it is observed that higher the absorbance at 280 nm had greatest protein concentration in wastewater also the peak centered at 280 nm is the result of absorbance by aromatic ring 43 the peak at lower wavelength caused by absorbance of peptide and carboxylic acid in wastewater 44 this analysis validate the qualitative evaluation of treated wastewater after treatment the absorbance spectra decreases considerably at all scanned wavelength 200 900 nm this confirms the removal potential of the floating hydroponic system for oxidation of organic compounds this helps to confirm the reduction of pollutant after treatment in a fast analytical response therefore can be applied for industrial system 5 2 ftir analysis the organic matter in dairy wastewater include carbon chain of carbohydrate fats proteins lipids 47 raw extracted solid dairy wastewater were analyzed by ftir technique to identify strong vibration caused due to the presence of various organic pollutant shown in fig 10 a in this experiment dairy wastewater were analyzed by ftir technique before and after treatment by floating hydroponic system as shown in fig 10 b study found that some of the intensity of the peaks reduces after treatment and few new peaks are developed the presence of lipid protein and carbohydrate were identified in the range of 3415 10 3218 94 cm 1 as shown in fig 10 a this small vibration may be due to stretching vibration of oh nh nh2 the stretch of oh is from water in case of liquid sample or carbohydrate in case of extracted solid sample in dairy wastewater the strong vibration in 2913 57 cm 1 is may be due to presence of ch group in carbon chain of proteins fats carbohydrate the nh vibration stretch may be due to peptide nh of protein strong peak at 1690 61 cm 1 attribute peptide co bond of protein co nh peak in range 1547 60 cm 1 1242 61 cm 1 may correspond either to co polymer of carbohydrate or co stretch of fatty acid cn stretch of amino acid in protein 47 peak of 1116 50 cm 1 attribute the characteristics of co bond in glycerol which confirms the presence of fatty acid in dairy wastewater 48 but in case of liquid dairy wastewater the peaks are not as strong as it is in diluted form as well as the reduction of pollutant after treatment causes problem in the process of extraction of treated wastewater in solid form the ftir spectra analysis indicates presence of lipid protein carbohydrate fatty acid amino acid in influent of dairy wastewater sample before treatment after floating hydroponic treatment absorption peak intensity reduces which indicates the effective removal of pollutants from wastewater 6 conclusion and future perspective present study outcome confirms efficient

bod tds tss tp phosphate and tn portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides aquatic macrophyte play a potential role in absorbing or treating nutrients and other contaminants because of their capacity to reproduce invasive character and nature of ubiquitous diffuse system of root in coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea foster an interaction zone close to region of rhizosphere of wastewater and root which can be utilized for onsite treatment system of various industrial wastewater hydroponic and propagated coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea aerated system can be installed for pre primary clarification portulaca oleracea and coleus scutellarioides system of hydroponic phytoremediation is a cost effective eco friendly easy to access and revamp with minimum technological challenges however retention time for the treatment of effluent is high further more research need to be done in design to improve the performance of treatment system the reduction of complex substances and load of chemical and tertiary treatment can be overcome by utilizing constructed wetland with integrated system hence the hydroponic cum coleus scutellarioides and portulaca oleracea system of treatment utilized in this study confirmed environmentally green and sustainable method simple and cost effective solution presently there is no definite and approved design basis

amount of eb is larger compared to rb which is further explained by density functional theory calculation rb and eb photocatalytic degradation removal are close to 100 under uv irradiation the oh and o2 generated by rs zno are responsible for rb and eb photocatalytic degradation based on electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer analysis besides the adsorption performance of rs zno contributes to rb and eb photocatalytic degradation this work indicates that rape straw waste is converted into rs zno for dye wastewater purification graphical abstract preparation of double functional carbon based zno adsorbent from rape straw using one pot for wastewater treatment unlabelled image keywords rape straw dye wastewater adsorption mechanism photocatalytic degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the environment of our world has seriously been polluted where we dispose of electronic medical industrial toxic and other harmful waste like dye into the water bodies 1 2 textile dyes of different industries and organic contaminated water are equally major causes of environmental pollution 3 4 the textile industry is a water consuming and heavily polluting industry 5 it is estimated that over 500 tons of various dyes are discharged into the water body 6 8 besides many dyes are hazardous carcinogenic and mutagenic for the aquatic life and human beings 9 10 therefore it is essential to separate dye from contaminated water using an effective method to eliminate the harm for the environment and human beings adsorption 11 biological 12 electrochemical 13 photodegradation 14 and chemical oxidation 15 are the common technologies for dye removal from wastewater adsorption and photodegradation technologies are the common and efficient methods for dye removal from wastewater among these technologies 16 however adsorption can only transfer dye from wastewater to the surface of adsorbent which cannot completely eradicate dye 17 18 photodegradation technology can completely remove the dye from wastewater by a series of oxidation reactions however the photocatalyst is expensive and the preparation process is complex 19 the photocatalysts are usually small in size which can cause agglomeration and decrease its dispersibility ying et al 2017 used activated carbon as the support to prevent the aggregation of zno and improve its dispersibility activated carbon is a stand alone adsorbent that possesses a high adsorption capacity for dye which could provide a high concentration of dye for zno degradation therefore the material has both photodegradation ability and adsorption performance which can contribute to dye wastewater removal by photodegradation and adsorption 20 in order to realize the economic and environmental friendly of preparation process the precursors of adsorbent photocatalyst should be sustainable and cheap 21 biomass waste can be used as the promising precursor for preparation of adsorbent photocatalyst to govern dye wastewater realizing waste to control waste 22 zncl2 is a kind of chemical agents to prepare activated carbon with the well developed pore structure zncl2 is decomposed into zno onto activated carbon in the activation process however zno is commonly washed from the surface of activated carbon using hcl to further extend its pore structure 23 this operation process will add the cost of preparation process besides it will produce acid wastewater if hcl is not used to wash the activated carbon it will obtain zno on its surface the formed zno activated carbon can be acted as the adsorbent photocatalyst composite this kind of adsorbent photocatalyst composites can be used in dye wastewater removal by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation due to well pore structure and the existence of zno the adsorption performance of zno activated carbon contributes to its photocatalytic degradation for dye besides the zno activated carbon is prepared using one pot method which is conductive to the large scale production and reduces the production cost for the actual application rape straw rs is a kind of biomass wastes which is produced every year however the comprehensive utilization rate is low therefore it is necessary to find an efficient utilization method for rs which can provide the guidance for the similar species in this work rs is used as feedstock to produce the adsorbent photocatalyst composite rs zno using zncl2 as chemical agent by a facile one pot method for rb and eb removal from wastewater the main objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the physicochemical properties of rs zno 2 analyze rb and eb adsorption process and mechanism on rs zno 3 analyze the involved in adsorption mechanism using the density

mg l is the liquid phase concentration of eb and eb solution at time t min the adsorption kinetic models data are presented in table s2 to test the adsorption desorption cycles of rs zno the sample is placed in the rb and eb solution at concentration of 300 mg l which is shaken for 48 h at 300 rpm the mixture is filtered and the residue is collected the regenerated rs zno is reused after being rinsed with distilled water and dried to constant weight 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of rs zno the nitrogen adsorption curve pore volume and pore distribution of rs zno are shown in fig 1 the type of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms is ii isotherm according to iupac classification 24 as fig 1a b shown rs zno has well developed pore structure which provides large number of adsorption sites for rb and eb adsorption zncl2 can acts as both a template and activating agent to promote the decomposition of feedstock during pyrolysis process which increases its specific surface area as fig 1a shown the nitrogen adsorption curve of rs zno has the hysteresis loop highlighting the presence of mesoporosity generation of mesopores is generally attributed to excess burnout or the zncl2 reaction rendering pore wall thinning and eventually pore merger the nitrogen adsorption capacity of rs zno continues to increase beyond a p p0 value of 0 1 which is typical for mesoporous material this type of isotherm indicates an indefinite multi layer formation after completion of the monolayer and is found in adsorbents with a wide distribution of pore sizes pore size distribution can affect the adsorption capacity of adsorbent for different sizes and shapes targeted contaminant which determines special application of adsorbent 25 the average pore size rs zno is 2 34 nm which mainly distributes in 1 5 nm fig 1c this result indicates that rs zno mainly has microporous and mesoporous ftir analysis of rs zno is shown in fig 2a as shown in fig 2a oh stretching vibration is appeared at 3441 cm 1 the peak at 2922 cm 1 in the ftir spectra is characteristic of ch stretching vibrations suggesting the presence of alkane alkene groups on the rs zno surface the peak of 2852 cm 1 is assigned to the ch2 stretch the cc group is found at peak of 1627 cm 1 rs zno has the peak at 1104 cm 1 which is assigned to the co stretching vibrations 26 these results indicate that oxygen containing groups such as quinone carboxyl hydroxy and lactone probably are generated in rs zno which contributes to rb and eb adsorption xue et al 2021 point out that oxygen containing group of adsorbent is conducive to organic dye removal 27 xrd spectrum of rs zno is shown in fig 2b fig 2b indicates that xrd spectrum has zno characteristic peaks zno diffraction peaks at 31 74 34 42 36 24 47 5 56 5 62 76 66 2 67 86 and 69 can be indexed to the 100 002 101 102 110 103 200 112 and 201 28 zno characteristic peaks are similar with the work reported by the xu et al 2014 when they prepared nanostructured fe3o4 zno 29 this result indicates that zncl2 is composed into zno zno peaks have large intensity which has well crystalline rs zno could be acted as the photocatalyst for photocatalytic degradation dye 30 these results also indicate that the one pot method of preparation rs zno is workable the micrographs of rs zno can be observed and analyzed by sem images fig 3a c indicates that the well developed visible pores are appeared onto rs zno this result demonstrates that zncl2 contributes to generating pores onto rs zno 31 the analysis result is consistent with pore structure analysis as fig 3a c shown the surface of rs zno has granular substance the granular substance has the o and zn elements which is confirmed by eds analysis fig 3d the granular substance is the zno based on xrd analysis 3 2 adsorption performance of rs zno 3 2 1 adsorption isotherms studies table 1 lists the fitting parameters calculated from adsorption data fitting the adsorption isotherms models as table 1 shown rb and eb adsorption behavior on rs zno can be more exactly described by langmuir and hill isotherm model with large r2 value the langmuir model represents a monolayer coverage which indicates that each site can be held by one adsorbate molecule on a homogenous substrate i e active sites are energetically equivalent langmuir quantitative interpretation of the solute phase is distribution between the solution and the solid rb and eb adsorption capacities of rs zno are 294 13 mg g and 449 23 mg g based on langmuir isotherm model calculation respectively this result indicates that rs zno has tremendous potential in dye wastewater treatment the derived n values from freundlich model for rb and eb adsorption are 5 34 and 4 17 respectively while d r model is more suitable to describe the actual situation which is commonly used to illustrate the adsorption characteristic qd r values of rb and eb calculated from the d r model are 288 09 and 433 05 mg g respectively if the e value is lower than 8 kj mol it belongs to physical adsorption 32 the adsorption of rb and eb on rs zno doesn t belong to physical adsorption adsorption based on e values table 1 the hill isotherm model assumes that the adsorption site has a cooperative phenomenon with the adsorbent the m values of the hill isotherm model for rb and eb adsorption are 0 6578 and 0 9006 indicating that one adsorption site of rs zno can only adsorb 0 6578 rb molecular or 0 9006 eb molecular fig 4 shows the rb and eb adsorption data fitting the adsorption isotherms models rb and eb adsorption amount of other similar adsorbents are summarized in table 2 as table 2 shown rs zno has larger rb and eb adsorption capability than that reported adsorbents therefore rs zno could be used as the promising adsorbent for rb and eb removal besides this result also demonstrates that the preparation method of rs zno is feasible 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics studies the fitting results of rb and eb adsorption on rs zno using the adsorption kinetics models are summarized in table 3 as table 3 shown rb and eb adsorption kinetics process can be more exactly analyzed by pseudo second order model owe to large r2 value among three kinds of adsorption kinetics models therefore pseudo second order model is employed to predict the rb and eb adsorption kinetic process the result demonstrates that adsorption site of rs zno mainly determines rb and eb adsorption rate the chemical mechanisms increase the affinity of adsorbents to rb and eb and reduce their release risk as table 3 shown the rb initial adsorption rate h is 0 4914 which is larger than that of eb 0 2457 the result indicates that the initial adsorption rate is large in the initial adsorption phase however average adsorption rate constant k2 of rb and eb are lower than that of h indicating that adsorption rate is faster at the beginning and gradually decreases with adsorption time increasing the large h values of rs zno suggest that π π conjugation or oh bonding participates in overcoming the mass transfer resistance between rb eb solution and rs zno 33 table 3 also indicates that eb adsorption rate k2 is larger than that of rb this result indicates that rs zno can quickly remove eb from wastewater fig 5 shows the adsorption data fitting adsorption kinetics models besides the rate limiting step of rb and eb adsorption on rs zno is investigated by the intraparticle diffusion model for the plot of qt versus t1 2 fig s1 the first steeper portion is the instantaneous adsorption or external surface adsorption the second portion is the gradual adsorption stage where intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting process 34 in some cases a third portion exists which is the final equilibrium stage where intraparticle diffusion starts to slow down due to extremely low adsorbate concentrations left in the solution as fig s1 shown the plot did not pass through the origin and this deviation from the origin or near saturation might be due to the difference in mass transfer rate in the initial and final stages of adsorption 35 this phenomenon strongly suggests that intraparticle diffusion involves in adsorption process but is not the rate controlling step c value presents the boundary layer thickness of the adsorbent if c value is large the corresponded adsorption resistance is large as table 3 shown the c value of rb is larger than that of eb indicating that rb adsorption resistance of rs zno is larger than that of eb 3 2 3 adsorption thermodynamics studies the thermodynamics parameters such as entropy s enthalpy h and free energy g are calculated by the following equations 3 ln kd δs r δ h rt 4 g rtln k d 5 k d q e c e fig s2 shows the slope and intercept of ln kd vs 1 t plot of rb and eb adsorption on rs zno the g values of rb 2 14 2 42 and 2 61 kj mol and eb 4 70 5 49 and 6 00 kj mol at 25 45 c indicate that rb and eb adsorption on rs zno are spontaneousness owe to negative g value g values decrease as adsorption temperature increases this phenomenon demonstrates that adsorption temperature contributes to rb and eb adsorption on rs zno which is useful in the actual application process the h values of rb 7 29 kj mol and eb 20 06 kj mol indicate that rb and eb adsorption on rs zno are endothermic the positive value of s 31 44 j mol of rb and 82 71 j mol of eb proves that spontaneous rb and eb adsorption on rs zno are favorable 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism adsorption of organic dye on carbon based adsorbent is considered to be influenced by the adsorbate as well as the pore structure and surface chemistry of the adsorbent 36 pseudo second order model accurately describes rb and eb adsorption kinetic process which indicates that chemisorption is involved in rb and eb adsorption onto rs zno combining the results of zeta potential of rs zno at different ph values it is assumed that electrostatic interaction participates in rb rb adsorption on rs zno fig 6a fig 6b shows the ftir spectra of rs zno before and after eb rb adsorption the peak at 1627 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of cc belonging to the aromatic structure which is migrated to 1622 cm 1 and 1617 cm 1 respectively this result might be ascribed to the π π interaction between rs zno and rb eb furthermore the presence of polar groups such as carboxylic amide alcohols esters ethers and phenol on the rs zno surface act as active sites to interact with rb eb by hydrogen bonds the oh peak exhibits an intensity decrease and a shift toward higher wavenumbers from 3441 to 3436 and 3433 cm 1 after rb eb adsorption respectively this result supports the creation of hydrogen bonding between the oxygen containing functional group of rs zno and rb eb molecules besides the aromatic rings of eb rb dye molecules interact with the co oh cooh and phenyl groups of the rs zno that act as adsorption sites for capturing eb rb by surface complexation 37 3 2 5 density functional theory calculation adsorption mechanism analysis indicates that carboxyl and hydroxyl groups involve in eb and rb adsorption density functional theory dft is used to investigate eb and rb adsorption on rs zno to decide which one carboxyl and hydroxyl groups has more important role in eb and rb adsorption process rs zno has carboxyl and hydroxyl groups therefore simpler biochar like molecules with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups such as phthalic acid or catechol could be acted as the model of rs zno eb and rb adsorption process are calculated by dft the binding energies of catechol or phthalic acid interactions with eb and rb are calculated by dft the calculated results are shown in fig 7 this result shows that it is existence of energy barrier in the adsorption process the binding energy of catechol interaction with rb 100 57 kj mol 1 and eb 133 15 kj mol 1 is negative than phthalic acid 4 87 kj mol 1 of rb and 49 51 kj mol 1of eb indicating that catechol plays an important role in rb and eb adsorption process this result indicates that hydroxyl groups play an important role in rb and eb adsorption process besides the binding energy of catechol interaction with rb is more negative than eb which indicates that eb is easily captured by the rs zno it is consistent with the adsorption isotherms analysis this result also explains the phenomenon that the eb adsorption on rs zno is larger compared to rb 3 2 6 reusability the reusability is used to assess the practical and economic use of rs zno besides the possible environmental pollution would be avoided by recycling rs zno from solution therefore the reusability of rs zno is an important parameter which is investigated by a series of adsorption desorption experiments fig 8 presents the reusability results of rs zno as shown in fig 8 the cycle number of rs zno has influenced rb and eb removal the rb and eb removal of rs zno are 84 71 and 83 25 of the initial level after three cycles respectively the reason may be that some rb and eb molecule on the rs zno cannot be removed using the desorption agent besides rs zno has lost some efficient adsorption sites in the adsorption desorption experiment the rs zno has excellent reusability which can be employed as the efficient adsorbent for contaminants removal from wastewater 3 2 7 effect of coexisted ions the impurity ions of actual water have influenced the adsorption performance of rs zno na k and mg2 are common metal cations which could influence rb and eb removal in the actual wastewater the rb and eb adsorption removal are presented in fig s3 at different coexisted ions concentrations fig s3 shows that rb and eb removal are slight influenced by na k and mg2 at different concentration the rb and eb removal are 82 06 90 71 at the na k and mg2 concentration of 1500 mg l compared to without adding the impurity ions the coexisting ions compete with rb and eb adsorption and the rate of diffusion to the surface of the rs zno is limited by the migration of rb and eb in the solution in other word there is existence of competitive adsorption between impurity ions and rb eb during adsorption process however rs zno still has high rb and eb removal in the actual water containing impurity ions the result indicates that rs zno has good application potential in actual wastewater process 3 3 photodegradation performance of rs zno rs zno is employed as photocatalyst for dye removal from wastewater owe to existence of zno photodegradation experiments are operated in dark condition before uv irridation to reach adsorption saturation which is used to eleminate the adsorption effect owe to developed pore structure of rs zno the detailed information of photodegradation experiment is in the supplementary material the adsorption and photodegradation process of rs zno are shown in fig 9 as fig 9 shown rb and eb removal are 14 36 42 63 and 27 63 43 81 at 15 25 mg g of rb and 30 50 mg g of eb in the dark condition due to large bet surface area without uv irradiation respectively fig 9 also indicates that rb and eb photodegradation removal increase as irradiation time increases at different concentrations the rb and eb removal are 75 05 94 41 and 83 23 95 83 at 15 25 and 30 50 mg l under uv irriadtion condition respectively it can be explained that a high concentration would reduce the transmittance of uv light in addition a high concentration increases the amount of e absorbed by rb and eb molecules resulting in that the photon flow that reached the surface of rs zno decreases 38 the analysis results show that rb and eb have good photodegradation removal under uv irradiation rs zno is the promising photocatalyst for dye removal rb 20 mg l and eb 40 mg l are used to further investigate the photodegradation mechanism of rs zno the rb and eb photodegradation process of rs zno are shown in fig s5 fig s5 has dark adsorption da photodegradation process up and direct photodegradation process without dark adsorption aup of rb and eb as fig s5 shown da up process of rs zno have large rb and eb removal which is close to 1 this result indicates that rb and eb can be totally removed combined with the adsorption and photodegradation performance of rs zno the rb and eb removal of the aup process are 63 53 and 71 74 respectively this result is larger than that of the rb 50 91 and eb 52 62 removal of up process the reason is that the adsorption performance of rs zno promotes rb and eb removal it also can be explained that rb and eb molecule are absorbed by rs zno and transferred rb and eb molecule to the surface of zno on rs zno for photocatalytic degradation besides the photogenerated electron hole pairs can be easily separated by the activated carbon on rs zno 39 the active species such as h oh and o2 in the photodegradation process play an important role in rb and eb removal 40 the electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer signals of oh and o2 active species are detected to directly verify the existence of active species generated from rs zno in the photocatalytic degradation process epr analysis results are shown in fig s4 epr spectrometer analysis proves that the free radicals oh and o2 generated by rs zno contribute to rb and eb removal the main peak intensity of rb and eb also gradually decreases as irradiation time increases fig 10 this phenomenon indicates that molecular structure of rb and eb is destroyed indicating that rb and eb have good photocatalytic removal the photocatalytic activity pathway of rb and eb are shown in fig 10c 4 conclusions the double functional rs zno is successfully prepared for rb and eb wastewater removal the adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic are investigated to describe rb and eb adsorption process rb and eb adsorption capacities of rs zno are 294 13 and 449 23 mg g based on langmuir model the possible adsorption mechanism of rs zno is investigated and analyzed rb and eb removal are 75 05 94 41 and 83 23 95 83 at 15 25 and 30 50 mg l under uv irriadtion condition respectively the free radicals oh and o2 generated by rs zno contribute to rb and eb removal declaration of competing interest the authors

12608,rape straw is used as feedstock to prepare the double functional carbon based zno rs zno using zncl2 as activation agent by one pot method for dye wastewater removal rs zno has well developed pore structure and zno which can be used as the adsorbent and photocatalyst for rhodamine b rb and evans blue eb wastewater removal rb and eb adsorption process are investigated by adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic studies the possible adsorption mechanism includes hydrogen bonding π π interactions electrostatic attraction pore filling and surface complexation the adsorption amount of eb is larger compared to rb which is further explained by density functional theory calculation rb and eb photocatalytic degradation removal are close to 100 under uv irradiation the oh and o2 generated by rs zno are responsible for rb and eb photocatalytic degradation based on electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer analysis besides the adsorption performance of rs zno contributes to rb and eb photocatalytic degradation this work indicates that rape straw waste is converted into rs zno for dye wastewater purification graphical abstract preparation of double functional carbon based zno adsorbent from rape straw using one pot for wastewater treatment unlabelled image keywords rape straw dye wastewater adsorption mechanism photocatalytic degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the environment of our world has seriously been polluted where we dispose of electronic medical industrial toxic and other harmful waste like dye into the water bodies 1 2 textile dyes of different industries and organic contaminated water are equally major causes of environmental pollution 3 4 the textile industry is a water consuming and heavily polluting industry 5 it is estimated that over 500 tons of various dyes are discharged into the water body 6 8 besides many dyes are hazardous carcinogenic and mutagenic for the aquatic life and human beings 9 10 therefore it is essential to separate dye from contaminated water using an effective method to eliminate the harm for the environment and human beings adsorption 11 biological 12 electrochemical 13 photodegradation 14 and chemical oxidation 15 are the common technologies for dye removal from wastewater adsorption and photodegradation technologies are the common and efficient methods for dye removal from wastewater among these technologies 16 however adsorption can only transfer dye from wastewater to the surface of adsorbent which cannot completely eradicate dye 17 18 photodegradation technology can completely remove the dye from wastewater by a series of oxidation reactions however the photocatalyst is expensive and the preparation process is complex 19 the photocatalysts are usually small in size which can cause agglomeration and decrease its dispersibility ying et al 2017 used activated carbon as the support to prevent the aggregation of zno and improve its dispersibility activated carbon is a stand alone adsorbent that possesses a high adsorption capacity for dye which could provide a high concentration of dye for zno degradation therefore the material has both photodegradation ability and adsorption performance which can contribute to dye wastewater removal by photodegradation and adsorption 20 in order to realize the economic and environmental friendly of preparation process the precursors of adsorbent photocatalyst should be sustainable and cheap 21 biomass waste can be used as the promising precursor for preparation of adsorbent photocatalyst to govern dye wastewater realizing waste to control waste 22 zncl2 is a kind of chemical agents to prepare activated carbon with the well developed pore structure zncl2 is decomposed into zno onto activated carbon in the activation process however zno is commonly washed from the surface of activated carbon using hcl to further extend its pore structure 23 this operation process will add the cost of preparation process besides it will produce acid wastewater if hcl is not used to wash the activated carbon it will obtain zno on its surface the formed zno activated carbon can be acted as the adsorbent photocatalyst composite this kind of adsorbent photocatalyst composites can be used in dye wastewater removal by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation due to well pore structure and the existence of zno the adsorption performance of zno activated carbon contributes to its photocatalytic degradation for dye besides the zno activated carbon is prepared using one pot method which is conductive to the large scale production and reduces the production cost for the actual application rape straw rs is a kind of biomass wastes which is produced every year however the comprehensive utilization rate is low therefore it is necessary to find an efficient utilization method for rs which can provide the guidance for the similar species in this work rs is used as feedstock to produce the adsorbent photocatalyst composite rs zno using zncl2 as chemical agent by a facile one pot method for rb and eb removal from wastewater the main objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the physicochemical properties of rs zno 2 analyze rb and eb adsorption process and mechanism on rs zno 3 analyze the involved in adsorption mechanism using the density

infrared spectroscopy ftir to analyze 2 4 adsorption experiment rb and eb are used as the adsorbate to test the adsorption potential of the rs zno batch adsorption experiments are conducted in a series of 250 ml volumetric flask 0 1 g rs zno is mixed with 100 ml rb or eb solution mono component systems the rb and eb concentrations are 200 400 mg l and 300 500 mg l respectively suspensions are putted in the thermostatic and oscillated at 300 rpm at 25 45 c until adsorption equilibrium after equilibrium is attained the amount of residual rb or eb concentration is determined using the uv vis spectrophotometer the maximum wave lengths of the rb and eb are 554 nm and 615 nm respectively the amount of rb and eb retained on the adsorbent qe mg g was calculated at equilibrium from the following equation 1 qe v c o c e m where c0 mg l and ce mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of rb and eb solutions respectively v is the volume of solution l and m is the weight of the adsorbent g the adsorption isotherm models are presented in table s1 adsorption kinetic studies are also conducted in a series of 250 ml volumetric flasks using methods similar to those described previously 0 1 g rs zno and 100 ml rb or eb mono component systems solution are mixed at the concentration of 400 mg g aqueous samples are collected at different time intervals and the residual concentrations of eb and eb are measured by the uv vis spectrophotometer the adsorption amounts of eb and eb adsorbed over time qt mg g are obtained by the following equation 2 q t c 0 ct v m where ct mg l is the liquid phase concentration of eb and eb solution at time t min the adsorption kinetic models data are presented in table s2 to test the adsorption desorption cycles of rs zno the sample is

and eb adsorption on rs zno the g values of rb 2 14 2 42 and 2 61 kj mol and eb 4 70 5 49 and 6 00 kj mol at 25 45 c indicate that rb and eb adsorption on rs zno are spontaneousness owe to negative g value g values decrease as adsorption temperature increases this phenomenon demonstrates that adsorption temperature contributes to rb and eb adsorption on rs zno which is useful in the actual application process the h values of rb 7 29 kj mol and eb 20 06 kj mol indicate that rb and eb adsorption on rs zno are endothermic the positive value of s 31 44 j mol of rb and 82 71 j mol of eb proves that spontaneous rb and eb adsorption on rs zno are favorable 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism adsorption of organic dye on carbon based adsorbent is considered to be influenced by the adsorbate as well as the pore structure and surface chemistry of the adsorbent 36 pseudo second order model accurately describes rb and eb adsorption kinetic process which indicates that chemisorption is involved in rb and eb adsorption onto rs zno combining the results of zeta potential of rs zno at different ph values it is assumed that electrostatic interaction participates in rb rb adsorption on rs zno fig 6a fig 6b shows the ftir spectra of rs zno before and after eb rb adsorption the peak at 1627 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of cc belonging to the aromatic structure which is migrated to 1622 cm 1 and 1617 cm 1 respectively this result might be ascribed to the π π interaction between rs zno and rb eb furthermore the presence of polar groups such as carboxylic amide alcohols esters ethers and phenol on the rs zno surface act as active sites to interact with rb eb by hydrogen bonds the oh peak exhibits an intensity decrease and a shift toward higher wavenumbers from 3441 to 3436 and 3433 cm 1 after rb eb adsorption respectively this result supports the creation of hydrogen bonding between the oxygen containing functional group of rs zno and rb eb molecules besides the aromatic rings of eb rb dye molecules interact with the co oh cooh and phenyl groups of the rs zno that act as adsorption sites for capturing eb rb by surface complexation 37 3 2 5 density functional theory calculation adsorption mechanism analysis indicates that carboxyl and hydroxyl groups involve in eb and rb adsorption density functional theory dft is used to investigate eb and rb adsorption on rs zno to decide which one carboxyl and hydroxyl groups has more important role in eb and rb adsorption process rs zno has carboxyl and hydroxyl groups therefore simpler biochar like molecules with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups such as phthalic acid or catechol could be acted as the model of rs zno eb and rb adsorption process are calculated by dft the binding energies of catechol or phthalic acid interactions with eb and rb are calculated by dft the calculated results are shown in fig 7 this result shows that it is existence of energy barrier in the adsorption process the binding energy of catechol interaction with rb 100 57 kj mol 1 and eb 133 15 kj mol 1 is negative than phthalic acid 4 87 kj mol 1 of rb and 49 51 kj mol 1of eb indicating that catechol plays an important role in rb and eb adsorption process this result indicates that hydroxyl groups play an important role in rb and eb adsorption process besides the binding energy of catechol interaction with rb is more negative than eb which indicates that eb is easily captured by the rs zno it is consistent with the adsorption isotherms analysis this result also explains the phenomenon that the eb adsorption on rs zno is larger compared to rb 3 2 6 reusability the reusability is used to assess the practical and economic use of rs zno besides the possible environmental pollution would be avoided by recycling rs zno from solution therefore the reusability of rs zno is an important parameter which is investigated by a series of adsorption desorption experiments fig 8 presents the reusability results of rs zno as shown in fig 8 the cycle number of rs zno has influenced rb and eb removal the rb and eb removal of rs zno are 84 71 and 83 25 of the initial level after three cycles respectively the reason may be that some rb and eb molecule on the rs zno cannot be removed using the desorption agent besides rs zno has lost some efficient adsorption sites in the adsorption desorption experiment the rs zno has excellent reusability which can be employed as the efficient adsorbent for contaminants removal from wastewater 3 2 7 effect of coexisted ions the impurity ions of actual water have influenced the adsorption performance of rs zno na k and mg2 are common metal cations which could influence rb and eb removal in the actual wastewater the rb and eb adsorption removal are presented in fig s3 at different coexisted ions concentrations fig s3 shows that rb and eb removal are slight influenced by na k and mg2 at different concentration the rb and eb removal are 82 06 90 71 at the na k and mg2 concentration of 1500 mg l compared to without adding the impurity ions the coexisting ions compete with rb and eb adsorption and the rate of diffusion to the surface of the rs zno is limited by the migration of rb and eb in the solution in other word there is existence of competitive adsorption between impurity ions and rb eb during adsorption process however rs zno still has high rb and eb removal in the actual water containing impurity ions the result indicates that rs zno has good application potential in actual wastewater process 3 3 photodegradation performance of rs zno rs zno is employed as photocatalyst for dye removal from wastewater owe to existence of zno photodegradation experiments are operated in dark condition before uv irridation to reach adsorption saturation which is used to eleminate the adsorption effect owe to developed pore structure of rs zno the detailed information of photodegradation experiment is in the supplementary material the adsorption and photodegradation process of rs zno are shown in fig 9 as fig 9 shown rb and eb removal are 14 36 42 63 and 27 63 43 81 at 15 25 mg g of rb and 30 50 mg g of eb in the dark condition due to large bet surface area without uv irradiation respectively fig 9 also indicates that rb and eb photodegradation removal increase as irradiation time increases at different concentrations the rb and eb removal are 75 05 94 41 and 83 23 95 83 at 15 25 and 30 50 mg l under uv irriadtion condition respectively it can be explained that a high concentration would reduce the transmittance of uv light in addition a high concentration increases the amount of e absorbed by rb and eb molecules resulting in that the photon flow that reached the surface of rs zno decreases 38 the analysis results show that rb and eb have good photodegradation removal under uv irradiation rs zno is the promising photocatalyst for dye removal rb 20 mg l and eb 40 mg l are used to further investigate the photodegradation mechanism of rs zno the rb and eb photodegradation process of rs zno are shown in fig s5 fig s5 has dark adsorption da photodegradation process up and direct photodegradation process without dark adsorption aup of rb and eb as fig s5 shown da up process of rs zno have large rb and eb removal which is close to 1 this result indicates that rb and eb can be totally removed combined with the adsorption and photodegradation performance of rs zno the rb and eb removal of the aup process are 63 53 and 71 74 respectively this result is larger than that of the rb 50 91 and eb 52 62 removal of up process the reason is that the adsorption performance of rs zno promotes rb and eb removal it also can be explained that rb and eb molecule are absorbed by rs zno and transferred rb and eb molecule to the surface of zno on rs zno for photocatalytic degradation besides the photogenerated electron hole pairs can be easily separated by the activated carbon on rs zno 39 the active species such as h oh and o2 in the photodegradation process play an important role in rb and eb removal 40 the electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer signals of oh and o2 active species are detected to directly verify the existence of active species generated from rs zno in the photocatalytic degradation process epr analysis results are shown in fig s4 epr spectrometer analysis proves that the free radicals oh and o2 generated by rs zno contribute to rb and eb removal the main peak intensity of rb and eb also gradually decreases as irradiation time increases fig 10 this phenomenon indicates that molecular structure of rb and eb is destroyed indicating that rb and eb have good photocatalytic removal the photocatalytic activity pathway of rb and eb are shown in fig 10c 4 conclusions the double functional rs zno is successfully prepared for rb and eb wastewater removal the adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic are investigated to describe rb and eb adsorption process rb and eb adsorption capacities of rs zno are 294 13 and 449 23 mg g based on langmuir model the possible adsorption mechanism of rs zno is investigated and analyzed rb and eb removal are 75 05 94 41 and 83 23 95 83 at 15 25 and 30 50 mg l under uv irriadtion condition respectively the free radicals oh and o2 generated by rs zno contribute to rb and eb removal declaration of competing interest the authors

12609,sustainable effluent treatments are essential tools in lowering the environmental impact of industrial activities the partial or complete replacement of synthetic coagulants by natural coagulants especially plant based ones can reduce the footprint of the effluent treatment due to the higher biodegradability and non toxicity natural coagulants are also generally cheaper this review focuses on plant based coagulants used in food industry wastewater treatment extraction parameters of plant based coagulants and effluent treatment conditions for different coagulants are presented based on an extensive assessment of peer reviewed papers on food industry wastewater treatment the performance of plant based coagulants is compared to that of traditional synthetic coagulants both alone and as coagulant aids this review aims to guide researchers and industry professionals in optimizing and scaling up environment friendlier wastewater treatments using natural coagulants keywords effluent treatment wastewater treatment coagulation natural coagulants sustainability biocoagulants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction industrial activities are one of the leading causes of water pollution due to the generation of significant amounts of wastewater that contain toxic species or species that are difficult to degrade 1 the production of liquid waste by the food industry is sizeable especially in the animal based food sector slaughtering operations and meat processing generate massive volumes of wastewater rich in proteins organic compounds and fats 5 for example slaughtering a single pig or cow generates 330 l and 700 l of wastewater respectively 2 4 although drastically less than the animal sector the production of plant derived foods also uses significant amounts of water for instance the production of one ton of crude palm oil requires 5 7 5 tons of water 6 7 another example is the cassava starch industry which generates 12 15 l of wastewater for each m3 of processed cassava the wastewater from cassava starch production exhibits high biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total solids ts and cyanides 8 inadequate disposal of food industry effluents impacts the environment due to the high load of organic matter heavy metals alkalinity and hardness resulting in water pollution odor generation algal blooms and mortality of aquatic and land animals 4 9 the appropriate treatment of industrial wastewater is carried out by effluent treatment stations etss 10 by diminishing the polluting load of effluents etss enable their safe reuse or release into water bodies to treat wastewater etss utilize coagulation flocculation sedimentation and other physical chemical and biological processes 11 wastewater treatments can be classified into physical media filtration settling adsorption membrane and ultraviolet radiation chemical electrochemical coagulation oxidation ion exchange disinfection catalytic reduction and softening and biological microbial biodegradation phytoremediation constructed wetlands and bioreactor digestion 12 13 among these technologies coagulation and flocculation cf are the oldest and most widely employed in wastewater treatment due to their simplicity cost efficiency efficacy and low energy demand 14 coagulation involves the addition of a coagulating agent to the effluent to reduce the forces that keep suspended particles apart from colloids flocculation agglomerates the resulting material to form larger particles that can be easily separated following sedimentation 13 15 in wastewater processing cf has been used as a pretreatment to remove suspended impurities and improve the quality of the treated effluent for the subsequent stages 15 cf operations are also utilized to remove compounds other than suspended particles and colloids such as pigments micro pollutants organic compounds oils and fats 14 due to the crucial role of cf in ensuring the safe discharge of wastewaters the global coagulant and flocculant market is estimated to reach usd 6 01 billion by 2022 following an annual growth rate of 5 9 between 2017 and 2022 16 the economic relevance of cf warrants the study of plant based coagulants as sustainable substitutes to chemical based coagulants 13 natural coagulants exhibit greater biodegradability lower cost and lesser toxicity and generate less sludge 9 17 18 given the alarming amplification of the climate and ecological crises research applying natural coagulants has critical industrial relevance by promoting more environmentally friendly effluent treatments research on natural coagulants is primarily focused on the treatment of drinking water 19 20 however studies that explore the application in industrial effluents mainly from the food industry have been growing in recent years for example vieira et al 9 and real olvera et al 4 investigated moringa oleifera as plant based coagulants in the treatment of dairy industry and slaughterhouse wastewaters respectively vieira et al 9 reported a 90 removal of color and turbidity while real olvera et al 4 obtained a 64 reduction in cod dozens of other research studies on the performance of plant based coagulants to treat food industry effluents will be discussed in the following sections this review provides a database for industry professionals and scientists interested in applying plant based coagulants in food industry wastewater treatment 2 coagulation and flocculation as colloidal particles present in effluents exhibit a low sedimentation velocity etss use cf to reduce suspended and dissolved materials 21 the use of coagulants during cf reduces the turbidity and color of wastewaters 9 turbidity for instance is reduced by 85 99 22 coagulation and flocculation agglomerate the impurities from the effluent into larger and heavier particles called flocs which can be removed by sedimentation filtration or flotation 23 fig 1 coagulation is a process that affects the physical forces and chemical reactions between the effluent and the dissolved impurities the coagulating agent generates positively charged ions in the water which contains negatively charged colloids 21 as a result the repulsion between particles is reduced causing the particles to collide and stick together to form flocs from an electrostatic point of view coagulation reduces the zeta potential i e the electric potential between the liquid medium and the particles surface by adding specific ions according to okuda et al 24 the zeta potential is an analytical method to evaluate the effect of coagulation which helps select the optimal coagulant dosage and medium ph according to pritchard et al 19 the coagulant must be mixed vigorously for a few seconds immediately after addition into the effluent fig 2 to ensure uniform dispersion and high interaction between coagulant and effluent coagulation efficiency is a function of the contact between coagulant and suspended particles before the end of the mixing stage in the subsequent step flocculation occurs due to the neutralization between the coagulant s acidity and the effluent s alkalinity flocs form due to the electrostatic attraction between the positive charges resulting from the ionization of the coagulant and the negative charges of the particles flocs are larger heavier particles exhibiting ionic bonds that tend to precipitate with decreased flow velocity 25 during flocculation proper time and stirring must be chosen to ensure floc formation since the aggregation of suspended particles occurs due to the collision between the particles previously destabilized by the coagulant agglomeration is attributed to van der waals forces 26 the greater the velocity gradient the faster the rate of particle agglutination however the flocs will grow to a maximum limit as the high shear forces can cause the agglomerated particles to break 21 as too intense agitation in the flocculation stage can hinder floc stability lower mixing velocities must be selected at this stage fig 2 27 worth noting when coagulation and flocculation are not carried out properly the performance of the treatment is compromised jeopardizing the quality of the treated effluent table 1 presents the operational conditions coagulation flocculation and sedimentation used in the treatment of food industry effluents with plant based coagulants due to the wide range of industrial effluents experiments must be conducted to define the optimal operational conditions for coagulation flocculation and sedimentation aiming at high efficiency and low cost an efficient way to determine the coagulant dosage and the coagulation ph is to conduct tests in static reactors known as jar tests fig 3 jar testing entails subjecting the effluent added with specific coagulant dosages to vigorous agitation the stirring rate is then significantly reduced to promote floc formation and the sample is let to sit for a defined period until the decanted water samples are collected sedimentation table 1 coagulation efficiency depends not only on the chemical nature of the effluent and the coagulant but also on such operational conditions as initial ph coagulant dosage particle size temperature stirring rate and reaction time 49 research on effluent treatment often uses experimental design as a statistical tool to evaluate the ideal conditions in which coagulation flocculation and sedimentation occur 6 7 24 34 44 the resulting data are plotted to illustrate changes in quality parameters e g color turbidity cod total solids among others as a function of operational conditions e g medium ph and coagulant dosage the objective is to derive the optimal conditions for maximum particle removal 50 such graphs are of prime importance in the design of jar tests and interpretation of results 51 3 coagulants the various coagulants used in effluent treatment can be classified into chemical coagulants also called synthetic or inorganic and natural coagulants 9 52 the coagulant s efficiency depends on the affinity and specificity characteristics which are a function of its physical chemical properties 49 metal based materials are the coagulants traditionally used in wastewater treatment despite the broad applicability of metal based coagulants the challenges associated with their use have prompted research efforts to develop environment friendly biobased coagulants 14 3 1 synthetic coagulants the most used inorganic coagulants are trivalent iron and aluminum salts with alcl3 al2 so4 3 fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 being the most frequent due to the low cost and proven coagulant capacity 53 54 the choice depends primarily on the effluent s characteristics coagulation performed with aluminum and iron salts involves chemical and physical phenomena the hydrolysis promoted by the coagulant forming hydrolyzed and positive charged species is a chemical process the formation of hydrolyzed species depends on the coagulant dosage and the effluent s ph 55 in general these coagulants will only be effective if the effluent is alkaline otherwise coagulation will be limited due to excess protons released by the coagulant in turn the physical mechanisms encompass the contact of the hydrolyzed species with the impurities present in the effluent forming flocs flocculation stage 21 particle aggregation results from the neutralization of negative charges of the effluent s solids by the hydrolyzed species ensuring floc growth and hence rapid precipitation 55 despite the recognized efficacy of synthetic coagulants in wastewater treatment the use of agents based on aluminum salts requires strict control over the residual concentration of inorganic material in the treated effluent according to yin 23 after the salt is solubilized the cation released will be adsorbed onto the solid suspended material in other words the sedimented material will have a high concentration of the cation for example al3 which impedes the safe discharge of the treated effluent in the environment studies link high aluminum intake to potential health conditions such as alzheimer s disease 13 3 2 natural plant based coagulants plant based coagulants play a prominent role in sustainable wastewater treatment due to their high biodegradability non corrosive nature and non toxicity an increasing number of research papers focus on the coagulation properties of seeds and bark resins from different plant species but also of bone shell extracts extracts from shellfish exoskeleton and natural mineral soils 14 20 56 57 natural coagulants are composed of large molecular chains either positively or negatively charged these coagulants can be cationic anionic or non ionic with the former two collectively termed polyelectrolytes 58 however only cationic polyelectrolytes those with positive charges are ideal for use as coagulants 14 coagulants characterized as cationic polyelectrolytes are ideal in wastewater treatment because the colloidal material present in the effluent generally exhibits a negative surface electrical charge cationic polyelectrolytes produce cationic species in the effluent destabilizing the particles and thus contributing to coagulation the resulting attraction between particles van der waals force enhances floc formation due to a reduction in the negative charge of the colloidal surface 52 54 natural coagulants have been studied as partial or total substitutes of chemical coagulants to improve the cf stage both the quality of the flocs produced and the reduction elimination of metals in the final sludge 52 the use of natural coagulants combines the properties expected for effluent treatment with abundant availability low toxicity and cost high biodegradability and low rate of waste sludge production 52 59 60 nevertheless the presence of natural organic polyelectrolytes in drinking water treatment can increase the organic matter content prompting the onset of unpleasant tastes and odors therefore the introduction of natural coagulants in water treatment must be carefully considered as the treated water is likely to contain residues that will be ingested by consumers 19 20 56 in effluent treatment this aspect is still little explored 61 63 table 2 presents the main conclusions of several studies on plant based coagulants in the treatment of food industry wastewater 3 2 1 parameters that influence the performance of plant based coagulants in view of the wide range of existing coagulants both chemical and natural choosing the most efficient can be challenging the process parameters such as dosage settling time mixtures temperature and ph must be weighted appropriately to obtain the best performance in removing contaminants 64 65 tables 1 and 2 summarize the process parameters commonly used in food industry effluents treated with plant based coagulants as well as the main performance results 3 2 1 1 dosage inadequate coagulant dosing results in unsatisfactory water quality after treatment therefore it is critical to determine the dosage range needed to obtain maximum pollutant removals at minimum cost among different coagulation mechanisms only charge neutralization and bridging are negatively affected by dosage mainly due to the stoichiometric relationship 44 66 when the effluent s turbidity is high 100 ntu the required coagulant dosage tends to be lower compared to low turbidity wastewaters 5 10 ntu 59 a likely cause is the collision frequency between particles and coagulant 15 as high turbidity means a high concentration of impurities and a high collision frequency coagulation is more likely in this case lower dosages of coagulant are necessary in contrast low turbidity requires a high dosage of coagulant because the collision frequency between impurities and coagulants is lower 50 optimal dosage can be obtained by plotting the measured turbidity or any other pollutant parameter versus the applied dosage 60 61 there is a decline in contaminant removal efficiency when the coagulant dosage is less than or exceeds the required dosage overdosing can lead to charge reversal and consequently result in particle repulsion preventing floc formation overdosing restricts the number of available adsorption sites by covering the coagulant surface 44 51 therefore adding more coagulant to the wastewater treatment does not enhance the coagulation process on the other hand a dosage much lower than necessary results in incomplete and ineffective coagulation because most of the particles remain in suspension real olvera et al 4 tested a dosage of 3 to 7 g l of moringa oleifera for the treatment of slaughterhouse effluent and observed that 7 g l yielded the best results when cassia obtusifolia at a dosage of 0 to 2 5 g l was used in effluent coagulation the optimal condition was 1 0 g l to treat palm oil residue 6 and 2 g l for rice starch 62 3 2 1 2 ph a solution s ph affects the efficiency of the coagulation process by changing the electrochemical nature of the solvent and ionic polymers used 44 63 therefore the system s ph optimization is essential to ensure efficient coagulation 61 66 the decrease in ph lowers the load of natural organic matter nom reducing their water solubility consequently coagulation efficiency is reduced as the main coagulation mechanism is charge neutralization in which cations or polyelectrolytes are required to bind to the negative charge of the nom 44 61 an optimal ph is also critical for forming metal poly hydroxides and the precipitation of solid colloidal phases 61 cationic polyelectrolytes are the most widely used organic polyelectrolytes owing to their ability to bind with negatively charged noms the positive charge in these polymers can increase at lower ph when the functional groups responsible for the cationic behavior are amines primary secondary and tertiary 61 some studies have optimized the ph of the treatment system when using plant based coagulants for example coccinia indica 67 okra gum 68 cactus and hyacinth bean peels 69 the optimal ph for coagulation using okra gum was 9 2 with 98 3 ss removal 68 at this ph okra gum uncoiled further to achieve a flat dangling form which enhances the coagulation process most legumes used as natural coagulants perform better when coagulation occurs at an optimized ph of 7 to 8 5 20 56 however the same coagulant can exhibit different optimal phs depending on the effluent under treatment for example moringa oleifera showed optimal performance at ph 9 0 for slaughterhouse effluent 4 between 4 0 and 5 0 for the effluent from the pulp of coffee fruits 6 and 4 0 for distillery spent wash 46 3 2 1 3 temperature temperature is the factor that receives the least attention in effluent treatment few studies have reported the effect of temperature on treatment efficiency 6 36 40 70 temperature affects coagulation kinetics and impurity removal efficiency 71 72 coagulation efficiency improves with an increase in temperature due to the higher collision rate among particles this results in lower viscosity favoring the homogeneous dissipation of the coagulation species in the mixing stage 73 at low temperatures floc aggregation tends to be weak due to the lesser particle particle collisions due to the formation of irregular flocs under low temperature conditions the coagulant dosage required to remove organic matter is higher 70 72 in many cases the effluent s temperature is a non controllable parameter which affects the removal of nom by coagulation therefore dosages must be reassessed across seasons to account for temperature changes 2 70 for plant based coagulants the optimal process temperature is 25 30 c 6 36 40 70 as the active agents in plant based coagulants are generally proteins system temperature must be increased carefully to avoid a reduction in the coagulation capacity due to protein denaturation as denaturation causes changes in the protein s spatial configuration its biological activity is reduced or lost 3 2 1 4 mixing mixing is crucial in coagulation processes including both rapid mixing to promote the interaction of coagulants with suspended particles to form microflocs and slow mixing to promote microfloc aggregation and large floc formation excessively low mixing speed and considerably short mixing time can decrease the rate of floc formation while excessively fast mixing speed and considerably long mixing time can break the flocs yielding poor settling efficiency 55 70 71 as shown in table 1 mixing parameters in the treatment of food industry effluents with plant based coagulants vary from 100 to 300 rpm for 30 s to 5 min for fast mixing and 20 to 100 rpm per 5 40 min for fast mixing followed by sedimentation for 30 min to 24 h 3 3 plant based versus chemical coagulants in effluent treatment the coagulation stage is conducted by adding a coagulating agent to reduce or remove suspended impurities and other types of pollutants such as organic compounds 15 74 the coagulating agent can be chemical based or naturally derived 75 currently chemical coagulants predominate in industrial settings due to their low cost high efficiency easy handling and widespread market availability alcl3 al2 so4 3 fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 are the most used coagulants 76 although these factors drive the choice of chemical coagulants over plant based alternatives chemical agents have raised controversial issues due to their low biodegradability and toxicity to living organisms residual aluminum concentrations are still detected after treatment 76 77 researchers warn that alzheimer s disease is linked to aluminum neurotoxicity 78 furthermore synthetic coagulants can form dangerous by products such as acrylamide a carcinogen and neurotoxic substance 79 according to kurniawan et al 79 the disposal of toxic sludge pollutes water and soil affecting plant and animal species negatively as a result chemical coagulants are not considered sustainable and do not qualify as green options 76 therefore it is necessary to promote sustainable and equally efficient coagulating agents natural coagulants are biodegradable non toxic non corrosive reduce the amount of sludge and are environmentally friendly 9 17 18 37 natural coagulants are recognized in traditional water purification especially in impoverished communities 20 56 based on these applications natural coagulants have attracted the scientific community s attention due to their significant health and environmental benefits and their efficiency in removing contaminants several studies have proven the effectiveness of plant based coagulants in wastewater treatment applications removal of 98 of color and turbidity from dairy industry wastewater 9 64 cod removal from slaughterhouse wastewater 4 removal of 87 tss and 55 cod from palm oil milling effluent 6 reduction of 54 tss 100 cod and 100 nitrate and nitrite from coffee fermentation wastewater 44 reduction of 95 suspended solids and 52 2 cod from palm oil milling effluent 35 removal of 96 5 color 87 cod and 99 9 turbidity from distillery spent wash 46 and removal of 90 of cod from palm oil milling effluent 39 however these studies are massively small scale the industrial application of natural coagulants in wastewater treatment is still limited especially owing to a lacking tax incentive and inconsistent information on performance quality control and production standards of plant extracts 20 76 80 although moringa oleifera is the most commonly used and extensively researched plant based coagulant 4 29 47 50 75 several others have been identified such as nirmali seeds strychnos potatorum 81 dolichos lablab or hyacinth bean lablab purpureus 69 banana musa paradisica 82 roselle seeds hibiscus sabdariffa 83 84 cactus species 85 watermelon seeds 86 sicklepod cassia obtusifolia 6 7 rice starch 37 38 okra abelmoschus esculentus sandpaper tree ficus exasperate and bridelia ferrugeneae 41 3 4 association between natural and inorganic coagulants despite the environmental benefits of using natural coagulants in drinking water and wastewater treatment these might not be as effective as inorganic coagulants to harness the advantages of natural coagulants without hindering the treatment efficiency they can be combined with inorganic coagulants either as a composite coagulant or as coagulant aid 87 88 the former is produced by combining two types of coagulants as a single coagulant while coagulant aids are materials added some time after the dosing of the primary coagulant these approaches minimize the consumption of non renewable coagulants and their associated environmental impact 89 there are few studies on the association of natural coagulants with inorganic coagulants such as ferric chloride polyaluminum chloride and aluminum sulfate 62 shak and wu 7 reported a 55 reduction in alum when gum extracted from cassia obtusifolia seeds was employed as a coagulant aid more impurities were adsorbed onto the coagulant aid due to the polymeric structure of the natural gum ghebremichael et al 90 concluded that dosing the moringa coagulant prior to alum resulted in better removal of turbidity and dissolved organic carbon from surface water river furthermore the use of the natural coagulant aid reduced the alum dosage by 50 75 similar benefits were achieved by dosing alum and moringa coagulants together in concrete wastewater treatment 75 freitas et al 91 also highlighted that dosing the moringa coagulant after alum results in greater turbidity removal than dosing them together to treat polluted stream water natural materials that might not perform well as coagulants individually e g lignin starch green algae and cactus mucilage can be used as coagulant aids or as part of a composite coagulant 13 89 91 92 these coagulant aids strengthen the flocs through charge neutralization and bonding with the flocs formed by the primary coagulant as the treatment becomes more effective and the dosage of the primary coagulant is reduced the residual inorganic coagulant e g aluminum is also minimized 4 active principle underlying coagulation with natural agents in broad terms most natural coagulants can be categorized into two groups based on the main compounds with coagulation activity polysaccharides and proteins examples of the first group are plant or animal derived materials such as chitosan starch and mucilage while protein based natural coagulants typically originate from plants 9 93 the presence of hydroxyl and amino functional groups in these compounds contribute to their coagulation capacity 13 plant based natural coagulants are mostly water soluble organic molecules 94 96 extracted primarily from seeds 97 99 and mucilages 100 101 for example moringa oleifera seeds are used as a coagulant due to the presence of soluble cationic proteins capable of reducing the turbidity of the treated liquid 4 102 nordmark et al 103 isolated eight different cationic protein fractions from aqueous extracts of moringa seeds in turn kwaambwa and maikokera 104 hypothesized that the active agents responsible for coagulation in moringa are dimeric cationic proteins with a molecular mass in the range of 12 14 kda and an isoelectric point of ph 10 11 which indicates a highly cationic nature ghebremichael et al 90 concluded that the active compound in moringa is not a single protein but rather a mixture of proteins with similar physical characteristics according to the authors this protein mixture is heat resistant and exhibits clotting activity after 5 h of heat treatment at 95 c this property renders the active ingredient ideal for use in water and effluent treatment systems exposed to high temperatures 35 40 c as frequently found in tropical countries unlike conventional metallic inorganic coagulants natural coagulants exhibit particularities that affect the quality control of the active ingredient rendering it more challenging this behavior results from the extraction method which comprises various stages and the coagulant source especially plant based coagulants where the compounds vary according to the plant species and growth conditions 13 worth noting non coagulating impurities will inevitably be present in extracted natural coagulants if further purification is not conducted the presence of impurities that possess no coagulation capacity affects the coagulation efficiency 102 for example the lipid fraction may inhibit the contact between coagulant and impurities rendering the floc formation ineffective while carbohydrates may increase the organic matter concentration in the solution 102 105 extensive purification can be conducted but will incur additional costs according to the source and extraction approach the variable performance of natural coagulants might hinder quality control 13 5 processing techniques of natural coagulants whenever the objective is to utilize the isolated active ingredient e g a particular protein coagulant preparation must follow three main stages fig 4 a primary flour preparation b secondary protein extraction and c tertiary purification 18 the characteristics of the coagulant and its performance in cf are directly influenced by the order of these stages 106 using moringa oleifera as a reference the primary stage includes harvesting the seeds removing the husk crushing sieving and drying the recommended particle size for water and effluent treatment varies between 0 25 mm and 1 25 mm 107 moringa seeds contain a wide variety of undesirable compounds in cf that increase the organic load in the treated wastewater therefore the material obtained in the primary stage is further treated the secondary stage consists of extracting proteins with water or saline solutions 18 the simplest extraction method uses clean water jung et al 108 mixed powdered moringa seeds with water and stirred the mixture to release the coagulating compounds which are positively charged proteins however the coagulation efficiency of this extraction approach is often unsatisfactory due to the presence of non coagulating impurities and a low number of coagulating compounds 13 the main disadvantage of water extraction is the increased cod due to the dissolved organic carbon content which discourages the use in drinking water treatment 109 in wastewater treatment this method s efficiency is controversial cod dropped in some studies and increased in others 33 in the study by oladoja 14 salt solution extraction exhibited better coagulant capacity than water extraction which can be explained by the higher number of soluble proteins present in salt extracts the author recommends using moringa seeds as a coagulant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater effluents intended for water reuse only after purifying the active proteins the coagulation capacity of a particular substance can be improved by using salt solutions e g nacl and cacl2 during extraction 110 111 the use of saline solution enhances protein extraction from natural coagulants due to the salt s capabilities of promoting protein protein dissociation and increasing the solubility of proteins which increases the efficiency of the coagulant ion 111 megersa et al 111 demonstrated that the addition of salt solutions nacl kno3 and nh4cl enhances the coagulation performance compared to the water extracted moringa coagulant the optimum coagulant dosage extracted using 0 5 m nacl was 2 mg ml yielding a 91 turbidity removal such improvement is attributed to the increased solubility of proteins from the natural coagulant in the presence of salt due to the breaking down of protein protein bonds carvalho et al 110 reported that moringa coagulant extracted with cacl2 resulted in higher turbidity removal compared to nacl extraction which could be explained by the participation of calcium ions in the coagulation process apart from increasing the extraction yield i e number of compounds with coagulation capacity the purity of natural coagulants can be improved to reduce impurity concentration and coagulant dosage organic compounds present in natural coagulants that do not take part in coagulation will possibly end up in the treated water as dissolved organic matter 112 the presence of organic residues is undesirable due to the increased risk of bacterial growth which can serve as a substrate for the formation of hazardous by products 113 114 to avoid such adverse effects natural coagulants must be purified after extraction only those compounds that contribute to the coagulation properties are purified in the third stage regardless of the plant source coagulating compounds are either polysaccharides or proteins 13 to obtain pure coagulants purification can be carried out using a combination of different methods such as dialysis centrifugation ultrafiltration chemical precipitation ion exchange and lyophilization 18 24 the final extract may differ based on the purification method and different solvent extractions and extract fractionation will yield different types of products 115 sánchez martín et al 112 investigated the impact of ion exchange purification using nacl solution on the coagulation performance of moringa extract the optimum dosage of the single step purified coagulant elution with 0 6 m nacl was two times higher than the two step purified coagulant first elution with 0 3 m nacl followed by a second elution with 0 6 m nacl in terms of turbidity removal this led to the production of more purified coagulants containing active coagulant proteins after the second elution the purified coagulant produced via ion exchange performed at par with the conventional alum coagulant in terms of required dosage 1 mg l and turbidity removal efficiency 83 for natural river water 111 without further purification the moringa extract could only achieve 50 turbidity removal at a similar dosage and required fourfold the dosage for 83 removal efficiency therefore the purification process can produce natural coagulants with a higher proportion of active coagulation compounds which results in better performance even at lower optimal dosage 13 98 due to the high cost of ion exchange chromatography researchers have sought alternative purification approaches that are more economically viable at the industrial level 13 relatively simple chemical precipitation using ammonium sulphate of compounds possessing coagulation activity has been proposed for the purification of moringa extract 95 116 choudhary and neogi 116 reported that the natural moringa extract isolated with saturated ammonium sulphate exhibited superior turbidity removal efficiency than alum hence a simple but effective isolation and purification method for natural moringa extract may result in a natural coagulant with satisfactory coagulation capacity 13 the methodology involved in the production of moringa coagulant can be replicated to extract and purify natural coagulants from other plant sources e g seeds of plantago plantago major l beans phaseolus vulgaris chestnut bertholletia excelsa basil ocimum basilicum oak quercus robur hibiscus flower hibiscus l or cactus pads from opuntia species 83 93 117 120 in general the extraction and purification of plant based natural coagulants rely on three stages as shown in fig 3 table 3 presents the manufacturing process of natural coagulants used to treat food industry wastewater 6 mechanisms of coagulation with natural agents natural coagulants can be obtained from plants animals and microorganisms the main mechanisms involved in the coagulation with plant based coagulants are adsorption and charge neutralization or alternatively adsorption and bond formation it is difficult to define the exact mechanism because the phenomena can co occur 121 122 adsorption and charge neutralization refer to the sorption of two particulates with oppositely charged ions while interparticle bridging occurs when a coagulant provides a polymeric chain that sorbs particulates 101 these two mechanisms are involved in the coagulant properties of plant based coagulants 58 101 amran et al 123 discuss in more detail how plant based coagulants promote the coagulation of pollutants in wastewater in charge neutralization an ionizable polymer present in the coagulant stabilizes the colloidal particles which otherwise would repel one another for being negatively charged in polymer adsorption long chain polymers partially attach themselves to the surface of the colloidal particles due to the affinity between them the unattached parts composed of loops and tails are the main structure involved in bond formation or polymer bridging bridging ensures the formation of pollutant flocs by decreasing interparticle repulsion sufficient coagulant dosages will provide the required amount of polymer to promote strong polymer bridging in the study by vieira et al 9 the sorption potential of moringa coagulant was assessed for color turbidity and cod removal in dairy industry wastewater diw maximum adsorption of diw components from aqueous solutions occurred using 1 g l of moringa seeds with a 60 min agitation time which suggested an excellent affinity between diw components and sorbent furthermore the moringa coagulant showed sorption capacity within a ph range from 5 to 8 real olvera et al 4 investigated the adsorption of organic pollutants from slaughterhouse wastewater when m oleifera was employed as a natural coagulant the results indicated that 180 min is necessary for high adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity of 0 523 g cod g powder suggests a good affinity between organic pollutants and powdered seeds moringa seed powder exhibited sorption capacity over the ph range 5 to 9 but the best results were obtained at high ph levels 7 benefits of using natural coagulants natural coagulants overperform chemical coagulants in terms of biodegradability non corrosivity and lower or non toxicity 24 54 106 fig 5 such features are attractive for the development of greener water and wastewater treatment where processing costs are reduced while color and turbidity removal are improved 122 in addition the sludge produced during the coagulation process is innocuous and has a volume 4 5 times smaller than the sludge produced when aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride are used 9124 furthermore natural coagulants do not significantly change the ph of the medium 124 and do not cause corrosion problems 99 although efficiency is one of the most critical factors in water and wastewater treatment other criteria are equally relevant for the long term reliability of sustainable plant based coagulants in effluent treatment sustainability encompasses the integration of environmental social economic and technical aspects 125 fig 6 8 economic aspects of plant based coagulants chemical coagulants are predominant in wastewater treatment because of their low cost easy handling high availability and market diversification nonetheless chemical coagulants do not fit into green chemistry due to the residual aluminum concentrations found after treatment 76 126 plant based coagulants become economically attractive when such advantages as biodegradability non toxicity non corrosiveness and easy implementation are factored in 127 in addition plant based coagulants reduce the volume of sludge produced as well as handling and treatment costs due to the biodegradable nature of water treatment residuals 76 according to othmani et al 128 wastewater treatment systems will eventually replace chemical coagulants with plant based alternatives given their low price multipurpose application biodegradability and abundant sources in a world facing a climate emergency the depletion of natural resources and widespread environmental degradation plant based coagulants are in line with global initiatives for sustainable development 62 the necessary advance of environmentally sustainable technologies will contribute to the broader use of plant sourced coagulants reducing production costs due to economies of scale moreover plant based coagulants will become ever more competitive as the high performance in wastewater treatment demonstrated in the scientific literature is translated into industrial practice 23 contrary to the abundant studies on the efficiency of plant based coagulants to treat wastewater especially from the food industry direct comparisons of production costs and end prices between natural origin and chemical coagulants are incredibly scarce according to vijayaraghavan et al 62 and yin 23 the attractive price of m oleifera coagulant compared to other natural coagulants is the result of the plant s widely publicized advantages and the coagulant s broad application across different effluent treatment systems a single m oleifera tree produces approximately 2000 seeds per year this amount can treat 6000 l of water at a dosage of 50 mg l 18 if fully grown the yield of a single tree can increase by up to 20 000 seeds which would be enough to treat 60 000 l of water per year 18 a study by the water and environmental health at london and loughborough well 129 shows that an m oleifera tree producing an average of 3 kg of seeds can treat 30 000 l of effluent at a dose of 100 mg l in about 1 ha it would be possible to harvest 3000 kg of seeds which would be able to treat 30 000 m3 of water 18 the production costs of moringa seed depend on several factors including harvest yield climate and agricultural practices for perspective the purchase price of moringa seed in malawi was 7 5 per 1000 m3 of treated water in 1994 while the cost of alum and soda ash was 49 8 130 in malaysia however the production cost of 1 kg of m oleifera in 2006 was approximately us 2 twice that of alum 59 the main elements hindering the pricing and commercialization of plant based coagulants include a insufficient plantations to allow bulk processing of the source plants b seasonal variations of the raw material c little market demand d incipient specialized knowledge and research development on economically viable extraction methods storage and preservation conditions and optimal wastewater treatment parameters e currently limited industrial use f shortfall of market awareness and interest g well established and competitive market focused on chemical coagulants and h absence of production regulation and quality control for plant extracts 13 20 76 80 while the cost effectiveness of plant based coagulants is currently restricted to small scale use and academic research exploration can be widened upon stakeholder endorsement 18 62 governmental and non governmental regulatory bodies should implement environmental rules that encourage industries to use natural coagulants including reduced tax payments and facilitated loans to subsidize implementation costs 77 80 furthermore research should be advanced to identify the best natural coagulants with economic and industrial potential 76 9 recent advances and future perspectives for plant based coagulants in water treatment 9 1 plants with coagulation capacity in addition to moringa oleifera othmani et al 128 evaluated the performance of moringa cactus okra and mango in freshwater and wastewater remediation according to the researchers not only do the selected plants belong to different families but also their coagulant capacity depends on the parts from which the coagulant agents are extracted the parts of interest are seeds for moringa and mango seed pods for okra and pad for cactus the coagulant capacity of these materials depends on the active agent extracted polysaccharides proteins or both which produces a variation in the removal rate of contaminants among plants thakur and choubey 131 observed an 80 7 turbidity reduction when treating synthetic cloudy water with moringa when using okra the removal rate was 78 7 kazi and virupakshi 132 demonstrated that moringa seed reduced 82 and 83 of turbidity and cod respectively of tannery effluent while cactus mucilage exhibited removal percentages of 78 5 and 80 6 for turbidity and cod respectively qureshi et al 133 reported that mango provided a 98 turbidity reduction versus 86 for moringa in their study othmani et al 128 found that the sequence mango moringa cactus okra defines the plants ability to remove turbidity given these results mango should be further investigated for its coagulation capacity in addition active agents should be better explored although previous studies claim that proteins are the only active coagulant compound in plants seghosime et al 134 hypothesize that the high carbohydrate content 76 73 in mango seeds contributes to the plants coagulant activity therefore the valorization and research of biomaterials for water and effluent remediation can be considered a gateway to applying green chemistry and clean technology in treatment systems 128 9 2 integrated process an integrated process is a strategy to enhance the use of natural coagulants by combining coagulants with other treatment technologies the treatment goals are met by utilizing the strength of each process while minimizing their shortcomings 13 an example is integrating a coagulation stage with natural coagulants with a biological treatment hameed et al 135 implemented a coagulation step with a tannin based coagulant before the biological treatment the integration reduced the organic load content generating savings due to the lower need for aeration pavón silva et al 136 demonstrated that combining coagulation and biological treatment resulted in cod removal rates of up to 99 in the treatment of food industry wastewaters these results indicate that natural coagulants improve the performance of the subsequent treatment steps another example is integrating coagulation with membrane systems where the tendency toward membrane fouling is minimized 15 chitosan utilized as a natural coagulant improved nanofiltration membrane fouling in relation to organic matter by neutralizing the charges and weakening the antifouling capability electrostatic repulsion of the membrane 12 furthermore integrating coagulation with electrolysis further refined the quality of the supernatant by degrading the organic compounds in the effluent making it suitable for discharge into water bodies 13 integrated processes involving coagulation and other treatments improve the quality of the treated effluent allowing its safe disposal natural coagulants can be used in pre or post treatments combined with other technologies to benefit the entire process 13 9 3 improved extraction and purification of natural coagulants unlike chemical coagulants where quality characteristics are precisely controlled the quality control of natural coagulants is challenging such peculiarity is associated with the synthesis of coagulants which can be obtained through various processes and sources to overcome this disadvantage and produce a pure natural coagulant it is necessary to optimize the extraction process the simplest extraction method uses water however the efficiency of this approach is usually unsatisfactory this can be circumvented by optimizing the extraction method and including a purification step the coagulation capacity can be increased by using saline solutions e g nacl and cacl2 during the extraction step 110 111 megersa et al 111 found that the use of saline solutions nacl kno3 and nh4cl increased the turbidity removal efficiency of moringa from 37 using water extraction to 91 this result can be explained by the debye huckel theory increasing solvating power 13 salts increase protein solubility by breaking down the protein protein bonds of natural coagulants 111 the number of active compounds with coagulation capacity in the coagulants extracted with saline solutions was higher which reduces the required dosage for similar or superior performance 13 111 the presence of organic residues in the extracted coagulant is undesirable because it promotes bacterial growth and serves as a substrate for by product formation 113 therefore the extracted natural coagulants must be purified the most used purification method consists of removing the oil fraction in the coagulant extract through solvents such as hexane and ethanol 111 the decrease in lipid content enhances the removal of turbidity and cod since oils hinder the coagulation process by adding impurities to the treated water 13 although this purification improves the performance of the natural coagulant the extract can be further purified yielding a final product with a high concentration of coagulation active compounds to this end several purification processes are being explored such as chemical precipitation dialysis lyophilization ultrafiltration and ion exchange 95 105 112 116 sánchez martín et al 112 investigated the effect of purification by ion exchange chromatography on the coagulation performance of moringa the ideal coagulant dosage in a single elution step was twice that of the coagulant purified in two steps due to the high cost of ion exchange chromatography researchers have been investigating alternative purification approaches 13 an example is chemical precipitation with ammonium sulphate for extract purification 95 116 choudhary and neogi 116 reported that moringa extract isolated with 30 60 and 60 80 saturated ammonium sulphate increased turbidity removal capacity compared to alum this study suggests that a simple but effective purification method can produce natural coagulants with superior coagulation capacity 9 4 modification for improved performance natural coagulants exhibit certain limitations that can hinder their industrial application including low solubility in water undesirable isoelectric point low stability shelf life narrow working window of ph range weak surface charge and moderate efficiency translated to higher working dosage and cost 70 131 reactive functional groups e g hydroxyl amino and carboxyl of natural coagulants promote modifications that can solve those concerns 13 76 a study on the incorporation of valuable compounds through interaction with functional groups was carried out to remedy the negative points of natural coagulants generally chemical reactions such as graft co polymerization crosslinking with aldehyde esterification etherification amination carboxyalkylation hydroxyalkylation and condensation have been adopted to improve the characteristics of natural coagulants 73 quarternized carboxymethyl chitosan is a modified chitosan used in coagulation processes by including carboxymethyl and grafting of quarternary ammonium groups 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropy trimethylammonium chloride onto the chitosan backbone the isoelectric point of chitosan is dislocated from 6 0 6 5 to beyond ph 9 which expands the use for alkaline effluents and wastewaters 137 furthermore the water solubility of modified chitosan is improved the combination of improved water solubility high isoelectric point and more positively charged functional groups enhances the performance of modified chitosan in removing contaminants compared to unmodified chitosan and chemical coagulants huang et al 138 found that the positive charge of starch can be increased by introducing quaternary ammonium salt groups 2 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride onto the starch polymer backbone a highly positive charge is desirable for coagulants because most suspended colloidal particles exhibit a negative surface charge in the study by huang et al 138 a low dosage 0 5 0 7 ppm of modified starch coagulant promoted removal rates as of 98 in addition to chemical modification and the search for efficient extraction and purification processes natural coagulants can be combined with other coagulants usually chemical 70 139 more details on hybrid coagulants are presented in topic 3 4 9 5 multifunctional natural coagulants as real effluents contain large amounts of impurities various forms of treatment are necessary to remove the pollutants the need for additional steps sophisticated equipment longer treatment time and labor can increase the process costs 13 therefore the use of multifunctional coagulants capable of removing several types of pollutants in parallel renders water and effluent treatment plants more compact and efficient 140 the removal of suspended particles is the most common parameter to evaluate the performance of natural coagulants however the application of natural coagulants for the removal of pollutants such as heavy metals organic compounds and other contaminants should also be investigated typically natural coagulants exhibit poor removal performance for dissolved contaminants 71 141 regardless of the coagulant used natural or chemical coagulation has a low capacity to remove soluble heavy metals from effluents 70 consequently coagulation must be integrated with other stages and unit operations to guarantee the complete removal of heavy metals and other dissolved pollutants 13 70 to enhance the ability of the natural coagulant to remove multiple contaminants functional groups with an affinity for such pollutants can be incorporated into the coagulant s molecular chain to produce modified coagulants yang et al 142 introduced a dithiocarboxy group to the oh functional group on chitosan to produce xanthated chitosan the researchers reported that copper a heavy metal and kaolin responsible for turbidity were successfully removed heavy metal chelating functional groups grafted onto natural coagulants allow the removal of coexisting copper chromium and nickel ions through the chelation process 143 9 6 viability of natural coagulants natural coagulants modified unmodified or hybrid that demonstrate promising performance in laboratory tests should be scaled up to pilot and industrial scale applications the industrial viability of natural coagulants as to their performance costs and technical aspects should also be further investigated furthermore the potential of plant based coagulants in rural and impoverished areas should be explored as natural coagulants can be locally sourced moreover quality control tools can be used to standardize and optimize production 13 18 77 9 7 sustainability of natural coagulants the investigation of sustainability criteria environmental economic and social will help elucidate uncertainties about natural coagulants a constant supply of raw materials for the extraction and synthesis of natural coagulants might be necessary to ensure competition with conventional coagulants a comprehensive cost study is needed to define the economic viability of natural coagulants comprising the cost of raw materials extraction and purification investigating the health and environmental impacts of natural coagulants especially modified natural coagulants can provide relevant results in addition a life cycle assessment may indicate opportunities for improvement in the coagulation process with natural agents finally an analysis based on circular economy and bioeconomy concepts can contribute to the development and sustainability of natural coagulants used to treat wastewaters 13 18 74 77 10 conclusions despite the encouraging results reported on plant based coagulants to treat food industry wastewater the number of information gaps identified in this research field is significant for instance only a few studies have elucidated the underlying coagulation mechanisms of natural coagulants while the analysis of the coagulation efficiency of different plant based materials for various types of wastewater and coagulant combinations is still in its infancy studies reporting the economic aspects are exceptionally scarce despite the opportunities for improvement the current scientific literature reports vital results plant based coagulants are efficient for turbidity and pollutant removal although purification is not mandatory it is frequently used to prevent an increase in organic matter concentration after the wastewater treatment high cost efficiency and low toxicity are among the fundamental advantages of plant based coagulants both as sole coagulants and coagulation aid the utilization of natural coagulants to treat food industry wastewater has been limited to academic research these studies must be scaled up given the high potential of natural coagulants in sustainable environmental technologies among the factors hindering further use of natural coagulants are the limited cultivation of plants with coagulant properties and the lack of regulation specifying the quality of processed coagulant extracts m oleifera is the most researched source of plant based coagulants the results summarized herein for moringa can be employed to optimize process conditions for this species or can be used as a starting point for the investigation of other plant species the industrial acceptance of natural coagulants over conventional coagulants is still negligible we trust this

12609,sustainable effluent treatments are essential tools in lowering the environmental impact of industrial activities the partial or complete replacement of synthetic coagulants by natural coagulants especially plant based ones can reduce the footprint of the effluent treatment due to the higher biodegradability and non toxicity natural coagulants are also generally cheaper this review focuses on plant based coagulants used in food industry wastewater treatment extraction parameters of plant based coagulants and effluent treatment conditions for different coagulants are presented based on an extensive assessment of peer reviewed papers on food industry wastewater treatment the performance of plant based coagulants is compared to that of traditional synthetic coagulants both alone and as coagulant aids this review aims to guide researchers and industry professionals in optimizing and scaling up environment friendlier wastewater treatments using natural coagulants keywords effluent treatment wastewater treatment coagulation natural coagulants sustainability biocoagulants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction industrial activities are one of the leading causes of water pollution due to the generation of significant amounts of wastewater that contain toxic species or species that are difficult to degrade 1 the production of liquid waste by the food industry is sizeable especially in the animal based food sector slaughtering operations and meat processing generate massive volumes of wastewater rich in proteins organic compounds and fats 5 for example slaughtering a single pig or cow generates 330 l and 700 l of wastewater respectively 2 4 although drastically less than the animal sector the production of plant derived foods also uses significant amounts of water for instance the production of one ton of crude palm oil requires 5 7 5 tons of water 6 7 another example is the cassava starch industry which generates 12 15 l of wastewater for each m3 of processed cassava the wastewater from cassava starch production exhibits high biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total solids ts and cyanides 8 inadequate disposal of food industry effluents impacts the environment due to the high load of organic matter heavy metals alkalinity and hardness resulting in water pollution odor generation algal blooms and mortality of aquatic and land animals 4 9 the appropriate treatment of industrial wastewater is carried out by effluent treatment stations etss 10 by diminishing the polluting load of effluents etss enable their safe reuse or release into water bodies to treat wastewater etss utilize coagulation flocculation sedimentation and other physical chemical and biological processes 11 wastewater treatments can be classified into physical media filtration settling adsorption membrane and ultraviolet radiation chemical electrochemical coagulation oxidation ion exchange disinfection catalytic reduction and softening and biological microbial biodegradation phytoremediation constructed wetlands and bioreactor digestion 12 13 among these technologies coagulation and flocculation cf are the oldest and most widely employed in wastewater treatment due to their simplicity cost efficiency efficacy and low energy demand 14 coagulation involves the addition of a coagulating agent to the effluent to reduce the forces that keep suspended particles apart from colloids flocculation agglomerates the resulting material to form larger particles that can be easily separated following sedimentation 13 15 in wastewater processing cf has been used as a pretreatment to remove suspended impurities and improve the quality of the treated effluent for the subsequent stages 15 cf operations are also utilized to remove compounds other than suspended particles and colloids such as pigments micro pollutants organic compounds oils and fats 14 due to the crucial role of cf in ensuring the safe discharge of wastewaters the global coagulant and flocculant market is estimated to reach usd 6 01 billion by 2022 following an annual growth rate of 5 9 between 2017 and 2022 16 the economic relevance of cf warrants the study of plant based coagulants as sustainable substitutes to chemical based coagulants 13 natural coagulants exhibit greater biodegradability lower cost and lesser toxicity and generate less sludge 9 17 18 given the alarming amplification of the climate and ecological crises research applying natural coagulants has critical industrial relevance by promoting more environmentally friendly effluent treatments research on natural coagulants is primarily focused on the treatment of drinking water 19 20 however studies that explore the application in industrial effluents mainly from the food industry have been growing in recent years for example vieira et al 9 and real olvera et al 4 investigated moringa oleifera as plant based coagulants in the treatment of dairy industry and slaughterhouse wastewaters respectively vieira et al 9 reported a 90 removal of color and turbidity while real olvera et al 4 obtained a 64 reduction in cod dozens of other research studies on the performance of plant based coagulants to treat food industry effluents will be discussed in the following sections this review provides a database for industry professionals and scientists interested in applying plant based coagulants in food industry wastewater treatment 2 coagulation and flocculation as colloidal particles present in effluents exhibit a low sedimentation velocity etss use cf to reduce suspended and dissolved materials 21 the use of coagulants during cf reduces the turbidity and color of wastewaters 9 turbidity for instance is reduced by 85 99 22 coagulation and flocculation agglomerate the impurities from the effluent into larger and heavier particles called flocs which can be removed by sedimentation filtration or flotation 23 fig 1 coagulation is a process that affects the physical forces and chemical reactions between the effluent and the dissolved impurities the coagulating agent generates positively charged ions in the water which contains negatively charged colloids 21 as a result the repulsion between particles is reduced causing the particles to collide and stick together to form flocs from an electrostatic point of view coagulation reduces the zeta potential i e the electric potential between the liquid medium and the particles surface by adding specific ions according to okuda et al 24 the zeta potential is an analytical method to evaluate the effect of coagulation which helps select the optimal coagulant dosage and medium ph according to pritchard et al 19 the coagulant must be mixed vigorously for a few seconds immediately after addition into the effluent fig 2 to ensure uniform dispersion and high interaction between coagulant and effluent coagulation efficiency is a function of the contact between coagulant and suspended particles before the end of the mixing stage in the subsequent step flocculation occurs due to the neutralization between the coagulant s acidity and the effluent s alkalinity flocs form due to the electrostatic attraction between the positive charges resulting from the ionization of the coagulant and the negative charges of the particles flocs are larger heavier particles exhibiting ionic bonds that tend to precipitate with decreased flow velocity 25 during flocculation proper time and stirring must be chosen to ensure floc formation since the aggregation of suspended particles occurs due to the collision between the particles previously destabilized by the coagulant agglomeration is attributed to van der waals forces 26 the greater the velocity gradient the faster the rate of particle agglutination however the flocs will grow to a maximum limit as the high shear forces can cause the agglomerated particles to break 21 as too intense agitation in the flocculation stage can hinder floc stability lower mixing velocities must be selected at this stage fig 2 27 worth noting when coagulation and flocculation are not carried out properly the performance of the treatment is compromised jeopardizing the quality of the treated effluent table 1 presents the operational conditions coagulation flocculation and sedimentation used in the treatment of food industry effluents with plant based coagulants due to the wide range of industrial effluents experiments must be conducted to define the optimal operational conditions for coagulation flocculation and sedimentation aiming at high efficiency and low cost an efficient way to determine the coagulant dosage and the coagulation ph is to conduct tests in static reactors known as jar tests fig 3 jar testing entails subjecting the effluent added with specific coagulant dosages to vigorous agitation the stirring rate is then significantly reduced to promote floc formation and the sample is let to sit for a defined period until the decanted water samples are collected sedimentation table 1 coagulation efficiency depends not only on the chemical nature of the effluent and the coagulant but also on such operational conditions as initial ph coagulant dosage particle size temperature stirring rate and reaction time 49 research on effluent treatment often uses experimental design as a statistical tool to evaluate the ideal conditions in which coagulation flocculation and sedimentation occur 6 7 24 34 44 the resulting data are plotted to illustrate changes in quality parameters e g color turbidity cod total solids among others as a function of operational conditions e g medium ph and coagulant dosage the objective is to derive the optimal conditions for maximum particle removal 50 such graphs are of prime importance in the design of jar tests and interpretation of results 51 3 coagulants the various coagulants used in effluent treatment can be classified into chemical coagulants also called synthetic or inorganic and natural coagulants 9 52 the coagulant s efficiency depends on the affinity and specificity characteristics which are a function of its physical chemical properties 49 metal based materials are the coagulants traditionally used in wastewater treatment despite the broad applicability of metal based coagulants the challenges associated with their use have prompted research efforts to develop environment friendly biobased coagulants 14 3 1 synthetic coagulants the most used inorganic coagulants are trivalent iron and aluminum salts with alcl3 al2 so4 3 fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 being the most frequent due to the low cost and proven coagulant capacity 53 54 the choice depends primarily on the effluent s characteristics coagulation performed with aluminum and iron salts involves chemical and physical phenomena the hydrolysis promoted by the coagulant forming hydrolyzed and positive charged species is a chemical process the formation of hydrolyzed species depends on the coagulant dosage and the effluent s ph 55 in general these coagulants will only be effective if the effluent is alkaline otherwise coagulation will be limited due to excess protons released by the coagulant in turn the physical mechanisms encompass the contact of the hydrolyzed species with the impurities present in the effluent forming flocs flocculation stage 21 particle aggregation results from the neutralization of negative charges of the effluent s solids by the hydrolyzed species ensuring floc growth and hence rapid precipitation 55 despite the recognized efficacy of synthetic coagulants in wastewater treatment the use of agents based on aluminum salts requires strict control over the residual concentration of inorganic material in the treated effluent according to yin 23 after the salt is solubilized the cation released will be adsorbed onto the solid suspended material in other words the sedimented material will have a high concentration of the cation for example al3 which impedes the safe discharge of the treated effluent in the environment studies link high aluminum intake to potential health conditions such as alzheimer s disease 13 3 2 natural plant based coagulants plant based coagulants play a prominent role in sustainable wastewater treatment due to their high biodegradability non corrosive nature and non toxicity an increasing number of research papers focus on the coagulation properties of seeds and bark resins from different plant species but also of bone shell extracts extracts from shellfish exoskeleton and natural mineral soils 14 20 56 57 natural coagulants are composed of large molecular chains either positively or negatively charged these coagulants can be cationic anionic or non ionic with the former two collectively termed polyelectrolytes 58 however only cationic polyelectrolytes those with positive charges are ideal for use as coagulants 14 coagulants characterized as cationic polyelectrolytes are ideal in wastewater treatment because the colloidal material present in the effluent generally exhibits a negative surface electrical charge cationic polyelectrolytes produce cationic species in the effluent destabilizing the particles and thus contributing to coagulation the resulting attraction between particles van der waals force enhances floc formation due to a reduction in the negative charge of the colloidal surface 52 54 natural coagulants have been studied as partial or total substitutes of chemical coagulants to improve the cf stage both the quality of the flocs produced and the reduction elimination of metals in the final sludge 52 the use of natural coagulants combines the properties expected for effluent treatment with abundant availability low toxicity and cost high biodegradability and low rate of waste sludge production 52 59 60 nevertheless the presence of natural organic polyelectrolytes in drinking water treatment can increase the organic matter content prompting the onset of unpleasant tastes and odors therefore the introduction of natural coagulants in water treatment must be carefully considered as the treated water is likely to contain residues that will be ingested by consumers 19 20 56 in effluent treatment this aspect is still little explored 61 63 table 2 presents the main conclusions of several studies on plant based coagulants in the treatment of food industry wastewater 3 2 1 parameters that influence the performance of plant based coagulants in view of the wide range of existing coagulants both chemical and natural choosing the most efficient can be challenging the process parameters such as dosage settling time mixtures temperature and ph must be weighted appropriately to obtain the best performance in removing contaminants 64 65 tables 1 and 2 summarize the process parameters commonly used in food industry effluents treated with plant based coagulants as well as the main performance results 3 2 1 1 dosage inadequate coagulant dosing results in unsatisfactory water quality after treatment therefore it is critical to determine the dosage range needed to obtain maximum pollutant removals at minimum cost among different coagulation mechanisms only charge neutralization and bridging are negatively affected by dosage mainly due to the stoichiometric relationship 44 66 when the effluent s turbidity is high 100 ntu the required coagulant dosage tends to be lower compared to low turbidity wastewaters 5 10 ntu 59 a likely cause is the collision frequency between particles and coagulant 15 as high turbidity means a high concentration of impurities and a high collision frequency coagulation is more likely in this case lower dosages of coagulant are necessary in contrast low turbidity requires a high dosage of coagulant because the collision frequency between impurities and coagulants is lower 50 optimal dosage can be obtained by plotting the measured turbidity or any other pollutant parameter versus the applied dosage 60 61 there is a decline in contaminant removal efficiency when the coagulant dosage is less than or exceeds the required dosage overdosing can lead to charge reversal and consequently result in particle repulsion preventing floc formation overdosing restricts the number of available adsorption sites by covering the coagulant surface 44 51 therefore adding more coagulant to the wastewater treatment does not enhance the coagulation process on the other hand a dosage much lower than necessary results in incomplete and ineffective coagulation because most of the particles remain in suspension real olvera et al 4 tested a dosage of 3 to 7 g l of moringa oleifera for the treatment of slaughterhouse effluent and observed that 7 g l yielded the best results when cassia obtusifolia at a dosage of 0 to 2 5 g l was used in effluent coagulation the optimal condition was 1 0 g l to treat palm oil residue 6 and 2 g l for rice starch 62 3 2 1 2 ph a solution s ph affects the efficiency of the coagulation process by changing the electrochemical nature of the solvent and ionic polymers used 44 63 therefore the system s ph optimization is essential to ensure efficient coagulation 61 66 the decrease in ph lowers the load of natural organic matter nom reducing their water solubility consequently coagulation efficiency is reduced as the main coagulation mechanism is charge neutralization in which cations or polyelectrolytes are required to bind to the negative charge of the nom 44 61 an optimal ph is also critical for forming metal poly hydroxides and the precipitation of solid colloidal phases 61 cationic polyelectrolytes are the most widely used organic polyelectrolytes owing to their ability to bind with negatively charged noms the positive charge in these polymers can increase at lower ph when the functional groups responsible for the cationic behavior are amines primary secondary and tertiary 61 some studies have optimized the ph of the treatment system when using plant based coagulants for example coccinia indica 67 okra gum 68 cactus and hyacinth bean peels 69 the optimal ph for coagulation using okra gum was 9 2 with 98 3 ss removal 68 at this ph okra gum uncoiled further to achieve a flat dangling form which enhances the coagulation process most legumes used as natural coagulants perform better when coagulation occurs at an optimized ph of 7 to 8 5 20 56 however the same coagulant can exhibit different optimal phs depending on the effluent under treatment for example moringa oleifera showed optimal performance at ph 9 0 for slaughterhouse effluent 4 between 4 0 and 5 0 for the effluent from the pulp of coffee fruits 6 and 4 0 for distillery spent wash 46 3 2 1 3 temperature temperature is the factor that receives the least attention in effluent treatment few studies have reported the effect of temperature on treatment efficiency 6 36 40 70 temperature affects coagulation kinetics and impurity removal efficiency 71 72 coagulation efficiency improves with an increase in temperature due to the higher collision rate among particles this results in lower viscosity favoring the homogeneous dissipation of the coagulation species in the mixing stage 73 at low temperatures floc aggregation tends to be weak due to the lesser particle particle collisions due to the formation of irregular flocs under low temperature conditions the coagulant dosage required to remove organic matter is higher 70 72 in many cases the effluent s temperature is a non controllable parameter which affects the removal of nom by coagulation therefore dosages must be reassessed across seasons to account for temperature changes 2 70 for plant based coagulants the optimal process temperature is 25 30 c 6 36 40 70 as the active agents in plant based coagulants are generally proteins system temperature must be increased carefully to avoid a reduction in the coagulation capacity due to protein denaturation as denaturation causes changes in the protein s spatial configuration its biological activity is reduced or lost 3 2 1 4 mixing mixing is crucial in coagulation processes including both rapid mixing to promote the interaction of coagulants with suspended particles to form microflocs and slow mixing to promote microfloc aggregation and large floc formation excessively low mixing speed and considerably short mixing time can decrease the rate of floc formation while excessively fast mixing speed and considerably long mixing time can break the flocs yielding poor settling efficiency 55 70 71 as shown in table 1 mixing parameters in the treatment of food industry effluents with plant based coagulants vary from 100 to 300 rpm for 30 s to 5 min for fast mixing and 20 to 100 rpm per 5 40 min for fast mixing followed by sedimentation for 30 min to 24 h 3 3 plant based versus chemical coagulants in effluent treatment the coagulation stage is conducted by adding a coagulating agent to reduce or remove suspended impurities and other types of pollutants such as organic compounds 15 74 the coagulating agent can be chemical based or naturally derived 75 currently chemical coagulants predominate in industrial settings due to their low cost high efficiency easy handling and widespread market availability alcl3 al2 so4 3 fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 are the most used coagulants 76 although these factors drive the choice of chemical coagulants over plant based alternatives chemical agents have raised controversial issues due to their low biodegradability and toxicity to living organisms residual aluminum concentrations are still detected after treatment 76 77 researchers warn that alzheimer s disease is linked to aluminum neurotoxicity 78 furthermore synthetic coagulants can form dangerous by products such as acrylamide a carcinogen and neurotoxic substance 79 according to kurniawan et al 79 the disposal of toxic sludge pollutes water and soil affecting plant and animal species negatively as a result chemical coagulants are not considered sustainable and do not qualify as green options 76 therefore it is necessary to promote sustainable and equally efficient coagulating agents natural coagulants are biodegradable non toxic non corrosive reduce the amount of sludge and are environmentally friendly 9 17 18 37 natural coagulants are recognized in traditional water purification especially in impoverished communities 20 56 based on these applications natural coagulants have attracted the scientific community s attention due to their significant health and environmental benefits and their efficiency in removing contaminants several studies have proven the effectiveness of plant based coagulants in wastewater treatment applications removal of 98 of color and turbidity from dairy industry wastewater 9 64 cod removal from slaughterhouse wastewater 4 removal of 87 tss and 55 cod from palm oil milling effluent 6 reduction of 54 tss 100 cod and 100 nitrate and nitrite from coffee fermentation wastewater 44 reduction of 95 suspended solids and 52 2 cod from palm oil milling effluent 35 removal of 96 5 color 87 cod and 99 9 turbidity from distillery spent wash 46 and removal of 90 of cod from palm oil milling effluent 39 however these studies are massively small scale the industrial application of natural coagulants in wastewater treatment is still limited especially owing to a lacking tax incentive and inconsistent information on performance quality control and production standards of plant extracts 20 76 80 although moringa oleifera is the most commonly used and extensively researched plant based coagulant 4 29 47 50 75 several others have been identified such as nirmali seeds strychnos potatorum 81 dolichos lablab or hyacinth bean lablab purpureus 69 banana musa paradisica 82 roselle seeds hibiscus sabdariffa 83 84 cactus species 85 watermelon seeds 86 sicklepod cassia obtusifolia 6 7 rice starch 37 38 okra abelmoschus esculentus sandpaper tree ficus exasperate and bridelia ferrugeneae 41 3 4 association between natural and inorganic coagulants despite the environmental benefits of using natural coagulants in drinking water and wastewater treatment these might not be as effective as inorganic coagulants to harness the advantages of natural coagulants without hindering the treatment efficiency they can be combined with inorganic coagulants either as a composite coagulant or as coagulant aid 87 88 the former is produced by combining two types of coagulants as a single coagulant while coagulant aids are materials added some time after the dosing of the primary coagulant these approaches minimize the consumption of non renewable coagulants and their associated environmental impact 89 there are few studies on the association of natural coagulants with inorganic coagulants such as ferric chloride polyaluminum chloride and aluminum sulfate 62 shak and wu 7 reported a 55 reduction in alum when gum extracted from cassia obtusifolia seeds was employed as a coagulant aid more impurities were adsorbed onto the coagulant aid due to the polymeric structure of the natural gum ghebremichael et al 90 concluded that dosing the moringa coagulant prior to alum resulted in better removal of turbidity and dissolved organic carbon from surface water river furthermore the use of the natural coagulant aid reduced the alum dosage by 50 75 similar benefits were achieved by dosing alum and moringa coagulants together in concrete wastewater treatment 75 freitas et al 91 also highlighted that dosing the moringa coagulant after alum results in greater turbidity removal than dosing them together to treat polluted stream water natural materials that might not perform well as coagulants individually e g lignin starch green algae and cactus mucilage can be used as coagulant aids or as part of a composite coagulant 13 89 91 92 these coagulant aids strengthen the flocs through charge neutralization and bonding with the flocs formed by the primary coagulant as the treatment becomes more effective and the dosage of the primary coagulant is reduced the residual inorganic coagulant e g aluminum is also minimized 4 active principle underlying coagulation with natural agents in broad terms most natural coagulants can be categorized into two groups based on the main compounds with coagulation activity polysaccharides and proteins examples of the first group are plant or animal derived materials such as chitosan starch and mucilage while protein based natural coagulants typically originate from plants 9 93 the presence of hydroxyl and amino functional groups in these compounds contribute to their coagulation capacity 13 plant based natural coagulants are mostly water soluble organic molecules 94 96 extracted primarily from seeds 97 99 and mucilages 100 101 for example moringa oleifera seeds are used as a coagulant due to the presence of soluble cationic proteins capable of reducing the turbidity of the treated liquid 4 102 nordmark et al 103 isolated eight different cationic protein fractions from aqueous extracts of moringa seeds in turn kwaambwa and maikokera 104 hypothesized that the active agents responsible for coagulation in moringa are dimeric cationic proteins with a molecular mass in the range of 12 14 kda and an isoelectric point of ph 10 11 which indicates a highly cationic nature ghebremichael et al 90 concluded that the active compound in moringa is not a single protein but rather a mixture of proteins with similar physical characteristics according to the authors this protein mixture is heat resistant and exhibits clotting activity after 5 h of heat treatment at 95 c this property renders the active ingredient ideal for use in water and effluent treatment systems exposed to high temperatures 35 40 c as frequently found in tropical countries unlike conventional metallic inorganic coagulants natural coagulants exhibit particularities that affect the quality control of the active ingredient rendering it more challenging this behavior results from the extraction method which comprises various stages and the coagulant source especially plant based coagulants where the compounds vary according to the plant species and growth conditions 13 worth noting non coagulating impurities will inevitably be present in extracted natural coagulants if further purification is not conducted the presence of impurities that possess no coagulation capacity affects the coagulation efficiency 102 for example the lipid fraction may inhibit the contact between coagulant and impurities rendering the floc formation ineffective while carbohydrates may increase the organic matter concentration in the solution 102 105 extensive purification can be conducted but will incur additional costs according to the source and extraction approach the variable performance of natural coagulants might hinder quality control 13 5 processing techniques of natural coagulants whenever the objective is to utilize the isolated active ingredient e g a particular protein coagulant preparation must follow three main stages fig 4 a primary flour preparation b secondary protein extraction and c tertiary purification 18 the characteristics of the coagulant and its performance in cf are directly influenced by the order of these stages 106 using moringa oleifera as a reference the primary stage includes harvesting the seeds removing the husk crushing sieving and drying the recommended particle size for water and effluent treatment varies between 0 25 mm and 1 25 mm 107 moringa seeds contain a wide variety of undesirable compounds in cf that increase the organic load in the treated wastewater therefore the material obtained in the primary stage is further treated the secondary stage consists of extracting proteins with water or saline solutions 18 the simplest extraction method uses clean water jung et al 108 mixed powdered moringa seeds with water and stirred the mixture to release the coagulating compounds which are positively charged proteins however the coagulation efficiency of this extraction approach is often unsatisfactory due to the presence of non coagulating impurities and a low number of coagulating compounds 13 the main disadvantage of water extraction is the increased cod due to the dissolved organic carbon content which discourages the use in drinking water treatment 109 in wastewater treatment this method s efficiency is controversial cod dropped in some studies and increased in others 33 in the study by oladoja 14 salt solution extraction exhibited better coagulant capacity than water extraction which can be explained by the higher number of soluble proteins present in salt extracts the author recommends using moringa seeds as a coagulant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater effluents intended for water reuse only after purifying the active proteins the coagulation capacity of a particular substance can be improved by using salt solutions e g nacl and cacl2 during extraction 110 111 the use of saline solution enhances protein extraction from natural coagulants due to the salt s capabilities of promoting protein protein dissociation and increasing the solubility of proteins which increases the efficiency of the coagulant ion 111 megersa et al 111 demonstrated that the addition of salt solutions nacl kno3 and nh4cl enhances the coagulation performance compared to the water extracted moringa coagulant the optimum coagulant dosage extracted using 0 5 m nacl was 2 mg ml yielding a 91 turbidity removal such improvement is attributed to the increased solubility of proteins from the natural coagulant in the presence of salt due to the breaking down of protein protein bonds carvalho et al 110 reported that moringa coagulant extracted with cacl2 resulted in higher turbidity removal compared to nacl extraction which could be explained by the participation of calcium ions in the coagulation process apart from increasing the extraction yield i e number of compounds with coagulation capacity the purity of natural coagulants can be improved to reduce impurity concentration and coagulant dosage organic compounds present in natural coagulants that do not take part in coagulation will possibly end up in the treated water as dissolved organic matter 112 the presence of organic residues is undesirable due to the increased risk of bacterial growth which can serve as a substrate for the formation of hazardous by products 113 114 to avoid such adverse effects natural coagulants must be purified after extraction only those compounds that contribute to the coagulation properties are purified in the third stage regardless of the plant source coagulating compounds are either polysaccharides or proteins 13 to obtain pure coagulants purification can be carried out using a combination of different methods such as dialysis centrifugation ultrafiltration chemical precipitation ion exchange and lyophilization 18 24 the final extract may differ based on the purification method and different solvent extractions and extract fractionation will yield different types of products 115 sánchez martín et al 112 investigated the impact of ion exchange purification using nacl solution on the coagulation performance of moringa extract the optimum dosage of the single step purified coagulant elution with 0 6 m nacl was two times higher than the two step purified coagulant first elution with 0 3 m nacl followed by a second elution with 0 6 m nacl in terms of turbidity removal this led to the production of more purified coagulants containing active coagulant proteins after the second elution the purified coagulant produced via ion exchange performed at par with the conventional alum coagulant in terms of required dosage 1 mg l and turbidity removal efficiency 83 for natural river water 111 without further purification the moringa extract could only achieve 50 turbidity removal at a similar dosage and required fourfold the dosage for 83 removal efficiency therefore the purification process can produce natural coagulants with a higher proportion of active coagulation compounds which results in better performance even at lower optimal dosage 13 98 due to the high cost of ion exchange chromatography researchers have sought alternative purification approaches that are more economically viable at the industrial level 13 relatively simple chemical precipitation using ammonium sulphate of compounds possessing coagulation activity has been proposed for the purification of moringa extract 95 116 choudhary and neogi 116 reported that the natural moringa extract isolated with saturated ammonium sulphate exhibited superior turbidity removal efficiency than alum hence a simple but effective isolation and purification method for natural moringa extract may result in a natural coagulant with satisfactory coagulation capacity 13 the methodology involved in the production of moringa coagulant can be replicated to extract and purify natural coagulants from other plant sources e g seeds of plantago plantago major l beans phaseolus vulgaris chestnut bertholletia excelsa basil ocimum basilicum oak quercus robur hibiscus flower hibiscus l or cactus pads from opuntia species 83 93 117 120 in general the extraction and purification of plant based natural coagulants rely on three stages as shown in fig 3 table 3 presents the manufacturing process of natural coagulants used to treat food industry wastewater 6 mechanisms of coagulation with natural agents natural coagulants can be obtained from plants animals and microorganisms the main mechanisms involved in the coagulation with plant based coagulants are adsorption and charge neutralization or alternatively adsorption and bond formation it is difficult to define the exact mechanism because the phenomena can co occur 121 122 adsorption and charge neutralization refer to the sorption of two particulates with oppositely charged ions while interparticle bridging occurs when a coagulant provides a polymeric chain that sorbs particulates 101 these two mechanisms are involved in the coagulant properties of plant based coagulants 58 101 amran et al 123 discuss in more detail how plant based coagulants promote the coagulation of pollutants in wastewater in charge neutralization an ionizable polymer present in the coagulant stabilizes the colloidal particles which otherwise would repel one another for being negatively charged in polymer adsorption long chain polymers partially attach themselves to the surface of the colloidal particles due to the affinity between them the unattached parts composed of loops and tails are the main structure involved in bond formation or polymer bridging bridging ensures the formation of pollutant flocs by decreasing interparticle repulsion sufficient coagulant dosages will provide the required amount of polymer to promote strong polymer bridging in the study by vieira et al 9 the sorption potential of moringa coagulant was assessed for color turbidity and cod removal in dairy industry wastewater diw maximum adsorption of diw components from aqueous solutions occurred using 1 g l of moringa seeds with a 60 min agitation time which suggested an excellent affinity between diw components and sorbent furthermore the moringa coagulant showed sorption capacity within a ph range from 5 to 8 real olvera et al 4 investigated the adsorption of organic pollutants from slaughterhouse wastewater when m oleifera was employed as a natural coagulant the results indicated that 180 min is necessary for high adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity of 0 523 g cod g powder suggests a good affinity between organic pollutants and powdered seeds moringa seed powder exhibited sorption capacity over the ph range 5 to 9 but the best results were obtained at high ph levels 7 benefits of using natural coagulants natural coagulants overperform chemical coagulants in terms of biodegradability non corrosivity and lower or non toxicity 24 54 106 fig 5 such features are attractive for the development of greener water and wastewater treatment where processing costs are reduced while color and turbidity removal are improved 122 in addition the sludge produced during the coagulation process is innocuous and has a volume 4 5 times smaller than the sludge produced when aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride are used 9124 furthermore natural coagulants do not significantly change the ph of the medium 124 and do not cause corrosion problems 99 although efficiency is one of the most critical factors in water and wastewater treatment other criteria are equally relevant for the long term reliability of sustainable plant based coagulants in effluent treatment sustainability encompasses the integration of environmental social economic and technical aspects 125 fig 6 8 economic aspects of plant based coagulants chemical coagulants are predominant in wastewater treatment because of their low cost easy handling high availability and market diversification nonetheless chemical coagulants do not fit into green chemistry due to the residual aluminum concentrations found after treatment 76 126 plant based coagulants become economically attractive when such advantages as biodegradability non toxicity non corrosiveness and easy implementation are factored in 127 in addition plant based coagulants reduce the volume of sludge produced as well as handling and treatment costs due to the biodegradable nature of water treatment residuals 76 according to othmani et al 128 wastewater treatment systems will eventually replace chemical coagulants with plant based alternatives given their low price multipurpose application biodegradability and abundant sources in a world facing a climate emergency the depletion of natural resources and widespread environmental degradation plant based coagulants are in line with global initiatives for sustainable development 62 the necessary advance of environmentally sustainable technologies will contribute to the broader use of plant sourced coagulants reducing production costs due to economies of scale moreover plant based coagulants will become ever more competitive as the high performance in wastewater treatment demonstrated in the scientific literature is translated into industrial practice 23 contrary to the abundant studies on the efficiency of plant based coagulants to treat wastewater especially from the food industry direct comparisons of production costs and end prices between natural origin and chemical coagulants are incredibly scarce according to vijayaraghavan et al 62 and yin 23 the attractive price of m oleifera coagulant compared to other natural coagulants is the result of the plant s widely publicized advantages and the coagulant s broad application across different effluent treatment systems a single m oleifera tree produces approximately 2000 seeds per year this amount can treat 6000 l of water at a dosage of 50 mg l 18 if fully grown the yield of a single tree can increase by up to 20 000 seeds which would be enough to treat 60 000 l of water per year 18 a study by the water and environmental health at london and loughborough well 129 shows that an m oleifera tree producing an average of 3 kg of seeds can treat 30 000 l of effluent at a dose of 100 mg l in about 1 ha it would be possible to harvest 3000 kg of seeds which would be able to treat 30 000 m3 of water 18 the production costs of moringa seed depend on several factors including harvest yield climate and agricultural practices for perspective the purchase price of moringa seed in malawi was 7 5 per 1000 m3 of treated water in 1994 while the cost of alum and soda ash was 49 8 130 in malaysia however the production cost of 1 kg of m oleifera in 2006 was approximately us 2 twice that of alum 59 the main elements hindering the pricing and commercialization of plant based coagulants include a insufficient plantations to allow bulk processing of the source plants b seasonal variations of the raw material c little market demand d incipient specialized knowledge and research development on economically viable extraction methods storage and preservation conditions and optimal wastewater treatment parameters e currently limited industrial use f shortfall of market awareness and interest g well established and competitive market focused on chemical coagulants and h absence of production regulation and quality control for plant extracts 13 20 76 80 while the cost effectiveness of plant based coagulants is currently restricted to small scale use and academic research exploration can be widened upon stakeholder endorsement 18 62 governmental and non governmental regulatory bodies should implement environmental rules that encourage industries to use natural coagulants including reduced tax payments and facilitated loans to subsidize implementation costs 77 80 furthermore research should be advanced to identify the best natural coagulants with economic and industrial potential 76 9 recent advances and future perspectives for plant based coagulants in water treatment 9 1 plants with coagulation capacity in addition to moringa oleifera othmani et al 128 evaluated the performance of moringa cactus okra and mango in freshwater and wastewater remediation according to the researchers not only do the selected plants belong to different families but also their coagulant capacity depends on the parts from which the coagulant agents are extracted the parts of interest are seeds for moringa and mango seed pods for okra and pad for cactus the coagulant capacity of these materials depends on the active agent extracted polysaccharides proteins or both which produces a variation in the removal rate of contaminants among plants thakur and choubey 131 observed an 80 7 turbidity reduction when treating synthetic cloudy water with moringa when using okra the removal rate was 78 7 kazi and virupakshi 132 demonstrated that moringa seed reduced 82 and 83 of turbidity and cod respectively of tannery effluent while cactus mucilage exhibited removal percentages of 78 5 and 80 6 for turbidity and cod respectively qureshi et al 133 reported that mango provided a 98 turbidity reduction versus 86 for moringa in their study othmani et al 128 found that the sequence mango moringa cactus okra defines the plants ability to remove turbidity given these results mango should be further investigated for its coagulation capacity in addition active agents should be better explored although previous studies claim that proteins are the only active coagulant compound in plants seghosime et al 134 hypothesize that the high carbohydrate content 76 73 in mango seeds contributes to the plants coagulant activity therefore the valorization and research of biomaterials for water and effluent remediation can be considered a gateway to applying green chemistry and clean technology in treatment systems 128 9 2 integrated process an integrated process is a strategy to enhance the use of natural coagulants by combining coagulants with other treatment technologies the treatment goals are met by utilizing the strength of each process while minimizing their shortcomings 13 an example is integrating a coagulation stage with natural coagulants with a biological treatment hameed et al 135 implemented a coagulation step with a tannin based coagulant before the biological treatment the integration reduced the organic load content generating savings due to the lower need for aeration pavón silva et al 136 demonstrated that combining coagulation and biological treatment resulted in cod removal rates of up to 99 in the treatment of food industry wastewaters these results indicate that natural coagulants improve the performance of the subsequent treatment steps another example is integrating coagulation with membrane systems where the tendency toward membrane fouling is minimized 15 chitosan utilized as a natural coagulant improved nanofiltration membrane fouling in relation to organic matter by neutralizing the charges and weakening the antifouling capability electrostatic repulsion of the membrane 12 furthermore integrating coagulation with electrolysis further refined the quality of the supernatant by degrading the organic compounds in the effluent making it suitable for discharge into water bodies 13 integrated processes involving coagulation and other treatments improve the quality of the treated effluent allowing its safe disposal natural coagulants can be used in pre or post treatments combined with other technologies to benefit the entire process 13 9 3 improved extraction and purification of natural coagulants unlike chemical coagulants where quality characteristics are precisely controlled the quality control of natural coagulants is challenging such peculiarity is associated with the synthesis of coagulants which can be obtained through various processes and sources to overcome this disadvantage and produce a pure natural coagulant it is necessary to optimize the extraction process the simplest extraction method uses water however the efficiency of this approach is usually unsatisfactory this can be circumvented by optimizing the extraction method and including a purification step the coagulation capacity can be increased by using saline solutions e g nacl and cacl2 during the extraction step 110 111 megersa et al 111 found that the use of saline solutions nacl kno3 and nh4cl increased the turbidity removal efficiency of moringa from 37 using water extraction to 91 this result can be explained by the debye huckel theory increasing solvating power 13 salts increase protein solubility by breaking down the protein protein bonds of natural coagulants 111 the number of active compounds with coagulation capacity in the coagulants extracted with saline solutions was higher which reduces the required dosage for similar or superior performance 13 111 the presence of organic residues in the extracted coagulant is undesirable because it promotes bacterial growth and serves as a substrate for by product formation 113 therefore the extracted natural coagulants must be purified the most used purification method consists of removing the oil fraction in the coagulant extract through solvents such as hexane and ethanol 111 the decrease in lipid content enhances the removal of turbidity and cod since oils hinder the coagulation process by adding impurities to the treated water 13 although this purification improves the performance of the natural coagulant the extract can be further purified yielding a final product with a high concentration of coagulation active compounds to this end several purification processes are being explored such as chemical precipitation dialysis lyophilization ultrafiltration and ion exchange 95 105 112 116 sánchez martín et al 112 investigated the effect of purification by ion exchange chromatography on the coagulation performance of moringa the ideal coagulant dosage in a single elution step was twice that of the coagulant purified in two steps due to the high cost of ion exchange chromatography researchers have been investigating alternative purification approaches 13 an example is chemical precipitation with ammonium sulphate for extract purification 95 116 choudhary and neogi 116 reported that moringa extract isolated with 30 60 and 60 80 saturated ammonium sulphate increased turbidity removal capacity compared to alum this study suggests that a simple but effective purification method can produce natural coagulants with superior coagulation capacity 9 4 modification for improved performance natural coagulants exhibit certain limitations that can hinder their industrial application including low solubility in water undesirable isoelectric point low stability shelf life narrow working window of ph range weak surface charge and moderate efficiency translated to higher working dosage and cost 70 131 reactive functional groups e g hydroxyl amino and carboxyl of natural coagulants promote modifications that can solve those concerns 13 76 a study on the incorporation of valuable compounds through interaction with functional groups was carried out to remedy the negative points of natural coagulants generally chemical reactions such as graft co polymerization crosslinking with aldehyde esterification etherification amination carboxyalkylation hydroxyalkylation and condensation have been adopted to improve the characteristics of natural coagulants 73 quarternized carboxymethyl chitosan is a modified chitosan used in coagulation processes by including carboxymethyl and grafting of quarternary ammonium groups 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropy trimethylammonium chloride onto the chitosan backbone the isoelectric point of chitosan is dislocated from 6 0 6 5 to beyond ph 9 which expands the use for alkaline effluents and wastewaters 137 furthermore the water solubility of modified chitosan is improved the combination of improved water solubility high isoelectric point and more positively charged functional groups enhances the performance of modified chitosan in removing contaminants compared to unmodified chitosan and chemical coagulants huang et al 138 found that the positive charge of starch can be increased by introducing quaternary ammonium salt groups 2 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride onto the starch polymer backbone a highly positive charge is desirable for coagulants because most suspended colloidal particles exhibit a negative surface charge in the study by huang et al 138 a low dosage 0 5 0 7 ppm of modified starch coagulant promoted removal rates as of 98 in addition to chemical modification and the search for efficient extraction and purification processes natural coagulants can be combined with other coagulants usually chemical 70 139 more details on hybrid coagulants are presented in topic 3 4 9 5 multifunctional natural coagulants as real effluents contain large amounts of impurities various forms of treatment are necessary to remove the pollutants the need for additional steps sophisticated equipment longer treatment time and labor can increase the process costs 13 therefore the use of multifunctional coagulants capable of removing several types of pollutants in parallel renders water and effluent treatment plants more compact and efficient 140 the removal of suspended particles is the most common parameter to evaluate the performance of natural coagulants however the application of natural coagulants for the removal of pollutants such as heavy metals organic compounds and other contaminants should also be investigated typically natural coagulants exhibit poor removal performance for dissolved contaminants 71 141 regardless of the coagulant used natural or chemical coagulation has a low capacity to remove soluble heavy metals from effluents 70 consequently coagulation must be integrated with other stages and unit operations to guarantee the complete removal of heavy metals and other dissolved pollutants 13 70 to enhance the ability of the natural coagulant to remove multiple contaminants functional groups with an affinity for such pollutants can be incorporated into the coagulant s molecular chain to produce modified coagulants yang et al 142 introduced a dithiocarboxy group to the oh functional group on chitosan to produce xanthated chitosan the researchers reported that copper a heavy metal and kaolin responsible for turbidity were successfully removed heavy metal chelating functional groups grafted onto natural coagulants allow the removal of coexisting copper chromium and nickel ions through the chelation process 143 9 6 viability of natural coagulants natural coagulants modified unmodified or hybrid that demonstrate promising performance in laboratory tests should be scaled up to pilot and industrial scale applications the industrial viability of natural coagulants as to their performance costs and technical aspects should also be further investigated furthermore the potential of plant based coagulants in rural and impoverished areas should be explored as natural coagulants can be locally sourced moreover quality control tools can be used to standardize and optimize production 13 18 77 9 7 sustainability of natural coagulants the investigation of sustainability criteria environmental economic and social will help elucidate uncertainties about natural coagulants a constant supply of raw materials for the extraction and synthesis of natural coagulants might be necessary to ensure competition with conventional coagulants a comprehensive cost study is needed to define the economic viability of natural coagulants comprising the cost of raw materials extraction and purification investigating the health and environmental impacts of natural coagulants especially modified natural coagulants can provide relevant results in addition a life cycle assessment may indicate opportunities for improvement in the coagulation process with natural agents finally an analysis based on circular economy and bioeconomy concepts can contribute to the development and sustainability of natural coagulants used to treat wastewaters 13 18 74 77 10 conclusions despite the encouraging results reported on plant based coagulants to treat food industry wastewater the number of information gaps identified in this research field is significant for instance only a few studies have elucidated the underlying coagulation mechanisms of natural coagulants while the analysis of the coagulation efficiency of different plant based materials for various types of wastewater and coagulant combinations is still in its infancy studies reporting the economic aspects are exceptionally scarce despite the opportunities for improvement the current scientific literature reports vital results plant based coagulants are efficient for turbidity and pollutant removal although purification is not mandatory it is frequently used to prevent an increase in organic matter concentration after the wastewater treatment high cost efficiency and low toxicity are among the fundamental advantages of plant based coagulants both as sole coagulants and coagulation aid the utilization of natural coagulants to treat food industry wastewater has been limited to academic research these studies must be scaled up given the high potential of natural coagulants in sustainable environmental technologies among the factors hindering further use of natural coagulants are the limited cultivation of plants with coagulant properties and the lack of regulation specifying the quality of processed coagulant extracts m oleifera is the most researched source of plant based coagulants the results summarized herein for moringa can be employed to optimize process conditions for this species or can be used as a starting point for the investigation of other plant species the industrial acceptance of natural coagulants over conventional coagulants is still negligible we trust this review paper will contribute to a more widespread application of natural coagulants by showcasing their properties declaration of competing interest the authors confirm that they have no conflicts of
