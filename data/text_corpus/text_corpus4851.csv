24255,forest landscape simulation models flm have been extensively used for projecting ecosystem dynamics and carbon fluxes however more guidance and methods for formal calibration and corroboration of flms are needed to ensure higher fidelity results from these models we developed a novel systematic methodology for calibrating and corroborating a flm at the grid cell scale using empirical estimates from the national forest inventory in the united states us which uses an equal probability sample design we illustrate our approach by using the forest inventory and analysis fia data from the us department of agriculture forest service across the state of wisconsin to represent initial site conditions and calibrate parameters for the density succession extension of the landis ii model formally coupled with an iterative model corroboration stage focused on the growth and internal competition component of the model at a site scale using plot remeasurement data that span 20 years we used a formal equivalence testing approach to compare model predictions to empirical estimates for permanent sample plots we found that the model performed well with 21 out of 30 species demonstrating equivalence in the estimator used to characterize basal area following initial parameterization upon calibration of the estimator the nine species not initially equivalent all showed reduced bias with five of the species ultimately passing the equivalence test the species that did not achieve equivalence through calibration were generally the least abundant ones these results have increased our confidence that the density succession algorithms were well implemented within the model and provides a useful additional succession option within the landis ii framework we believe this methodology can capture a wider range of local scale variability compared to previous methods conducted at a landscape level using summary statistics the iterative nature of the method also gives an opportunity for learning about the model components and the reference plot data our approach will help researchers using landscape simulation models to follow a replicable framework for corroborating their results and prioritize forest management activities and land use planning which can help reduce external pressures on forests and help mitigate climate change effects graphical abstract image

dynamic biological systems peng 2000 disturbances play a critical role in forest dynamics oliver and larson 1996 causing changes in species composition habitat and resource allocation disturbance regimes are also changing due to global climate change seidl et al 2011 2017 turner 2010 zhu et al 2020 and interactions among disturbance types sturtevant and fortin 2021 threatening habitat conditions in forests and their ability to sustain ecosystem services franklin et al 2007 seidl et al 2017 studies of forest dynamics are key to understanding changes in tree density species composition biomass and carbon sequestration which are fundamental components of forest ecosystem resilience to climate change there are different approaches to studying forest dynamics one of them being vegetation models which can represent complex interdisciplinary and multi scale spatial processes to address questions about short and long term ecosystem dynamics and human caused or natural drivers of landscape change mayer et al 2016 mladenoff 2004 forest landscape models flm integrate the influence of time and space on environmental drivers and processes that influence vegetation patterns which in turn feed back to affect ecological processes gao et al 2018 peterson 2002 shifley et al 2017 flms have been broadly used especially when long term forest inventory data are absent to represent forest dynamics in species composition future yield succession disturbances and ecological restoration purposes all under diverse environmental conditions landis ii foundation 2018 peng 2000 thompson et al 2016 over the last three decades flms have increased in detail complexity and spatial extent with the advancement in technology and computing capacity scheller 2018 shifley et al 2017 despite the power of flms to integrate across scales and processes affecting forest dynamics they are notoriously challenging to validate impacting confidence in the veracity of their outputs scheller 2018 concerns regarding model confidence are not unique to flms there has been an ongoing plea for greater transparency and rigor in the evaluation of ecological and environmental models more generally grimm et al 2010 2014 augusiak et al 2014 coined the term evaludation to encompass the full cycle of activities to critically assess whether and when a model is meeting its intended purpose two important components of this process are the calibration of model parameters and the corroboration of model outputs calibration a component of model output verification is an iterative process of modifying the model parameters one at a time until there is an incremental improvement of the results in comparison to empirical data wang et al 2014 a common method of calibrating species level parameters within an flm is to fit model outputs to established empirical estimates of growth and yield lucash et al 2017 reese et al 2022 these estimates are often based on averages of observations aggregated over space and time model corroboration involves comparing an independent data set with the model predictions from the same temporal and spatial scales within its relevant domain to examine agreement between modeled and empirical data augusiak et al 2014 shifley et al 2017 previous corroboration work has been done for flms such as landclim schumacher et al 2004 iland seidl et al 2012 and landis pro wang et al 2014 using aggregated plot data for a short term two or three decades a more novel approach to both calibration and model corroboration is to match model outputs with the behavior of individual plots i e disaggregated this method has been widely applied to plot scale models bagdon et al 2021 vacchiano et al 2014 but not yet applied to flms while similar studies have been conducted within the landis ii model framework e g boulanger et al 2017 mckenzie et al 2019 its distributed development strategy and design has impeded the adoption of a more universal corroboration methodology to help address this problem we developed a systematic and disaggregated methodology for calibrating and corroborating a flm using a pairwise comparison to existing forest inventory data our specific research objectives are to 1 build a replicable methodology for model evaluation that can segregate specific areas of the model to evaluate and 2 increase confidence in model processes by testing the performance of individual model components at the site level we believe this methodology can capture a wider range of local scale variability compared to previous methods conducted at a landscape level that use summary statistics to achieve these objectives we used estimates from the forest inventory and analysis fia program of the united states forest service usfs across the state of wisconsin to represent initial site conditions and calibrate a new succession extension for landis ii scheller et al 2007 density succession that encapsulates the logic of vegetation dynamics from landis pro wang et al 2013 into the landis ii model framework our approach applies an iterative methodology to progress from calibration to model corroboration stage illustrated by the growth and internal competition components of the density succession extension using 20 years of the fia plot remeasurement data 2 methods to demonstrate our methodology we selected a multi remeasurement inventory dataset wisconsin s fia data and a flm landis ii where observations from the inventory plots were represented as individual cells 12 97 12 97 m within the flm we subdivided our dataset into three groups each of which were used in different phases of the analysis we performed an initial fit of model parameters on the first subset group and used the second subset group to test equivalency we then performed an iterative parameter calibration process using subset groups one and two together finally we simulated subset group 3 using calibrated parameters and tested the model equivalency see section simulations for further details for calibration and corroboration steps we conducted a pairwise comparison at a cell plot level 2 1 the landis ii model the landis ii flm combines ecological principles such as succession disturbance and ecosystem ecology to represent the changes that occur in vegetation and ecosystem properties and rates describing both the behavior and state of the system itself scheller et al 2007 the model accounts for interactions among succession natural disturbances and management actions at a species level mladenoff and he 1999 scheller and mladenoff 2004 and is spatially dynamic he 2008 landis ii is driven by tree species life history attributes which regulate the way species grow and are distributed across the landscape as well as species responses to disturbances due to its broad scale of landscape application the landis ii model does not represent individual trees but uses collections of tree species age cohorts where each cohort carries attributes of age and species scheller et al 2007 the landis ii landscape is represented in a raster format with individual sites cells as the basic spatial unit of the landscape containing tree cohort data and regions which are collections of sites that have similar characteristics e g soils climate disturbance regime as a secondary spatial unit landis ii is not a single model but a model framework that consists of a central core that coordinates the plug in extensions that actually contain the science with designated extensions that represent the modeled processes of succession disturbance and model output for the purposes of this study we utilized the newly developed density succession extension fraser et al 2020 for succession processes and the land use plus lu extension thompson et al 2016 for disturbances 2 1 1 density succession density succession is an extension that ports the forest stand dynamics processes developed for landis pro wang et al 2013 into the landis ii model framework fig 1 species within the model are assigned key life history attributes that are common across all landis ii succession extensions including longevity shade tolerance age of sexual maturity minimum age for sprouting and its probability seeding distance and fire tolerance additionally density succession tracks the number of trees and diameter by species age cohort on each active site fraser et al 2020 which is also how landis pro operates wang et al 2013 the succession competition and establishment processes use additional species and site level parameters to estimate the occupied proportion of available growing space fraser et al 2020 wang et al 2013 estimates of stand density basal area stocking and biomass through allometric equations can be derived from the number of trees and diameter for each cohort site level resource competition is modeled using a stand density index sdi to quantify growing space occupied g s o and maximum growing space mgs reineke 1933 woodall et al 2005 s d i i j is calculated for each cohort present on a site with a reference diameter of 25 4 cm using eq 1 where n t i j is the number of trees and d b h i j is the diameter in cm of cohort j in species i the sdi parameter is defined in units of number of reference trees per hectare therefore the minimum growing space m i n g s i for a single reference tree of 25 4 cm for each species is calculated using the inverse of the maximum sdi parameter m a x s d i i defined per species eq 2 the gso for a given site is calculated using eq 3 as the sum s d i

the calculated growing space of the stem is subtracted from g s o this loop continues through all cohorts and makes multiple passes through the list if necessary until g s o is less than the mgs ecoregion parameter 2 1 2 land use plus the land use plus lu extension is a disturbance extension within landis ii that incorporates land use land cover change and other disturbances into the simulation despite the extension s name lu allows the user to do more than just represent land use change it integrates specific predefined spatially and temporally explicit disturbance events that could be externally developed empirical observations specific prescriptions e g plantations harvests or specific spatiotemporal processes e g land use or disturbance representations into landis ii simulations thompson et al 2016 j 2021 lu uses categorical or thematic raster maps for each time step representing the different change or disturbance processes to be simulated changes indicated by the map series are incorporated into the simulations as disturbances to the cohorts on impacted sites users specify the impact to species age cohorts including the amount of biomass to be removed new cohorts added through planting as well as the option to prevent establishment following the change thompson et al 2016 2 2 the forest inventory and analysis data for this study we used subsets of the forest inventory and analysis fia dataset to represent initial site conditions calibrate model parameters and test for equivalency we used wisconsin s plot data collected by the fia program from 2000 the start of wisconsin s annual inventory until 2020 burrill et al 2018 the fia program focuses on monitoring forestland conditions in the us across all ownerships as with other states in the eastern continental us each of wisconsin s fia plots with at least one forested condition i e a mapped domain on fia plots is remeasured approximately every five years with attention to the growth and mortality of previously recorded trees as well the ingrowth of new trees the fia program uses an equal probability sampling design where all elements of the population have the same probability of being sampled by a ground plot bechtold and patterson 2005 the design based estimators used to obtain estimates from the fia program can be assumed to be unbiased for large samples stanke et al 2022 the sample area covered by each fia plot is 0 4 hectares divided into four fixed radius 7 32 m permanent sample subplots trees with a diameter at breast height dbh greater than or equal to 12 7 cm are recorded in each subplot these four subplots are distributed with subplot one being at the center and subplots two three and four are located 36 6 m away at azimuths of 120 240 and 360 respectively within each subplot a microplot of 2 07 m radius is nested where trees with a dbh between 2 54 cm and 12 7 cm are recorded for our approach we used the four subplots that make up a plot for different stages of our analysis we used one subplot for the initial fit of model parameters a second subplot was used for testing equivalency and the two remaining subplots were combined to represent our third group for our second corroboration round subplots from each plot were randomly assigned to these groups within each subplot fia records certain information at a condition level a condition is defined by changes in land use or vegetation that occur inside a plot each forested condition is mapped according to reserved status owner group forest type stand density etc burrill et al 2018 we used data from trees greater or equal to 2 54 cm dbh to initialize our sites in the landis ii model to calibrate model parameters and to corroborate the density succession extension growth algorithms the trees recorded in the microplots 12 7 cm dbh represent regeneration ingrowth in the fia database and were used in our analysis to represent establishment of new tree species cohorts see land use plus section utilizing the microplot expansion factor tpa unadj burrill et al 2018 this expansion factor represents the number of trees per acre that are theoretically represented by the sample tree based on the fia sample design burrill et al 2018 the use of this expansion factor allowed us to scale inventory tree regeneration records to match the area simulated in each site for this research due to the scale desired level of detail and the ability for density succession to reduce density to reflect individual tree deaths we used the agent code as the cause of mortality this variable is useful when information about disturbances that affect individual trees is desired fitts et al 2022 2 3 general considerations our approach is based on a cell level assessment with each cell representing a single fia subplot therefore we used a cell size of 12 97 12 97 m which corresponds to the area of a fia subplot 168 33 m2 for computing efficiency all the fia subplots cells available for wisconsin were run independently but configured in a single simulation landscape without interaction between cells where natural regeneration e g seeding was prevented and disturbances were applied individually at the cell scale fig 1 each subplot was assumed to be homogeneous with respect to forest type and age distribution consistent with landis ii assumptions 2 4 data preparation the pool of simulated plots is composed of fia plots in the state of wisconsin filtered to plots classified with a forested land cover at the start of the study period 2000 these plots consisted of either forested or mixed conditions partial forest non forest plot e g one forest plus one non forest condition that had trees present at the initial time step we further refined our selection to include only plots that had remeasurements available for at least 3 points in time t0 t1 and t2 making a total of 4895 plots that were used wisconsin has data from four fia remeasurements each time a plot is re evaluated by the field crew which allows for a robust spatiotemporal analysis between 2000 and 2020 95 3 of the subplots consisted of a single condition while almost 4 7 had two conditions present the high number of subplots that had only one condition reinforced our decision to work at the subplot level to achieve homogeneous units for each fia plot we randomly assigned subplots to three groups hereafter a b and c with a single subplot in groups a and b and the remaining two assigned to group c each subplot group or combination of them was used for different purposes described in the calibration and corroboration sections fig 2 this approach ensures representation of each plot but with a direct translation between inventory data into landis ii s cells without further aggregation there were 92 species present in wisconsin s fia subplots the three most abundant hardwood species were red maple acer rubrum quaking aspen populus tremuloides and sugar maple acer saccharum the three most abundant conifer species were red pine pinus resinosa balsam fir abies balsamea and northern white cedar thuja occidentalis since less than a third of the species represented 99 of the total number of trees we selected the 30 most abundant verberk 2012 species in the ecosystem and created an additional six generic categories to represent life history attributes for those remaining table 1 the categories created were large shade tolerant hardwood l t h large shade tolerant conifer l t c large shade intolerant hardwood l i h large shade intolerant conifer l i c small medium shade tolerant hardwood s t h and small medium shade intolerant hardwood s i h no small sized conifers were present in the data set so no generic categories were created for small conifers some of the less frequent species were crosswalked to another species that had similar life history attributes i e longevity sexual maturity shade tolerance and fire tolerance within our selected 30 species see table s 1 for a complete list of species present in our dataset and the re categorization performed on the least abundant species 1 of the trees we reclassified the remaining low abundance species into the six generic categories according to their life history attributes from these there were 16 species categorized as small medium tolerant hardwoods nine species categorized as small medium intolerant hardwoods two species categorized as large tolerant hardwoods two as large tolerant conifers three categorized as large intolerant hardwoods and one large intolerant conifer there are 40 ecological subsection codes in wisconsin ecosubcd burrill et al 2018 mcnab et al 2007 12 ecological sections and two provinces laurentian mixed forest province and midwest broadleaf forest province we selected the ecological sections to represent ecoregions in our simulations to balance representation of major differences in productivity across the state with the need for adequate plot sample sizes in each ecoregion we used the ecological sections attribute to characterize each subplot s growing environment diameter growth models for each species in each ecological section were estimated with the vitalrates function in the rfia package for trees larger than 12 7 cm dbh stanke et al 2020 for trees less than 12 7 cm dbh we calculated average annual diameter growth from remeasurement records in fia for each species in each ecological section disturbances including the year when they occurred were processed from the agent of mortality agentcd variable in fia burrill et al 2018 this variable records the cause of death agent of a tree which was alive at the previous measurement and is now dead or removed the vegetation agent of mortality code was removed from the disturbances since self thinning is already incorporated into density succession the model should remove these trees via internal self thinning routines and was one of our evaluation variables the other mortality code was also removed from the disturbances since the reason for mortality was not clearly identified and we assumed this was either part of the competition mortality or it would be accounted for by the incorporated background mortality in the model both self thinning and background mortality are stochastic processes within the density succession extension model parameters for each species were defined using information from previous studies available literature and expert knowledge table 1 maximum stand density index values maxsdi were obtained from usda forest service 2019 species life history attributes e g longevity shade tolerance were also obtained from the literature species attributes for the generic categories were assigned values from representative species forl i h we used the value for quaking aspen populus tremuloides for l t h we used sugar maple acer saccharum for s t h we used eastern hophornbeam ostrya virginiana for s i h we used hawthorn crataegus spp for l i c we used red pine pinus resinosa and for l t c we used balsam fir abies balsamea see methods simulations for a list of the parameters set to zero 2 5 simulations landis ii requires several text and raster map files to provide model inputs the main file is the scenario text file which contains the specific instructions and details for the simulation see the density succession user guide fraser et al 2020 for a complete list of input files needed for the succession extension we ran different sets of simulations using landis ii starting at time zero t0 for 20 years we set the model so the succession process would occur at a one year time step due to possible inconsistent remeasurement intervals where disturbances and establishment are recorded this approach allowed us to intervene in the timeline when an event disturbance or establishment happened in specific cells but make no change to the cells where no events happened seed dispersal was set to one while reproduction probability sprouting and post fire regeneration were set to zero to prevent cell interaction and to control the disturbances and establishment occurring in the simulated subplot the species values of fire tolerance and sexual maturity age were ignored by the model due to the decision to disable disturbance events and seed production longevity was given an arbitrary number of 400 for all species this approach allowed us to isolate our evaluation and corroboration to focus on the growth and competition behaviors of the model we used a modified version of lu to remove individual stems when documented disturbances happened and to plant new stems recruited to the minimum diameter class recorded in the fia data we did not add trees that were recruited at the subplot level greater or equal to 12 7 cm dbh in future remeasurements only those recruited at the microplot level this was done to prevent repetition of stems since the microplot was scaled up to the subplot level with the fia expansion factor tpa unadj and was assumed to be representative of the subplot in density and species the process of the simulations that included calibration and corroboration phases occurred in an iterative and stepwise way with different groups of subplots reserved for each stage in the process fig 2 2 5 1 phase 1 initial parameter fit subplots randomly assigned to group a were used to fit one initial model parameter maximum growing space mgs see methods density succession section at an ecoregion level calibrating mgs for each ecological section required fitting a model of maximum basal area to different levels of mgs values on this set of simulations mgs was adjusted upward by 0 1 increments starting with a value of 1 0 up to and including the value of 2 0 the simulations were run for 200 years with no disturbance lu was turned off for these runs which allowed the plots to grow to peak basal area and let the model s self thinning algorithms control the dynamics after we ran the simulations with the varying mgs values we created a linear regression model in r between mgs as the response variable and maximum basal area 95 percentile as the predictor variable in parallel we used the rfia package stanke et al 2020 to obtain the maximum basal area total stocking for all the forested plots within the wisconsin s fia database alstkcd variable we fit a quantile regression model using the 95th percentile of basal area predicted by total stocking for each ecological section a prediction of basal area from the quantile regression model for a stocking value of 100 was generated for each ecological section and used in the corresponding linear regression model to predict a value for mgs for each ecoregion the mgs value obtained for each ecoregion was used for the remaining phases of the analysis 2 5 2 phase 2 model corroboration after estimating mgs we used the b subset of subplots for the second model run with which we corroborated the model outputs against observed tree density mean tree diameter and basal area during this corroboration we determined regions of agreement and regions of discrepancy at this stage we verified that the observed inventory data was correctly represented within the model and that the assumptions of ingrowth establishment and non competition mortality were enacted properly fig 2 in addition we verified the computer code for both the model itself and for data analysis by checking for errors bugs and oversights as well as confirming the model was performing according to design implementation verification augusiak et al 2014 corroboration allowed us to compare the simulated and observed outputs and evaluate the model performance the site scale corroboration was done through comparing raster cell level predictions with inventory data to explore individual cell deviation from the corresponding fia data the model outputs were corroborated using the data from the last fia remeasurement tf during phase 2 the output variables used for corroboration were total basal area m2 ha density number of trees and mean diameter cm per ecoregion and per species each observation point was a subplot to verify if there were significant differences between simulated and observed estimates for each corroboration variable equivalence tests were performed lakens 2017 robinson and froese 2004 equivalence tests permit a dissimilarity based on a specified threshold that allows some amount of disagreement between observed and predicted values lakens et al 2018 the benefit of this approach is that we put the burden of proof on the alternative hypothesis which in this application was that both landis ii and fia outputs means of the response variables are equivalent the validity of the model is then assessed by examining the accuracy of model predictions the tost procedure consists of two one sided t tests the first one sided test is used to test the estimate against values at least as extreme as the lower equivalence bound δl and the second one sided test is used to test the estimate against values at least as extreme as the upper equivalence bound δu both of these one sided t tests need to be significant for equivalence to be assumed see lakens et al 2018 for a complete description of equivalence tests the tost variables were the mean of the differences between simulated s the landis ii output and observed o the fia empirical data values for total basal area density and mean diameter per species and per ecoregion the null hypothesis is that the means are different h0 µs µo 0 dissimilarity and the alternative hypothesis is that the means are the same we used the toster r package lakens 2017 to perform two one sided t tests of equivalence tost with an alpha of 0 05 and epsilon values of 0 5 blanco et al 2007 robinson and froese 2004 we had paired data between fia observations and landis ii projections and therefore used the datatostpaired r function lakens 2017 we performed three equivalence tests at phase 2 of the simulations total basal area per species 1 mean diameter per species 2 and density per species 3 the first round of corroboration with the b subplots was followed by a model calibration phase phase 3 upon completion of calibration a second round of corroboration was done using the same equivalence testing methods with the c subplot group maintaining consistent sample sizes between calibration and corroboration where we again determined regions of agreement and regions of discrepancy phase 4 2 5 3 phase 3 parameter calibration after initial corroboration we performed a stepwise calibration using the combined a and b groups of subplots fig 2 the goal of the calibration was to minimize discrepancies and retain agreements identified in the initial corroboration because the density variable performed well during phase 2 the calibration phase focused on adjusting the mean diameter and total basal area to match observed fia data to achieve this we adjusted the age diameter curves which control the growth rates for each species in every ecoregion and directly affect mean diameter and total basal area our variables of interest only species that failed the second round of corroboration equivalence test for basal area 9 species when using the combined a and b groups were targeted for parameter adjustment for each species undergoing calibration we applied proportional adjustment factors ranging between 0 05 and 3 0 in increments of 0 05 to increase or decrease growth at a specific ecological section of the growth curve as needed this over or under estimation of growth was evaluated with scatterplots of observed vs predicted values fig 3 for mean diameter the scatterplots were used to identify which diameter growth model 12 7 cm dbh 12 7 cm dbh or both would need adjustments this threshold is the one that separates the trees measured in the fia program at a microplot from a subplot level to achieve calibration we created r code that interacts with the input files of each extension until an optimal adjustment factor minimized residual bias for each parameter was reached we chose adjustment factors that minimized mean bias for basal area when doing equivalence tests with an epsilon of 0 5 these values were carried to the next phase in addition we ran a simulation using the same a and b group subplots with non calibrated parameters to ensure that the differences observed from the previous phase phase 2 corroboration were actually due to calibrated parameters and not due to an increase in sample size 2 5 4 phase 4 final model corroboration in this phase we conducted the tost equivalence tests using group c fig 2 with an epsilon of 0 5 and the same hypothesis described in section phase 2 corroboration we performed two tost tests in parallel one using non calibrated parameters and the other using the calibrated parameters table 4 this was done to see if the difference that occurred in the results was actually due to the calibrated parameters instead of due to the use of a different sample 3 results 3 1 phase 1 initial fit of maximum growing space parameter observed 95th percentile basal areas across all ecological sections ranged from 39 to 52 m2 ha and the calibrated values for mgs ranged from 0 93 to 1 69 table 2 see supplementary figure s 2 for visual outputs of the different runs for subplot group a 3 2 phase 2 model corroboration we observed that density outputs from landis ii simulations were equivalent for 29 out of the 30 most abundant species table 3 for mean diameter 22 out of the 30 most abundant species fell into the equivalence range landis ii simulations under predicted the mean diameter for abies balsamea ostrya virginiana pinus banksiana and populus tremuloides and over predicted for quercus alba thuja occidentalis tilia americana and tsuga canadensis for basal area 20 out of the 30 most abundant species were equivalent with an epsilon of 0 5 landis ii simulations tended to under estimate basal area the species that fell into this category were abies balsamea ostrya virginiana picea mariana pinus banksiana populus tremuloides and prunus serotina the species whose output was over estimated were pinus resinosa quercus alba thuja occidentalis and tsuga canadensis 3 3 phase 3 parameter calibration from the observed vs predicted scatterplots subplots a b for mean diameter fig 3 we noticed that the diameter growth models for abies balsamea ostrya virginiana and prunus serotina were overpredicting the diameter for trees 12 7 cm dbh the models for pinus banksiana were overpredicted for trees larger or equal than 12 7 cm dbh picea mariana and populus tremuloides were overpredicted across the entire dbh range the mean diameter was underpredicted for tsuga canadensis under 12 7 cm dbh and for quercus alba and thuja occidentalis across the entire diameter range after iterative adjustments all nine calibrated species showed equivalence table 4 the proportional adjustment selected to apply for the next corroboration phase was the one for each species that made the mean bias in the estimator the lowest among the iterative calibration runs 3 4 phase 4 final model validation from subplot group c we observed that application of calibrated parameters for the nine corresponding species table 4 reduced mean bias in the estimator for basal area m2 ha fig 4 top panel in addition despite keeping the parameters for some species unchanged i e non calibrated their respective mean bias was affected by competitive interactions with calibrated species fig 4 bottom panel we observed that the mean bias associated with the estimator for basal area was reduced for nine species by calibration of those nine species five were ultimately equivalent at an epsilon value of 0 5 ostrya virginiana pinus banksiana populus tremuloides prunus serotina and thuja occidentalis table 5 we observed that calibrating one variable i e basal area affected model performance for other variables of interest table 5 for density when running a non calibrated simulation for all species all of the most abundant species were equivalent however when using the calibrated parameters for basal area table 4 four out of the 30 were not equivalent mean diameter had a direct relationship with basal area calibration since the growth curves our calibration focus directly affected mean diameter when looking at the simulation with non calibrated parameters 22 out of the 30 most abundant species were equivalent compared to the 24 equivalent species when using calibrated parameters 4 discussion our study presents a novel and replicable framework to evaluate calibrate and corroborate a landscape simulation model landis ii at a site scale using an extensive equal probability sample from the us national forest inventory i e fia the design based unbiased estimators used to obtain empirical estimates from the publicly available fia data provide a basis for corroboration of a forest landscape model and a consistent source of data for model calibration the novelty in this study emerges from the scale of observation and the pairwise method of comparison the traditional approach for landscape models is to examine concurrence equivalency or bias in aggregated outputs where some sources of error may be obscured by variability in multiple processes occurring across the landscape we performed the iterative calibration and model corroboration using a direct pairwise comparison of simulation outputs and forest inventory data at the plot level our approach can be applied by other researchers to enhance model confidence for a wide breadth of questions such as carbon fire interactions effects of disturbances on forest structure and health and simulation of different forest management scenarios previous corroboration work for landscape simulation models has been conducted for landclim schumacher et al 2004 iland seidl et al 2012 and landis pro duan et al 2021 huang et al 2017 c 2021 luo et al 2014 wang et al 2014 using experimental or observational data over a short timeframe two or three decades similar to that used in this study to corroborate model projections at the species or site level scale corroboration work for other models like treemig lischke et al 2006 and landis ii mckenzie et al 2019 scheller and mladenoff 2004 has relied on limited empirical data available for comparison from these examples wang et al 2014 conducted a corroboration approach most similar to our own in that they applied equivalency tests to the output of a density based succession model landis pro using a time series of forest inventory data their approach differs in two important respects first they used a subset of the inventory data that excluded disturbed plots by using the lu extension to implement establishment and disturbance related mortality we were able to assess the processes of growth and competition mortality within the model compared to a wider range of observed data second their evaluations of model predictions for each species were performed at the aggregated ecoregion level whereas our evaluations were conducted using a pair wise comparison between individual model cells and fia subplots such site level model evaluation is more commonly applied to stand or plot scale models for example glasby et al 2019 applied equivalence tests to evaluate diameter growth relationships simulated by the forest vegetation simulator fvs model crookston and dixon 2005 fvs staff 2021 with a specific focus on the role of disturbance on residual growth we demonstrated that similar logic may be applied to landscape models providing a more rigorous empirical foundation for projections of local processes that can then be scaled to landscapes via their integration with spatially contagious processes such as seed dispersal and disturbances equivalence tests are useful when we expect the differences to be very small and hard to detect therefore the decision of what equivalence threshold to choose is critical lakens et al 2018 proposed several methods for selecting these thresholds based on sample size and effect size of interest the strength of the equivalence tests relies on the null hypothesis of dissimilarity and examines whether effects extreme enough to be considered meaningful can be rejected lakens 2017 in our case we used equivalence tests to capture the small differences expected from evaluating a flm over a short time frame and having most of the model stochastic processes controlled since we were using plot remeasurements we conducted a pairwise comparison analysis for the equivalence tests where data are not treated as independent lakens 2017 we established a 0 5 threshold for determining equivalency as used in robinson et al 2004 and blanco et al 2007 when applying a methodology such as ours to the evaludation procedures that develop confidence in a model the assumptions underlying model design the representation of processes in the model scale and how these factors relate to empirical data are all important factors in our case we focused on parameters underlying age diameter curves as those control how fast a tree grows to determine mean diameter and basal area outputs we selected our cell size to match a subplot size i e scale even so trees smaller than 12 7 cm dbh within fia plots are measured from a smaller area microplot and assumed to be representative of the entire subplot hence discrepancies are anticipated as tree diameters cross the 12 7 cm threshold we therefore assumed that such discrepancies emerge as statistical noise without bias such assumptions would need to be carefully addressed when evaluating model behavior for different resolutions such as the 0 09 ha or 6 25 ha scales consistent with landsat and modis satellite imagery respectively response variables may also be interdependent for example when we calibrated basal area the density of trees was affected because of the way growing space acts in the model table 5 consequently fine tuning equivalence in one variable might result in a loss of equivalence in another variable therefore the primary variable of interest should be chosen in the context of the specific modeling objectives finally the relatively short time span analyzed 20 years compared to the relatively slow processes of tree growth and mortality may be problematic so a longer time span of empirical data is clearly desirable an important benefit of the iterative approach illustrated by fig 2 is that it facilitates better understanding of model process interactions allowing the model user to learn as they explore complicating factors this method allows for learning about the model design application methods and the reference data for example the attribute that we were calibrating was species growth rates age diameter relationship which when applied to the generation of initial communities would create slightly different starting cohort diameters in the initial stage of calibration we had not accounted for this difference but the evaluation brought this to our attention and we integrated this knowledge into the final stage of corroboration these models are complicated and it is difficult to anticipate all of the pertinent interactions another learning example resulted in the improvement of a specific model component application of the stand density based mortality model within density succession had not been previously tested at this spatial scale and the iterative calibration process highlighted the potential for improving the design of a specific function previously the mortality function iterated over cohorts sorted by probability of mortality and removed a proportion of stems within the cohort until the target amount of growing space removed was satisfied when applying our design to cohorts containing a single tree we identified a potential source of bias in the species experiencing mortality this led to a redesign of the looping function to better capture stochasticity within the mortality model while equivalence tests represent a formal statistical method for comparison across models results should still be interpreted with caution rejection of a meaningful effect equivalency does not imply that an effect is not present at all lakens et al 2018 therefore even if our results show equivalency there might still be some patterns in the data e g environmental gradients etc that represent relevant differences furthermore agreement between modeled and empirical data does not always mean that the model is correct but could also be a factor of an over calibration or a combination of incorrect representation of processes and input parameters augusiak et al 2014 therefore researchers should look at the bigger picture such as the plausibility of specific parameter ranges rather than only looking at observed vs predicted values over calibrating parameters can increase the risk of model equivalency for the wrong reasons i e unrealistic parameter combination augusiak et al 2014 one could guard against such over calibration by approaching the data from different angles such as equivalency at species versus ecoregion level e g fitts vargas 2021 it should be noted that we identified two avenues for calibration to do it at the ecoregion level or at the species level for this study we focused on just the species level see fitts vargas 2021 to explore the ecoregion calibration approach however focusing too narrowly on one level can lead to poor behavior elsewhere in the model and should be avoided in addition we noticed feedback between parameters when calibrating similarly when the corroboration process improves one variable s behavior other variables might be affected because of the feedback forest attributes have among each other future work could conduct sensitivity analysis to explore additional parameters to calibrate and corroborate our approach may be adapted to address multiple areas of model uncertainty one might explore the sources of error in this work by grouping plots with other common specific characteristics i e disturbed vs not disturbed where potentially stronger results may be observed within the small timeframe where data is available conducting a sensitivity analysis to explore which model parameters have the most impact during calibration and which contribute the most to confounding other metrics of model performance could be implemented in future work other processes within the density succession extension of landis ii such as species cohort recruitment could be evaluated by enabling the regeneration and establishment components of the model the method is likewise extensible to other geographic regions other model designs or both 5 conclusions while flms hold very real potential to inform land management and other policy decisions their adoption for such purposes can be greatly hampered by a lack of confidence in such models scheller 2018 shifley et al 2017 this issue is not limited to flms but a concern for environmental modeling generally with increasing calls for greater transparency documentation and rigor in model evaludation augusiak et al 2014 here we present a methodology for evaluating calibrating and corroborating landis ii s successional growth algorithms when using its new density succession extension at a site scale this methodology connects empirical data from the us national forest inventory to initialize the landscape corroborate and calibrate the model s parameters this plot cell evaluation of model behavior is a novel approach compared to the traditional way that evaluation corroboration and calibration have been conducted for flm at landscape levels using summary statistics these summary statistics might not capture the whole range of variability and bias the iterative nature of our approach further facilitates learning by the user where such learning can be thoroughly documented to enhance overall model confidence the specific succession extension evaluated by our methodology opens a new window of research and development for landis ii users as density succession is directly compatible with common forest inventory measurements and can therefore be integrated with national inventory data in a relatively seamless fashion as demonstrated here there are several sources of potential error to consider when performing such evaludation efforts these sources of bias or error include the corroboration assumptions and study design the forest inventory sample design the way certain processes are represented in the model particular site characteristics etc moreover calibration can be useful for having the output better match the empirical data but it should be done with caution one reason to be cautious is to avoid over calibration augusiak et al 2014 another reason includes that focusing too narrowly on calibrating at one scale can alter results at another scale i e species vs ecoregions or for another variable of interest therefore it is important to keep in mind the study s main interest for selecting which variable to calibrate and corroborate the cohort characteristics of diameter and density tracked by density succession are commonly recorded measurements of individual trees in forest inventory datasets this provides a set of directly comparable metrics for model calibration and corroboration these cohort characteristics are also frequently used in forest management plans and wildlife habitat models the emergent processes of stand development based on the stand density index competition process leverages established theories of forest stand dynamics that are unique from other landis ii succession extensions the main objective of this paper was to isolate and test specific processes of competition and growth to show how the model is performing by using individual components without interactions we sought to understand the inherent bias augusiak et al 2014 we acknowledge that the interactions between cells are important for the realism of the simulation however that would be a next step given the caveats above our approach is extensible to many flm designs and should help improve the rigor and transparency of their application funding this

24255,forest landscape simulation models flm have been extensively used for projecting ecosystem dynamics and carbon fluxes however more guidance and methods for formal calibration and corroboration of flms are needed to ensure higher fidelity results from these models we developed a novel systematic methodology for calibrating and corroborating a flm at the grid cell scale using empirical estimates from the national forest inventory in the united states us which uses an equal probability sample design we illustrate our approach by using the forest inventory and analysis fia data from the us department of agriculture forest service across the state of wisconsin to represent initial site conditions and calibrate parameters for the density succession extension of the landis ii model formally coupled with an iterative model corroboration stage focused on the growth and internal competition component of the model at a site scale using plot remeasurement data that span 20 years we used a formal equivalence testing approach to compare model predictions to empirical estimates for permanent sample plots we found that the model performed well with 21 out of 30 species demonstrating equivalence in the estimator used to characterize basal area following initial parameterization upon calibration of the estimator the nine species not initially equivalent all showed reduced bias with five of the species ultimately passing the equivalence test the species that did not achieve equivalence through calibration were generally the least abundant ones these results have increased our confidence that the density succession algorithms were well implemented within the model and provides a useful additional succession option within the landis ii framework we believe this methodology can capture a wider range of local scale variability compared to previous methods conducted at a landscape level using summary statistics the iterative nature of the method also gives an opportunity for learning about the model components and the reference plot data our approach will help researchers using landscape simulation models to follow a replicable framework for corroborating their results and prioritize forest management activities and land use planning which can help reduce external pressures on forests and help mitigate climate change effects graphical abstract image

dynamic biological systems peng 2000 disturbances play a critical role in forest dynamics oliver and larson 1996 causing changes in species composition habitat and resource allocation disturbance regimes are also changing due to global climate change seidl et al 2011 2017 turner 2010 zhu et al 2020 and interactions among disturbance types sturtevant and fortin 2021 threatening habitat conditions in forests and their ability to sustain ecosystem services franklin et al 2007 seidl et al 2017 studies of forest dynamics are key to understanding changes in tree density species composition biomass and carbon sequestration which are fundamental components of forest ecosystem resilience to climate change there are different approaches to studying forest dynamics one of them being vegetation models which can represent complex interdisciplinary and multi scale spatial processes to address questions about short and long term ecosystem dynamics and human caused or natural drivers of landscape change mayer et al 2016 mladenoff 2004 forest landscape models flm integrate the influence of time and space on environmental drivers and processes that influence vegetation patterns which in turn feed back to affect ecological processes gao et al 2018 peterson 2002 shifley et al 2017 flms have been broadly used especially when long term forest inventory data are absent to represent forest dynamics in species composition future yield succession disturbances and ecological restoration purposes all under diverse environmental conditions landis ii foundation 2018 peng 2000 thompson et al 2016 over the last three decades flms have increased in detail complexity and spatial extent with the advancement in technology and computing capacity scheller 2018 shifley et al 2017 despite the power of flms to integrate across scales and processes affecting forest dynamics they are notoriously challenging to validate impacting confidence in the veracity of their outputs scheller 2018 concerns regarding model confidence are not unique to flms there has been an ongoing plea for greater transparency and rigor in the evaluation of ecological and environmental models more generally grimm et al 2010 2014 augusiak et al 2014 coined the term evaludation to encompass the full cycle of activities to critically assess whether and when a model is meeting its intended purpose two important components of this process are the calibration of model parameters and the corroboration of model outputs calibration a component of model output verification is an iterative process of modifying the model parameters one at a time until there is an incremental improvement of the results in comparison to empirical data wang et al 2014 a common method of calibrating species level parameters within an flm is to fit model outputs to established empirical estimates of growth and yield lucash et al 2017 reese et al 2022 these estimates are often based on averages of observations aggregated over space and time model corroboration involves comparing an independent data set with the model predictions from the same temporal and spatial scales within its relevant domain to examine agreement between modeled and empirical data augusiak et al 2014 shifley et al 2017 previous corroboration work has been done for flms such as landclim schumacher et al 2004 iland seidl et al 2012 and landis pro wang et al 2014 using aggregated plot data for a short term two or three decades a more novel approach to both calibration and model corroboration is to match model outputs with the behavior of individual plots i e disaggregated this method has been widely applied to plot scale models bagdon et al 2021 vacchiano et al 2014 but not yet applied to flms while similar studies have been conducted within the landis ii model framework e g boulanger et al 2017 mckenzie et al 2019 its distributed development strategy and design has impeded the adoption of a more universal corroboration methodology to help address this problem we developed a systematic and disaggregated methodology for calibrating and corroborating a flm using a pairwise comparison to existing forest inventory data our specific research objectives are to 1 build a replicable methodology for model evaluation that can segregate specific areas of the model to evaluate and 2 increase confidence in model processes by testing the performance of individual model components at the site level we believe this methodology can capture a wider range of local scale variability compared to previous methods conducted at a landscape level that use summary statistics to achieve these objectives we used estimates from the forest inventory and analysis fia program of the united states forest service usfs across the state of wisconsin to represent initial site conditions and calibrate a new succession extension for landis ii scheller et al 2007 density succession that encapsulates the logic of vegetation dynamics from landis pro wang et al 2013 into the landis ii model framework our approach applies an iterative methodology to progress from calibration to model corroboration stage illustrated by the growth and internal competition components of the density succession extension using 20 years of the fia plot remeasurement data 2 methods to demonstrate our methodology we selected a multi remeasurement inventory dataset wisconsin s fia data and a flm landis ii where observations from the inventory plots were represented as individual cells 12 97 12 97 m within the flm we subdivided our dataset into three groups each of which were used in different phases of the analysis we performed an initial fit of model parameters on the first subset group and used the second subset group to test equivalency we then performed an iterative parameter calibration process using subset groups one and two together finally we simulated subset group 3 using calibrated parameters and tested the model equivalency see section simulations for further details for calibration and corroboration steps we conducted a pairwise comparison at a cell plot level 2 1 the landis ii model the landis ii flm combines ecological principles such as succession disturbance and ecosystem ecology to represent the changes that occur in vegetation and ecosystem properties and rates describing both the behavior and state of the system itself scheller et al 2007 the model accounts for interactions among succession natural disturbances and management actions at a species level mladenoff and he 1999 scheller and mladenoff 2004 and is spatially dynamic he 2008 landis ii is driven by tree species life history attributes which regulate the way species grow and are distributed across the landscape as well as species responses to disturbances due to its broad scale of landscape application the landis ii model does not represent individual trees but uses collections of tree species age cohorts where each cohort carries attributes of age and species scheller et al 2007 the landis ii landscape is represented in a raster format with individual sites cells as the basic spatial unit of the landscape containing tree cohort data and regions which are collections of sites that have similar characteristics e g soils climate disturbance regime as a secondary spatial unit landis ii is not a single model but a model framework that consists of a central core that coordinates the plug in extensions that actually contain the science with designated extensions that represent the modeled processes of succession disturbance and model output for the purposes of this study we utilized the newly developed density succession extension fraser et al 2020 for succession processes and the land use plus lu extension thompson et al 2016 for disturbances 2 1 1 density succession density succession is an extension that ports the forest stand dynamics processes developed for landis pro wang et al 2013 into the landis ii model framework fig 1 species within the model are assigned key life history attributes that are common across all landis ii succession extensions including longevity shade tolerance age of sexual maturity minimum age for sprouting and its probability seeding distance and fire tolerance additionally density succession tracks the number of trees and diameter by species age cohort on each active site fraser et al 2020 which is also how landis pro operates wang et al 2013 the succession competition and establishment processes use additional species and site level parameters to estimate the occupied proportion of available growing space fraser et al 2020 wang et al 2013 estimates of stand density basal area stocking and biomass through allometric equations can be derived from the number of trees and diameter for each cohort site level resource competition is modeled using a stand density index sdi to quantify growing space occupied g s o and maximum growing space mgs reineke 1933 woodall et al 2005 s d i i j is calculated for each cohort present on a site with a reference diameter of 25 4 cm using eq 1 where n t i j is the number of trees and d b h i j is the diameter in cm of cohort j in species i the sdi parameter is defined in units of number of reference trees per hectare therefore the minimum growing space m i n g s i for a single reference tree of 25 4 cm for each species is calculated using the inverse of the maximum sdi parameter m a x s d i i defined per species eq 2 the gso for a given site is calculated using eq 3 as the sum s d i

the calculated growing space of the stem is subtracted from g s o this loop continues through all cohorts and makes multiple passes through the list if necessary until g s o is less than the mgs ecoregion parameter 2 1 2 land use plus the land use plus lu extension is a disturbance extension within landis ii that incorporates land use land cover change and other disturbances into the simulation despite the extension s name lu allows the user to do more than just represent land use change it integrates specific predefined spatially and temporally explicit disturbance events that could be externally developed empirical observations specific prescriptions e g plantations harvests or specific spatiotemporal processes e g land use or disturbance representations into landis ii simulations thompson et al 2016 j 2021 lu uses categorical or thematic raster maps for each time step representing the different change or disturbance processes to be simulated changes indicated by the map series are incorporated into the simulations as disturbances to the cohorts on impacted sites users specify the impact to species age cohorts including the amount of biomass to be removed new cohorts added through planting as well as the option to prevent establishment following the change thompson et al 2016 2 2 the forest inventory and analysis data for this study we used subsets of the forest inventory and analysis fia dataset to represent initial site conditions calibrate model parameters and test for equivalency we used wisconsin s plot data collected by the fia program from 2000 the start of wisconsin s annual inventory until 2020 burrill et al 2018 the fia program focuses on monitoring forestland conditions in the us across all ownerships as with other states in the eastern continental us each of wisconsin s fia plots with at least one forested condition i e a mapped domain on fia plots is remeasured approximately every five years with attention to the growth and mortality of previously recorded trees as well the ingrowth of new trees the fia program uses an equal probability sampling design where all elements of the population have the same probability of being sampled by a ground plot bechtold and patterson 2005 the design based estimators used to obtain estimates from the fia program can be assumed to be unbiased for large samples stanke et al 2022 the sample area covered by each fia plot is 0 4 hectares divided into four fixed radius 7 32 m permanent sample subplots trees with a diameter at breast height dbh greater than or equal to 12 7 cm are recorded in each subplot these four subplots are distributed with subplot one being at the center and subplots two three and four are located 36 6 m away at azimuths of 120 240 and 360 respectively within each subplot a microplot of 2 07 m radius is nested where trees with a dbh between 2 54 cm and 12 7 cm are recorded for our approach we used the four subplots that make up a plot for different stages of our analysis we used one subplot for the initial fit of model parameters a second subplot was used for testing equivalency and the two remaining subplots were combined to represent our third group for our second corroboration round subplots from each plot were randomly assigned to these groups within each subplot fia records certain information at a condition level a condition is defined by changes in land use or vegetation that occur inside a plot each forested condition is mapped according to reserved status owner group forest type stand density etc burrill et al 2018 we used data from trees greater or equal to 2 54 cm dbh to initialize our sites in the landis ii model to calibrate model parameters and to corroborate the density succession extension growth algorithms the trees recorded in the microplots 12 7 cm dbh represent regeneration ingrowth in the fia database and were used in our analysis to represent establishment of new tree species cohorts see land use plus section utilizing the microplot expansion factor tpa unadj burrill et al 2018 this expansion factor represents the number of trees per acre that are theoretically represented by the sample tree based on the fia sample design burrill et al 2018 the use of this expansion factor allowed us to scale inventory tree regeneration records to match the area simulated in each site for this research due to the scale desired level of detail and the ability for density succession to reduce density to reflect individual tree deaths we used the agent code as the cause of mortality this variable is useful when information about disturbances that affect individual trees is desired fitts et al 2022 2 3 general considerations our approach is based on a cell level assessment with each cell representing a single fia subplot therefore we used a cell size of 12 97 12 97 m which corresponds to the area of a fia subplot 168 33 m2 for computing efficiency all the fia subplots cells available for wisconsin were run independently but configured in a single simulation landscape without interaction between cells where natural regeneration e g seeding was prevented and disturbances were applied individually at the cell scale fig 1 each subplot was assumed to be homogeneous with respect to forest type and age distribution consistent with landis ii assumptions 2 4 data preparation the pool of simulated plots is composed of fia plots in the state of wisconsin filtered to plots classified with a forested land cover at the start of the study period 2000 these plots consisted of either forested or mixed conditions partial forest non forest plot e g one forest plus one non forest condition that had trees present at the initial time step we further refined our selection to include only plots that had remeasurements available for at least 3 points in time t0 t1 and t2 making a total of 4895 plots that were used wisconsin has data from four fia remeasurements each time a plot is re evaluated by the field crew which allows for a robust spatiotemporal analysis between 2000 and 2020 95 3 of the subplots consisted of a single condition while almost 4 7 had two conditions present the high number of subplots that had only one condition reinforced our decision to work at the subplot level to achieve homogeneous units for each fia plot we randomly assigned subplots to three groups hereafter a b and c with a single subplot in groups a and b and the remaining two assigned to group c each subplot group or combination of them was used for different purposes described in the calibration and corroboration sections fig 2 this approach ensures representation of each plot but with a direct translation between inventory data into landis ii s cells without further aggregation there were 92 species present in wisconsin s fia subplots the three most abundant hardwood species were red maple acer rubrum quaking aspen populus tremuloides and sugar maple acer saccharum the three most abundant conifer species were red pine pinus resinosa balsam fir abies balsamea and northern white cedar thuja occidentalis since less than a third of the species represented 99 of the total number of trees we selected the 30 most abundant verberk 2012 species in the ecosystem and created an additional six generic categories to represent life history attributes for those remaining table 1 the categories created were large shade tolerant hardwood l t h large shade tolerant conifer l t c large shade intolerant hardwood l i h large shade intolerant conifer l i c small medium shade tolerant hardwood s t h and small medium shade intolerant hardwood s i h no small sized conifers were present in the data set so no generic categories were created for small conifers some of the less frequent species were crosswalked to another species that had similar life history attributes i e longevity sexual maturity shade tolerance and fire tolerance within our selected 30 species see table s 1 for a complete list of species present in our dataset and the re categorization performed on the least abundant species 1 of the trees we reclassified the remaining low abundance species into the six generic categories according to their life history attributes from these there were 16 species categorized as small medium tolerant hardwoods nine species categorized as small medium intolerant hardwoods two species categorized as large tolerant hardwoods two as large tolerant conifers three categorized as large intolerant hardwoods and one large intolerant conifer there are 40 ecological subsection codes in wisconsin ecosubcd burrill et al 2018 mcnab et al 2007 12 ecological sections and two provinces laurentian mixed forest province and midwest broadleaf forest province we selected the ecological sections to represent ecoregions in our simulations to balance representation of major differences in productivity across the state with the need for adequate plot sample sizes in each ecoregion we used the ecological sections attribute to characterize each subplot s growing environment diameter growth models for each species in each ecological section were estimated with the vitalrates function in the rfia package for trees larger than 12 7 cm dbh stanke et al 2020 for trees less than 12 7 cm dbh we calculated average annual diameter growth from remeasurement records in fia for each species in each ecological section disturbances including the year when they occurred were processed from the agent of mortality agentcd variable in fia burrill et al 2018 this variable records the cause of death agent of a tree which was alive at the previous measurement and is now dead or removed the vegetation agent of mortality code was removed from the disturbances since self thinning is already incorporated into density succession the model should remove these trees via internal self thinning routines and was one of our evaluation variables the other mortality code was also removed from the disturbances since the reason for mortality was not clearly identified and we assumed this was either part of the competition mortality or it would be accounted for by the incorporated background mortality in the model both self thinning and background mortality are stochastic processes within the density succession extension model parameters for each species were defined using information from previous studies available literature and expert knowledge table 1 maximum stand density index values maxsdi were obtained from usda forest service 2019 species life history attributes e g longevity shade tolerance were also obtained from the literature species attributes for the generic categories were assigned values from representative species forl i h we used the value for quaking aspen populus tremuloides for l t h we used sugar maple acer saccharum for s t h we used eastern hophornbeam ostrya virginiana for s i h we used hawthorn crataegus spp for l i c we used red pine pinus resinosa and for l t c we used balsam fir abies balsamea see methods simulations for a list of the parameters set to zero 2 5 simulations landis ii requires several text and raster map files to provide model inputs the main file is the scenario text file which contains the specific instructions and details for the simulation see the density succession user guide fraser et al 2020 for a complete list of input files needed for the succession extension we ran different sets of simulations using landis ii starting at time zero t0 for 20 years we set the model so the succession process would occur at a one year time step due to possible inconsistent remeasurement intervals where disturbances and establishment are recorded this approach allowed us to intervene in the timeline when an event disturbance or establishment happened in specific cells but make no change to the cells where no events happened seed dispersal was set to one while reproduction probability sprouting and post fire regeneration were set to zero to prevent cell interaction and to control the disturbances and establishment occurring in the simulated subplot the species values of fire tolerance and sexual maturity age were ignored by the model due to the decision to disable disturbance events and seed production longevity was given an arbitrary number of 400 for all species this approach allowed us to isolate our evaluation and corroboration to focus on the growth and competition behaviors of the model we used a modified version of lu to remove individual stems when documented disturbances happened and to plant new stems recruited to the minimum diameter class recorded in the fia data we did not add trees that were recruited at the subplot level greater or equal to 12 7 cm dbh in future remeasurements only those recruited at the microplot level this was done to prevent repetition of stems since the microplot was scaled up to the subplot level with the fia expansion factor tpa unadj and was assumed to be representative of the subplot in density and species the process of the simulations that included calibration and corroboration phases occurred in an iterative and stepwise way with different groups of subplots reserved for each stage in the process fig 2 2 5 1 phase 1 initial parameter fit subplots randomly assigned to group a were used to fit one initial model parameter maximum growing space mgs see methods density succession section at an ecoregion level calibrating mgs for each ecological section required fitting a model of maximum basal area to different levels of mgs values on this set of simulations mgs was adjusted upward by 0 1 increments starting with a value of 1 0 up to and including the value of 2 0 the simulations were run for 200 years with no disturbance lu was turned off for these runs which allowed the plots to grow to peak basal area and let the model s self thinning algorithms control the dynamics after we ran the simulations with the varying mgs values we created a linear regression model in r between mgs as the response variable and maximum basal area 95 percentile as the predictor variable in parallel we used the rfia package stanke et al 2020 to obtain the maximum basal area total stocking for all the forested plots within the wisconsin s fia database alstkcd variable we fit a quantile regression model using the 95th percentile of basal area predicted by total stocking for each ecological section a prediction of basal area from the quantile regression model for a stocking value of 100 was generated for each ecological section and used in the corresponding linear regression model to predict a value for mgs for each ecoregion the mgs value obtained for each ecoregion was used for the remaining phases of the analysis 2 5 2 phase 2 model corroboration after estimating mgs we used the b subset of subplots for the second model run with which we corroborated the model outputs against observed tree density mean tree diameter and basal area during this corroboration we determined regions of agreement and regions of discrepancy at this stage we verified that the observed inventory data was correctly represented within the model and that the assumptions of ingrowth establishment and non competition mortality were enacted properly fig 2 in addition we verified the computer code for both the model itself and for data analysis by checking for errors bugs and oversights as well as confirming the model was performing according to design implementation verification augusiak et al 2014 corroboration allowed us to compare the simulated and observed outputs and evaluate the model performance the site scale corroboration was done through comparing raster cell level predictions with inventory data to explore individual cell deviation from the corresponding fia data the model outputs were corroborated using the data from the last fia remeasurement tf during phase 2 the output variables used for corroboration were total basal area m2 ha density number of trees and mean diameter cm per ecoregion and per species each observation point was a subplot to verify if there were significant differences between simulated and observed estimates for each corroboration variable equivalence tests were performed lakens 2017 robinson and froese 2004 equivalence tests permit a dissimilarity based on a specified threshold that allows some amount of disagreement between observed and predicted values lakens et al 2018 the benefit of this approach is that we put the burden of proof on the alternative hypothesis which in this application was that both landis ii and fia outputs means of the response variables are equivalent the validity of the model is then assessed by examining the accuracy of model predictions the tost procedure consists of two one sided t tests the first one sided test is used to test the estimate against values at least as extreme as the lower equivalence bound δl and the second one sided test is used to test the estimate against values at least as extreme as the upper equivalence bound δu both of these one sided t tests need to be significant for equivalence to be assumed see lakens et al 2018 for a complete description of equivalence tests the tost variables were the mean of the differences between simulated s the landis ii output and observed o the fia empirical data values for total basal area density and mean diameter per species and per ecoregion the null hypothesis is that the means are different h0 µs µo 0 dissimilarity and the alternative hypothesis is that the means are the same we used the toster r package lakens 2017 to perform two one sided t tests of equivalence tost with an alpha of 0 05 and epsilon values of 0 5 blanco et al 2007 robinson and froese 2004 we had paired data between fia observations and landis ii projections and therefore used the datatostpaired r function lakens 2017 we performed three equivalence tests at phase 2 of the simulations total basal area per species 1 mean diameter per species 2 and density per species 3 the first round of corroboration with the b subplots was followed by a model calibration phase phase 3 upon completion of calibration a second round of corroboration was done using the same equivalence testing methods with the c subplot group maintaining consistent sample sizes between calibration and corroboration where we again determined regions of agreement and regions of discrepancy phase 4 2 5 3 phase 3 parameter calibration after initial corroboration we performed a stepwise calibration using the combined a and b groups of subplots fig 2 the goal of the calibration was to minimize discrepancies and retain agreements identified in the initial corroboration because the density variable performed well during phase 2 the calibration phase focused on adjusting the mean diameter and total basal area to match observed fia data to achieve this we adjusted the age diameter curves which control the growth rates for each species in every ecoregion and directly affect mean diameter and total basal area our variables of interest only species that failed the second round of corroboration equivalence test for basal area 9 species when using the combined a and b groups were targeted for parameter adjustment for each species undergoing calibration we applied proportional adjustment factors ranging between 0 05 and 3 0 in increments of 0 05 to increase or decrease growth at a specific ecological section of the growth curve as needed this over or under estimation of growth was evaluated with scatterplots of observed vs predicted values fig 3 for mean diameter the scatterplots were used to identify which diameter growth model 12 7 cm dbh 12 7 cm dbh or both would need adjustments this threshold is the one that separates the trees measured in the fia program at a microplot from a subplot level to achieve calibration we created r code that interacts with the input files of each extension until an optimal adjustment factor minimized residual bias for each parameter was reached we chose adjustment factors that minimized mean bias for basal area when doing equivalence tests with an epsilon of 0 5 these values were carried to the next phase in addition we ran a simulation using the same a and b group subplots with non calibrated parameters to ensure that the differences observed from the previous phase phase 2 corroboration were actually due to calibrated parameters and not due to an increase in sample size 2 5 4 phase 4 final model corroboration in this phase we conducted the tost equivalence tests using group c fig 2 with an epsilon of 0 5 and the same hypothesis described in section phase 2 corroboration we performed two tost tests in parallel one using non calibrated parameters and the other using the calibrated parameters table 4 this was done to see if the difference that occurred in the results was actually due to the calibrated parameters instead of due to the use of a different sample 3 results 3 1 phase 1 initial fit of maximum growing space parameter observed 95th percentile basal areas across all ecological sections ranged from 39 to 52 m2 ha and the calibrated values for mgs ranged from 0 93 to 1 69 table 2 see supplementary figure s 2 for visual outputs of the different runs for subplot group a 3 2 phase 2 model corroboration we observed that density outputs from landis ii simulations were equivalent for 29 out of the 30 most abundant species table 3 for mean diameter 22 out of the 30 most abundant species fell into the equivalence range landis ii simulations under predicted the mean diameter for abies balsamea ostrya virginiana pinus banksiana and populus tremuloides and over predicted for quercus alba thuja occidentalis tilia americana and tsuga canadensis for basal area 20 out of the 30 most abundant species were equivalent with an epsilon of 0 5 landis ii simulations tended to under estimate basal area the species that fell into this category were abies balsamea ostrya virginiana picea mariana pinus banksiana populus tremuloides and prunus serotina the species whose output was over estimated were pinus resinosa quercus alba thuja occidentalis and tsuga canadensis 3 3 phase 3 parameter calibration from the observed vs predicted scatterplots subplots a b for mean diameter fig 3 we noticed that the diameter growth models for abies balsamea ostrya virginiana and prunus serotina were overpredicting the diameter for trees 12 7 cm dbh the models for pinus banksiana were overpredicted for trees larger or equal than 12 7 cm dbh picea mariana and populus tremuloides were overpredicted across the entire dbh range the mean diameter was underpredicted for tsuga canadensis under 12 7 cm dbh and for quercus alba and thuja occidentalis across the entire diameter range after iterative adjustments all nine calibrated species showed equivalence table 4 the proportional adjustment selected to apply for the next corroboration phase was the one for each species that made the mean bias in the estimator the lowest among the iterative calibration runs 3 4 phase 4 final model validation from subplot group c we observed that application of calibrated parameters for the nine corresponding species table 4 reduced mean bias in the estimator for basal area m2 ha fig 4 top panel in addition despite keeping the parameters for some species unchanged i e non calibrated their respective mean bias was affected by competitive interactions with calibrated species fig 4 bottom panel we observed that the mean bias associated with the estimator for basal area was reduced for nine species by calibration of those nine species five were ultimately equivalent at an epsilon value of 0 5 ostrya virginiana pinus banksiana populus tremuloides prunus serotina and thuja occidentalis table 5 we observed that calibrating one variable i e basal area affected model performance for other variables of interest table 5 for density when running a non calibrated simulation for all species all of the most abundant species were equivalent however when using the calibrated parameters for basal area table 4 four out of the 30 were not equivalent mean diameter had a direct relationship with basal area calibration since the growth curves our calibration focus directly affected mean diameter when looking at the simulation with non calibrated parameters 22 out of the 30 most abundant species were equivalent compared to the 24 equivalent species when using calibrated parameters 4 discussion our study presents a novel and replicable framework to evaluate calibrate and corroborate a landscape simulation model landis ii at a site scale using an extensive equal probability sample from the us national forest inventory i e fia the design based unbiased estimators used to obtain empirical estimates from the publicly available fia data provide a basis for corroboration of a forest landscape model and a consistent source of data for model calibration the novelty in this study emerges from the scale of observation and the pairwise method of comparison the traditional approach for landscape models is to examine concurrence equivalency or bias in aggregated outputs where some sources of error may be obscured by variability in multiple processes occurring across the landscape we performed the iterative calibration and model corroboration using a direct pairwise comparison of simulation outputs and forest inventory data at the plot level our approach can be applied by other researchers to enhance model confidence for a wide breadth of questions such as carbon fire interactions effects of disturbances on forest structure and health and simulation of different forest management scenarios previous corroboration work for landscape simulation models has been conducted for landclim schumacher et al 2004 iland seidl et al 2012 and landis pro duan et al 2021 huang et al 2017 c 2021 luo et al 2014 wang et al 2014 using experimental or observational data over a short timeframe two or three decades similar to that used in this study to corroborate model projections at the species or site level scale corroboration work for other models like treemig lischke et al 2006 and landis ii mckenzie et al 2019 scheller and mladenoff 2004 has relied on limited empirical data available for comparison from these examples wang et al 2014 conducted a corroboration approach most similar to our own in that they applied equivalency tests to the output of a density based succession model landis pro using a time series of forest inventory data their approach differs in two important respects first they used a subset of the inventory data that excluded disturbed plots by using the lu extension to implement establishment and disturbance related mortality we were able to assess the processes of growth and competition mortality within the model compared to a wider range of observed data second their evaluations of model predictions for each species were performed at the aggregated ecoregion level whereas our evaluations were conducted using a pair wise comparison between individual model cells and fia subplots such site level model evaluation is more commonly applied to stand or plot scale models for example glasby et al 2019 applied equivalence tests to evaluate diameter growth relationships simulated by the forest vegetation simulator fvs model crookston and dixon 2005 fvs staff 2021 with a specific focus on the role of disturbance on residual growth we demonstrated that similar logic may be applied to landscape models providing a more rigorous empirical foundation for projections of local processes that can then be scaled to landscapes via their integration with spatially contagious processes such as seed dispersal and disturbances equivalence tests are useful when we expect the differences to be very small and hard to detect therefore the decision of what equivalence threshold to choose is critical lakens et al 2018 proposed several methods for selecting these thresholds based on sample size and effect size of interest the strength of the equivalence tests relies on the null hypothesis of dissimilarity and examines whether effects extreme enough to be considered meaningful can be rejected lakens 2017 in our case we used equivalence tests to capture the small differences expected from evaluating a flm over a short time frame and having most of the model stochastic processes controlled since we were using plot remeasurements we conducted a pairwise comparison analysis for the equivalence tests where data are not treated as independent lakens 2017 we established a 0 5 threshold for determining equivalency as used in robinson et al 2004 and blanco et al 2007 when applying a methodology such as ours to the evaludation procedures that develop confidence in a model the assumptions underlying model design the representation of processes in the model scale and how these factors relate to empirical data are all important factors in our case we focused on parameters underlying age diameter curves as those control how fast a tree grows to determine mean diameter and basal area outputs we selected our cell size to match a subplot size i e scale even so trees smaller than 12 7 cm dbh within fia plots are measured from a smaller area microplot and assumed to be representative of the entire subplot hence discrepancies are anticipated as tree diameters cross the 12 7 cm threshold we therefore assumed that such discrepancies emerge as statistical noise without bias such assumptions would need to be carefully addressed when evaluating model behavior for different resolutions such as the 0 09 ha or 6 25 ha scales consistent with landsat and modis satellite imagery respectively response variables may also be interdependent for example when we calibrated basal area the density of trees was affected because of the way growing space acts in the model table 5 consequently fine tuning equivalence in one variable might result in a loss of equivalence in another variable therefore the primary variable of interest should be chosen in the context of the specific modeling objectives finally the relatively short time span analyzed 20 years compared to the relatively slow processes of tree growth and mortality may be problematic so a longer time span of empirical data is clearly desirable an important benefit of the iterative approach illustrated by fig 2 is that it facilitates better understanding of model process interactions allowing the model user to learn as they explore complicating factors this method allows for learning about the model design application methods and the reference data for example the attribute that we were calibrating was species growth rates age diameter relationship which when applied to the generation of initial communities would create slightly different starting cohort diameters in the initial stage of calibration we had not accounted for this difference but the evaluation brought this to our attention and we integrated this knowledge into the final stage of corroboration these models are complicated and it is difficult to anticipate all of the pertinent interactions another learning example resulted in the improvement of a specific model component application of the stand density based mortality model within density succession had not been previously tested at this spatial scale and the iterative calibration process highlighted the potential for improving the design of a specific function previously the mortality function iterated over cohorts sorted by probability of mortality and removed a proportion of stems within the cohort until the target amount of growing space removed was satisfied when applying our design to cohorts containing a single tree we identified a potential source of bias in the species experiencing mortality this led to a redesign of the looping function to better capture stochasticity within the mortality model while equivalence tests represent a formal statistical method for comparison across models results should still be interpreted with caution rejection of a meaningful effect equivalency does not imply that an effect is not present at all lakens et al 2018 therefore even if our results show equivalency there might still be some patterns in the data e g environmental gradients etc that represent relevant differences furthermore agreement between modeled and empirical data does not always mean that the model is correct but could also be a factor of an over calibration or a combination of incorrect representation of processes and input parameters augusiak et al 2014 therefore researchers should look at the bigger picture such as the plausibility of specific parameter ranges rather than only looking at observed vs predicted values over calibrating parameters can increase the risk of model equivalency for the wrong reasons i e unrealistic parameter combination augusiak et al 2014 one could guard against such over calibration by approaching the data from different angles such as equivalency at species versus ecoregion level e g fitts vargas 2021 it should be noted that we identified two avenues for calibration to do it at the ecoregion level or at the species level for this study we focused on just the species level see fitts vargas 2021 to explore the ecoregion calibration approach however focusing too narrowly on one level can lead to poor behavior elsewhere in the model and should be avoided in addition we noticed feedback between parameters when calibrating similarly when the corroboration process improves one variable s behavior other variables might be affected because of the feedback forest attributes have among each other future work could conduct sensitivity analysis to explore additional parameters to calibrate and corroborate our approach may be adapted to address multiple areas of model uncertainty one might explore the sources of error in this work by grouping plots with other common specific characteristics i e disturbed vs not disturbed where potentially stronger results may be observed within the small timeframe where data is available conducting a sensitivity analysis to explore which model parameters have the most impact during calibration and which contribute the most to confounding other metrics of model performance could be implemented in future work other processes within the density succession extension of landis ii such as species cohort recruitment could be evaluated by enabling the regeneration and establishment components of the model the method is likewise extensible to other geographic regions other model designs or both 5 conclusions while flms hold very real potential to inform land management and other policy decisions their adoption for such purposes can be greatly hampered by a lack of confidence in such models scheller 2018 shifley et al 2017 this issue is not limited to flms but a concern for environmental modeling generally with increasing calls for greater transparency documentation and rigor in model evaludation augusiak et al 2014 here we present a methodology for evaluating calibrating and corroborating landis ii s successional growth algorithms when using its new density succession extension at a site scale this methodology connects empirical data from the us national forest inventory to initialize the landscape corroborate and calibrate the model s parameters this plot cell evaluation of model behavior is a novel approach compared to the traditional way that evaluation corroboration and calibration have been conducted for flm at landscape levels using summary statistics these summary statistics might not capture the whole range of variability and bias the iterative nature of our approach further facilitates learning by the user where such learning can be thoroughly documented to enhance overall model confidence the specific succession extension evaluated by our methodology opens a new window of research and development for landis ii users as density succession is directly compatible with common forest inventory measurements and can therefore be integrated with national inventory data in a relatively seamless fashion as demonstrated here there are several sources of potential error to consider when performing such evaludation efforts these sources of bias or error include the corroboration assumptions and study design the forest inventory sample design the way certain processes are represented in the model particular site characteristics etc moreover calibration can be useful for having the output better match the empirical data but it should be done with caution one reason to be cautious is to avoid over calibration augusiak et al 2014 another reason includes that focusing too narrowly on calibrating at one scale can alter results at another scale i e species vs ecoregions or for another variable of interest therefore it is important to keep in mind the study s main interest for selecting which variable to calibrate and corroborate the cohort characteristics of diameter and density tracked by density succession are commonly recorded measurements of individual trees in forest inventory datasets this provides a set of directly comparable metrics for model calibration and corroboration these cohort characteristics are also frequently used in forest management plans and wildlife habitat models the emergent processes of stand development based on the stand density index competition process leverages established theories of forest stand dynamics that are unique from other landis ii succession extensions the main objective of this paper was to isolate and test specific processes of competition and growth to show how the model is performing by using individual components without interactions we sought to understand the inherent bias augusiak et al 2014 we acknowledge that the interactions between cells are important for the realism of the simulation however that would be a next step given the caveats above our approach is extensible to many flm designs and should help improve the rigor and transparency of their application funding this

24256,wildfire occurrence varies among regions and through time due to the long term impacts of climate on fuel structure and short term impacts on fuel flammability identifying the climatic conditions that trigger extensive fire years at regional scales can enable development of area burned models that are both spatially and temporally robust which is crucial for understanding the impacts of past and future climate change we identified region specific thresholds in fire season aridity that distinguish years with limited moderate and extensive area burned for 11 extensively forested ecoregions in the western united states we developed a new area burned model using these relationships and demonstrate its application in the southern rocky mountains using climate projections from five global climate models gcms that bracket the range of projected changes in aridity we used the aridity thresholds to classify each simulation year as having limited moderate or extensive area burned and defined fire size distributions from historical fire records for these categories we simulated individual fires from a regression relating fire season aridity to the annual number of fires and drew fire sizes from the corresponding fire size distributions we project dramatic increases in area burned after 2020 under most gcms and after 2060 with all gcms as the frequency of extensive fire years increases our adaptable model can readily incorporate new observations e g extreme fire years to directly address the non stationarity of fire climate relationships as climatic conditions diverge from past observations our aridity threshold fire model provides a simple yet spatially robust approach to project regional changes in area burned with broad applicability to

in henne and hawbaker 2023 https doi org 10 5066 p9erj5z4 1 introduction fire is the dominant disturbance in many forested regions of the world and many forest species possess adaptations to survive or regenerate after fire bond et al 2005 bowman et al 2009 however annual area burned increased dramatically in recent years in concert with rising regional temperatures bringing record breaking fire seasons to western north america siberia and australia in 2019 2020 alone and prompting concern that observed and projected climatic changes will further increase fire activity collins et al 2021 higuera and abatzoglou 2021 ponomarev et al 2021 such changes have well documented societal and ecological consequences extensive wildfires produce hazardous air increase spending on fire management and emergency services drive shifts in species abundances and even trigger the replacement of forests with open and shrub dominated ecosystems bowman et al 2017 davis et al 2019 turner 2010 therefore anticipating changes in fire frequency fire size and annual area burned is critical to understanding the societal and ecological risks posed by wildfire annual area burned is a key statistic used to track changes in wildfire activity through time and can be quantitatively linked to the climatic ecological and cultural factors that constrain fire regimes area burned increased in many ecosystems not only during recent drought events but also during warm dry intervals of the past calder et al 2015 higuera et al 2021 marlon et al 2012 westerling et al 2006 which demonstrates an enduring link between climate and fire activity climate has both long and short term impacts on fire activity on annual and longer timescales climate constrains vegetation dynamics and therefore fuel availability including fine fuels and fuel connectivity in the short term climate controls fuel moisture which decreases under dry conditions increasing flammability and fire spread changes in fuel moisture can be tracked using aridity indices including water balance or fire danger metrics that synthesize the interactions among temperature precipitation and soil water littell et al 2016 although fuel moisture is an important driver of annual variability in area burned the specific climatic conditions that engender extensive fire years vary among ecosystems and vegetation types and are affected by disturbance and management histories littell et al 2009 westerling et al 2003 nonetheless recent analyses demonstrated significant correlations between aridity indices and area burned at monthly to annual scales abatzoglou and kolden 2013 williams et al 2015 furthermore exponential increases in area burned have been reported in many forested regions when fire season aridity exceeds a threshold henne et al 2021 pausas and paula 2012 young et al 2017 fire models provide a means to understand the drivers of past variation in area burned and anticipate future change models operate at varying scales of area and complexity with associated tradeoffs in realism and computational intensity statistical and machine learning models relate one or more predictor variables to fire regime components at pixel regional and subcontinental scales jain et al 2020 xi et al 2019 although input variables differ among models those relying on aridity indices as a proxy for fuel moisture often show similar performance as models that rely on multiple predictors higuera et al 2015 williams et al 2015 combined statistical models can simulate both ignition numbers and fire sizes westerling et al 2011 that can be applied to or integrated with landscape vegetation models to investigate wildfire impacts on vegetation dynamics although landscape models are often calibrated with historical fire return intervals or observed fire size distributions he and mladenoff 1999 ignition probabilities and fire size distributions may also be related to climatic parameters to project climate change impacts henne et al 2021 liang et al 2017 more data intensive approaches incorporate landscape and fuel specific data for example models that predict fire spread based on fuel characteristics and topography can use spatially explicit information to understand fire risks across landscapes finney et al 2011 liu et al 2015 sleeter et al 2015 while such models can apply empirical fire behavior data they can require extensive calibration demand detailed information about fuel composition and condition over time and may have unrealistic assumptions about fuel behavior when applied to novel settings at regional to global scales dynamic global vegetation models dgvms use observed relationships among fuel moisture fire season length and burned area or processed based estimations of fire ignition and spread e g thonicke et al 2001 li et al 2012 however large differences exist among models in the representation of processes that constrain burned area and additional model complexity does not necessarily improve model performance which can vary regionally hantsen et al 2016 despite the extensive efforts to simulate fires and area burned there remains a need for computationally efficient fire models that can easily integrate with simulation models incorporate recent patterns of fire occurrence and allow for rapid assessment of future potential changes in fire occurrence here we investigate relationships among fire season aridity the annual number of fires and annual area burned in 11 extensively forested ecoregions of the western united states fig 1 we focus on extensively forested ecoregions because of their known sensitivity to annual variations in fire season aridity relative to non forested ecoregions littell et al 2018 for each ecoregion we identify significant relationships between fire season aridity and the annual number of fires and thresholds in fire season aridity that separate years with significant differences in area burned we use these ecoregion specific data to develop a model that uses aridity thresholds to project climate driven changes in the number of fires generates fire sizes and calculates annual area burned in a final step we apply the model to simulate climate driven changes in annual area burned in the southern rocky mountains ecoregion using climate projections for 2021 2100 2 methods 2 1 quantifying annual area burned and fire season climatic water deficit fscwd for 1980 2020 we investigated relationships among seasonal drought the annual number of large fires and annual area burned in 11 extensively forested ecoregions in the western united states fig 1 we used ecoregions defined by national land cover database nlcd mapping zones as our unit of analysis homer et al 2015 vegetation ranges from alpine tundra to subalpine and montane forests open woodlands sagebrush steppe and semiarid grasslands in these mountainous ecoregions we compiled annual area burned records for each ecoregion from 1980 2020 see supporting information we calculated monthly climatic water deficit cwd stephenson 1998 as a proxy for fuel aridity at the ecoregion scale defined as the difference between potential evapotranspiration pet and actual evapotranspiration aet cwd quantifies evaporative demand unmet by soil water we used reference evapotranspiration eto asce penman montieth abatzoglou 2013 to represent pet and estimated monthly aet with the soil water balance model used by the landis ii forest landscape model necn extension scheller et al 2021 see supporting information we summarized monthly cwd and area burned at the ecoregion level we used the same fire season for all ecoregions defined as the months that captured 95 of area burned for the entire study region then summed monthly cwd values to assign an annual fire season cwd fscwd for 1980 2020 to each ecoregion this resulted in annual values for fscwd and area burned for each ecoregion 2 2 relationships between fire season aridity the annual number of large fires and area burned whereas most fires in western north america are small i e 1 ha large fires account for most area burned short 2021 we analyzed only large fires defined as those fires that cumulatively contributed 99 of total burned area in each ecoregion from 1980 2020 by identifying separate large fire size thresholds for each ecoregion for each ecoregion we fit a linear regression between the fscwd and the annual number of large fires using all 41 years of the calibration period we also fit 41 separate regressions using 40 years of data as part of a leave one year out analysis annual area burned does not increase linearly with aridity in extensively forested ecoregions of western north america instead area burned tends to be extensive when fuel aridity exceeds quantifiable aridity thresholds at and limited or moderate in fire seasons that do not exceed these thresholds we identified ats for each ecoregion by relating annual area burned to fscwd using conditional inference trees hothorn et al 2006 to separate years into either two or three area burned categories limited moderate and extensive or moderate and extensive see supplemental information for each ecoregion we identified ats with all 41 years of the calibration period and with 40 years of data by leaving out each year once as part of a leave one year out analysis 2 3 applying aridity thresholds to simulate climate change impacts on area burned we evaluated model performance by simulating annual area burned in each ecoregion from 1980 to 2020 using historical climate we first used the linear regressions to predict the annual number of large fires to represent variability we randomly selected the number of fires from a normal distribution defined by the regression s predicted value and standard error to determine the size of each fire we fit separate fire size distributions to the groups of years defined with the ats as being limited moderate or extensive fire years we fit both lognormal and pareto distribution functions both of which produce long tailed distributions suitable for representing our data where a small number of very large fires account for most area burned holmes et al 2008 with the fitdistrplus package in r delignette muller and dutang 2015 r core team 2022 we then drew random fire sizes from the limited moderate or extensive fire size distributions depending on the value of the annual fscwd relative to the lower and upper ats and summed the area of all simulated fires for each year for each ecoregion we generated 1000 41 year simulations from the full and leave one year out datasets we assessed model performance by calculating three metrics that compare observed to simulated area burned root mean square error standardized by the standard deviation of annual area burned rmse sd mean error and pearson s correlation rmse measures accuracy and dividing by the standard deviation of observed annual area burned allows comparison among ecoregions smaller values indicate greater model skill littell et al 2009 we used mean error as a measure of bias indicating simulations that over or underestimate area burned relative to observations the coefficient of determination r2 measures how well year to year variability in the predictions follow observations for the calibration period we tested for temporal autocorrelation in the residuals of the modeled number of large fires and annual area burned with the acf function in r and plotted the distributions of residuals through time for all ecoregions and models to examine shifting biases in predictions to demonstrate how our modeling approach can be used to make projections we simulated area burned under changing future climate for the southern rocky mountains using the area burned model fit with all 41 years from the calibration period we obtained temperature precipitation and reference evapotranspiration eto data from the period 1980 2100 for 13 global climate models gcms under the rcp 8 5 emissions scenario that were downscaled to a 4 km grid using multivariate adapted construction analogues maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 we calculated gcm fscwd as described above then ranked the 13 gcms by fscwd from 2020 2100 and selected 5 gcms that represented the full range of projected aridity i e the minimum 1st quartile median 3rd quartile and maximum fscwd henne and hawbaker 2023 3 results we set a fire season for our analyses of may october during which most fires 96 and area burned 97 were recorded in the 11 ecoregions within this fire season the threshold for large fires that contributed 99 of area burned varied among ecoregions from 10 ha in the utah high plateaus to 80 ha in the middle rocky mountains and oregon coastal range table 1 we found significant p 0 01 positive linear relationships between fscwd and the number of large fires in all ecoregions however the strength of the correlations varied table 1 ecoregions with a strong positive correlation e g middle rocky mountains r2 0 69 had large interannual variation in the number of large fires figs 2 a and s1 indicating a greater importance of fire season climate as a determinant for the number of large fires in ecoregions with a lower correlation multiple large fires occurred in most years e g sierra nevada range r2 0 18 we identified ats that distinguish years with significant differences in annual area burned for all ecoregions table 1 figs 2b and s2 two ecoregions the oregon and california coastal ranges have one significant p 0 05 at we identified two significant ats in the remaining ecoregions a lower threshold at1 distinguishes years with limited and moderate area burned and an upper threshold at2 separates years with moderate and extensive area burned table 1 figure s2 for example in the southern rocky mountains 30 years had limited mean 7979 ha 7 years had moderate mean 32 652 ha and 4 years had extensive mean 169 993 ha area burned all three divisions had a large number of fires to fit fire size distributions there were 634 fires in the limited area burned years 255 fires in the moderate area burned years and 251 fires in the extensive area burned years mean fire sizes in limited moderate and extensive fire years varied among ecoregions in the sierra nevada range and mogollon rim where very large fires occurred in even wetter than average years mean area burned was 22 000 ha during limited fire years in contrast in the rocky mountain ecoregions i e northwestern northern middle and southern rocky mountains wet years dampened the number and size of fires and limited fire years all averaged 8000 ha range of 502 7979 ha the leave one year out analysis identified at least one alternate at in all ecoregions in most ecoregions these alternate splits did not cause a major change in the number of years classified as limited moderate or extensive indicating most individual years had no impact on the position of ats figs 2b s2 however in four ecoregions where area burned in a single year greatly exceeded area burned in all other years i e the northern california coastal cascades and sierra nevada ranges in 2020 and the middle rocky mountains in 1988 removing the extreme fire year strongly affected the ats the southern rocky mountains ecoregion provides an important contrast there 2020 had both the highest observed fscwd and area burned however extreme fire years in 2002 and 2018 with a similarly high fscwd fig 2 meant that omitting 2020 did not shift the ats 3 1 burned area simulations for 1980 2020 observed fire size distributions for limited moderate and extensive fire years were not significantly different p 0 05 cramer von mises test from the fitted lognormal and pareto distributions in any ecoregion when calculated with all years because we used a random sample of observed fire sizes for the cramer von mises tests statistical distributions estimated for some years in the leave one year out analysis were significantly different from the subset of observed fire sizes however on average observed fire size distributions for limited moderate and extensive fire years were also not significantly different from the lognormal and pareto distributions for the leave one year out analysis for all ecoregions simulated area burned tracked observed interannual variation in area burned for all ecoregions during the calibration period figs 3 and s3 henne and hawbaker 2023 residuals for the mean simulated number of fires showed no significant autocorrelation in all ecoregions for most of the 1000 simulations for models calibrated with the full data set and models for the leave one year out analysis figure s4 likewise residuals of area burned simulated with lognormal and pareto distributions were not autocorrelated for most replicates in all ecoregions with models trained with all years or the leave one year out analysis figure s5 correlations between the mean simulated and observed annual area burned were significant in all ecoregions when models were trained using all years p value 0 05 and r2 ranged between 0 48 and 0 74 table s1 the type of fire size distribution lognormal or pareto had little influence on r2 values the largest difference was in the utah high plateaus 0 07 difference however individual years had a large influence on the correlation correlations were not significant in the leave one year out analysis for the sierra nevada range and cascades mountain range whereas correlations remained significant for all other ecoregions r2 was consistently lower i e 0 09 0 22 decrease simulations with pareto fire size distributions better captured the observed range in area burned than simulations with lognormal distributions table s1 with lognormal distributions observed area burned fell within the simulation range between 37 and 41 years in the different ecoregions figs 3 and s3 table s1 most years with observed area burned outside the simulation range were underestimates of area burned for extensive fire years e g 2020 in the sierra nevada range overestimates occurred in one year in the northern cascades range and two years in the middle rocky mountains figure s3 because we assumed a minimum of one large fire in every year this assumption is broadly consistent with fire records no years lacked a recorded fire and years without a large fire occurred in only the northern cascades two years northern rocky mountains one year and middle rocky mountains three years with pareto fire size distributions observed area burned was less than the simulated maximum in all ecoregions and all years for models trained with the full dataset but fell outside the simulation range with pareto distributions in 2017 for the oregon coastal range and 2020 for the sierra nevada range in the leave one year out analysis negative mean error values for all ecoregions indicate that fire simulations drawn from lognormal distributions generally underestimated total area burned mean error ranged from 66 to 15 for models trained with all years and from 66 to 14 for the leave one year out models table s1 drawing fire sizes from pareto distributions which include a higher probability of very large events resulted in more simulated area burned with pareto distributions mean error ranged from 44 to 47 when all years were considered and 41 to 50 with the leave one year out analysis in most ecoregions mean error was generally closer to zero with pareto distributions time series of residuals show that model errors were not significantly different between models calibrated with all years and the leave one year out analysis figures s6 s7 however residuals were generally larger after 2000 when conditions generally became drier in the western us and observed area burned increased williams et al 2020 mccabe and wolock 2021 simulations with fire sizes drawn from pareto distributions had higher rmse sd than those drawn from lognormal distributions indicating lesser skill and wider dispersion of the simulation results table s1 model skill was highest in the southern rocky mountains with lognormal distributions rmse sd 0 75 models using pareto distributions showed moderate skill in the southern rocky mountains rmse sd 0 85 and a small sensitivity to individual years rmse sd 0 89 for the leave one year out analysis 3 2 area burned projections for the southern rocky mountains we selected five gcms that span the range in fscwd projected by the cmip5 models for the period 2021 2099 henne and hawbaker 2023 and used annual fscwd from these gcms to simulate annual area burned observed fscwd was on average higher i e drier than gcm fscwd from 1981 2020 especially after 2000 most years were classified as limited fire years in the historical 28 years and gcm data 31 35 years however four years 2002 2012 2018 and 2020 had drier fire seasons than all but one year in the five gcms the historical data also had more moderate fire years six than the gcms which ranged from two to five years the gcm with the lowest fscwd cnrm cm5 had one extensive fire year during the historical period hadgem2 with the highest fscwd had five and the remaining models three relatively low gcm fscwd during the historical period figs 4 and 5 may mean that the gcms also underestimate fscwd in the coming decades separation among the gcms and historical climate is evident after 2020 figs 4 5 from 2021 2060 the relatively moist cnrm cm5 does not project drier fire seasons than the historical record in contrast ipsl cm5b ccsm4 and bcc csm1 which rank as the 1st quartile median and 3rd quartile of fscwd all have 10 moderate fire seasons but 3 10 and 11 extensive years hadgem2 has six moderate and 25 extensive fire years in this same interval during the final 40 years from 2060 2099 most years are either moderate or extensive fire years for all gcms the two wettest gcms cnrm cm5 ipsl cm5b maintained 14 limited fire years and nine and 11 moderate fire years respectively most years are extensive fire years in the drier gcms ccsm4 has 25 bcc csm1 30 and hadgem2 37 extensive fire years the frequency of extensive fire years may provide an important marker for changing fire climate relationships for the southern rocky mountains the timing of such a shift varies among gcms under the extreme hadgem2 average fscwd exceeds the upper at after 2038 i e 10 year moving average fscwd at2 figs 4a and 5a the average fscwd fluctuates near at2 after 2050 with bcc csm1 and remains above at2 after the 2080s average fscwd also remains above at2 during the 2080s but does not exceed at2 until the 2090s with the wetter cnrm cm5 and ipsl cm5b gcms we summarized simulated area burned for the three 40 year periods with the median range and interquartile range to help visualize and compare long term trends relative to the calibration period fig 6 observed area burned in the southern rocky mountains from 1981 2020 exceeded the range of area burned simulated with observed climate and lognormal distributions however one year i e 2020 had a major impact on this offset in contrast observed area burned fell within the interquartile range of simulations using pareto distributions median simulated area burned was lower than observations for the historical period with all gcms with lognormal 49 76 and pareto 23 60 distributions which was not surprising given that both the mean fscwd and frequencies of moderate and extreme fire years are lower in the gcms simulated area burned increased in all gcms during the period 2021 2060 fig 6 median area burned simulated with lognormal distributions remained below observed area burned from 1981 2020 for the two wettest scenarios cnrm cm5 65 and ipsl cm5b 47 was slightly higher for ccsm4 2 and bcc csm1 3 and about double 101 for hadgem2 the driest gcm for hadgem2 the frequency of extreme fire years increased markedly after 2040 fig 4 with pareto distributions the median simulated area burned for cnrm cm5 and ipsl sm5b from 2021 2060 was lower than observed from 1981 2020 by 44 and 18 but much higher with ccsm4 47 bcc csm1 49 and hadgem2 174 during the final 40 years of simulations the increase in median simulated area burned relative to observed area burned in 1981 2020 ranged from 33 246 with lognormal distributions and 94 360 with pareto distributions fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 aridity thresholds for limited moderate and extensive fire years fire season climatic water deficit fscwd effectively distinguishes years with limited moderate and extensive area burned in extensively forested ecoregions with variable land cover and climate water deficit metrics like fscwd are robust predictors of annual area burned in forested regions because they integrate multiple factors that constrain fuel moisture e g temperature precipitation insolation soils although our burned area model relies on a single water deficit metric we achieve similar predictive skill at the ecoregion scale as more complex models that integrate multiple variables littell et al 2018 2009 fscwd also increases with fire season length a critical driver of recent increases in area burned westerling et al 2006 because it sums monthly water deficits over a period that exceeds the typical fire season through much of our study area aridity thresholds link area burned to fire season water balance at the regional scale however flammability also varies within regions at finer scales warm dry topographic settings e g lower elevations south facing slopes may experience flammable conditions during a typical year while adjacent north facing slopes and upper elevations remain relatively moist dillon et al 2011 topographic position similarly affects productivity and therefore fuel loads kane et al 2015 rollins et al 2002 intraregional variation in fuel moisture and availability may explain the occurrence of two aridity thresholds in the ecoregions considered here which include complex mountainous terrain in ecoregions with two ats flammable conditions are very unlikely at both local and regional scales during years with limited burning i e fscwd at1 for example in the southern rocky mountains mean area burned is 7979 ha when fscwd at1 probably because moist conditions limited fire spread through much of the ecoregion in contrast during years with moderate area burned i e at1 fscwd at2 mean area burned is 32 652 ha and it is likely that the driest landscapes e g submontane forests and grasslands at lower elevations or southerly aspects become flammable years with extensive area burned mean area burned 169 993 ha occur when regional climate overwhelms local heterogeneity in fuel moisture and fires readily spread in even typically moist settings e g subalpine forests at high elevations and on northerly aspects extensive burning tends to coincide with high severity fires in forests of the western united states dillon et al 2011 parks and abatzoglou 2020 which indicates that typically moist settings with higher fuel loads become flammable because we averaged aridity at the ecoregion scale our ats may identify fire seasons where a critical proportion of the landscape becomes flammable thus during extensive fire years fires readily spread among stands with distinct topographic settings and heterogeneous fuel moisture levels that in wetter years could restrict fire spread 4 2 influences on model performance model performance varied among ecoregions and with the choice of fire size distribution type area burned models for ecoregions in the rocky mountains showed the highest skill and strongest correlations with observations table s1 in these ecoregions interannual variation in fuel moisture exerts the strongest control on fire activity littell et al 2018 fine fuel availability can limit fire spread locally e g in submontane pinus ponderosa forests however at higher elevations in the rocky mountains extensive subalpine forests have abundant well connected fuels that support high severity fire regimes and fire spread is limited primarily by fuel moisture sherriff and veblen 2008 in contrast in the mogollon rim where dry conditions and large fires are typical in most years low model skill table s1 may relate to the importance of fine fuel limitations on fire activity and also reflect the lack of distinction among fires with differing severities in our model woodlands and submontane forests with relatively open canopies and grassy understories are typical of the mogollon rim hurteau et al 2014 therefore climatic factors that control interannual variation in fine fuel availability especially antecedent moisture may be needed in combination with current year aridity to more effectively predict variations in area burned in ecoregions like the mogollon rim swetnam and betancourt 1990 extreme fire years affected the position of ats and model skill in some ecoregions for example leaving out 2020 from the sierra nevada and cascades ranges resulted in non significant correlations between simulated and observed area burned over the 41 year calibration period and large reductions in model skill thus our leave one year out models did not capture area burned in years when area burned vastly exceeded all previous observations similar situations may develop in other ecoregions where extreme fire years that greatly exceeded previously observed area burned did not occur during the calibration period for example in the highly productive forests of the northern cascades and oregon coastal range average area burned is lower than other ecoregions which may affect model fit and performance extensive burning in these ecoregions is highly episodic and smaller fires exhibit weak climatic control colombaroli and gavin 2010 therefore the inclusion of more years especially with extreme area burned may be necessary to precisely define ats that identify extensive fire years in contrast multiple extreme fire years that can help characterize fire activity under extremely dry conditions occurred during the calibration period in the southern rocky mountains fig 2 ultimately while extreme fire years may shift ats inclusion of such years may be critical to identifying fire season analogues for a warmer and drier future the value of accurately depicting annual versus decadal scale variations is an important consideration when selecting statistical distributions for area burned models pareto distributions better captured rare extreme events that dominate area burned on decadal scales in the western united states lognormal distributions more effectively reproduced interannual variability as demonstrated by higher model skill but are more likely to miss extreme fire events that can dominate ecological processes for decades this difference results from the higher probability of rare extreme events i e very large fires with pareto distributions and the resulting wider range of simulated area burned in our simulation replicates holmes et al 2008 the statistical distribution that best characterizes fire size distributions may also change through time li and banerjee 2021 for example pareto distributions may better approximate fire sizes as the proportion of area burned incurred during extreme fire events increases in a warming climate as is likely in ecosystems with flammability limited fire regimes williams et al 2019 changes in fuel availability and fire suppression policies and or efficacy may affect the long term stability of ats by changing relationships between fire spread and climate higuera et al 2015 taylor et al 2016 in several ecoregions with increasing trends in area burned during the calibration period e g sierra nevada range mogollon rim southern rocky mountains we overestimated area burned during the 1980s and or 1990s but underestimated during the 2020s figs 3 and s3 observed increases in area burned relate in part to increasing temperatures and fuel aridity between these intervals abatzoglou and williams 2016 however model performance may have also been affected by the changing success of fire suppression in these decades that is fire suppression limited area burned during the relatively moist 1980s but was less successful during the historically dry 2010s as the number of days and amount of area experiencing extreme fire danger increased abatzoglou et al 2021b changes in fire suppression policies may also have had a modest effect on our results after 2009 fire managers were granted greater flexibility to allow some fires to burn especially in wilderness areas which may have also contributed to our underestimate of area burned in the rocky mountains and mogollon rim in the 2010s young et al 2020 4 3 implications from the southern rocky mountains for projecting area burned in a warming climate our threshold approach does not extrapolate beyond observed climate fire relationships to project area burned in a warming climate although we calibrated our model with recent fire years we identified ats that distinguish significant differences in annual area burned and draw fire sizes from distributions defined by these thresholds therefore median area burned in our simulations approaches the maximum of past observed annual area burned figs 4 and 5 nonetheless because fire sizes are generated randomly maximum simulated area burned can exceed maximum observed area burned especially as the number of large fires increases with fscwd figs 2 and 3 furthermore decadal area burned can also exceed observations as the frequency of extensive fire years i e fscwd at2 increases a key challenge for projecting area burned in a warmer and drier future is that fire climate relationships change through time they are non stationary gavin et al 2007 mckenzie and littell 2017 for example climate was a stronger predictor of area burned during recent decades than during the mid 20th century for many ecoregions in the western united states higuera et al 2015 littell et al 2009 thus area burned models developed for one period can over or underpredict fire when applied to novel climate conditions vegetation change is an important driver of non stationarity changing climate and disturbance regimes can alter fuel accumulation decomposition and structure which affects fire spread and ultimately area burned batllori et al 2013 matthews et al 2012 parks et al 2018 consequently as with other models our simulations become less reliable as the frequency of extensive fire years increases and climate departs from the historical range of variation under which our models were trained littell et al 2018 westerling et al 2011 especially if interactions between wildfires and drought stress alter forest regeneration davis et al 2019 littell et al 2018 concluded that simulated fire rotations for an ecoregion that are shorter than the calibration period of a statistical area burned model violate the assumption that future vegetation will resemble historical vegetation and therefore support a similar fire climate relationship similar inferences can be made from our approach once most years pass the threshold for extensive area burned it is unlikely that vegetation will support the fire climate relationships observed during the calibration period for the southern rocky mountains the timing of such a shift varies among gcms from after 2038 under the extreme hadgem2 but not until the 2090s with the wetter cnrm cm5 and ipsl cm5b gcms figs 4a 5a thus although we project major increases in area burned under all gcms fig 6 the timing of departure from observed fire climate relationships will likely depend on changes in future precipitation regimes which have higher uncertainty than temperature projections woldemeskel et al 2016 statistical area burned models can attenuate projected area burned in a warming climate to account for vegetation feedbacks to fire climate relationships abatzoglou et al 2021a turco et al 2018 however calibrating vegetation feedbacks in area burned simulations is nontrivial because the specific impacts of vegetation change on fire regimes vary among forest types and ecoregions gavin et al 2007 tepley et al 2018 in projections of area burned for the western united states abatzoglou et al 2021a limited area burned in a warming climate following the assumptions that fire fuel feedbacks diminish the forest area capable of carrying subsequent fires and that fuel limitations can diminish through time these authors concluded that fuel availability will impart only a modest limitation on forest area burned through the mid century relative to climate driven increases in flammability climate change and fire activity can also have positive feedbacks on area burned climate and fire driven shifts that reduce tree density or trigger forest to shrubland or grassland conversion can increase fine fuel availability and promote short interval burning even if fire intensity is reduced coop et al 2020 tepley et al 2018 therefore assumptions that fire activity and or warming will limit future area burned are not always justified and in projecting area burned the range of gcm uncertainty may be greater than uncertainty in changes to fire climate feedbacks turco et al 2018 one way to address the shortcomings of purely statistical modeling approaches is to couple statistical models with landscape simulation models in this approach the statistical model would provide regional targets to the landscape simulation model for area burned or fire size distributions that change with future weather and climate conditions however the landscape simulation model would determine the actual area burned accounting for spatial variability in biomass and how that variability was altered by past fires and other disturbances we have used this approach coupling our aridity threshold fire model with the landis ii forest landscape model which tracks fire spread across landscapes in addition to species establishment growth rates and biomass levels henne et al 2021 future efforts could also dynamically adjust aridity thresholds to depict climatically driven changes in fuel for example pausas and paula 2012 found a positive linear relationship between aridity thresholds and productivity among 13 regions in spain that could be applied to dynamically adjust aridity thresholds in a changing climate 5 conclusions our aridity threshold fire model relates the annual number and size of wildfires to fire season aridity to simulate climate driven changes in annual area burned at the ecoregion scale by applying thresholds in area burned our model projects abrupt changes in annual area burned that result as the frequency of extreme fire seasons increases with major increases after 2020 for most gcms and all gcms after 2060 because our model requires limited inputs it can be readily updated to incorporate recent observations and the knowledge gained from future extreme fire years such adaptability may be critical in the western united states and other regions where climatic conditions and fire regimes are rapidly diverging from past observations higuera and abatzoglou 2021 but also allows application of our model at broader scales our statistical model is robust enough to be used on its own to project the timing of major changes in annual area burned but also applicable to models that directly simulate feedbacks among climate vegetation land use and fire for example forest landscape models henne et al 2021 or state and transition models sleeter et al 2015 marchal et al 2020 that require ignition counts and fire size distributions to simulate wildfire which our at model produces similarly we provide a low complexity alternative for fire enabled dgvms hantsen et al 2016 that directly calibrates thresholds in fire season moisture and makes few assumptions about fire spread development of empirical relationships between climatic thresholds for extensive fire years over gradients in productivity and aridity could further the applicability of our approach to global fire models pausas and paula 2012 credit author statement for an aridity threshold model of fire sizes and annual area burned in extensively

24256,wildfire occurrence varies among regions and through time due to the long term impacts of climate on fuel structure and short term impacts on fuel flammability identifying the climatic conditions that trigger extensive fire years at regional scales can enable development of area burned models that are both spatially and temporally robust which is crucial for understanding the impacts of past and future climate change we identified region specific thresholds in fire season aridity that distinguish years with limited moderate and extensive area burned for 11 extensively forested ecoregions in the western united states we developed a new area burned model using these relationships and demonstrate its application in the southern rocky mountains using climate projections from five global climate models gcms that bracket the range of projected changes in aridity we used the aridity thresholds to classify each simulation year as having limited moderate or extensive area burned and defined fire size distributions from historical fire records for these categories we simulated individual fires from a regression relating fire season aridity to the annual number of fires and drew fire sizes from the corresponding fire size distributions we project dramatic increases in area burned after 2020 under most gcms and after 2060 with all gcms as the frequency of extensive fire years increases our adaptable model can readily incorporate new observations e g extreme fire years to directly address the non stationarity of fire climate relationships as climatic conditions diverge from past observations our aridity threshold fire model provides a simple yet spatially robust approach to project regional changes in area burned with broad applicability to

in henne and hawbaker 2023 https doi org 10 5066 p9erj5z4 1 introduction fire is the dominant disturbance in many forested regions of the world and many forest species possess adaptations to survive or regenerate after fire bond et al 2005 bowman et al 2009 however annual area burned increased dramatically in recent years in concert with rising regional temperatures bringing record breaking fire seasons to western north america siberia and australia in 2019 2020 alone and prompting concern that observed and projected climatic changes will further increase fire activity collins et al 2021 higuera and abatzoglou 2021 ponomarev et al 2021 such changes have well documented societal and ecological consequences extensive wildfires produce hazardous air increase spending on fire management and emergency services drive shifts in species abundances and even trigger the replacement of forests with open and shrub dominated ecosystems bowman et al 2017 davis et al 2019 turner 2010 therefore anticipating changes in fire frequency fire size and annual area burned is critical to understanding the societal and ecological risks posed by wildfire annual area burned is a key statistic used to track changes in wildfire activity through time and can be quantitatively linked to the climatic ecological and cultural factors that constrain fire regimes area burned increased in many ecosystems not only during recent drought events but also during warm dry intervals of the past calder et al 2015 higuera et al 2021 marlon et al 2012 westerling et al 2006 which demonstrates an enduring link between climate and fire activity climate has both long and short term impacts on fire activity on annual and longer timescales climate constrains vegetation dynamics and therefore fuel availability including fine fuels and fuel connectivity in the short term climate controls fuel moisture which decreases under dry conditions increasing flammability and fire spread changes in fuel moisture can be tracked using aridity indices including water balance or fire danger metrics that synthesize the interactions among temperature precipitation and soil water littell et al 2016 although fuel moisture is an important driver of annual variability in area burned the specific climatic conditions that engender extensive fire years vary among ecosystems and vegetation types and are affected by disturbance and management histories littell et al 2009 westerling et al 2003 nonetheless recent analyses demonstrated significant correlations between aridity indices and area burned at monthly to annual scales abatzoglou and kolden 2013 williams et al 2015 furthermore exponential increases in area burned have been reported in many forested regions when fire season aridity exceeds a threshold henne et al 2021 pausas and paula 2012 young et al 2017 fire models provide a means to understand the drivers of past variation in area burned and anticipate future change models operate at varying scales of area and complexity with associated tradeoffs in realism and computational intensity statistical and machine learning models relate one or more predictor variables to fire regime components at pixel regional and subcontinental scales jain et al 2020 xi et al 2019 although input variables differ among models those relying on aridity indices as a proxy for fuel moisture often show similar performance as models that rely on multiple predictors higuera et al 2015 williams et al 2015 combined statistical models can simulate both ignition numbers and fire sizes westerling et al 2011 that can be applied to or integrated with landscape vegetation models to investigate wildfire impacts on vegetation dynamics although landscape models are often calibrated with historical fire return intervals or observed fire size distributions he and mladenoff 1999 ignition probabilities and fire size distributions may also be related to climatic parameters to project climate change impacts henne et al 2021 liang et al 2017 more data intensive approaches incorporate landscape and fuel specific data for example models that predict fire spread based on fuel characteristics and topography can use spatially explicit information to understand fire risks across landscapes finney et al 2011 liu et al 2015 sleeter et al 2015 while such models can apply empirical fire behavior data they can require extensive calibration demand detailed information about fuel composition and condition over time and may have unrealistic assumptions about fuel behavior when applied to novel settings at regional to global scales dynamic global vegetation models dgvms use observed relationships among fuel moisture fire season length and burned area or processed based estimations of fire ignition and spread e g thonicke et al 2001 li et al 2012 however large differences exist among models in the representation of processes that constrain burned area and additional model complexity does not necessarily improve model performance which can vary regionally hantsen et al 2016 despite the extensive efforts to simulate fires and area burned there remains a need for computationally efficient fire models that can easily integrate with simulation models incorporate recent patterns of fire occurrence and allow for rapid assessment of future potential changes in fire occurrence here we investigate relationships among fire season aridity the annual number of fires and annual area burned in 11 extensively forested ecoregions of the western united states fig 1 we focus on extensively forested ecoregions because of their known sensitivity to annual variations in fire season aridity relative to non forested ecoregions littell et al 2018 for each ecoregion we identify significant relationships between fire season aridity and the annual number of fires and thresholds in fire season aridity that separate years with significant differences in area burned we use these ecoregion specific data to develop a model that uses aridity thresholds to project climate driven changes in the number of fires generates fire sizes and calculates annual area burned in a final step we apply the model to simulate climate driven changes in annual area burned in the southern rocky mountains ecoregion using climate projections for 2021 2100 2 methods 2 1 quantifying annual area burned and fire season climatic water deficit fscwd for 1980 2020 we investigated relationships among seasonal drought the annual number of large fires and annual area burned in 11 extensively forested

monthly cwd and area burned at the ecoregion level we used the same fire season for all ecoregions defined as the months that captured 95 of area burned for the entire study region then summed monthly cwd values to assign an annual fire season cwd fscwd for 1980 2020 to each ecoregion this resulted in annual values for fscwd and area burned for each ecoregion 2 2 relationships between fire season aridity the annual number of large fires and area burned whereas most fires in western north america are small i e 1 ha large fires account for most area burned short 2021 we analyzed only large fires defined as those fires that cumulatively contributed 99 of total burned area in each ecoregion from 1980 2020 by identifying separate large fire size thresholds for each ecoregion for each ecoregion we fit a linear regression between the fscwd and the annual number of large fires using all 41 years of the calibration period we also fit 41 separate regressions using 40 years of data as part of a leave one year out analysis annual area burned does not increase linearly with aridity in extensively forested ecoregions of western north america instead area burned tends to be extensive when fuel aridity exceeds quantifiable aridity thresholds at and limited or moderate in fire seasons that do not exceed these thresholds we identified ats for each ecoregion by relating annual area burned to fscwd using conditional inference trees hothorn et al 2006 to separate years into either two or three area burned categories limited moderate and extensive or moderate and extensive see supplemental information for each ecoregion we identified ats with all 41 years of the calibration period and with 40 years of data by leaving out each year once as part of a leave one year out analysis 2 3 applying aridity thresholds to simulate climate change impacts on area burned we evaluated model performance by simulating annual area burned in each ecoregion from 1980 to 2020 using historical climate we first used the linear regressions to predict the annual number of large fires to represent variability we randomly selected the number of fires from a normal distribution defined by the regression s predicted value and standard error to determine the size of each fire we fit separate fire size distributions to the groups of years defined with the ats as being limited moderate or extensive fire years we fit both lognormal and pareto distribution functions both of which produce long tailed distributions suitable for representing our data where a small number of very large fires account for most area burned holmes et al 2008 with the fitdistrplus package in r delignette muller and dutang 2015 r core team 2022 we then drew random fire sizes from the limited moderate or extensive fire size distributions depending on the value of the annual fscwd relative to the lower and upper ats and summed the area of all simulated fires for each year for each ecoregion we generated 1000 41 year simulations from the full and leave one year out datasets we assessed model performance by calculating three metrics that compare observed to simulated area burned root mean square error standardized by the standard deviation of annual area burned rmse sd mean error and pearson s correlation rmse measures accuracy and dividing by the standard deviation of observed annual area burned allows comparison among ecoregions smaller values indicate greater model skill littell et al 2009 we used mean error as a measure of bias indicating simulations that over or underestimate area burned relative to observations the coefficient of determination r2 measures how well year to year variability in the predictions follow observations for the calibration period we tested for temporal autocorrelation in the residuals of the modeled number of large fires and annual area burned with the acf function in r and plotted the distributions of residuals through time for all ecoregions and models to examine shifting biases in predictions to demonstrate how our modeling approach can be used to make projections we simulated area burned under changing future climate for the southern rocky mountains using the area burned model fit with all 41 years from the calibration period we obtained temperature precipitation and reference evapotranspiration eto data from the period 1980 2100 for 13 global climate models gcms under the rcp 8 5 emissions scenario that were downscaled to a 4 km grid using multivariate adapted construction analogues maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 we calculated gcm fscwd as described above then ranked the 13 gcms by fscwd from 2020 2100 and selected 5 gcms that represented the full range of projected aridity i e the minimum 1st quartile median 3rd quartile and maximum fscwd henne and hawbaker 2023 3 results we set a fire season for our analyses of may october during which most fires 96 and area burned 97 were recorded in the 11 ecoregions within this fire season the threshold for large fires that contributed 99 of area burned varied among ecoregions from 10 ha in the utah high plateaus to 80 ha in the middle rocky mountains and oregon coastal range table 1 we found significant p 0 01 positive linear relationships between fscwd and the number of large fires in all ecoregions however the strength of the correlations varied table 1 ecoregions with a strong positive correlation e g middle rocky mountains r2 0 69 had large interannual variation in the number of large fires figs 2 a and s1 indicating a greater importance of fire season climate as a determinant for the number of large fires in ecoregions with a lower correlation multiple large fires occurred in most years e g sierra nevada range r2 0 18 we identified ats that distinguish years with significant differences in annual area burned for all ecoregions table 1 figs 2b and s2 two ecoregions the oregon and california coastal ranges have one significant p 0 05 at we identified two significant ats in the remaining ecoregions a lower threshold at1 distinguishes years with limited and moderate area burned and an upper threshold at2 separates years with moderate and extensive area burned table 1 figure s2 for example in the southern rocky mountains 30 years had limited mean 7979 ha 7 years had moderate mean 32 652 ha and 4 years had extensive mean 169 993 ha area burned all three divisions had a large number of fires to fit fire size distributions there were 634 fires in the limited area burned years 255 fires in the moderate area burned years and 251 fires in the extensive area burned years mean fire sizes in limited moderate and extensive fire years varied among ecoregions in the sierra nevada range and mogollon rim where very large fires occurred in even wetter than average years mean area burned was 22 000 ha during limited fire years in contrast in the rocky mountain ecoregions i e northwestern northern middle and southern rocky mountains wet years dampened the number and size of fires and limited fire years all averaged 8000 ha range of 502 7979 ha the leave one year out analysis identified at least one alternate at in all ecoregions in most ecoregions these alternate splits did not cause a major change in the number of years classified as limited moderate or extensive indicating most individual years had no impact on the position of ats figs 2b s2 however in four ecoregions where area burned in a single year greatly exceeded area burned in all other years i e the northern california coastal cascades and sierra nevada ranges in 2020 and the middle rocky mountains in 1988 removing the extreme fire year strongly affected the ats the southern rocky mountains ecoregion provides an important contrast there 2020 had both the highest observed fscwd and area burned however extreme fire years in 2002 and 2018 with a similarly high fscwd fig 2 meant that omitting 2020 did not shift the ats 3 1 burned area simulations for 1980 2020 observed fire size distributions for limited moderate and extensive fire years were not significantly different p 0 05 cramer von mises test from the fitted lognormal and pareto distributions in any ecoregion when calculated with all years because we used a random sample of observed fire sizes for the cramer von mises tests statistical distributions estimated for some years in the leave one year out analysis were significantly different from the subset of observed fire sizes however on average observed fire size distributions for limited moderate and extensive fire years were also not significantly different from the lognormal and pareto distributions for the leave one year out analysis for all ecoregions simulated area burned tracked observed interannual variation in area burned for all ecoregions during the calibration period figs 3 and s3 henne and hawbaker 2023 residuals for the mean simulated number of fires showed no significant autocorrelation in all ecoregions for most of the 1000 simulations for models calibrated with the full data set and models for the leave one year out analysis figure s4 likewise residuals of area burned simulated with lognormal and pareto distributions were not autocorrelated for most replicates in all ecoregions with models trained with all years or the leave one year out analysis figure s5 correlations between the mean simulated and observed annual area burned were significant in all ecoregions when models were trained using all years p value 0 05 and r2 ranged between 0 48 and 0 74 table s1 the type of fire size distribution lognormal or pareto had little influence on r2 values the largest difference was in the utah high plateaus 0 07 difference however individual years had a large influence on the correlation correlations were not significant in the leave one year out analysis for the sierra nevada range and cascades mountain range whereas correlations remained significant for all other ecoregions r2 was consistently lower i e 0 09 0 22 decrease simulations with pareto fire size distributions better captured the observed range in area burned than simulations with lognormal distributions table s1 with lognormal distributions observed area burned fell within the simulation range between 37 and 41 years in the different ecoregions figs 3 and s3 table s1 most years with observed area burned outside the simulation range were underestimates of area burned for extensive fire years e g 2020 in the sierra nevada range overestimates occurred in one year in the northern cascades range and two years in the middle rocky mountains figure s3 because we assumed a minimum of one large fire in every year this assumption is broadly consistent with fire records no years lacked a recorded fire and years without a large fire occurred in only the northern cascades two years northern rocky mountains one year and middle rocky mountains three years with pareto fire size distributions observed area burned was less than the simulated maximum in all ecoregions and all years for models trained with the full dataset but fell outside the simulation range with pareto distributions in 2017 for the oregon coastal range and 2020 for the sierra nevada range in the leave one year out analysis negative mean error values for all ecoregions indicate that fire simulations drawn from lognormal distributions generally underestimated total area burned mean error ranged from 66 to 15 for models trained with all years and from 66 to 14 for the leave one year out models table s1 drawing fire sizes from pareto distributions which include a higher probability of very large events resulted in more simulated area burned with pareto distributions mean error ranged from 44 to 47 when all years were considered and 41 to 50 with the leave one year out analysis in most ecoregions mean error was generally closer to zero with pareto distributions time series of residuals show that model errors were not significantly different between models calibrated with all years and the leave one year out analysis figures s6 s7 however residuals were generally larger after 2000 when conditions generally became drier in the western us and observed area burned increased williams et al 2020 mccabe and wolock 2021 simulations with fire sizes drawn from pareto distributions had higher rmse sd than those drawn from lognormal distributions indicating lesser skill and wider dispersion of the simulation results table s1 model skill was highest in the southern rocky mountains with lognormal distributions rmse sd 0 75 models using pareto distributions showed moderate skill in the southern rocky mountains rmse sd 0 85 and a small sensitivity to individual years rmse sd 0 89 for the leave one year out analysis 3 2 area burned projections for the southern rocky mountains we selected five gcms that span the range in fscwd projected by the cmip5 models for the period 2021 2099 henne and hawbaker 2023 and used annual fscwd from these gcms to simulate annual area burned observed fscwd was on average higher i e drier than gcm fscwd from 1981 2020 especially after 2000 most years were classified as limited fire years in the historical 28 years and gcm data 31 35 years however four years 2002 2012 2018 and 2020 had drier fire seasons than all but one year in the five gcms the historical data also had more moderate fire years six than the gcms which ranged from two to five years the gcm with the lowest fscwd cnrm cm5 had one extensive fire year during the historical period hadgem2 with the highest fscwd had five and the remaining models three relatively low gcm fscwd during the historical period figs 4 and 5 may mean that the gcms also underestimate fscwd in the coming decades separation among the gcms and historical climate is evident after 2020 figs 4 5 from 2021 2060 the relatively moist cnrm cm5 does not project drier fire seasons than the historical record in contrast ipsl cm5b ccsm4 and bcc csm1 which rank as the 1st quartile median and 3rd quartile of fscwd all have 10 moderate fire seasons but 3 10 and 11 extensive years hadgem2 has six moderate and 25 extensive fire years in this same interval during the final 40 years from 2060 2099 most years are either moderate or extensive fire years for all gcms the two wettest gcms cnrm cm5 ipsl cm5b maintained 14 limited fire years and nine and 11 moderate fire years respectively most years are extensive fire years in the drier gcms ccsm4 has 25 bcc csm1 30 and hadgem2 37 extensive fire years the frequency of extensive fire years may provide an important marker for changing fire climate relationships for the southern rocky mountains the timing of such a shift varies among gcms under the extreme hadgem2 average fscwd exceeds the upper at after 2038 i e 10 year moving average fscwd at2 figs 4a and 5a the average fscwd fluctuates near at2 after 2050 with bcc csm1 and remains above at2 after the 2080s average fscwd also remains above at2 during the 2080s but does not exceed at2 until the 2090s with the wetter cnrm cm5 and ipsl cm5b gcms we summarized simulated area burned for the three 40 year periods with the median range and interquartile range to help visualize and compare long term trends relative to the calibration period fig 6 observed area burned in the southern rocky mountains from 1981 2020 exceeded the range of area burned simulated with observed climate and lognormal distributions however one year i e 2020 had a major impact on this offset in contrast observed area burned fell within the interquartile range of simulations using pareto distributions median simulated area burned was lower than observations for the historical period with all gcms with lognormal 49 76 and pareto 23 60 distributions which was not surprising given that both the mean fscwd and frequencies of moderate and extreme fire years are lower in the gcms simulated area burned increased in all gcms during the period 2021 2060 fig 6 median area burned simulated with lognormal distributions remained below observed area burned from 1981 2020 for the two wettest scenarios cnrm cm5 65 and ipsl cm5b 47 was slightly higher for ccsm4 2 and bcc csm1 3 and about double 101 for hadgem2 the driest gcm for hadgem2 the frequency of extreme fire years increased markedly after 2040 fig 4 with pareto distributions the median simulated area burned for cnrm cm5 and ipsl sm5b from 2021 2060 was lower than observed from 1981 2020 by 44 and 18 but much higher with ccsm4 47 bcc csm1 49 and hadgem2 174 during the final 40 years of simulations the increase in median simulated area burned relative to observed area burned in 1981 2020 ranged from 33 246 with lognormal distributions and 94 360 with pareto distributions fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 aridity thresholds for limited moderate and extensive fire years fire season climatic water deficit fscwd effectively distinguishes years with limited moderate and extensive area burned in extensively forested ecoregions with variable land cover and climate water deficit metrics like fscwd are robust predictors of annual area burned in forested regions because they integrate multiple factors that constrain fuel moisture e g temperature precipitation insolation soils although our burned area model relies on a single water deficit metric we achieve similar predictive skill at the ecoregion scale as more complex models that integrate multiple variables littell et al 2018 2009 fscwd also increases with fire season length a critical driver of recent increases in area burned westerling et al 2006 because it sums monthly water deficits over a period that exceeds the typical fire season through much of our study area aridity thresholds link area burned to fire season water balance at the regional scale however flammability also varies within regions at finer scales warm dry topographic settings e g lower elevations south facing slopes may experience flammable conditions during a typical year while adjacent north facing slopes and upper elevations remain relatively moist dillon et al 2011 topographic position similarly affects productivity and therefore fuel loads kane et al 2015 rollins et al 2002 intraregional variation in fuel moisture and availability may explain the occurrence of two aridity thresholds in the ecoregions considered here which include complex mountainous terrain in ecoregions with two ats flammable conditions are very unlikely at both local and regional scales during years with limited burning i e fscwd at1 for example in the southern rocky mountains mean area burned is 7979 ha when fscwd at1 probably because moist conditions limited fire spread through much of the ecoregion in contrast during years with moderate area burned i e at1 fscwd at2 mean area burned is 32 652 ha and it is likely that the driest landscapes e g submontane forests and grasslands at lower elevations or southerly aspects become flammable years with extensive area burned mean area burned 169 993 ha occur when regional climate overwhelms local heterogeneity in fuel moisture and fires readily spread in even typically moist settings e g subalpine forests at high elevations and on northerly aspects extensive burning tends to coincide with high severity fires in forests of the western united states dillon et al 2011 parks and abatzoglou 2020 which indicates that typically moist settings with higher fuel loads become flammable because we averaged aridity at the ecoregion scale our ats may identify fire seasons where a critical proportion of the landscape becomes flammable thus during extensive fire years fires readily spread among stands with distinct topographic settings and heterogeneous fuel moisture levels that in wetter years could restrict fire spread 4 2 influences on model performance model performance varied among ecoregions and with the choice of fire size distribution type area burned models for ecoregions in the rocky mountains showed the highest skill and strongest correlations with observations table s1 in these ecoregions interannual variation in fuel moisture exerts the strongest control on fire activity littell et al 2018 fine fuel availability can limit fire spread locally e g in submontane pinus ponderosa forests however at higher elevations in the rocky mountains extensive subalpine forests have abundant well connected fuels that support high severity fire regimes and fire spread is limited primarily by fuel moisture sherriff and veblen 2008 in contrast in the mogollon rim where dry conditions and large fires are typical in most years low model skill table s1 may relate to the importance of fine fuel limitations on fire activity and also reflect the lack of distinction among fires with differing severities in our model woodlands and submontane forests with relatively open canopies and grassy understories are typical of the mogollon rim hurteau et al 2014 therefore climatic factors that control interannual variation in fine fuel availability especially antecedent moisture may be needed in combination with current year aridity to more effectively predict variations in area burned in ecoregions like the mogollon rim swetnam and betancourt 1990 extreme fire years affected the position of ats and model skill in some ecoregions for example leaving out 2020 from the sierra nevada and cascades ranges resulted in non significant correlations between simulated and observed area burned over the 41 year calibration period and large reductions in model skill thus our leave one year out models did not capture area burned in years when area burned vastly exceeded all previous observations similar situations may develop in other ecoregions where extreme fire years that greatly exceeded previously observed area burned did not occur during the calibration period for example in the highly productive forests of the northern cascades and oregon coastal range average area burned is lower than other ecoregions which may affect model fit and performance extensive burning in these ecoregions is highly episodic and smaller fires exhibit weak climatic control colombaroli and gavin 2010 therefore the inclusion of more years especially with extreme area burned may be necessary to precisely define ats that identify extensive fire years in contrast multiple extreme fire years that can help characterize fire activity under extremely dry conditions occurred during the calibration period in the southern rocky mountains fig 2 ultimately while extreme fire years may shift ats inclusion of such years may be critical to identifying fire season analogues for a warmer and drier future the value of accurately depicting annual versus decadal scale variations is an important consideration when selecting statistical distributions for area burned models pareto distributions better captured rare extreme events that dominate area burned on decadal scales in the western united states lognormal distributions more effectively reproduced interannual variability as demonstrated by higher model skill but are more likely to miss extreme fire events that can dominate ecological processes for decades this difference results from the higher probability of rare extreme events i e very large fires with pareto distributions and the resulting wider range of simulated area burned in our simulation replicates holmes et al 2008 the statistical distribution that best characterizes fire size distributions may also change through time li and banerjee 2021 for example pareto distributions may better approximate fire sizes as the proportion of area burned incurred during extreme fire events increases in a warming climate as is likely in ecosystems with flammability limited fire regimes williams et al 2019 changes in fuel availability and fire suppression policies and or efficacy may affect the long term stability of ats by changing relationships between fire spread and climate higuera et al 2015 taylor et al 2016 in several ecoregions with increasing trends in area burned during the calibration period e g sierra nevada range mogollon rim southern rocky mountains we overestimated area burned during the 1980s and or 1990s but underestimated during the 2020s figs 3 and s3 observed increases in area burned relate in part to increasing temperatures and fuel aridity between these intervals abatzoglou and williams 2016 however model performance may have also been affected by the changing success of fire suppression in these decades that is fire suppression limited area burned during the relatively moist 1980s but was less successful during the historically dry 2010s as the number of days and amount of area experiencing extreme fire danger increased abatzoglou et al 2021b changes in fire suppression policies may also have had a modest effect on our results after 2009 fire managers were granted greater flexibility to allow some fires to burn especially in wilderness areas which may have also contributed to our underestimate of area burned in the rocky mountains and mogollon rim in the 2010s young et al 2020 4 3 implications from the southern rocky mountains for projecting area burned in a warming climate our threshold approach does not extrapolate beyond observed climate fire relationships to project area burned in a warming climate although we calibrated our model with recent fire years we identified ats that distinguish significant differences in annual area burned and draw fire sizes from distributions defined by these thresholds therefore median area burned in our simulations approaches the maximum of past observed annual area burned figs 4 and 5 nonetheless because fire sizes are generated randomly maximum simulated area burned can exceed maximum observed area burned especially as the number of large fires increases with fscwd figs 2 and 3 furthermore decadal area burned can also exceed observations as the frequency of extensive fire years i e fscwd at2 increases a key challenge for projecting area burned in a warmer and drier future is that fire climate relationships change through time they are non stationary gavin et al 2007 mckenzie and littell 2017 for example climate was a stronger predictor of area burned during recent decades than during the mid 20th century for many ecoregions in the western united states higuera et al 2015 littell et al 2009 thus area burned models developed for one period can over or underpredict fire when applied to novel climate conditions vegetation change is an important driver of non stationarity changing climate and disturbance regimes can alter fuel accumulation decomposition and structure which affects fire spread and ultimately area burned batllori et al 2013 matthews et al 2012 parks et al 2018 consequently as with other models our simulations become less reliable as the frequency of extensive fire years increases and climate departs from the historical range of variation under which our models were trained littell et al 2018 westerling et al 2011 especially if interactions between wildfires and drought stress alter forest regeneration davis et al 2019 littell et al 2018 concluded that simulated fire rotations for an ecoregion that are shorter than the calibration period of a statistical area burned model violate the assumption that future vegetation will resemble historical vegetation and therefore support a similar fire climate relationship similar inferences can be made from our approach once most years pass the threshold for extensive area burned it is unlikely that vegetation will support the fire climate relationships observed during the calibration period for the southern rocky mountains the timing of such a shift varies among gcms from after 2038 under the extreme hadgem2 but not until the 2090s with the wetter cnrm cm5 and ipsl cm5b gcms figs 4a 5a thus although we project major increases in area burned under all gcms fig 6 the timing of departure from observed fire climate relationships will likely depend on changes in future precipitation regimes which have higher uncertainty than temperature projections woldemeskel et al 2016 statistical area burned models can attenuate projected area burned in a warming climate to account for vegetation feedbacks to fire climate relationships abatzoglou et al 2021a turco et al 2018 however calibrating vegetation feedbacks in area burned simulations is nontrivial because the specific impacts of vegetation change on fire regimes vary among forest types and ecoregions gavin et al 2007 tepley et al 2018 in projections of area burned for the western united states abatzoglou et al 2021a limited area burned in a warming climate following the assumptions that fire fuel feedbacks diminish the forest area capable of carrying subsequent fires and that fuel limitations can diminish through time these authors concluded that fuel availability will impart only a modest limitation on forest area burned through the mid century relative to climate driven increases in flammability climate change and fire activity can also have positive feedbacks on area burned climate and fire driven shifts that reduce tree density or trigger forest to shrubland or grassland conversion can increase fine fuel availability and promote short interval burning even if fire intensity is reduced coop et al 2020 tepley et al 2018 therefore assumptions that fire activity and or warming will limit future area burned are not always justified and in projecting area burned the range of gcm uncertainty may be greater than uncertainty in changes to fire climate feedbacks turco et al 2018 one way to address the shortcomings of purely statistical modeling approaches is to couple statistical models with landscape simulation models in this approach the statistical model would provide regional targets to the landscape simulation model for area burned or fire size distributions that change with future weather and climate conditions however the landscape simulation model would determine the actual area burned accounting for spatial variability in biomass and how that variability was altered by past fires and other disturbances we have used this approach coupling our aridity threshold fire model with the landis ii forest landscape model which tracks fire spread across landscapes in addition to species establishment growth rates and biomass levels henne et al 2021 future efforts could also dynamically adjust aridity thresholds to depict climatically driven changes in fuel for example pausas and paula 2012 found a positive linear relationship between aridity thresholds and productivity among 13 regions in spain that could be applied to dynamically adjust aridity thresholds in a changing climate 5 conclusions our aridity threshold fire model relates the annual number and size of wildfires to fire season aridity to simulate climate driven changes in annual area burned at the ecoregion scale by applying thresholds in area burned our model projects abrupt changes in annual area burned that result as the frequency of extreme fire seasons increases with major increases after 2020 for most gcms and all gcms after 2060 because our model requires limited inputs it can be readily updated to incorporate recent observations and the knowledge gained from future extreme fire years such adaptability may be critical in the western united states and other regions where climatic conditions and fire regimes are rapidly diverging from past observations higuera and abatzoglou 2021 but also allows application of our model at broader scales our statistical model is robust enough to be used on its own to project the timing of major changes in annual area burned but also applicable to models that directly simulate feedbacks among climate vegetation land use and fire for example forest landscape models henne et al 2021 or state and transition models sleeter et al 2015 marchal et al 2020 that require ignition counts and fire size distributions to simulate wildfire which our at model produces similarly we provide a low complexity alternative for fire enabled dgvms hantsen et al 2016 that directly calibrates thresholds in fire season moisture and makes few assumptions about fire spread development of empirical relationships between climatic thresholds for extensive fire years over gradients in productivity and aridity could further the applicability of our approach to global fire models pausas and paula 2012 credit author statement for an aridity threshold model of fire sizes and annual area burned in extensively

finally end users wu and wang 2017 within a basin the iwr of provinces or cities are allocated according to the national distribution plan and the total amount and rights of water drawing are embodied as regional water consumption index including the control index of total water use and the water quantity distribution index of rivers and many scholars conducted extensive studies on china s iwra based on the water policy they considered the development goals history and status quo of water departments built the model and proposed suggestions of iwra to help implement relevant national allocation plans zhang et al 2014 yao et al 2019 the term industry refers to groups of companies or individuals that produce or provide a particular kind of good or service in national economy china water resources bulletin calculates the annual water consumption of industry from agricultural industrial residential including urban public water use and ecological supplement use iwra of industry plays a critical supporting role in regional iwr management diao and cui 2017 however there is no specific policy on iwra of industry for guidance but scholars have made great efforts in this aspect wang et al 2009 employed a large scale multi objective optimization method summarized four major types of water use in ningxia hui autonomous region of china domestic agricultural industrial and ecological water use built an optimized model for iwra of industry by calculating the allocation parameters of each industry additionally wu et al 2010 proposed the basic iwra principles based on the development goals of each industry in detail they established priority levels of right holders built a goal programming model for iwra and made an empirical analysis on the daling river in china zhang et al 2020a grounded in risk control and gini coefficient constructed a two stage stochastic programming framework offering ideas and methods for iwra 1 2 the high quality development and iwra of the yellow river basin according to the report of the 19th national congress of the communist party of china in 2017 china s economy has entered a new phase of shifting from high speed development to high quality development the economic meanings of high speed growth and high quality development are all to increase the amount of use value and meet the growing needs of the people by producing more use value peng and yu 2019 high speed development attaches too much importance to the supply of products and services and pursues the goals of income and gdp while excessively pursuing the speed growth it has accumulated numerous contradictions and problems such as the increase of the gap between the rich and the poor environmental deterioration etc however high quality development pays more attention to the use value and quality desirability of products and economic activities although income and gdp are still the goals it will become particularly important whether or not the economy can operate effectively and make progress and whether or not the supply side can meet the people s growing needs for a better life to a greater extent wen et al 2021 the new development philosophy is the general requirement for all aspects of economic and social development in all regions high quality development has expanded from the economic sector to all sectors and regions and has become a long term development strategy that china must adhere to in september 2019 the chinese government elevated ecological protection and high quality development as a major national strategy the high quality development of the yellow river basin can drive the coordinated development of local economy ecological security and cultural heritage yu and fang 2020 water shortage has been hindering the basin s progress therefore the key to high quality development is to relieve water scarcity chen and jin 2019 water shortage in the yellow river basin arises from not only insufficient eco flow protection but inequitable water allocation and regulation as well shen et al 2020a an overall strategy based on the status quo of water development and utilization zhang 2020c to guarantee the volume quality and efficiency of water resources wei et al 2021 can further promote the high quality development of the yellow river basin in the research about iwra of yellow river basin jia et al 2020 based on the new trends in water and sand proportions and regional supply and demand of water estimated the reserved ecological water demand including sediment yield alternative water resources from the south north water transfer project and seawater utilization for the downstream as well as the industrial water demand along the midstream and upstream of the yellow river in doing so they helped formulate new plans that distribute more water to the midstream and upstream of the yellow river in addition guan et al 2021 took the perspective of water saving potential built a two level allocation model for rural households living in canal areas and irrigation districts and also employed gini coefficient to construct a fair model for allocating rights to use water for rural households the following problems however remain to be solved first what principles iwra should follow in the stage of high quality development second studies on iwra of industry a major water consumer should be enriched and expanded to help improve the integrated water resources management this study focuses on the iwra of industry driven by high quality development in the yellow river basin in detail based on the status quo of the basin this study proposed the principle of total quantity control safeguard fairness and efficiency set up the priority of each industry and conducted actual iwra via goal programming model next this study used the gm 1 1 model to calculate the ideal value of iwra of industry in the goal programming model additionally this study put forward an iwra method combining quota method and water demand proportion for end users of industry an outline is shown in fig 1 2 study area this section briefly introduced the basic situation of the yellow river basin and put forward the principle of iwra of industry under the guidance of high quality development and the situation of water resource dilemma in the basin 2 1 overview of study area originated from sanjiangyuan there river source area dubbed the water tower of china the yellow river flows through nine provinces regions such as qinghai and sichuan and eventually into the bohai sea it covers a length of 5464 km and is one of china s largest rivers second only to the yangtze river the yellow river basin is located at 96 119 e 32 52 n about 1900 km in length from east to west and 1100 km in width from south to north covering a total drainage area of 795 thousand km2 as a key eco corridor it is crucial for sustaining grain production and energy security pan et al 2020 li et al 2020b the yellow river basin extends through nine provinces region qinghai province sichuan province gansu province ningxia hui autonomous region inner mongolia autonomous region shaanxi province shanxi province henan province and shandong province with broader scale and close interaction among provinces region taken into account this study chose to focus on the nine provinces region of the yellow river basin the yellow river basin is a key economic development area in china chen et al 2020 according to china statistic yearbook 2021 in 2020 the gdp of the basin was 25 39 trillion yuan accounting for 25 05 of the national gdp and its gdp grew at a rate of 3 2 faster than the national level 0 45 in detail the value added of the primary industry including forestry animal husbandry and fishery secondary industry including mining manufacturing electricity gas and construction and tertiary industry including transportation warehousing postal services and other industries except the primary and secondary industries were 2 3 trillion yuan 9 9 trillion yuan and 12 79 trillion yuan taking up 29 53 25 8 and 23 18 respectively of the national number the data shows that the primary sector of the basin plays a critical role across china the available water resources in the yellow river basin are mainly transit water insufficient for whole basin water use in 2020 the total water volume of the basin was 649 08 billion m3 accounting for 20 54 of the national water volume and 24 46 of the water volume in the yangtze river basin shortage and inequitable distribution of water resources forced the yellow river basin to initiate iwra many years ago in september 1987 the state council of china approved the yellow river water allocation scheme 87 scheme in short based on the actual water consumption in 1980 the 87 scheme considered the irrigation scale growth in industrial and urban water consumption of each province or region to accordingly distributed the available water furthermore the scheme made clear of the iwr of each province in the yellow river basin serving as even at present the basis of water drawing lin et al 2014 however the scheme lacks dynamic or compulsory solutions and cannot produce solid results now as the basin is entering the stage of high quality development industry has become a major engine of progress so equitable iwra of industry helps improve the efficiency of water use solve water issues and strengthen water management in the basin 2 2 principles for iwra of industry driven by high quality development in the yellow river basin in october 2021 the state council of china issued outline of the yellow river basin s ecological protection and high quality development plan the outline proposed to make whole basin water allocation plans in a coordinated manner distribute enough water for ecological domestic and production water use at the same time based on the status quo of water resources and economic development of the basin the following principles are determined for iwra of industry driven by high quality development 1 total quantity control china has integrated the total quantity control system into laws regulations and documents related to water resources for the yellow river basin a basin that suffers from water shortage iwra of industry must consider the bearing capacity of its water resources status quo of water use and future water demand at the same time the sum of iwr of industry should not surpass the total volume of available water 2 safeguard in iwra of industry for the basin domestic and ecological water use must be put in the first place domestic water is necessary to satisfy basic needs thus must be secured preferentially in the meantime the eco system of the basin is already vulnerable the number of fish in the yellow river s main stream declined from 125 in the 1980s to 47 in 2007 northern copper fish bony lip yellow river fish and so on are precious endangered aquatic wild animals xie et al 2018 lu et al 2022b so maintaining enough water for the ecological environment is also of great significance 3 fairness industries in the basin have formed up their own water use patterns in the past years therefore based on the principle of fairness the iwra of industry in the basin must consider the water use habits of each industry and the status quo of water consumption 4 efficiency iwra of industry must be aware of the scarcity value of water lu et al 2021 in the yellow river basin each industry makes unique contributions to the economy of the basin and the country at large hence the principle of efficiency must be followed to equally allocate water resources 3 method in this section the goal programming model of iwra for industry and end users in the yellow river basin are constructed based on the requirements of the model gm 1 1 is used to calculate the ideal value of the model 3 1 goal programming model of iwra of industry in reality some multi objective decision making problems are characterized by complexity dominance and hierarchy goodarzian and nasab 2019 in this type of problems there are usually multiple goals and each goal has an ideal value to be achieved at the same time the importance of each goal is different so it is necessary to rank the importance of each target the goal programming model can effectively solve the problems with the above characteristics brouer et al 2014 the model is based on the basic theory of linear programming the basic idea of the model is that due to the restrictions of various conditions each objective function is difficult to achieve its expected value therefore positive and negative deviation variables are introduced to combine the original constraint equations to form new constraint conditions and the scheme with the minimum deviation is obtained based on the goal setting zhao 1987 the goal programming model combines the objective importance of the multi objective decision making problem the ideal value of the objective function and analyzes other data to obtain a series of decision making schemes for complex economic activities for decision makers to choose the goal programming model can be solved on lindo software by using the sequential algorithm the idea of the sequential algorithm is to decompose the linear goal programming into multiple single objective linear programming according to the goal priority and solve them in turn mhanna and mancarella 2022 the application steps of the goal planning model mainly include step 1 determining the priority of goals step 2 determining the model constraint conditions weight coefficients positive and negative deviations step 3 achieving functions and solving li et al 2020a this study decided on the goal programming model for iwra of industry in china iwra is carried out by governmental departments with focus on fairness efficiency wang et al 2020 however given the water shortage iwra may not be able to meet the demand of all users so the priorities of users must be made clear domestic ecological and urban public water use need to be more prioritized and their water demands should be met to the maximum extent as for the principle of fairness users demands should be met according to previous water use patterns as for the principle of efficiency users with higher water use efficiency and benefit should be given more initial water rights li et al 2019 all in all the goal programming model can deal with the scenarios above w σ σ 1 2 3 4 5 6 represents the iwr of domestic ecological urban public industrial agricultural water use and governmental reserved water the ideal value of the iwr for each user is assigned as subgoal to set the positive and negative deviation variables represented as d σ and d σ the above mentioned principles are employed to prioritize water users as for the principle of priority domestic water use comes first denoted as p1 ecological water use is pivotal to the sustainable ecosystem the second level of priority denoted as p2 urban public water use is essential to public activities the third level of priority denoted as p3 industrial and agricultural water use is for production and management the fourth level of priority denoted as p4 in addition different weight coefficients are used to rank the importance of industrial and agricultural water use details of modeling and solution are as follows 1 analysis on model constraints and weight coefficients p1 constraint on domestic water use iwra for domestic water use should be no less than the target value 1 w 1 d 1 d 1 w l where w l is the target value of iwr for domestic water use in the planning year product of the planning year population and water consumption per capita over the past years d 1 and d 1 are the positive deviation variable the target value of iwr for domestic water use is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of iwr for domestic water use is underachieved respectively p2 constraint on ecological water use iwra for ecological water use should be no less than the target value 2 w 2 d 2 d 2 w e where w e is the target value of iwr for ecological water use in the planning year obtained by predicting via gm 1 1 model and based on the previous water use patterns d 2 and d 2 are positive deviation variable the target value of iwr for ecological water use is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of iwr for ecological water use is underachieved respectively p3 constraint on urban public water use iwra for urban public water use should be no less than the target value 3 w 3 d 3 d 3 w u p where w u p is the target value of iwr for urban public water use in the planning year obtained by predicting via gm 1 1 model and based on the previous water use patterns d 3 and d 3 are positive deviation variable the target value of iwr for urban public water use is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of iwr for urban public water use is underachieved respectively p4 constraint and weight coefficient on agricultural and industrial water use proportion of iwra for agricultural or industrial water use should be no less than the proportion of average water consumption in the past years 4 w 4 d 4 d 4 w a κ 4 5 w 5 d 5 d 5 w a κ 5 where 6 κ 4 y 1 u q y arg y 1 u q y 7 κ 5 y 1 u q y i n d y 1 u q y in eqs 4 7 w a represents the iwr determined by the red line of water use control according to the strictest water resources management system policy in china κ 4 is the ratio of average agricultural water consumption in the past years to total water consumption κ 5 the ratio of average industrial water consumption in the past years to total water consumption d 4 and d 4 are the positive deviation variable the target value of agricultural iwr is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of agricultural iwr is underachieved respectively d 5 and d 5 are the positive deviation variable the target value of industrial iwr is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of industrial iwr is underachieved respectively q y arg and q y i n d represent the water consumption of agriculture and industry in year y and q y represents the total water consumption in year y y 1 2 u agriculture and industry are at the same priority level so their weight coefficients are determined by industrial outlook and characteristics to be specific in areas dominated by agriculture agricultural iwra has higher weight coefficient in areas dominated by industry industrial iwra has higher weight coefficient however product value per unit of industry is higher than that of agriculture so it is meaningless to compare the annual value added of agriculture and industry in the same city therefore this study decided on the proportion of local agricultural industrial value added to the corresponding provincial the administrative unit above city gdp 8 ϖ arg ϖ i n d y 1 u v y arg y 1 u g d p y j y 1 u v y i n d y 1 u g d p y j where ϖ arg and ϖ i n d represent the weight coefficients of iwra of agriculture and industry respectively v y arg and

industry for end users a critical task for improving national water rights system and strengthening water resources management is to allocate clear rights to end users iwra of industry may not be able to meet the needs of all end users so the actual water demand of end users is not a reasonable basis for iwra instead their water demand proportions should be included to build an iwra model 12 w u s e r s w d u s e r s w d s w s where w u s e r s is the iwra to end users of industry s w d s the total water demand of industry s w d u s e r s the water demand of users of industry s and w s the iwr of industry s in this study water demand of end users of industry was predicted via the quota method water quota refers to the water demand per unit of product or area or the domestic water demand per capita per unit of time yi et al 2019 quotas are determined by technical guideline of stipulation for norm of water intake under the principles of being scientific rational moderate and practical such measure considers the total water quantity water demand as well as water saving investment technologies and devices in different regions or industries and sticks to the basic state policy of water conservancy in a word it is an effective measure that enhances management on total water quantity in china there are insufficient water resources yet too many end users so allocating water for users according to quotas makes it easier to check and manage hence this study employed the simple and practical quota method 13 w d u s e r s i 1 m w c n i w s i n i t i where w d u s e r s is the total water demand of users in industry s w c n i the quota for user i w s i the water use scale of user i e g planting area of crops or industrial output n i the water use times of user i in unit time and t i the total water use time of user i 3 3 predicting the objective value of industry water use via gm 1 1 model limited by the level of technology and cognition human beings cannot fully understand the components or development characteristics of complex systems but are in the state of part of the information is known and the other part is unknown so the data about these complex systems is also limited liu 2014 however in order to explore the development trend of complex systems it is necessary to analyze and predict these systems with small samples poor information and uncertainty the gray prediction model can meet the prediction needs of these complex systems gm 1 1 is a commonly used gray prediction mode designed to systemically generate and extract valuable information and find patterns to quantitively predict complicated results shen et al 2020b it is not demanding on data yet easy to operate and able to produce accurate results the application steps of gm 1 1 model include step 1 the grade ratio test of the original sequence and the data that fails the test needs to be translated step 2 the original sequence is generated by accumulation step 3 fitting to obtain whitening equation step 4 use the least square method to calculate the parameters and obtain the time response formula of the gray prediction model step 5 model accuracy inspection step 6 use the model meeting the accuracy requirements to carry out prediction wang et al 2018 this study used the gm 1 1 model to predict the objective value of iwra of industry in the yellow river basin iwra of industry always puts ecology first by maintaining the patterns of ecological water use therefore in this study the previous patterns of both ecological and urban public water use were considered which are an integral basis of urban public service to predict the water use in the planning year via gm 1 1 model to guarantee the regional water demand and carry out equitable iwra of industry the original sequence is z 0 z 0 1 z 0 2 z 0 n and z 0 g 0 g 1 2 3 n is the water consumption in the past years shen et al 2020b the grade ratio of the sequence should be within the tolerance interval e 2 n 1 e 2 n 1 if the grade ratio cannot meet the requirement the original sequence needs to be modified to fall into the acceptable range taking the constant g for translation transformation chen et al 2022 14 h 0 g z 0 g g to make the original sequence less random and volatile the first order accumulated generating operation 1 ago sequence was obtained liu 2014 15 h 1 h 1 1 h 1 2 h 1 n moreover first order univariate differential equation was used to fit the whitening equation of gm 1 1 16 d h 1 d t a 1 h 1 μ 1 the parameters were obtained via the least squares method 17 a 1 μ 1 t b 1 t b 1

the relative error is the more accurate the mode is table 1 shows the accuracy levels of the gm 1 1 model liu et al 2021 used to predict ecological water consumption 4 empirical analysis in this section we applied the model built in 3 method to calculate the iwr of hetao irrigation district of bayannur city in the yellow river basin first it introduced the general situation of hetao irrigation district then analysed the iwr of industry of bayannur city and finally obtained the iwr of hetao irrigation district 4 1 overview of hetao irrigation district in bayannur city hetao irrigation district is located in bayannur city in the west of inner mongolia of china the north end of the ji shaped bend of the yellow river over 200 km in length from east to west and 40 60 km in width from south to north with a total land area of about 1 12 million hm2 it is one of the three super large irrigation districts in china and the largest artesian water diversion irrigation district in asia additionally hetao is in a desert and arid area with low rainfall and high evaporation about 130 mm of average annual rainfall and 2300 mm of average annual evaporation the main source of its agricultural water is the yellow river chen et al 2021b hetao irrigation district is a key base for marketable grain and oil production in china according to statistical communiqué of bayannur city on the 2020 municipal economic and social development hetao produced approximately 2 76 billion kg crops in 2020 accounting for over 90 of the gross agricultural output of bayannur the water consumption of hetao irrigation district is large but the water resources are seriously insufficient therefore it is of great practical significance to carry out the iwra in hetao irrigation district chen et al 2022 4 2 iwra in hetao irrigation district of bayannur city 4 2 1 data source in this section iwr of hetao irrigation district will be calculated based on data from government documents like the strictest water resources management system goals of inner mongolia 2014 2020 inner mongolia water resources bulletin 2014 2022 bayannur water resources bulletin statistical communiqué of bayannur city on the 2014 2020 municipal economic and social development and the website of national bureau of statistics of china and so on 4 2 2 analysis on iwr of bayannur city inner mongolia was one of the first provinces regions that pioneered in iwra the scheme 87 based on the water consumption of the yellow river allocated 5 4 billion m3 of iwr to inner mongolia therefore this study guided by the strictest water resources management system policy in china took the total water use of inner mongolia as its iwr and the regional total water use as iwr of each region relevant policies have made clear regulations on the total water use in 2020 and 2030 as a result this study took the year 2025 as the planning year to calculate the iwr of inner mongolia and bayannur in 2025 via arithmetic mean next according to the strictest water resources management system goals of inner mongolia this study further determined the corresponding iwra results in inner mongolia and bayannur as shown in table 2 according to table 2 iwr of bayannur in 2025 w a is 5 099 billion m3 4 2 3 calculating iwr of industry in bayannur city the iwr of hetao irrigation district mainly come from iwr for agricultural irrigation in bayannur so in the section iwr of industry in bayannur will be first allocated 1 expected value of iwr for domestic water use in the planning year in the past years the average natural population growth rate of bayannur is 2 63 domestic water consumption per capita is about 31 62 m3 year person so based on the population in 2019 the total domestic water consumption of bayannur in 2025 w l is expected to be 54 41 million m3 2 expected value of iwr for ecological water use in the planning year ecological water serves to maintain a healthy eco system but the eco environment of yellow river basin is fragile so while striving for high quality development the basin must see ecological protection as a top priority considering the status quo of ecological water use in bayannur and based on eqs 14 20 and gm 1 1 model the ecological water consumption of bayannur in 2025 w e is expected to be 61 91 million m3 average relative error 2 58 within the acceptance range suitable to be the expected value of the iwr 3 expected value of iwr for urban public water use in the planning year urban public water use is for maintaining the functions of the city and people s daily life considering the status quo of urban public water use in bayannur and based on eqs 14 20 and gm 1 1 model the urban public water consumption of bayannur in 2025 w u p is expected to be 45 28 million m3 average relative error 1 9 within the acceptance range suitable to be the expected value of the initial water rights 4 expected value of iwr for agricultural and industrial water use in the planning year agricultural and industrial water use is for production and operation less significant than domestic ecological and urban public water use the iwra for bayannur may not be able to meet the agricultural and industrial water demand as a result considering the status quo of agricultural and industrial water use in bayannur and based on eqs 4 7 the agricultural and industrial water consumption of bayannur during 2014 2020 κ 4 and κ 5 is calculated to take up 96 2 and 1 8 respectively the priority weights of agricultural and industrial water use were determined based on the proportion of value added of agriculture and industry of bayannur in the gdp of inner mongolia during 2014 2020 to highlight the economic contribution of bayannur in inner mongolia and its pillar sectors according to eq 8 the weight coefficient of iwra for agricultural and industrial water use ϖ arg and ϖ i n d is 2 27 1 5 based on previous studies and the status quo of water resources in bayannur this study determined that the governmental reserved water accounts for 5 zhang et al 2020b of the city s iwr w 6 254 95 million m3 according to eq 11 and previous studies dan and wang 2014 and the status quo of water resources in bayannur this study after excluding the governmental reserved water constructed the goal programming model for iwra of industry for bayannur in 2025 21 min y p

hetao irrigation district hetao irrigation district has determined its total water quantity and allocated water quotas and set up channels for registering pilot areas for iwra however farmland patches are scattered and the lack of devices and facilities measuring water quantity make it hard to carry out the iwr registration further hindering iwra of hetao via quota method sun et al 2021 in china agriculture consumes plenty of water resources mainly for irrigation and the irrigation water in bayannur is mainly used in hetao irrigation district it has been calculated that in the past years the proportion of hetao s average irrigation water consumption in agricultural water consumption of bayannur is 94 hence the agricultural iwr for hetao irrigation district w h e t a o a is 4 38 billion m3 4 2 5 analysis of changes in parameters this paper constructed a goal programming model to allocate iwr in hetao irrigation district bayannur city the yellow river basin in this process some parameters need to be set in advance some parameters are based on the government department files some parameters are based on the calculation results of other indicators indicator settings may have different effects on allocation results in this section one at a time oat is used to analyze parameter changes that is one parameter is selected each time under the premise that other parameters remain unchanged the influence of the selected parameter on the model value is studied by adjusting the value of the selected parameter hwang et al 1997 pisoni et al 2010 this paper mainly analyzed the influence of the change of w a w 6 κ 4 κ 5 ϖ arg and ϖ i n d on the calculation results w a is the total amount of regional distributable water w 6 is the emergency water volume which needs to be deducted before the iwra of the industry in the model κ 4 κ 5 ϖ arg and ϖ i n d affected the proportion of the iwra of agriculture and industry and had a more direct regulatory role for the model results the actual meaning of the parameter and the source of the data determine the adjustment range of the parameter in eq 21 w a is 5 099 billion m3 which is based on the calculation results of government documents the adjustment range determined by referring to table 2 is from 4 952 billion m3 to 5 246 billion m3 w 6 is 254 95 million m3 which is determined according to the research results of relevant literature therefore the adjustment range of this parameter is 10 upward or downward respectively from 203 96 million m3 to 305 94 million m3 κ 4 and κ 5 is 96 2 and 1 8 respectively which are the calculation results of the industry s average annual water consumption therefore the industry s annual water consumption from 2014 to 2020 are selected as the adjustment range κ 4 is from 95 85 to 96 58 and κ 5 is from 1 71 to 2 04 ϖ arg and ϖ i n d are decided according to the proportion of the industry s average annual added value so the adjustment range of the parameters is respectively 50 higher of the existing data only one parameter is changed at a time and the other parameters remain unchanged and they are substituted in eq 21 the parameter variation range and the iwra of hetao irrigation district are shown in table 4 according to table 4 the impact of changes of the six parameters selected in this paper on the model values is shown in fig 2 in fig 2 1 with the increase of iwr in bayannur city the iwr in hetao irrigation district are also increasing the regional iwr is the total amount of water resources that can be used in a region and the increase of the total amount will inevitably lead to the increase of that of water users in the region as shown in fig 2 2 with the increase of water reserved by bayannur municipal government the iwr of hetao irrigation district decreases as the government reserved water has an emergency role it is usually deducted from the total amount at the beginning of the iwra so the more the government reserved water the less the distributable water and the less the iwr in hetao irrigation district in fig 2 3 the larger the proportion of historical agricultural water consumption in bayannur city the more water that can be allocated in hetao irrigation district in the iwra of the industry this paper identifies the characteristics of industry water use and follows the its water use habits hetao irrigation district is the largest water user in bayannur city and the agricultural water consumption is always large in fig 2 4 the historical industrial water consumption of bayannur city has little impact on the iwra of hetao irrigation district the industrial development of city is relatively slow and the industrial water consumption is small so it has little impact on the iwra of agriculture as shown in fig 2 5 the average agricultural added value for many years has little impact on the iwra in hetao irrigation district in the goal programming model of this paper priority is given to water volume factors such as the role of regional iwra and historical water consumption of the industry therefore the average agricultural added value for many years as the weight coefficient of the distribution has little impact on the final distribution result in fig 2 6 with the increase of average industrial added value for many years the iwra of hetao irrigation district is different the changes of the average industrial added value in the early years have not affected the calculation results of the model with the industrial development of bayannur city the enhancement of industrial economic strength has led to the tilt of iwra to industry with a certain total amount the agricultural iwr will be reduced from the actual situation as a city focusing on agricultural development bayannur city has few times more industrial output value than agriculture based on the above analysis the change of parameters will lead to the change of the final result of iwra in hetao irrigation district however when the parameter value that conforms to the actual value is selected the unique and effective results can be obtained 5 discussion this study probed into iwra of industry in the yellow river basin driven by high quality development based on the status quo of water resources and social economic development in the basin this study proposed the principles of total quantity control safeguard fairness and efficiency determined the priority weight of each sector via the goal programming model this paper constructed the iwra model of the industry and anticipated the ideal value of the model by gm 1 1 in addition this study proposed the model of iwra for end users based on their water use patterns this study carried out an empirical analysis on the iwra of bayannur city in inner mongolia in 2025 results show that①agricultural iwr accounted for 91 39 of the total water rights compared with the average annual water consumption of agriculture it decreases by 2 71 with a small change indicating that water resources in bayannur are mainly used for agricultural production ②iwr for industrial was accounting for 0 44 compared with the average annual water consumption the industrial iwr changed greatly which may be mainly due to the serious waste of industrial water and it is not the focus of economic development of the city so the iwr is reduced ③iwr of domestic water accounted for 1 07 of the total which increased by 21 59 compared with the average water consumption for many years indicating a great change the main reason is that the distribution model proposed in this paper firstly considered domestic water so as to ensure all the demands of domestic water as much as possible ④iwr of urban public water accounts for 0 89 of the total which increased by 1 75 compared with the average water consumption for many years showing a small change ⑤the ecological iwr accounted for 1 21 of the total which increased by 43 25 compared with the average water consumption for many years the main reason is that in the past the city s ecological water consumption was small and the ecological water security was insufficient however based on the high quality development this paper considered the growth demand of ecological water and gives priority to ecological water security ⑥as the iwr are difficult to be allocated for hetao irrigation district via quota method water demand proportion is hence applied the water consumption in the area was mainly irrigation water accounting for 85 91 of the total water rights compared with the average water consumption in the area for many years the water consumption decreased by 3 32 with little change if the iwr cannot meet the industry demand water conservation or water purchase through water right transaction can be considered if the iwr can meet the industry demand and has surplus water it can also be considered to sell water through water right trading in the statistics of water consumption of china governmental reserved is generally not included so there is no historical data about it this paper studies the yellow river basin under the high quality development which is a major development strategy for china the yellow river basin is in a new stage with water resources still the major obstacle hindering its progress current studies mainly focus on water allocation based on the basic situation of the basin lin et al 2014 not on the high quality development strategies the research results have some limitations to guide the development of watershed this study nonetheless is grounded in iwra driven by high quality development in line with the development demand of the basin and suitable for practical application this paper studies the iwra of industry in the yellow river basin current studies on iwra mainly focus on two aspects first iwra for provinces autonomous regions direct administered municipalities in the basin wu et al 2012 wu and wang 2017 second iwra for cities counties townships under provinces autonomous regions direct administered municipalities diao and cui 2017 the iwra of industry plays a connecting role in regional water management on the one hand the iwr index of the city county township is decomposed to realize the total water use control of the region on the other hand it is helpful to understand the water consumption of the industry and facilitate the total management of the terminal water users this study looked into iwra of industry in the yellow river basin and built a goal programming model offering an effective method for quantitatively analyzing iwr this study still has the following limits first this study employed the gm 1 1 model to anticipate the ideal value of agricultural industrial domestic urban public and ecological water use but neglected other influencing factors second bayannur city is located in an arid area so the governmental reserved water is mainly for emergencies based on previous studies this study determined it take up 5 of the total water rights a proportion much higher than the iwra for industrial ecological and urban public water use whether it is practical for the city needs further exploration 6 conclusion based on the status quo of water resources and socioeconomic development of the basin this study probed into iwra of industry proposed the principles of total quantity control safeguard fairness and efficiency in doing so this study determined the priority weight of each industry built a goal programming model for iwra of industry in the basin driven by high quality development and an iwra calculation model for end users and ran an empirical analysis on the iwr of hetao irrigation district in bayannur city of inner mongolia here are the analysis results 1 according to inner mongolia s most strict water resources management system control target iwra of bayannur in 2025 is expected to be 5 099 billion m3 2 calculating the iwr of bayannur via goal programming model finds that agricultural iwr in 2025 is expected to be 4 66 billion m3 91 39 of the total water rights iwra for industrial domestic ecological and urban public water use are 22 47 million m3 54 41 million m3 45 28 million m3 and 61 91 million m3 accounting for 0 44 1 07 0 89 and 1 21 respectively governmental reserved water is calculated as 254 95 million m3 5 of the total water rights 3 based on the previous water use patterns this study determined the proportion of agricultural iwra of hetao irrigation district in 2025 as 43 80 billion m3 94 of the total iwr iwra of industry is a critical method to enhance water resource management governments can set priority weights of each industry and carry out iwra of industry in an equitable and effective manner to

24257,in september 2019 the chinese government elevated ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin to a major national strategy however the scarcity and inequitable distribution of water resources in the basin remain a tough and urgent problem therefore this study probed into the initial water rights allocation iwra of industry in the yellow river basin driven by high quality development first based on the status quo of water resources in the basin this study proposed principles of iwra of industry were total quantity control safeguard fairness and efficiency next the paper set the industry water priority based on the configuration rules constructed a goal programming model for iwra of industry anticipated the ideal value via the gray model 1 1 gm 1 1 and suggested iwra for end users through both quota method and water demand proportion last this study calculated that the initial water rights iwr for hetao irrigation district in bayannur city of inner mongolia should be 4 38 billion m3 theories and methods put forward in this paper helps enhance water resources management and improve the high quality development of the yellow river basin graphical

rights data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is an indispensable resource for human survival and development at present the world suffers severe scarcity of water resources according to un world water development report 2022 two fifths of world population lack water for domestic use nearly 4 billion people have encountered water shortage at least one month a year and up to 2 1 billion people are forced to drink contaminated water china faces the similar predicament to be specific china ranks low in water resources per capita worldwide only 28 of the world average level statistics of ministry of water resources of china show that about 60 of chinese cities lack water supply and 17 suffer serious water shortage among the socioeconomically fast developing megacities and coastal cities around 94 of megacities and 64 coastal cities severely lack water lu et al 2022a water has gradually turned from a supporting resource into a constrained resource making effective water management urgent and important bai et al 2022 1 1 iwr and iwra of industry the iwra in overseas started in the mid 1950s countries and regions according to their own social systems water state cultures and traditions continued to use their conventional allocation methods occupation oriented bank oriented or condition oriented and tried to optimize allocation via legislation and process simulation gopalakrishnan 1973 in china water resources are state owned and the state council of china shall exercise ownership of water resources on behalf of the country so to better utilize water resources different subjects are entitled to use water basin or regional water rights to separate the ownership and rights of use in other words the iwra to be more specific the iwr refer to the right to use water that different departments or sectors in an administrative district get from the first water quantity allocation and water drawing permit li and zhao 2005 it is the boundary of the total amount and interest of water taken by a basin or region chen et al 2021a and should take into account the fairness and efficiency of water use among different regions wu et al 2013 it is a critical demonstration of how the chinese government exerts its rights to use water resources for that many scholars conducted researches on iwra models from three major perspectives iwra in combination with administrative configuration wang et al 2008 using the mixing mechanism to allocate and research the iwr chen and wu 2010 benjamin 2015 javier et al 2016 building the coupling mechanism to research iwra xevi et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 condon and maxwell 2013 in china iwra is from the state to provinces autonomous regions municipalities cities counties townships sectors and finally end users wu and wang 2017 within a basin the iwr of provinces or cities are allocated according to the national distribution plan and the total amount and rights of water drawing are embodied as regional water consumption index including the control index of total water use and the water quantity distribution index of rivers and many scholars conducted extensive studies on china s iwra based on the water policy they considered the development goals history and status quo of water departments built the model and proposed suggestions of iwra to help implement relevant national allocation plans zhang et al 2014 yao et al 2019 the term industry refers to groups of companies or individuals that produce or provide a particular kind of good or service in national economy china water resources bulletin calculates the annual water consumption of industry from agricultural industrial residential including urban public water use and ecological supplement use iwra of industry plays a critical supporting role in regional iwr management diao and cui 2017 however there is no specific policy on iwra of industry for guidance but scholars have made great efforts in this aspect wang et al 2009 employed a large scale multi objective optimization method summarized four major types of water use in ningxia hui autonomous region of china domestic agricultural industrial and ecological water use built an optimized model for iwra of industry by calculating the allocation parameters of each industry additionally wu et al 2010 proposed the basic iwra principles based on the development goals of each industry in detail they established priority levels of right holders built a goal programming model for iwra and made an empirical analysis on the daling river in china zhang et al 2020a grounded in risk control and gini coefficient constructed a two stage stochastic programming framework offering ideas and methods for iwra 1 2 the high quality development and iwra of the yellow river basin according to the report of the 19th national congress of the communist party of china in 2017 china s economy has entered a new phase of shifting from high speed development to high quality development the economic meanings of high speed growth and high quality development are all to increase the amount of use value and meet the growing needs of the people by producing more use value peng and yu 2019 high speed development attaches too much importance to the supply of products and services and pursues the goals of income and gdp while excessively pursuing the speed growth it has accumulated numerous contradictions and problems such as the increase of the gap between the rich and the poor environmental deterioration etc however high quality development pays more attention to the use value and quality desirability of products and economic activities although income and gdp are still the goals it will become particularly important whether or not the economy can operate effectively and make progress and whether or not the supply side can meet the people s growing needs for a better life to a greater extent wen et al 2021 the new development philosophy is the general requirement for all aspects of economic and social development in all regions high quality development has expanded from the economic sector to all sectors and regions and has become a long term development strategy that china must adhere to in september 2019 the chinese government elevated ecological protection and high quality development as a major national strategy the high quality development of the yellow river basin can drive the coordinated development of local economy ecological security and cultural heritage yu and fang 2020 water shortage has been hindering the basin s progress therefore the key to high quality development is to relieve water scarcity chen and jin 2019 water shortage in the yellow river basin arises from not only insufficient eco flow protection but inequitable water allocation and regulation as well shen et al 2020a an overall strategy based on the status quo of water development and utilization zhang 2020c to guarantee the volume quality and efficiency of water resources wei et al 2021 can further promote the high quality development of the yellow river basin in the research about iwra of yellow river basin jia et al 2020 based on the new trends in water and sand proportions and regional supply and demand of water estimated the reserved ecological water demand including sediment yield alternative water resources from the south north water transfer project and seawater utilization for the downstream as well as the industrial water demand along the midstream and upstream of the yellow river in doing so they helped formulate new plans that distribute more water to the midstream and upstream of the yellow river in addition guan et al 2021 took the perspective of water saving potential built a two level allocation model for rural households living in canal areas and irrigation districts and also employed gini coefficient to construct a fair model for allocating rights to use water for rural households the following problems however remain to be solved first what principles iwra should follow in the stage of high quality development second studies on iwra of industry a major water consumer should be enriched and expanded to help improve the integrated water resources management this study focuses on the iwra of industry driven by high quality development in the yellow river basin in detail based on the status quo of the basin this study proposed the principle of total quantity control safeguard fairness and efficiency set up the priority of each industry and conducted actual iwra via goal programming model next this study used the gm 1 1 model to calculate the ideal value of iwra of industry in the goal programming model additionally this study put forward an iwra method combining quota method and water demand proportion for end users of industry an outline is shown in fig 1 2 study area this section briefly introduced the basic situation of the yellow river basin and put forward the principle of iwra of industry under the guidance of high quality development and the situation of water resource dilemma in the basin 2 1 overview of study area originated from sanjiangyuan there river source area dubbed the water tower of china the yellow river flows through nine provinces regions such as qinghai and sichuan and eventually into the bohai sea it covers a length of 5464 km and is one of china s largest rivers second only to the yangtze river the yellow river basin is located at 96 119 e 32 52 n about 1900 km in length from east to west and 1100 km in width from south to north covering a total drainage area of 795 thousand km2 as a key eco corridor it is crucial for sustaining grain production and energy security pan et al 2020 li et al 2020b the yellow river basin extends through nine provinces region qinghai province sichuan province gansu province ningxia hui autonomous region inner mongolia autonomous region shaanxi province shanxi province henan province and shandong province with broader scale and close interaction among provinces region taken into account this study chose to focus on the nine provinces region of the yellow river basin the yellow river basin is a key economic development area in china chen et al 2020 according to china statistic yearbook 2021 in 2020 the gdp of the basin was 25 39 trillion yuan accounting for 25 05 of the national gdp and its gdp grew at a rate of 3 2 faster than the national level 0 45 in detail the value added of the primary industry including forestry animal husbandry and fishery secondary industry including mining manufacturing electricity gas and construction and tertiary industry including transportation warehousing postal services and other industries except the primary and secondary industries were 2 3 trillion yuan 9 9 trillion yuan and 12 79 trillion yuan taking up 29 53 25 8 and 23 18 respectively of the national number the data shows that the primary sector of the basin plays a critical role across china the available water resources in the yellow river basin are mainly transit water insufficient for whole basin water use in 2020 the total water volume of the basin was 649 08 billion m3 accounting for 20 54 of the national water volume and 24 46 of the water volume in the yangtze river basin shortage and inequitable distribution of water resources forced the yellow river basin to initiate iwra many years ago in september 1987 the state council of china approved the yellow river water allocation scheme 87 scheme in short based on the actual water consumption in 1980 the 87 scheme considered the irrigation scale growth in industrial and urban water consumption of each province or region to accordingly distributed the available water furthermore the scheme made clear of the iwr of each province in the yellow river basin serving as even at present the basis of water drawing lin et al 2014 however the scheme lacks dynamic or compulsory solutions and cannot produce solid results now as the basin is entering the stage of high quality development industry has become a major engine of progress so equitable iwra of industry helps improve the efficiency of water use solve water issues and strengthen water management in the basin 2 2 principles for iwra of industry driven by high quality development in the yellow river basin in october 2021 the state council of china issued outline of the yellow river basin s ecological protection and high quality development plan the outline proposed to make whole basin water allocation plans in a coordinated manner distribute enough water for ecological domestic and production water use at the same time based on the status quo of water resources and economic development of the basin the following principles are determined for iwra of industry driven by high quality development 1 total quantity control china has integrated the total quantity control system into laws regulations and documents related to water resources for the yellow river basin a basin that suffers from water shortage iwra of industry must consider the bearing capacity of its water resources status quo of water use and future water demand at the same time the sum of iwr of industry should not surpass the total volume of available water 2 safeguard in iwra of industry for the basin domestic and ecological water use must be put in the first place domestic water is necessary to satisfy basic needs thus must be secured preferentially in the meantime the eco system of the basin is already vulnerable the number of fish in the yellow river s main stream declined from 125 in the 1980s to 47 in 2007 northern copper fish bony lip yellow river fish and so on are precious endangered aquatic wild animals xie et al 2018 lu et al 2022b so maintaining enough water for the ecological environment is also of great significance 3 fairness industries in the basin have formed up their own water use patterns in the past years therefore based on the principle of fairness the iwra of industry in the basin must consider the water use habits of each industry and the status quo of water consumption 4 efficiency iwra of industry must be aware of the scarcity value of water lu et al 2021 in the yellow river basin each industry makes unique contributions to the economy of the basin and the country at large hence the principle of efficiency must be followed to equally allocate water resources 3 method in this section the goal programming model of iwra for industry and end users in the yellow river basin are constructed based on the requirements of the model gm 1 1 is used to calculate the ideal value of the model 3 1 goal programming model of iwra of industry in reality some multi objective decision making problems are characterized by complexity dominance and hierarchy goodarzian and nasab 2019 in this type of problems there are usually multiple goals and each goal has an ideal value to be achieved at the same time the importance of each goal is different so it is necessary to rank the importance of each target the goal programming model can effectively solve the problems with the above characteristics brouer et al 2014 the model is based on the basic theory of linear programming the basic idea of the model is that due to the restrictions of various conditions each objective function is difficult to achieve its expected value therefore positive and negative deviation variables are introduced to combine the original constraint equations to form new constraint conditions and the scheme with the minimum deviation is obtained based on the goal setting zhao 1987 the goal programming model combines the objective importance of the multi objective decision making problem the ideal value of the objective function and analyzes other data to obtain a series of decision making schemes for complex economic activities for decision makers to choose the goal programming model can be solved on lindo software by using the sequential algorithm the idea of the sequential algorithm is to decompose the linear goal programming into multiple single objective linear programming according to the goal priority and solve them in turn mhanna and mancarella 2022 the application steps of the goal planning model mainly include step 1 determining the priority of goals step 2 determining the model constraint conditions weight coefficients positive and negative deviations step 3 achieving functions and solving li et al 2020a this study decided on the goal programming model for iwra of industry in china iwra is carried out by governmental departments with focus on fairness efficiency wang et al 2020 however given the water shortage iwra may not be able to meet the demand of all users so the priorities of users must be made clear domestic ecological and urban public water use need to be more prioritized and their water demands should be met to the maximum extent as for the principle of fairness users demands should be met according to previous water use patterns as for the principle of efficiency users with higher water use efficiency and benefit should be given more initial water rights li et al 2019 all in all the goal programming model can deal with the scenarios above w σ σ 1 2 3 4 5 6 represents the iwr of domestic ecological urban public industrial agricultural water use and governmental reserved water the ideal value of the iwr for each user is assigned as subgoal to set the positive and negative deviation variables represented as d σ and d σ the above mentioned principles are employed to prioritize water users as for the principle of priority domestic water use comes first denoted as p1 ecological water use is pivotal to the sustainable ecosystem the second level of priority denoted as p2 urban public water use is essential to public activities the third level of priority denoted as p3 industrial and agricultural water use is for production and management the fourth level of priority denoted as p4 in addition different weight coefficients are used to rank the importance of industrial and agricultural water use details of modeling and solution are as follows 1 analysis on model constraints and weight coefficients p1 constraint on domestic water use iwra for domestic water use should be no less than the target value 1 w 1 d 1 d 1 w l where w l is the target value of iwr for domestic water use in the planning year product of the planning year population and water consumption per capita over the past years d 1 and d 1 are the positive deviation variable the target value of iwr for domestic water use is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of iwr for domestic water use is underachieved respectively p2 constraint on ecological water use iwra for ecological water use should be no less than the target value 2 w 2 d 2 d 2 w e where w e is the target value of iwr for ecological water use in the planning year obtained by predicting via gm 1 1 model and based on the previous water use patterns d 2 and d 2 are positive deviation variable the target value of iwr for ecological water use is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of iwr for ecological water use is underachieved respectively p3 constraint on urban public water use iwra for urban public water use should be no less than the target value 3 w 3 d 3 d 3 w u p where w u p is the target value of iwr for urban public water use in the planning year obtained by predicting via gm 1 1 model and based on the previous water use patterns d 3 and d 3 are positive deviation variable the target value of iwr for urban public water use is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of iwr for urban public water use is underachieved respectively p4 constraint and weight coefficient on agricultural and industrial water use proportion of iwra for agricultural or industrial water use should be no less than the proportion of average water consumption in the past years 4 w 4 d 4 d 4 w a κ 4 5 w 5 d 5 d 5 w a κ 5 where 6 κ 4 y 1 u q y arg y 1 u q y 7 κ 5 y 1 u q y i n d y 1 u q y

water consumption in the past years to total water consumption κ 5 the ratio of average industrial water consumption in the past years to total water consumption d 4 and d 4 are the positive deviation variable the target value of agricultural iwr is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of agricultural iwr is underachieved respectively d 5 and d 5 are the positive deviation variable the target value of industrial iwr is overachieved and the negative deviation variable the target value of industrial iwr is underachieved respectively q y arg and q y i n d represent the water consumption of agriculture and industry in year y and q y represents the total water consumption in year y y 1 2 u agriculture and industry are at the same priority level so their weight coefficients are determined by industrial outlook and characteristics to be specific in areas dominated by agriculture agricultural iwra has higher weight coefficient in areas dominated by industry industrial iwra has higher weight coefficient however product value per unit of industry is higher than that of agriculture so it is meaningless to compare the annual value added of agriculture and industry in the same city therefore this study decided on the proportion of local agricultural industrial value added to the corresponding provincial the administrative unit above city

industry for end users a critical task for improving national water rights system and strengthening water resources management is to allocate clear rights to end users iwra of industry may not be able to meet the needs of all end users so the actual water demand of end users is not a reasonable basis for iwra instead their water demand proportions should be included to build an iwra model 12 w u s e r s w d u s e r s w d s w s where w u s e r s is the iwra to end users of industry s w d s the total water demand of industry s w d u s e r s the water demand of users of industry s and w s the iwr of industry s in this study water demand of end users of industry was predicted via the quota method water quota refers to the water demand per unit of product or area or the domestic water demand per capita per unit of time yi et al 2019 quotas are determined by technical guideline of stipulation for norm of water intake under the principles of being scientific rational moderate and practical such measure considers the total water quantity water demand as well as water saving investment technologies and devices in different regions or industries and sticks to the basic state policy of water conservancy in a word it is an effective measure that enhances management on total water quantity in china there are insufficient water resources yet too many end users so allocating water for users according to quotas makes it easier to check and manage hence this study employed the simple and practical quota method 13 w d u s e r s i 1 m w c n i w s i n i t i where w d u s e r s is the total water demand of users in industry s w c n i the quota for user i w s i the water use scale of user i e g planting area of crops or industrial output n i the water use times of user i in unit time and t i the total water use time of user i 3 3 predicting the objective value of industry water use via gm 1 1 model limited by the level of technology and cognition human beings cannot fully understand the components or development characteristics of complex systems but are in the state of part of the information is known and the other part is unknown so the data about these complex systems is also limited liu 2014 however in order to explore the development trend of complex systems it is necessary to analyze and predict these systems with small samples poor information and uncertainty the gray prediction model can meet the prediction needs of these complex systems gm 1 1 is a commonly used gray prediction mode designed to systemically generate and extract valuable information and find patterns to quantitively predict complicated results shen et al 2020b it is not demanding on data yet easy to operate and able to produce accurate results the application steps of gm 1 1 model include step 1 the grade ratio test of the original sequence and the data that fails the test needs to be translated step 2 the original sequence is generated by accumulation step 3 fitting to obtain whitening equation step 4 use the least square method to calculate the parameters and obtain the time response formula of the gray prediction model step 5 model accuracy inspection step 6 use the model meeting the accuracy requirements to carry out prediction wang et al 2018 this study used the gm 1 1 model to predict the objective value of iwra of industry in the yellow river basin iwra of industry always puts ecology first by maintaining the patterns of ecological water use therefore in this study the previous patterns of both ecological and urban public water use were considered which are an integral basis of urban public service to predict the water use in the planning year via gm 1 1 model to guarantee the regional water demand and carry out equitable iwra of industry the

section we applied the model built in 3 method to calculate the iwr of hetao irrigation district of bayannur city in the yellow river basin first it introduced the general situation of hetao irrigation district then analysed the iwr of industry of bayannur city and finally obtained the iwr of hetao irrigation district 4 1 overview of hetao irrigation district in bayannur city hetao irrigation district is located in bayannur city in the west of inner mongolia of china the north end of the ji shaped bend of the yellow river over 200 km in length from east to west and 40 60 km in width from south to north with a total land area of about 1 12 million hm2 it is one of the three super large irrigation districts in china and the largest artesian water diversion irrigation district in asia additionally hetao is in a desert and arid area with low rainfall and high evaporation about 130 mm of average annual rainfall and 2300 mm of average annual evaporation the main source of its agricultural water is the yellow river chen et al 2021b hetao irrigation district is a key base for marketable grain and oil production in china according to statistical communiqué of bayannur city on the 2020 municipal economic and social development hetao produced approximately 2 76 billion kg crops in 2020 accounting for over 90 of the gross agricultural output of bayannur the water consumption of hetao irrigation district is large but the water resources are seriously insufficient therefore it is of great practical significance to carry out the iwra in hetao irrigation district chen et al 2022 4 2 iwra in hetao irrigation district of bayannur city 4 2 1 data source in this section iwr of hetao irrigation district will be calculated based on data from government documents like the strictest water resources management system goals of inner mongolia 2014 2020 inner mongolia water resources bulletin 2014 2022 bayannur water resources bulletin statistical communiqué of bayannur city on the 2014 2020 municipal economic and social development and the website of national bureau of statistics of china and so on 4 2 2 analysis on iwr of bayannur city inner mongolia was one of the first provinces regions that pioneered in iwra the scheme 87 based on the water consumption of the yellow river allocated 5 4 billion m3 of iwr to inner mongolia therefore this study guided by the strictest water resources management system policy in china took the total water use of inner mongolia as its iwr and the regional total water use as iwr of each region relevant policies have made clear regulations on the total water use in 2020 and 2030 as a result this study took the year 2025 as the planning year to calculate the iwr of inner mongolia and bayannur in 2025 via arithmetic mean next according to the strictest water resources management system goals of inner mongolia this study further determined the corresponding iwra results in inner mongolia and bayannur as shown in table 2 according to table 2 iwr of bayannur in 2025 w a is 5 099 billion m3 4 2 3 calculating iwr of industry in bayannur city the iwr of hetao irrigation district mainly come from iwr for agricultural irrigation in bayannur so in the section iwr of industry in bayannur will be first allocated 1 expected value of iwr for domestic water use in the planning year in the past years the average natural population growth rate of bayannur is 2 63 domestic water consumption per capita is about 31 62 m3 year person so based on the population in 2019 the total domestic water consumption of bayannur in 2025 w l is expected to be 54 41 million m3 2 expected value of iwr for ecological water use in the planning year ecological water serves to maintain a healthy eco system but the eco environment of yellow river basin is fragile so while striving for high quality development the basin must see ecological protection as a top priority considering the status quo of ecological water use in bayannur and based on eqs 14 20 and gm 1 1 model the ecological water consumption of bayannur in 2025 w e is expected to be 61 91 million m3 average relative error 2 58 within the acceptance range suitable to be the expected value of the iwr 3 expected value of iwr for urban public water use in the planning year urban public water use is for maintaining the functions of the city and people s daily life considering the status quo of urban public water use in bayannur and based on eqs 14 20 and gm 1 1 model the urban public water consumption of bayannur in 2025 w u p is expected to be 45 28 million m3 average relative error 1 9 within the acceptance range suitable to be the expected value of the initial water rights 4 expected value of iwr for agricultural and industrial water use in the planning year agricultural and industrial water use is for production and operation less significant than domestic ecological and urban public water use the iwra for bayannur may not be able to meet the agricultural and industrial water demand as a result considering the status quo of agricultural and industrial water use in bayannur and based on eqs 4 7 the agricultural and industrial water consumption of bayannur during 2014 2020 κ 4 and κ 5 is calculated to take up 96 2 and 1 8 respectively the priority weights of agricultural and industrial water use were determined based on the proportion of value added of agriculture and industry of bayannur in the gdp of inner mongolia during 2014 2020 to highlight the economic contribution of bayannur in inner mongolia and its pillar sectors according to eq 8 the weight coefficient of iwra for agricultural and industrial water use ϖ arg and ϖ i n d is 2 27 1 5 based on previous studies and the status quo of water resources in bayannur this study determined that the governmental reserved water accounts for 5 zhang et al 2020b of the city s iwr w 6 254 95 million m3 according to eq 11 and previous studies dan and wang 2014 and the status quo of water resources in bayannur this study after excluding the governmental reserved water constructed the goal programming model for iwra of industry for bayannur in 2025 21 min y p

hetao irrigation district hetao irrigation district has determined its total water quantity and allocated water quotas and set up channels for registering pilot areas for iwra however farmland patches are scattered and the lack of devices and facilities measuring water quantity make it hard to carry out the iwr registration further hindering iwra of hetao via quota method sun et al 2021 in china agriculture consumes plenty of water resources mainly for irrigation and the irrigation water in bayannur is mainly used in hetao irrigation district it has been calculated that in the past years the proportion of hetao s average irrigation water consumption in agricultural water consumption of bayannur is 94 hence the agricultural iwr for hetao irrigation district w h e t a o a is 4 38 billion m3 4 2 5 analysis of changes in parameters this paper constructed a goal programming model to allocate iwr in hetao irrigation district bayannur city the yellow river basin in this process some parameters need to be set in advance some parameters are based on the government department files some parameters are based on the calculation results of other indicators indicator settings may have different effects on allocation results in this section one at a time oat is used to analyze parameter changes that is one parameter is selected each time under the premise that other parameters remain unchanged the influence of the selected parameter on the model value is studied by adjusting the value of the selected parameter hwang et al 1997 pisoni et al 2010 this paper mainly analyzed the influence of the change of w a w 6 κ 4 κ 5 ϖ arg and ϖ i n d on the calculation results w a is the total amount of regional distributable water w 6 is the emergency water volume which needs to be deducted before the iwra of the industry in the model κ 4 κ 5 ϖ arg and ϖ i n d affected the proportion of the iwra of agriculture and industry and had a more direct regulatory role for the model results the actual meaning of the parameter and the source of the data determine the adjustment range of the parameter in eq 21 w a is 5 099 billion m3 which is based on the calculation results of government documents the adjustment range determined by referring to table 2 is from 4 952 billion m3 to 5 246 billion m3 w 6 is 254 95 million m3 which is determined according to the research results of relevant literature therefore the adjustment range of this parameter is 10 upward or downward respectively from 203 96 million m3 to 305 94 million m3 κ 4 and κ 5 is 96 2 and 1 8 respectively which are the calculation results of the industry s average annual water consumption therefore the industry s annual water consumption from 2014 to 2020 are selected as the adjustment range κ 4 is from 95 85 to 96 58 and κ 5 is from 1 71 to 2 04 ϖ arg and ϖ i n d are decided according to the proportion of the industry s average annual added value so the adjustment range of the parameters is respectively 50 higher of the existing data only one parameter is changed at a time and the other parameters remain unchanged and they are substituted in eq 21 the parameter variation range and the iwra of hetao irrigation district are shown in table 4 according to table 4 the impact of changes of the six parameters selected in this paper on the model values is shown in fig 2 in fig 2 1 with the increase of iwr in bayannur city the iwr in hetao irrigation district are also increasing the regional iwr is the total amount of water resources that can be used in a region and the increase of the total amount will inevitably lead to the increase of that of water users in the region as shown in fig 2 2 with the increase of water reserved by bayannur municipal government the iwr of hetao irrigation district decreases as the government reserved water has an emergency role it is usually deducted from the total amount at the beginning of the iwra so the more the government reserved water the less the distributable water and the less the iwr in hetao irrigation district in fig 2 3 the larger the proportion of historical agricultural water consumption in bayannur city the more water that can be allocated in hetao irrigation district in the iwra of the industry this paper identifies the characteristics of industry water use and follows the its water use habits hetao irrigation district is the largest water user in bayannur city and the agricultural water consumption is always large in fig 2 4 the historical industrial water consumption of bayannur city has little impact on the iwra of hetao irrigation district the industrial development of city is relatively slow and the industrial water consumption is small so it has little impact on the iwra of agriculture as shown in fig 2 5 the average agricultural added value for many years has little impact on the iwra in hetao irrigation district in the goal programming model of this paper priority is given to water volume factors such as the role of regional iwra and historical water consumption of the industry therefore the average agricultural added value for many years as the weight coefficient of the distribution has little impact on the final distribution result in fig 2 6 with the increase of average industrial added value for many years the iwra of hetao irrigation district is different the changes of the average industrial added value in the early years have not affected the calculation results of the model with the industrial development of bayannur city the enhancement of industrial economic strength has led to the tilt of iwra to industry with a certain total amount the agricultural iwr will be reduced from the actual situation as a city focusing on agricultural development bayannur city has few times more industrial output value than agriculture based on the above analysis the change of parameters will lead to the change of the final result of iwra in hetao irrigation district however when the parameter value that conforms to the actual value is selected the unique and effective results can be obtained 5 discussion this study probed into iwra of industry in the yellow river basin driven by high quality development based on the status quo of water resources and social economic development in the basin this study proposed the principles of total quantity control safeguard fairness and efficiency determined the priority weight of each sector via the goal programming model this paper constructed the iwra model of the industry and anticipated the ideal value of the model by gm 1 1 in addition this study proposed the model of iwra for end users based on their water use patterns this study carried out an empirical analysis on the iwra of bayannur city in inner mongolia in 2025 results show that①agricultural iwr accounted for 91 39 of the total water rights compared with the average annual water consumption of agriculture it decreases by 2 71 with a small change indicating that water resources in bayannur are mainly used for agricultural production ②iwr for industrial was accounting for 0 44 compared with the average annual water consumption the industrial iwr changed greatly which may be mainly due to the serious waste of industrial water and it is not the focus of economic development of the city so the iwr is reduced ③iwr of domestic water accounted for 1 07 of the total which increased by 21 59 compared with the average water consumption for many years indicating a great change the main reason is that the distribution model proposed in this paper firstly considered domestic water so as to ensure all the demands of domestic water as much as possible ④iwr of urban public water accounts for 0 89 of the total which increased by 1 75 compared with the average water consumption for many years showing a small change ⑤the ecological iwr accounted for 1 21 of the total which increased by 43 25 compared with the average water consumption for many years the main reason is that in the past the city s ecological water consumption was small and the ecological water security was insufficient however based on the high quality development this paper considered the growth demand of ecological water and gives priority to ecological water security ⑥as the iwr are difficult to be allocated for hetao irrigation district via quota method water demand proportion is hence applied the water consumption in the area was mainly irrigation water accounting for 85 91 of the total water rights compared with the average water consumption in the area for many years the water consumption decreased by 3 32 with little change if the iwr cannot meet the industry demand water conservation or water purchase through water right transaction can be considered if the iwr can meet the industry demand and has surplus water it can also be considered to sell water through water right trading in the statistics of water consumption of china governmental reserved is generally not included so there is no historical data about it this paper studies the yellow river basin under the high quality development which is a major development strategy for china the yellow river basin is in a new stage with water resources still the major obstacle hindering its progress current studies mainly focus on water allocation based on the basic situation of the basin lin et al 2014 not on the high quality development strategies the research results have some limitations to guide the development of watershed this study nonetheless is grounded in iwra driven by high quality development in line with the development demand of the basin and suitable for practical application this paper studies the iwra of industry in the yellow river basin current studies on iwra mainly focus on two aspects first iwra for provinces autonomous regions direct administered municipalities in the basin wu et al 2012 wu and wang 2017 second iwra for cities counties townships under provinces autonomous regions direct administered municipalities diao and cui 2017 the iwra of industry plays a connecting role in regional water management on the one hand the iwr index of the city county township is decomposed to realize the total water use control of the region on the other hand it is helpful to understand the water consumption of the industry and facilitate the total management of the terminal water users this study looked into iwra of industry in the yellow river basin and built a goal programming model offering an effective method for quantitatively analyzing iwr this study still has the following limits first this study employed the gm 1 1 model to anticipate the ideal value of agricultural industrial domestic urban public and ecological water use but neglected other influencing factors second bayannur city is located in an arid area so the governmental reserved water is mainly for emergencies based on previous studies this study determined it take up 5 of the total water rights a proportion much higher than the iwra for industrial ecological and urban public water use whether it is practical for the city needs further exploration 6 conclusion based on the status quo of water resources and socioeconomic development of the basin this study probed into iwra of industry proposed the principles of total quantity control safeguard fairness and efficiency in doing so this study determined the priority weight of each industry built a goal programming model for iwra of industry in the basin driven by high quality development and an iwra calculation model for end users and ran an empirical analysis on the iwr of hetao irrigation district in bayannur city of inner mongolia here are the analysis results 1 according to inner mongolia s most strict water resources management system control target iwra of bayannur in 2025 is expected to be 5 099 billion m3 2 calculating the iwr of bayannur via goal programming model finds that agricultural iwr in 2025 is expected to be 4 66 billion m3 91 39 of the total water rights iwra for industrial domestic ecological and urban public water use are 22 47 million m3 54 41 million m3 45 28 million m3 and 61 91 million m3 accounting for 0 44 1 07 0 89 and 1 21 respectively governmental reserved water is calculated as 254 95 million m3 5 of the total water rights 3 based on the previous water use patterns this study determined the proportion of agricultural iwra of hetao irrigation district in 2025 as 43 80 billion m3 94 of the total iwr iwra of industry is a critical method to enhance water resource management governments can set priority weights of each industry and carry out iwra of industry in an equitable and effective manner to

24258,our former assessment of viability in a local population of androsace albana an alpine short lived perennial plant species logofet et al 2020b relied upon 10 year observations of the population structure on permanent sample plots and the corresponding time inhomogeneous matrix model of stage structured population dynamics we applied a concept of the population in a random environment and its stochastic growth rate λ s estimated by a monte carlo technique under the so called i i d mode of randomness a simple model popular in the literature meaning independent identically distributed environments all the monte carlo tests resulted in the estimates of λ s 1 meaning a negative forecast of population viability a recent expansion of the monitoring period up to 13 years has now been combined with a more realistic model of randomness namely a markov chain of changes in the environment that is recovered from a longer time series of a local weather index correlated with variations in the asymptotic growth rate λ 1 of the model population within the 13 year period the former design of monte carlo tests with the updated time series of λ 1s and the realistic model of randomness have principally changed the viability assessment to λ s 1 whereas the i i d tests have still resulted in λ s 1 i e a qualitatively opposite forecast of population viability an alternative approach to the viability assessment guides to the original concept of pattern multiplicative average of nonnegative matrices and reduces to calculating λ 1 g the dominant eigenvalue of the average matrix g unexpectedly λ 1 g turns out less than 1 thus suggesting a conceptual revision of how the local population viability should be predicted graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords discrete structured population life cycle graph matrix calibration asymptotic growth rate pattern geometric average stochastic growth rate markov chain monte carlo data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in modern theory and practice of population ecology the assessment of population viability relies mostly on mathematical models calibrated vs monitoring data on the one hand the longer is the time series of data the more reliable should the outcome be considered on the other hand a long time series of monitoring data causes another kind of problem when the matter is about matrix models for stage structured population dynamics caswell 2001 logofet and salguero gómez 2021 while a pair of successive observation years is sufficient to calibrate the population projection matrix ppm the core of the matrix model different pairs lead to different annual ppms hence to different often contrasting values of λ 1 the asymptotic growth rate of the population in a constant environment when λ 1 serves a basis to forecast population viability the successive forecasts may turn out contradicting i e indicating either population growth or decline table 3 in logofet et al 2020a what the current literature on matrix population models suggests to resolve the contradiction was called the stochastic growth rate λ s of the population in random environments tuljapurkar 1986 1990 caswell 2001 however the stochastic growth rate has its own methodic problems sanz 2019 logofet et al 2020 related to the artificial mode of randomness inherent in the calculations we have proposed an alternative approach to forecasting the population viability from a long series of monitoring data logofet 2019 the approach relying on the novel concept of matrix averaging namely the pattern geometric or pattern multiplicative average of nonnegative matrices logofet 2018 the novelty consists in the plain idea that the average matrix g should have the same zero nonzero pattern as the matrices to be averaged ibidem in terms of the matrix population model it means that g is associated with the same given life cycle graph for the species under study that the ppms to be averaged the simple formulation has however faced with a principal problem when applied to case studies logofet et al 2018 2019 2020b a system of algebraic equations to find the unknown positive elements of matrix g turns out to be overdetermined branham 1990 academic 2022 and has no exact solution the approximate solution reduces to a nonlinear constrained minimization problem for the approximation error which can be attacked by standard software routines such as fmincon in matlab mathworks 2022a but faces in turn an eternal issue of the local vs global character of what they return what the software offers to resolve the issue mathworks 2022b requires fine tuning of the routine parameters but can hardly guarantee the absolute result in these circumstances the both methods to forecast population viability need comprehention and further development and the both ought to be applied to case studies to result in more reliable forecasts the case study we analyze here comprises 13 years of monitoring a local population of androsace albana an alpine short lived perennial inhabiting heathlands in the north west caucasus section 2 we introduce the both methods emphasizing their recent improvements section 3 and present the outcomes of the both applied to the a albana case study section 4 the features deserving further attention are discussed in section 5 2 objects 2 1 androsace albana case study androsace albana is a herbaceous short lived perennial plant inhabiting alpine lichen heaths and other habitats logofet et al 2018 it is listed in the red book of the krasnodar region 2007 and the red book of the adygea republic 2012 as a rare species the identified individuals data i e when the individuals are marked and followed over time caswell 2001 p 134 were obtaining from permanent sample plots laid down on the malaya khatipara mountain north west caucasus each august in the 2009 2018 period logofet et al 2020b and the time series of data has now been extended to 2021 successive ontogenetic stages are shown in fig 1 the stages being distinguishable from the above ground morphology of plants and the corresponding column vectors x t pl t j t im t v t g t t of the population structure observed at the year t are presented in table 1 as regards population recruitment the species features a seed reproduction alone hence the life cycle graph lcg a picture of the transitions that individuals can do between stages in one year should look as is shown in fig 2 i with a stage of dormant seeds as the initial one of ontogeny however the parameters associated with seed production and germination are highly uncertain in the field and we therefore exclude seeds from the model lcg fig 2 ii like many other authors did without any justification kendall et al 2019 compadre 2022 we explain below section 5 how such an exclusion is justified in our case in the lcg of this model fig 2 ii the delays in the im and v stages occur due to the harsh conditions of high mountains forcing plants to resort to the space holder strategy körner 2003 staying or growing in one place for as long as possible accelerated transitions pl im occur as a manifestation of polyvariant ontogeny in a albana under conditions of the alpine belt in the north western caucasus the individuals exhibit different rates of ontogeny so that the recruis are found in either of the stage specific groups pl j or im at the moment of census 2 2 matrix model of stage structured population dynamics mathematically this kind of model represents a system of difference equations for the components of the population structure vector caswell 1989 2001 logofet 1993 when written down in the vector matrix form the system that corresponds to the lcg in fig 2 b looks as follows 1 x t 1 l t x t t 2009 2010 2020 where matrix l t has the following zero nonzero pattern 2 l 0 0 0 0 a d 0 0 0 b e f h 0 c 0 0 k l 0 0 0 0 m 0 a b l m 0 when we deal with the identified individuals type of data the ppm can already be calibrated from the data of only two successive time moments namely of the beginning t and the end t 1 of a single time step ibidem thus 13 observation years give rise to 12 annual ppms table 2 calibrated in rational numbers as the average numbers a b c of recruits found at the corresponding recruiting stages p j im and the observed frequencies d e m of transitions between stages different time varying values of matrix elements result in respectively different characteristics even conflicting ones of the population such as the asymptotic growth rate λ 1 the dominant eigenvalue of the annual ppm and the steady state structure the corresponding eigenvector x six of the 12 annual ppms have their λ 1s located to the left of 1 meaning extinction and the other six to the right of 1 population growth table 2 so that any ad hoc guess on the ensuing population viability would be problematic 3 methods 3 1 stochastic growth rate as an index of population viability the paradigm of population growth in random environments tuljapurkar 1990 caswell 2001 treats a set of calibrated annual ppms as an indirect reflection of the spectrum of potential variations the population was exposed to in its environment each particular matrix being responsible for the whole complex of environmental conditions that has determined the corresponding set of vital rates matrix elements for a given year the random variations in the environment through time are therefore reduced to a random choice from the given set of ppms in a long theoretically infinite sequence of transformations l τ that act successively on the population vector such a sequence was long ago proved to converge with probability 1 furstenberg and kesten 1960 oseledec 1968 cohen 1979a b to the limit that defined what is nowadays called the stochastic growth rate λ s 3 lim τ 1 τ log n τ 1 lim τ 1 τ log l τ 1 l 0 x 0 1 here n τ denotes the total population size and 1 gives the vector norm as the sum of vector components in modulus again the value of λ s relative to 1 indicates exponential growth or decline in the total population size thus serving as an index of population viability theoretically the limit of a converging sequence can be accurately approximated by its distant enough member and it is the method we apply to estimate λ s in a series of monte carlo tests to illustrate this fundamental property we conduct the tests with several lengths of finite sequences longer sequences give their final terms that are closer to the sequence limit hence more accurate estimates of λ s however the legitimate desire to lengthen the sequence as far as our machine resource allows faces a technical obstacle a great enough number of multiplications of the initial vector with the matrices some of which have their λ 1s less than 1 while the others having λ 1s greater than 1 table 2 leads eventually to either the computer zero or the computer infinity quite vividly illustrating the idea of exponential decline growth but resulting in a false trivial outcome earlier we already invented a trick that overcomes the obstacle by means of scaling factors appendix c in logofet et al 2019 appendix a in logofet et al 2021 scale 0 and scale retaining all the current terms within reasonable bounds they have enabled us to obtain random sequences 3 up to 1 million terms although the mode of random choice called i i d i e independent identically distributed at each step τ caswell 2001 is the most popular in the literature it should certainly be recognized as a caricature of the reality where the ppms rather follow variations in the environment than obey an artificial rule what we have proposed instead is a markov chain to govern the random choice the chain being correlated with variations in the local environment 3 2 markov chain to govern the random choice we recover the chain from a time series of local whether data correlated to the variations in the λ 1s of annual ppms logofet et al 2020a for the ten annual ppms available two years ago the time series consisted of 59 points and represented the november to may precipitation sums ibidem supplementary material surprising but the expansion of the series just by 2 points has changed the crucial weather index to the previous year august september precipitation sum appendix a albeit it has not changed the method of recovering a markov chain to govern the choice logofet et al 2020a following the method we identify the chain states with those of the environment expressed indirectly as the 12 successive annual ppms with their λ 1s table 2 and the weather index values observed in the corresponding years 2009 2020 table s2 in supplementary material these 12 values now serve as the labels of the chain states and we consider the 61 point series of index values as a chain realization by attributing each particular point to the nearest one among the 12 labels ibidem thus the 60 events of transitions between states or non transitions should result in a set of event frequencies to determine the 12 12 transition matrix p of the governing markov chain if p turns out irreducible and primitive horn and johnson 1990 appendix b then the chain becomes regular kemeny and snell 1960 i e any state of the chain can be reached from any other one for a finite number of time steps thereafter the distribution of chain states tends to a steady state one that is determined by the dominant eigenvector of p normalized to 1 it may also serve as a distribution to provide for the random choice of identically distributed matrices in the i i d construction of sequence 3 3 3 pattern multiplicative average of nonnegative matrices an alternative method to assess the viability in a local population relies on the original concept of pattern multiplicative or pattern geometric average of nonnegative matrices logofet 2018 and reduces to calculating λ 1 g the dominant eigenvalue of the average matrix g since the average matrix is supposed to summarize the whole observation period the logic behind the concept is as follows given the population vectors x 2009 and x 2021 at the initial and terminal moments of observation the former vector transforms to the latter one by means of eq 1 i e by successive multiplication with the 12 annual ppms 4 x 2021 l 2020 l 2019 l 2010 l 2009 x 2009 it is logical to require that the average matrix g does the same when raised to the12th power in formal terms it means that 5 g 12 l 2020 l 2019 l 2010 l 2009 and the task seems trivial at the first glance you have just to extract the 12th power root from the known calculable product of the 12 given ppms however even despite the product being positive all the elements 0 extracting roots from positive matrices is far not so simple as from positive numbers denman 1981 ando et al 2004 bhatia and holbrook 2006 mcdonald et al 2014 tam and huang 2016 for example the routine taking down the 12th power root may even not result in a positive matrix appendix c to say nothing of its being a ppm of a certain pattern hence being considered as an average of ppms in the contrast when averaging a set of ppms i e of nonnegative matrices with a fixed pattern corresponding to a certain lcg we expect the average matrix to represent a ppm too i e to be of the same pattern as the ppms to be averaged and to belong to the same quantitative range as those matrices this is the essence of the concept proposed a few years ago logofet 2018 and called the pattern geometric average of nonnegative matrices by analogy to averaging a pair of nonnegative numbers albeit the pattern multiplicative average pma is a more adequate term note that the simple arithmetic mean does meet all these terms by construction except for the averaging eq 5 but does not bear any biological sense except for the arithmetic one logofet 2013 the next logical step should be just to solve eq 5 for a b l m the 10 unknown elements of the 5 5 matrix g see pattern 2 and pray to the god of algebra but the algebra proves this system of 25 scalar equations for the 10 unknowns and the rest 25 10 15 zeros to be overdetermined hence having no exact solution watson 1979 branham 1990 the situation is general enough as far as any lcg with n nodes implies the n n ppm pattern with a less than n number of positive entries which leads to the lack of an exact solution for the averaging equation the conceptual logic thus faces a principal technical obstacle and the bypassing logic prompts seeking for an approximate solution to the averaging equation now the general logic of approximation is to minimize the error of approximation which can be measured in a number of ways for example we may seek for a solution that minimizes a matrix norm of the left hand side in the equation 6 g 12 l 2020 l 2019 l 2010 l 2009 0 equivalent to 5 albeit the number of ways now lead to choosing a particular norm from a number of matrix ones known in theory however since eq 5 means essentially the equality between projection operators the choice becomes evident is should logically be the operator or frobenius norm mathworks 2022c the task to find the pma of the 12 given ppms reduces therefore to a constrained minimization problem for the operator norm of the left hand side in eq 6 the constraints being determined by matrix g being a ppm of the fixed pattern 2 and lying within the bounds of the ppms to be averaged table 2 as regards the prescribed pattern of the average matrix g its nonnegative elements c d e h turn into zero for some years 2013 2014 2015 table 2 and the matrix of lower ppm bounds carries those zeros respectively too if the optimal solution hits the corresponding boundary points of the feasible set then the corresponding arcs disappear from the prescribed lcg fig 2 b hence the pattern of g now falsifies the very idea of pma to exclude the chance of such a falsification the zero bounds ought to be modified with the minimal positive values of the ppm elements greater detail and routine descriptions can be found in appendix c 4 results 4 1 a albana growth in random environments transition matrix p of the governing markov chain recovered as described in section 3 2 takes on the 12 12 form shown in table 3 we have verified its irreducibility and primitivity by means of the directed graph associated with the matrix appendix b hereby the distribution of the chain states does converge to a steady state one found as the normalized dominant eigenvector of p table 3 it has been used in i i d several series of monte carlo simulations among the others commented below table 4 combines the outcomes from the series of monte carlo simulations under the governing markov chain and two kinds of the i i d choice for various lengths of the finite sequence 3 we see the range of variations in the estimates of λ s to shrink logically with increasing the sequence length at a fixed number of random realizations and to expand with increasing this number when the length is fixed therefore the 1000 realizations of the 1 million long sequence represent the most accurate assessment of the stochastic growth rate by its original definition within our monte carlo simulation scheme the range of λ s estimates lies luckily and totally to the right of 1 thus giving an unambiguously favorable forecast of population viability the two i i d versions of the sequence construction differ from one another in the identical distributions the one meaning equiprobable choice from the 12 given ppms the other distributing them in accordance with vector ss the steady state distribution of markov chain states the former gives λ s 1 i e a negative qualitatively opposite forecast of population viability while the latter just quantitatively differs from the markov chain forecast an explanation of these findings is proposed in section 5 4 2 averaging the annual a albana ppms table 5 presents the outcome of solving the pattern geometric average problem by minimizing the operator norm of the left hand side in eq 6 for the 12 ppms presented in table 2 the minimal value of the norm is considered as the approximation error and it has turned out fairly small equal to 3 930342 10 2 again the arithmetic mean of annual ppms gives markedly greater value of λ 1 with a markedly differing steady state distribution the normalized dominant eigenvector in contrast to the previous findings logofet 2019 for a shorter time series of ppms what the pattern multiplicative average gives now differs qualitatively from the λ s estimates table 4 and we suggest a possible explanation in section 5 5 discussion as noted in section 2 1 the exclusion of seed stage s from the model lcg is a far not trivial issue it is a particular case of the cryptic life stages issue raised recently by kendall et al 2019 and discussed by nguyen et al 2019 and che castaldo et al 2020 the discussion has ended with an obvious conclusion that the exclusion needs careful justification in each particular case to avoid inadequate conclusions from modelling in our case however the seed exclusion has been well grounded by comparing the outcome of the model with a bank of dormant seeds fig 2 i to that of the no seeds model with virtual reproduction fig 2 ii logofet et al 2020c we investigated what might be a family of ppms in the seed bank model within certain wide enough ranges of three uncertain seeds related parameters while the certain vital rates being the same in both models ibidem the task was to detect a set of the seeds related parameters such that the models result in the qualitatively different outcomes i e in their λ 1s located on the different sides of 1 in the real axis two novel features of the matrix population model formalism have enabled us to do so namely the integer valued version of the formalism logofet et al 2020c instead of the traditional one in real numbers caswell 2001 and the original theory of potential growth indicators logofet and belova 2008 protasov and logofet 2014 logofet and razzhevaikin 2021 the former has provided the family of all feasible seed bank ppms for each of 10 calibrated annual no seeds ppms to consist of a finite yet enormous number of quantitatively certain hence analyzable matrices while the latter resulted in quantitatively certain outcomes from the analysis the justice of excluding the seed stage has ensued from the computer verified fact that none of the 10 seed bank ppm families contains any matrix l t with its λ 1 being qualitatively different from that of its no seeds counterpart although we have really detected certain sets of the seeds related parameters such that the λ 1s under comparison are qualitatively different indeed those sets have been always outside of the feasible parameter ranges a real qualitative difference can be seen if we compare the estimates of the stochastic growth rate λ s for 10 table 4 in logofet et al 2020a and 12 annual ppms table 4 it is a common sense logic that the longer is a time series the more information it carries on the process under study even two matrices added to our former set of ten annual ppms have changed the key weather index from november to may precipitation sums ibidem supplementary material to the august september precipitation sum table s1 in supplementary material the effect on the growth rate now becoming negative a rationale behind it may be of two kinds rains and accompanying cloudy weather in autumn reduce insect activity and seed set in rainy weather the seeds ripen worse and are more affected by fungi albeit the issue may well be more complicated combining the effects by several factors so adding the two latest ppms l 10 and l 11 in table 2 has principally changed the estimate from λ s 1 table 4 in logofet et al 2020a to λ s 1 table 4 the estimates should certainly bear a dependence of λ s upon the magnitudes of λ 1 in the ppms to be chosen but such a principal change was not expected a priori since the λ 1 l 10 1 might compensate the λ 1 l 11 1 however the deviation 1 λ 1 l 10 0 1504 is two accurate but occasional times less than λ 1 l 11 1 0 3008 which explains the λ s jumping over 1 note a principal contrast between the outcome from two versions of the i i d series for estimating the stochastic growth rate λ s table 4 while a half of ppms has λ 1 1 and another half has λ 1 1 table 2 the fact the equiprobable choice has resulted in the λ s estimates located to the left of 1 indicates that the smaller values of λ 1 are small enough to provide for this shift to the left under the equal probabilities of choice on the contrary under the i i d choice governed by the ss distribution table 3 the three greatest probabilities are ascribed to the 2010 2015 and 2017 states accumulating 42 rather than 12 3 36 of the total probability with the λ 1s being markedly greater than 1 table 2 the greatest probabilities are implicitly reflected in the location of λ s estimates to the right of 1 this is also the reason why this location features markedly greater values of λ s than those under the markov chain choice table 4 leading to the most accurate estimates of λ s as regards the pattern multiplicative average of annual ppms our former results for 8 logofet 2019 logofet et al 2019 and 9 logofet et al 2020b ppms have accustomed us to see the λ 1 g close to the λ s estimates altogether being permanently less than 1 thus signifying the disappointing survival forecast for a local population of androsace albana in a random environment logofet et al 2020b page 202 eleven annual matrices 2009 2019 logofet et al 2020a confirmed the pessimistic forecast by their improved by markov chain choice estimates of the stochastic growth rate logofet et al 2020a however our 12th ppm has just shifted the improved estimates to the optimistic domain of λ s 1 table 4 which makes the qualitatively opposite result of averaging λ 1 g 0 8904 1 table 5 especially unexpected and discouraging to comprehend this contradiction we return to the logic of pattern multiplicative averaging in particular to the original eq 5 in the following equivalent form 7 g 12 prodl where prodl denotes the product of 12 ppms in the right hand side of eq 5 since λ 1 g 12 λ 1 g 12 it follows from eq 7 that the exact value of λ 1 g 8 λ 1 g λ 1 prodl 1 12 0 893087 see c 6 in appendix c it should not be surprising therefore that an approximate value of λ 1 g 0 890402 table 5 is quite close to the exact one above hence it should not be discouraging at all although we get used to consider λ 1 g and λ s as the alternative measures population viability we should now recognize them as conceptually different ones while the former just summarizes what has happened over all the past years of monitoring the latter tends to the randomized future although the thirteen years of monitoring predicts the population decline an implicit assumption behind it considers the future environments to be just a strict repetition of what has happened in the past in the same chronological order the future environments on the contrary correlated to a crucial local weather factor with a much longer observation history section 3 2 turn out respectively more favorable for the androsace albana population under the corresponding markov chain scenario of randomness resulting in the greater than 1 estimates of λ s table 4 the two concepts of population viability are therefore quite compatible and complementary to each other without any contradiction an intriguing question in this regard is whether a pure periodic scenario of constructing sequence 3 by repeating the 12 annual ppms in the chronological order will lead to an estimate of the now periodic rather than stochastic growth rate that be close to or coincident with the exact value of λ 1 g the answer is worth further research efforts and might be obtained by an algorithm similar to that of constructing sequence 3 under the governing markov chain but with the 12 12 transition matrix p 12 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 called a circulant permutation matrix horn and johnson 1990 as the choice from annual ppms will no longer be random the chain becomes a periodic deterministic rather than a stochastic process 6 conclusions permanent plots that provide for the identified individuals type of data on the stage structure of a local population for a number of successive years represent an ideal object for matrix population modelling calibration by the data of any pair of successive years generates a unique annual ppm whose λ 1 the asymptotic growth rate serves as a time specific measure of population viability a longer time series of the annual growth rates lays down profound grounds to assess the viability from the whole 13 year monitoring period 2009 2021 we have compared the outcomes from two alternative approaches to the assessment the traditional one associated with the stochastic growth rate λ s yet with an original more realistic mode of randomness and a novel approach ensuing from the original concept of pattern multiplicative average for nonnegative matrices while the shorter periods of monitoring were invariantly resulting in disappointing assessments logofet 2018 2019 logofet et al 2019 2020a b by the both methods the recent expansion up to 13 years has unexpectedly scattered the outcomes on different sides of the barricade i e the position of λ 1 1 this scatter or the qualitative difference in figures makes us to revise conceptually the meaning of averaging the given annual ppms with regard to measuring a local population viability we conclude that it does measure the viability over the whole past period of monitoring but has nothing to do with projecting to the uncertain nor to the random future the latter task is quite fit for the concept of λ s in the paradigm of random environments and the λ s when estimated under a realistic scenario of randomness does disprove the former pessimistic assessments should we be equipped with a scenario of global climate changes downscaled properly to the local habitat the novel method of λ s estimation be able to forecast the population viability too credit authorship contribution statement dmitrii o logofet

local meteodata there are several weather factors that potentially effect the wintering germination and growth of androsace albana plants under severe alpine conditions namely the air temperature in autumn september october the amounts of precipitation during various periods such as the previous autumn the winter period and the spring and early summer of the current year may june the air temperature for the same period and the duration of soil freezing in winter according to temperature sensors on the soil surface and from a depth of 10 cm to detect the most influential factors we have constructed some ordinary least squares ols multiple regression models for the λ 1s as the dependent variable since the number of factors to be analyzed significantly exceeds the number of observations table s1 in supplementary materials we have confined the multiple regression model to three predictors at most which have been selected by means of stepwise forward regression all the factors were preliminary checked for cross correlations so that the factors that were correlated with each other have not been included into one model the distribution of the dependent variable λ 1 in a albana is normal according to the shapiro wilk test p 0 849 shapiro and wilk 1965 whether the distribution of model errors corresponds to the normal one has been assessed visually from the quantile quantile plots the time series of 12 λ 1s table 2 has been checked up for the presence of the level 1 autocorrelation i e with the previous year value by the ljung box test r core team 2022 the low significance of the test χ2 0 443 df 1 p 0 506 indicates the absence of autocorrelation i e in the current year the value of λ does not depend on the previous year the factors that the λ1 index significantly depends upon in simple linear regression models are the mean soil temperatures at the 10 cm depth in september october of the previous year positive relationship table a1 the number of days with soil surface freezing during november to april positive relationship ibidem as well as the amount of precipitation in august to september of the previous year negative relationship ibidem the best multiple regression model explains 90 9 of the variance and includs two factors the amount of precipitation in august september and the number of days with soil freezing table a1 the model including soil surface freezing and average temperatures at the 10 cm depth in september october of the previous year explains 53 5 of the variance but is generally not significant p 0 216 because of both factors having missed values in some years and the number of degrees of freedom is small the total precipitation in august september is negatively correlated with soil temperatures in september october pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 716 p 0 013 hence they could not be included into the overall model compared with previous results adding two observation years has retained the nature of the relationship with only one factor the number of days when soil freezing was observed relationship with the minimal temperatures of may june has ceased to be significant because of the deviating values observed in 2020 and 2021 in 2020 with a relatively warm beginning of the growing season a low value of λ1 was obtained whereas the value of λ1 turned out to be high in 2021 when the minimal temperatures of may june were low appendix b properties of the markov chain transition matrix to verify matrix p pij being irreducible horn and johnson 1990 we construct the directed graph associated with p table 3 by the following rules its nodes vertices are identified with the chain states and there is the arc j i i j 1 2 12 if and only if pij 0 harary et al 1965 the digraph is shown in fig b1 and the matrix is known to be irreducible if and only the digraph is strongly connected ibidem i e for any pair of nodes i j there is a directed path from i to j however this property is far not evident from the figure fortunately a simple criterion for a digraph to be strongly connected reduces to the existence of a directed cycle comprising all the nodes ibidem such a 12 cycle does exist in our digraph successive transitions 2009 2010 2020 are predetermined by the very mode of our markov chain construction section 3 2 while the closing transition 2020 2009 equivalent to the nonzero element p 1 12 has been fortunately discovered in the long enough series that we have used for the construction table s2 in supplementary materials an irreducible matrix can be either primitive of imprimitive horn and johnson 1990 resulting respectively in a fixed steady state distribution of states or a periodic limit distribution logofet 1993 this matrix property can again be verified through the associated digraph and more specifically through the g c d of all its cycle lengths a g c d greater than 1 implies imprimitivity and the g c d equal to 1 provides for the matrix being primitive ibidem see also exercise 38 in logofet and ulanova 2018 therefore each one of the three self loops i e the cycles of length 1 2010 2010 2014 2014 2015 2015 is sufficient for the matrix p to be primitive appendix c solving the pattern multiplicative average problem the product 5 of the 12 nonnegative annual ppms written in the rational form table 2 becomes too cumbersome to be presented here no doubt it is a positive matrix see c 5 but if we take routinely the 12th power root from that positive matrix then the matlab routine returns the following matrix c 1 0 1265 0 4396 0 0099 0 0948 0 4795 0 1147 0 4981 0 0874 0 0443 0 7356 0 1922 0 0790 0 4603 0 2057 0 2479 0 0073 0 0499 0 0840 0 7367 0 2802 0 0380 0 0093 0 0229 0 0923 0 5467 which is even not nonnegative searching for an approximate solution to eq 6 reduces to solving a nonlinear constrained minimization problem for the matrix operator norm of its left hand side the constraints being element wise determined by the minimums and maximums of the corresponding positive elements among the 12 annual ppms table 2 namely c 2 m i n l 0 0 0 0 4 3 1 19 0 0 0 3 2 37 1 49 14 95 0 3 13 0 0 0 6 95 8 25 0 0 0 0 1 35 0 g m a x

inequalities d e 1 f 1 h k 1 l m 1 equivalent to c 3 g 21 g 31 1 g 32 1 g 33 g 43 1 g 44 g 54 1 in the terms of g gij a routine function that matlab offers to solve this kind of optimal problem is called fmincon mathworks 2022a its syntax is technically inconvenient in what concerns the number of input arguments in the user s function φ a subroutine of fmincon that implements the function to be minimized it is equal to 1 alone in our case the 10 unknown elements at the fixed positions of the 5 5 matrix g to be optimized see pattern 2 might logically represent an input 10 vector for the φ however the φ should also carry the product prod of 12 annual ppms to avoid its invariable calculation at each step of the iterative optimization algorithm fortunately the matlab syntax also allows the sole input argument of φ to be a matrix so that a trick to bypass the inconveniency is to combine the 5 5 matrix g and the 5 5 prod into a single one say gprod which can for instance be of the 5 10 size carrying the g in the first 5 columns and the prod in the rest 5 ones thereafter a much faster separation of them from gprod substitutes for the invariant product calculation in the subroutine that calculates the approximation error as a matrix norm of the difference mathworks 2022c the lower and upper bounds c 2 of the gp have to be respectively of the same 5 10 size and invariant in the last 5 columns in the matlab terms the call of the minimization function takes on the following form c 4 gp fval fmincon normg12 prodl mingp mingp maxgp options where normg12 prodl is the user s function commented above options carry certain technical parameters of the algorithm implementation fval and gp represent the output arguments meaning respectively the local minimum the routine finds when starting from mingp and the matrix g at which this minimum is attained a nonlinear function of 10 variables may have a lot of local minima and the particular one to be found by fmincon depends logically upon the starting point the global search is provided by what is called multistart in the global optimization toolbox mathworks 2022b and 1000 starting points have resulted in the solution

24258,our former assessment of viability in a local population of androsace albana an alpine short lived perennial plant species logofet et al 2020b relied upon 10 year observations of the population structure on permanent sample plots and the corresponding time inhomogeneous matrix model of stage structured population dynamics we applied a concept of the population in a random environment and its stochastic growth rate λ s estimated by a monte carlo technique under the so called i i d mode of randomness a simple model popular in the literature meaning independent identically distributed environments all the monte carlo tests resulted in the estimates of λ s 1 meaning a negative forecast of population viability a recent expansion of the monitoring period up to 13 years has now been combined with a more realistic model of randomness namely a markov chain of changes in the environment that is recovered from a longer time series of a local weather index correlated with variations in the asymptotic growth rate λ 1 of the model population within the 13 year period the former design of monte carlo tests with the updated time series of λ 1s and the realistic model of randomness have principally changed the viability assessment to λ s 1 whereas the i i d tests have still resulted in λ s 1 i e a qualitatively opposite forecast of population viability an alternative approach to the viability assessment guides to the original concept of pattern multiplicative average of nonnegative matrices and reduces to calculating λ 1 g the dominant eigenvalue of the average matrix g unexpectedly λ 1 g turns out less than 1 thus suggesting a conceptual revision of how the local population viability should be predicted graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords discrete structured population life cycle graph matrix calibration asymptotic growth rate pattern geometric average stochastic growth rate markov chain monte carlo data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in modern theory and practice of population ecology the assessment of population viability relies mostly on mathematical models calibrated vs monitoring data on the one hand the longer is the time series of data the more reliable should the outcome be considered on the other hand a long time series of monitoring data causes another kind of problem when the matter is about matrix models for stage structured population dynamics caswell 2001 logofet and salguero gómez 2021 while a pair of successive observation years is sufficient to calibrate the population projection matrix ppm the core of the matrix model different pairs lead to different annual ppms hence to different often contrasting values of λ 1 the asymptotic growth rate of the population in a constant environment when λ 1 serves a basis to forecast population viability the successive forecasts may turn out contradicting i e indicating either population growth or decline table 3 in logofet et al 2020a what the current literature on matrix population models suggests to resolve the contradiction was called the stochastic growth rate λ s of the population in random environments tuljapurkar 1986 1990 caswell 2001 however the stochastic growth rate has its own methodic problems sanz 2019 logofet et al 2020 related to the artificial mode of randomness inherent in the calculations we have proposed an alternative approach to forecasting the population viability from a long series of monitoring data logofet 2019 the approach relying on the novel concept of matrix averaging namely the pattern geometric or pattern multiplicative average of nonnegative matrices logofet 2018 the novelty consists in the plain idea that the average matrix g should have the same zero nonzero pattern as the matrices to be averaged ibidem in terms of the matrix population model it means that g is associated with the same given life cycle graph for the species under study that the ppms to be averaged the simple formulation has however faced with a principal problem when applied to case studies logofet et al 2018 2019 2020b a system of algebraic equations to find the unknown positive elements of matrix g turns out to be overdetermined branham 1990 academic 2022 and has no exact solution the approximate solution reduces to a nonlinear constrained minimization problem for the approximation error which can be attacked by standard software routines such as fmincon in matlab mathworks 2022a but faces in turn an eternal issue of the local vs global character of what they return what the software offers to resolve the issue mathworks 2022b requires fine tuning of the routine parameters but can hardly guarantee the absolute result in these circumstances the both methods to forecast population viability need comprehention and further development and the both ought to be applied to case studies to result in more reliable forecasts the case study we analyze here comprises 13 years of monitoring a local population of androsace albana an alpine short lived perennial inhabiting heathlands in the north west caucasus section 2 we introduce the both methods emphasizing their recent improvements section 3 and present the outcomes of the both applied to the a albana case study section 4 the features deserving further attention are discussed in section 5 2 objects 2 1 androsace albana case study androsace albana is a herbaceous short lived perennial plant inhabiting alpine lichen heaths and other habitats logofet et al 2018 it is listed in the red book of the krasnodar region 2007 and the red book of the adygea republic 2012 as a rare species the identified individuals data i e when the individuals are marked and followed over time caswell 2001 p 134 were obtaining from permanent sample plots laid down on the malaya khatipara mountain north west caucasus each august in the 2009 2018 period logofet et al 2020b and the time series of data has now been extended to 2021 successive ontogenetic stages are shown in fig 1 the stages being distinguishable from the above ground morphology of plants and the corresponding column vectors x t pl t j t im t v t g t t of the population structure observed at the year t are presented in table 1 as regards population recruitment the species features a seed reproduction alone hence the life cycle graph lcg a picture of the transitions that individuals can do between stages in one year should look as is shown in fig 2 i with a stage of dormant seeds as the initial one of ontogeny however the parameters associated with seed production and germination are highly uncertain in the field and we therefore exclude seeds from the model lcg fig 2 ii like many other authors did without any justification kendall et al 2019 compadre 2022 we explain below section 5 how such an exclusion is justified in our case in the lcg of this model fig 2 ii the delays in the im and v stages occur due to the harsh conditions of high mountains forcing plants to resort to the space holder strategy körner 2003 staying or growing in one place for as long as possible accelerated transitions pl im occur as a manifestation of polyvariant ontogeny in a albana under conditions of the alpine belt in the north western caucasus the individuals exhibit different rates of ontogeny so that the recruis are found in either of the stage specific groups pl j or im at the moment of census 2 2 matrix model of stage structured population dynamics mathematically this kind of model represents a system of difference equations for the components of the population structure vector caswell 1989 2001 logofet 1993 when written down in the vector matrix form the system that corresponds to the lcg in fig 2 b looks as follows 1 x t 1 l t x t t 2009 2010 2020 where matrix l t has the following zero nonzero pattern 2 l 0 0 0 0 a d 0 0 0 b e f h 0 c 0 0 k l 0 0 0 0 m 0 a b l m 0 when we deal with the identified individuals type of data the ppm can already be calibrated from the data of only two successive time moments namely of the beginning t and the end t 1 of a single time step ibidem thus 13 observation years give rise to 12 annual ppms table 2 calibrated in rational numbers as the average numbers a b c of recruits found at the corresponding recruiting stages p j im and the observed frequencies d e m of transitions between stages different time varying values of matrix elements result in respectively different characteristics even conflicting ones of the population such as the asymptotic growth rate λ 1 the dominant eigenvalue of the annual ppm and the steady state structure the corresponding eigenvector x six of the 12 annual ppms have their λ 1s located to the left of 1 meaning extinction and the other six to the right of 1 population growth table 2 so that any ad hoc guess on the ensuing population viability would be problematic 3 methods 3 1 stochastic growth rate as an index of population viability the paradigm of population growth in random environments tuljapurkar 1990 caswell 2001 treats a set of calibrated annual ppms as an indirect reflection of the spectrum of potential variations the population was exposed to in its environment each particular matrix being responsible for the whole complex of environmental conditions that has determined the corresponding set of vital rates matrix elements for a given year the random variations in the environment through time are therefore reduced to a random choice from the given set of ppms in a long theoretically infinite sequence of transformations l τ that act successively on the population vector such a sequence was long ago proved to converge with probability 1 furstenberg and kesten 1960 oseledec 1968 cohen 1979a b to the limit that defined what is nowadays called the stochastic growth rate λ s 3 lim τ 1 τ log n τ 1 lim τ 1 τ log l τ 1 l 0 x 0 1 here n τ denotes the total population size and 1 gives the vector norm as the sum of vector components in modulus again the value of λ s relative to 1 indicates exponential growth or decline in the total population size thus serving as an index of population viability theoretically the limit of a converging sequence can be accurately approximated by its distant enough member and it is the method we apply to estimate λ s in a series of monte carlo tests to illustrate this fundamental property we conduct the tests with several lengths of finite sequences longer sequences give their final terms that are closer to the sequence limit hence more accurate estimates of λ s however the legitimate desire to lengthen the sequence as far as our machine resource allows faces a technical obstacle a great enough number of multiplications of the initial vector with the matrices some of which have their λ 1s less than 1 while the others having λ 1s greater than 1 table 2 leads eventually to either the computer zero or the computer infinity quite vividly illustrating the idea of exponential decline growth but resulting in a false trivial outcome earlier we already invented a trick that overcomes the obstacle by means of scaling factors appendix c in logofet et al 2019 appendix a in logofet et al 2021 scale 0 and scale retaining all the current terms within reasonable bounds they have enabled us to obtain random sequences 3 up to 1 million terms although the mode of random choice called i i d i e independent identically distributed at each step τ caswell 2001 is the most popular in the literature it should certainly be recognized as a caricature of the reality where the ppms rather follow variations in the environment than obey an artificial rule what we have proposed instead is a markov chain to govern the random choice the chain being correlated with variations in the local environment 3 2 markov chain to govern the random choice we recover the chain from a time series of local whether data correlated to the variations in the λ 1s of annual ppms logofet et al 2020a for the ten annual ppms available two years ago the time series consisted of 59 points and represented the november to may precipitation sums ibidem supplementary material surprising but the expansion of the series just by 2 points has changed the crucial weather index to the previous year august september precipitation sum appendix a albeit it has not changed the method of recovering a markov chain to govern the choice logofet et al 2020a following the method we identify the chain states with those of the environment expressed indirectly as the 12 successive annual ppms with their λ 1s table 2 and the weather index values observed in the corresponding years 2009 2020 table s2 in supplementary material these 12 values now serve as the labels of the chain states and we consider the 61 point series of index values as a chain realization by attributing each particular point to the nearest one among the 12 labels ibidem thus the 60 events of transitions between states or non transitions should result in a set of event frequencies to determine the 12 12 transition matrix p of the governing markov chain if p turns out irreducible and primitive horn and johnson 1990 appendix b then the chain becomes regular kemeny and snell 1960 i e any state of the chain can be reached from any other one for a finite number of time steps thereafter the distribution of chain states tends to a steady state one that is determined by the dominant eigenvector of p normalized to 1 it may also serve as a distribution to provide for the random choice of identically distributed matrices in the i i d construction of sequence 3 3 3 pattern multiplicative average of nonnegative matrices an alternative method to assess the viability in a local population relies on the original concept of pattern multiplicative or pattern geometric average of nonnegative matrices logofet 2018 and reduces to calculating λ 1 g the dominant eigenvalue of the average matrix g since the average matrix is supposed to summarize the whole observation period the logic behind the concept is as follows given the population vectors x 2009 and x 2021 at the initial and terminal moments of observation the former vector transforms to the latter one by means of eq 1 i e by successive multiplication with the 12 annual ppms 4 x 2021 l 2020 l 2019 l 2010 l 2009 x 2009 it is logical to require that the average matrix g does the same when raised to the12th power in formal terms it means that 5 g 12 l 2020 l 2019 l 2010 l 2009 and the task seems trivial at the first glance you have just to extract the 12th power root from the known calculable product of the 12 given ppms however even despite the product being positive all the elements 0 extracting roots from positive matrices is far not so simple as from positive numbers denman 1981 ando et al 2004 bhatia and holbrook 2006 mcdonald et al 2014 tam and huang 2016 for example the routine taking down the 12th power root may even not result in a positive matrix appendix c to say nothing of its being a ppm of a certain pattern hence being considered as an average of ppms in the contrast when averaging a set of ppms i e of nonnegative matrices with a fixed pattern corresponding to a certain lcg we expect the average matrix to represent a ppm too i e to be of the same pattern as the ppms to be averaged and to belong to the same quantitative range as those matrices this is the essence of the concept proposed a few years ago logofet 2018 and called the pattern geometric average of nonnegative matrices by analogy to averaging a pair of nonnegative numbers albeit the pattern multiplicative average pma is a more adequate term note that the simple arithmetic mean does meet all these terms by construction except for the averaging eq 5 but does not bear any biological sense except for the arithmetic one logofet 2013 the next logical step should be just to solve eq 5 for a b l m the 10 unknown elements of the 5 5 matrix g see pattern 2 and pray to the god of algebra but the algebra proves this system of 25 scalar equations for the 10 unknowns and the rest 25 10 15 zeros to be overdetermined hence having no exact solution watson 1979 branham 1990 the situation is general enough as far as any lcg with n nodes implies the n n ppm pattern with a less than n number of positive entries which leads to the lack of an exact solution for the averaging equation the conceptual logic thus faces a principal technical obstacle and the bypassing logic prompts seeking for an approximate solution to the averaging equation now the general logic of approximation is to minimize the error of approximation which can be measured in a number of ways for example we may seek for a solution that minimizes a matrix norm of the left hand side in the equation 6 g 12 l 2020 l 2019 l 2010 l 2009 0 equivalent to 5 albeit the number of ways now lead to choosing a particular norm from a number of matrix ones known in theory however since eq 5 means essentially the equality between projection operators the choice becomes evident is should logically be the operator or frobenius norm mathworks 2022c the task to find the pma of the 12 given ppms reduces therefore to a constrained minimization problem for the operator norm of the left hand side in eq 6 the constraints being determined by matrix g being a ppm of the fixed pattern 2 and lying within the bounds of the ppms to be averaged table 2 as regards the prescribed pattern of the average matrix g its nonnegative elements c d e h turn into zero for some years 2013 2014 2015 table 2 and the matrix of lower ppm bounds carries those zeros respectively too if the optimal solution hits the corresponding boundary points of the feasible set then the corresponding arcs disappear from the prescribed lcg fig 2 b hence the pattern of g now falsifies the very idea of pma to exclude the chance of such a falsification the zero bounds ought to be modified with the minimal positive values of the ppm elements greater detail and routine descriptions can be found in appendix c 4 results 4 1 a albana growth in random environments transition matrix p of the governing markov chain recovered as described in section 3 2 takes on the 12 12 form shown in table 3 we have verified its irreducibility and primitivity by means of the directed graph associated with the matrix appendix b hereby the distribution of the chain states does converge to a steady state one found as the normalized dominant eigenvector of p table 3 it has been used in i i d several series of monte carlo simulations among the others commented below table 4 combines the outcomes from the series of monte carlo simulations under the governing markov chain and two kinds of the i i d choice for various lengths of the finite sequence 3 we see the range of variations in the estimates of λ s to shrink logically with increasing the sequence length at a fixed number of random realizations and to expand with increasing this number when the length is fixed therefore the 1000 realizations of the 1 million long sequence represent the most accurate assessment of the stochastic growth rate by its original definition within our monte carlo simulation scheme the range of λ s estimates lies luckily and totally to the right of 1 thus giving an unambiguously favorable forecast of population viability the two i i d versions of the sequence construction differ from one another in the identical distributions the one meaning equiprobable choice from the 12 given ppms the other distributing them in accordance with vector ss the steady state distribution of markov chain states the former gives λ s 1 i e a negative qualitatively opposite forecast of population viability while the latter just quantitatively differs from the markov chain forecast an explanation of these findings is proposed in section 5 4 2 averaging the annual a albana ppms table 5 presents the outcome of solving the pattern geometric average problem by minimizing the operator norm of the left hand side in eq 6 for the 12 ppms presented in table 2 the minimal value of the norm is considered as the approximation error and it has turned out fairly small equal to 3 930342 10 2 again the arithmetic mean of annual ppms gives markedly greater value of λ 1 with a markedly differing steady state distribution the normalized dominant eigenvector in contrast to the previous findings logofet 2019 for a shorter time series of ppms what the pattern multiplicative average gives now differs qualitatively from the λ s estimates table 4 and we suggest a possible explanation in section 5 5 discussion as noted in section 2 1 the exclusion of seed stage s from the model lcg is a far not trivial issue it is a particular case of the cryptic life stages issue raised recently by kendall et al 2019 and discussed by nguyen et al 2019 and che castaldo et al 2020 the discussion has ended with an obvious conclusion that the exclusion needs careful justification in each particular case to avoid inadequate conclusions from modelling in our case however the seed exclusion has been well grounded by comparing the outcome of the model with a bank of dormant seeds fig 2 i to that of the no seeds model with virtual reproduction fig 2 ii logofet et al 2020c we investigated what might be a family of ppms in the seed bank model within certain wide enough ranges of three uncertain seeds related parameters while the certain vital rates being the same in both models ibidem the task was to detect a set of the seeds related parameters such that the models result in the qualitatively different outcomes i e in their λ 1s located on the different sides of 1 in the real axis two novel features of the matrix population model formalism have enabled us to do so namely the integer valued version of the formalism logofet et al 2020c instead of the traditional one in real numbers caswell 2001 and the original theory of potential growth indicators logofet and belova 2008 protasov and logofet 2014 logofet and razzhevaikin 2021 the former has provided the family of all feasible seed bank ppms for each of 10 calibrated annual no seeds ppms to consist of a finite yet enormous number of quantitatively certain hence analyzable matrices while the latter resulted in quantitatively certain outcomes from the analysis the justice of excluding the seed stage has ensued from the computer verified fact that none of the 10 seed bank ppm families contains any matrix l t with its λ 1 being qualitatively different from that of its no seeds counterpart although we have really detected certain sets of the seeds related parameters such that the λ 1s under comparison are qualitatively different indeed those sets have been always outside of the feasible parameter ranges a real qualitative difference can be seen if we compare the estimates of the stochastic growth rate λ s for 10 table 4 in logofet et al 2020a and 12 annual ppms table 4 it is a common sense logic that the longer is a time series the more information it carries on the process under study even two matrices added to our former set of ten annual ppms have changed the key weather index from november to may precipitation sums ibidem supplementary material to the august september precipitation sum table s1 in supplementary material the effect on the growth rate now becoming negative a rationale behind it may be of two kinds rains and accompanying cloudy weather in autumn reduce insect activity and seed set in rainy weather the seeds ripen worse and are more affected by fungi albeit the issue may well be more complicated combining the effects by several factors so adding the two latest ppms l 10 and l 11 in table 2 has principally changed the estimate from λ s 1 table 4 in logofet et al 2020a to λ s 1 table 4 the estimates should certainly bear a dependence of λ s upon the magnitudes of λ 1 in the ppms to be chosen but such a principal change was not expected a priori since the λ 1 l 10 1 might compensate the λ 1 l 11 1 however the deviation 1 λ 1 l 10 0 1504 is two accurate but occasional times less than λ 1 l 11 1 0 3008 which explains the λ s jumping over 1 note a principal contrast between the outcome from two versions of the i i d series for estimating the stochastic growth rate λ s table 4 while a half of ppms has λ 1 1 and another half has λ 1 1 table 2 the fact the equiprobable choice has resulted in the λ s estimates located to the left of 1 indicates that the smaller values of λ 1 are small enough to provide for this shift to the left under the equal probabilities of choice on the contrary under the i i d choice governed by the ss distribution table 3 the three greatest probabilities are ascribed to the 2010 2015 and 2017 states accumulating 42 rather than 12 3 36 of the total probability with the λ 1s being markedly greater than 1 table 2 the greatest probabilities are implicitly reflected in the location of λ s estimates to the right of 1 this is also the reason why this location features markedly greater values of λ s than those under the markov chain choice table 4 leading to the most accurate estimates of λ s as regards the pattern multiplicative average of annual ppms our former results for 8 logofet 2019 logofet et al 2019 and 9 logofet et al 2020b ppms have accustomed us to see the λ 1 g close to the λ s estimates altogether being permanently less than 1 thus signifying the disappointing survival forecast for a local population of androsace albana in a random environment logofet et al 2020b page 202 eleven annual matrices 2009 2019 logofet et al 2020a confirmed the pessimistic forecast by their improved by markov chain choice estimates of the stochastic growth rate logofet et al 2020a however our 12th ppm has just shifted the improved estimates to the optimistic domain of λ s 1 table 4 which makes the qualitatively opposite result of averaging λ 1 g 0 8904 1 table 5 especially unexpected and discouraging to comprehend this contradiction we return to the logic of pattern multiplicative averaging in particular to the original eq 5 in the following equivalent form 7 g 12 prodl where prodl denotes the product of 12 ppms in the right hand side of eq 5 since λ 1 g 12 λ 1 g 12 it follows from eq 7 that the exact value of λ 1 g 8 λ 1 g λ 1 prodl 1 12 0 893087 see c 6 in appendix c it should not be surprising therefore that an approximate value of λ 1 g 0 890402 table 5 is quite close to the exact one above hence it should not be discouraging at all although we get used to consider λ 1 g and λ s as the alternative measures population viability we should now recognize them as conceptually different ones while the former just summarizes what has happened over all the past years of monitoring the latter tends to the randomized future although the thirteen years of monitoring predicts the population decline an implicit assumption behind it considers the future environments to be just a strict repetition of what has happened in the past in the same chronological order the future environments on the contrary correlated to a crucial local weather factor with a much longer observation history section 3 2 turn out respectively more favorable for the androsace albana population under the corresponding markov chain scenario of randomness resulting in the greater than 1 estimates of λ s table 4 the two concepts of population viability are therefore quite compatible and complementary to each other without any contradiction an intriguing question in this regard is whether a pure periodic scenario of constructing sequence 3 by repeating the 12 annual ppms in the chronological order will lead to an estimate of the now periodic rather than stochastic growth rate that be close to or coincident with the exact value of λ 1 g the answer is worth further research efforts and might be obtained by an algorithm similar to that of constructing sequence 3 under the governing markov chain but with the 12 12 transition matrix p 12 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 called a circulant permutation matrix horn and johnson 1990 as the choice from annual ppms will no longer be random the chain becomes a periodic deterministic rather than a stochastic process 6 conclusions permanent plots that provide for the identified individuals type of data on the stage structure of a local population for a number of successive years represent an ideal object for matrix population modelling calibration by the data of any pair of successive years generates a unique annual ppm whose λ 1 the asymptotic growth rate serves as a time specific measure of population viability a longer time series of the annual growth rates lays down profound grounds to assess the viability from the whole 13 year monitoring period 2009 2021 we have compared the outcomes from two alternative approaches to the assessment the traditional one associated with the stochastic growth rate λ s yet with an original more realistic mode of randomness and a novel approach ensuing from the original concept of pattern multiplicative average for nonnegative matrices while the shorter periods of monitoring were invariantly resulting in disappointing assessments logofet 2018 2019 logofet et al 2019 2020a b by the both methods the recent expansion up to 13 years has unexpectedly scattered the outcomes on different sides of the barricade i e the position of λ 1 1 this scatter or the qualitative difference in figures makes us to revise conceptually the meaning of averaging the given annual ppms with regard to measuring a local population viability we conclude that it does measure the viability over the whole past period of monitoring but has nothing to do with projecting to the uncertain nor to the random future the latter task is quite fit for the concept of λ s in the paradigm of random environments and the λ s when estimated under a realistic scenario of randomness does disprove the former pessimistic assessments should we be equipped with a scenario of global climate changes downscaled properly to the local habitat the novel method of λ s estimation be able to forecast the population viability too credit authorship contribution statement dmitrii o logofet

local meteodata there are several weather factors that potentially effect the wintering germination and growth of androsace albana plants under severe alpine conditions namely the air temperature in autumn september october the amounts of precipitation during various periods such as the previous autumn the winter period and the spring and early summer of the current year may june the air temperature for the same period and the duration of soil freezing in winter according to temperature sensors on the soil surface and from a depth of 10 cm to detect the most influential factors we have constructed some ordinary least squares ols multiple regression models for the λ 1s as the dependent variable since the number of factors to be analyzed significantly exceeds the number of observations table s1 in supplementary materials we have confined the multiple regression model to three predictors at most which have been selected by means of stepwise forward regression all the factors were preliminary checked for cross correlations so that the factors that were correlated with each other have not been included into one model the distribution of the dependent variable λ 1 in a albana is normal according to the shapiro wilk test p 0 849 shapiro and wilk 1965 whether the distribution of model errors corresponds to the normal one has been assessed visually from the quantile quantile plots the time series of 12 λ 1s table 2 has been checked up for the presence of the level 1 autocorrelation i e with the previous year value by the ljung box test r core team 2022 the low significance of the test χ2 0 443 df 1 p 0 506 indicates the absence of autocorrelation i e in the current year the value of λ does not depend on the previous year the factors that the λ1 index significantly depends upon in simple linear regression models are the mean soil temperatures at the 10 cm depth in september october of the previous year positive relationship table a1 the number of days with soil surface freezing during november to april positive relationship ibidem as well as the amount of precipitation in august to september of the previous year negative relationship ibidem the best multiple regression model explains 90 9 of the variance and includs two factors the amount of precipitation in august september and the number of days with soil freezing table a1 the model including soil surface freezing and average temperatures at the 10 cm depth in september october of the previous year explains 53 5 of the variance but is generally not significant p 0 216 because of both factors having missed values in some years and the number of degrees of freedom is small the total precipitation in august september is negatively correlated with soil temperatures in september october pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 716 p 0 013 hence they could not be included into the overall model compared with previous results adding two observation years has retained the nature of the relationship with only one factor the number of days when soil freezing was observed relationship with the minimal temperatures of may june has ceased to be significant because of the deviating values observed in 2020 and 2021 in 2020 with a relatively warm beginning of the growing season a low value of λ1 was obtained whereas the value of λ1 turned out to be high in 2021 when the minimal temperatures of may june were low appendix b properties of the markov chain transition matrix to verify matrix p pij being irreducible horn and johnson 1990 we construct the directed graph associated with p table 3 by the following rules its nodes vertices are identified with the chain states and there is the arc j i i j 1 2 12 if and only if pij 0 harary et al 1965 the digraph is shown in fig b1 and the matrix is known to be irreducible if and only the digraph is strongly connected ibidem i e for any pair of nodes i j there is a directed path from i to j however this property is far not evident from the figure fortunately a simple criterion for a digraph to be strongly connected reduces to the existence of a directed cycle comprising all the nodes ibidem such a 12 cycle does exist in our digraph successive transitions 2009 2010 2020 are predetermined by the very mode of our markov chain construction section 3 2 while the closing transition 2020 2009 equivalent to the nonzero element p 1 12 has been fortunately discovered in the long enough series that we have used for the construction table s2 in supplementary materials an irreducible matrix can be either primitive of imprimitive horn and johnson 1990 resulting respectively in a fixed steady state distribution of states or a periodic limit distribution logofet 1993 this matrix property can again be verified through the associated digraph and more specifically through the g c d of all its cycle lengths a g c d greater than 1 implies imprimitivity and the g c d equal to 1 provides for the matrix being primitive ibidem see also exercise 38 in logofet and ulanova 2018 therefore each one of the three self loops i e the cycles of length 1 2010 2010 2014 2014 2015 2015 is sufficient for the matrix p to be primitive appendix c solving the pattern multiplicative average problem the product 5 of the 12 nonnegative annual ppms written in the rational form table 2 becomes too cumbersome to be presented here no doubt it is a positive matrix see c 5 but if we take routinely the 12th power root from that positive matrix then the matlab routine returns the following matrix c 1 0 1265 0 4396 0 0099 0 0948 0 4795 0 1147 0 4981 0 0874 0 0443 0 7356 0 1922 0 0790 0 4603 0 2057 0 2479 0 0073 0 0499 0 0840 0 7367 0 2802 0 0380 0 0093 0 0229 0 0923 0 5467 which is even not nonnegative searching for an approximate solution to eq 6 reduces to solving a nonlinear constrained minimization problem for the matrix operator norm of its left hand side the constraints being element wise determined by the minimums and maximums of the corresponding positive elements among the 12 annual ppms table 2 namely c 2 m i n l 0 0 0 0 4 3 1 19 0 0 0 3 2 37 1 49 14 95 0 3 13 0 0 0 6 95 8 25 0 0 0 0 1 35 0 g m a x

inequalities d e 1 f 1 h k 1 l m 1 equivalent to c 3 g 21 g 31 1 g 32 1 g 33 g 43 1 g 44 g 54 1 in the terms of g gij a routine function that matlab offers to solve this kind of optimal problem is called fmincon mathworks 2022a its syntax is technically inconvenient in what concerns the number of input arguments in the user s function φ a subroutine of fmincon that implements the function to be minimized it is equal to 1 alone in our case the 10 unknown elements at the fixed positions of the 5 5 matrix g to be optimized see pattern 2 might logically represent an input 10 vector for the φ however the φ should also carry the product prod of 12 annual ppms to avoid its invariable calculation at each step of the iterative optimization algorithm fortunately the matlab syntax also allows the sole input argument of φ to be a matrix so that a trick to bypass the inconveniency is to combine the 5 5 matrix g and the 5 5 prod into a single one say gprod which can for instance be of the 5 10 size carrying the g in the first 5 columns and the prod in the rest 5 ones thereafter a much faster separation of them from gprod substitutes for the invariant product calculation in the subroutine that calculates the approximation error as a matrix norm of the difference mathworks 2022c the lower and upper bounds c 2 of the gp have to be respectively of the same 5 10 size and invariant in the last 5 columns in the matlab terms the call of the minimization function takes on the following form c 4 gp fval fmincon normg12 prodl mingp mingp maxgp options where normg12 prodl is the user s function commented above options carry certain technical parameters of the algorithm implementation fval and gp represent the output arguments meaning respectively the local minimum the routine finds when starting from mingp and the matrix g at which this minimum is attained a nonlinear function of 10 variables may have a lot of local minima and the particular one to be found by fmincon depends logically upon the starting point the global search is provided by what is called multistart in the global optimization toolbox mathworks 2022b and 1000 starting points have resulted in the solution

request 1 introduction xylella fastidiosa xf is a xylem limited gram negative bacterium originating from the americas identified in europe during the last decade when the italian authorities reported the first outbreak of xf subsp pauca in the south of the apulia region in 2013 afterward the bacterium has also been detected in france first outbreak in corse 2015 switzerland detected in 2015 now eradicated spain first outbreak in balearic islands 2012 germany an isolated infection in 2016 now eradicated and portugal first outbreak in porto 2019 efsa plh panel 2019 eppo reporting service 2018 eppo reporting service 2019 in europe the bacterium represents a significant risk for several crops and therefore a serious threat to food security efsa plh panel 2020 schneider et al 2020 host plants susceptibility and symptoms vary according to the xf subsp strains nunney et al 2013 sanderlin 2017 several important crop diseases can be associated with xf such as the pierce s disease of grapevine the plum leaf scald the citrus variegated chlorosis the phony peach disease and as confirmed in italy xf is the cause of olive quick decline syndrome which dramatically brought the apulia olive growing sector to its knees hopkins and purcell 2002 saponari et al 2017 the bacterium is transmitted by xylem sap feeding insects almeida et al 2005 perring et al 2001 purcell et al 1999 redak et al 2004 host species and bacterium strains highly influence vector competence cavalieri and porcelli 2017 lopes et al 2009 in europe xf is mainly transmitted by the indigenous vector philaenus spumarius cornara et al 2018 cruaud et al 2018 moralejo et al 2019 more recently two other spittlebug species philaenus italosignus and neophilaenus campestris have also been identified as competent vectors cavalieri et al 2019 the xf epidemiological system is characterized by high variability and heterogeneity according to prevalence and spread of the infection sicard et al 2018 efsa plh panel 2019 the spatial and temporal patterns of disease dynamics strictly depend on the interactions among bacteria vectors and host plants in the pathosystem these interactions are mediated by complex physiological and pathological processes and strongly influenced by environmental variables e g temperature water stress almeida et al 2005 cornara et al 2017 jeger and bragard 2019 several models have been proposed to investigate the key factors determining the xf dynamics and how to manipulate them to support disease management parnell et al 2017 focusing on process based models a wide variety of approaches can be found in the literature reaction diffusion models chapman et al 2015 susceptible exposed infectious removed seir models jeger and bragard 2019 white et al 2020 lattice susceptible infected removed sir models fierro et al 2019 spatially explicit simulation models short distance deterministic and long distance stochastic kernels white et al 2017 discrete time versions of standard differential equations used in epidemiological compartmental models white et al 2019 and ordinary differential equation systems brunetti et al 2020 despite the variety of models proposed there is still the need to further explore the epidemiology of xf by integrating biological elements influencing the xf disease spread and growth mechanisms and patterns to contribute to the effort of developing integrated modeling approaches in view also of the need of supporting rational disease management we propose a xf eco epidemiological model xem describing the continuous spread of xf in an area xem is a spatially explicit mechanistic model considering the following biological processes i the growth of the bacterium into the xylem of the host plant ii the acquisition of the pathogen by the vector from an infected plant and its transmission to healthy plants iii the basic elements of the vector population dynamics iv the dispersal of the vector the environmental drivers affecting xf epidemic dynamics are considered in the model in terms of the impact on both the vector population dynamics and the development of the bacterial population in the host plant xem describes the spatio temporal dynamics of the disease and the vector in a continuous or patchy landscape with any composition of the plant community through the description of the landscape structure and the accurate calibration of the functions parameters xem can easily be adapted to describe any specific context and management strategies xem is a suitable tool to evaluate the effectiveness of different risk reducing options and practices aimed to the management of the disease pressure and spread as well as to compare the efficacy of strategies aimed at the eradication of new outbreaks in section 2 1 we describe the mathematical formulation and the biological assumptions of xem in section 2 2 we apply the model to the apulia outbreak of xf therefore the model components and the parameterization for the case study are presented the management strategies and scenario analysis approach are explained in section 2 3 the results of the scenario analysis on infection spread and management strategies are reported in section 3 discussion and conclusion are presented in section 4 2 materials methods 2 1 mathematical formulation xem describes the spread dynamics of xf in a spatial domain ω during the time interval 0 t xem is based on the following biological assumptions the univoltine biological cycle of the vector p spumarius is here simplified considering two phenological stages the pre imaginal stage and the adult stage the two stages do not overlap in xem an adult vector can become infected solely by feeding on an infected plant once infected the vector can transmit the bacterium feeding on other plants infecting and or re infecting i e increasing the bacteria load them the pre imaginal stage is not able to acquire neither to transmit the bacterium vector population dynamics are represented in a simplified way the phenological processes and events are described as occurring at pre defined times in the year depending on the site under consideration change in population abundance is described only for the adult stage by means of a site specific natural mortality function the initial conditions for the adult stage are set equal to a site specific maximum abundance interpreted as the local population carrying capacity if no external mortality factor is applied e g per imaginal or adult control each year adult population dynamics has the same initial conditions this assumption corresponds to the case in which adult fecundity exactly compensates pre imaginal mortality vectors move in the spatial domain only individuals in the adult stage can disperse and the dispersal behavior is modelled by means of a random walk motion vector long distance dispersal due to both human assisted or natural movement is disregarded the health status of a plant is described by the bacterial load titre in the xylem in an infected plant the bacterial load titre grows due to the multiplication of the bacterial population within the plant a plant can receive multiple successful inoculums of the disease pathogen due to the feeding of the infected vectors these multiple inoculums also contribute to bacterial population growth we disregard plant mortality depending on bacterial load therefore for a high level of bacterial load titre the plant remains a source of bacteria for adult vectors this simplified assumption can be acceptable for a relatively short time period relevant for management consideration as considered in this paper successful transmission of the pathogen to the host plant is described by a transmission function that considers i the vector feeding behavior also including the vector preference for the target host ii the capacity of the vector to transmit the pathogen iii the susceptibility s of a specific host plant species or cv to the pathogen the possibility that vectors take and spread the disease is influenced by the bacterial titre in the host plant xem considers only the short range spread of the disease we assume the disease to propagate solely by the natural local dispersal and the feeding activities of the vectors long jumps of the disease due to natural or human assisted dispersal of infected vectors or to the trade of infected plant material are not included in the model the model state variables are the abundance of infected adult vectors in the spatial point x at time γ x t the variable γ x t assumes values in the range 0 a x t where a x t is the adult vector abundance the abundance of uninfected adult vectors can be calculated as the difference between the vector population abundance and the abundance of infected vectors a x t γ x t γ x t is equal to 0 during the pre imaginal stage the health status of a host plant in the spatial point x at time t φ x t the health status of a host plant represents the level of bacteria load in that plant at time t and it assumes values in the range 0 1 as it is normalized to a maximum level of bacteria load see table 3 in a non infected plant the bacterium is absent therefore φ x t 0 in an infected plant φ x t is greater than 0 and proportional to the bacteria load in the plant for the sake of clarity hereinafter φ x t and γ x t will be reported without their parameters the spread in space and time of the disease is described through a nonlinear system composed of a parabolic partial differential equation for γ and a first order ordinary differential equation for φ 1 γ x t d δ γ x t m γ x t b x t a x t γ x t φ x t 2 φ x t s l x t γ x t f t φ x t 1 φ x t ν γ x t γ x t υ x 0 φ x 0 φ 0 x γ x 0 γ 0 x where δ is the laplacian operator ν is the normal versor on the boundary of ω ν stands for the outward normal derivative on the boundary of ω φ 0 x and γ 0 x are the initial conditions i e the status of the system at t 0 the parameters of the xem are defined in table 1 the biological meaning of the parameters and their estimation are reported in section 2 2 the spatial domain ω is approximated with a grid mesh considering the discrete counterpart of neumann homogeneous boundary conditions on the discrete scheme brezis 1986 the structure of the mesh is defined according to the characteristics of the landscape considered in a continuous and homogeneous landscape the host plants are placed in the nodes of the mesh and arranged in a continuous space with regular or irregular space among plants in a patchy landscape the host plants are present in restricted areas surrounded by unsuitable habitats or plants for the bacterium this patchy spatial configuration can support metapopulation analysis of disease dynamics vectors are present in the whole ω and the vector stage varies in time according to vector phenological dynamics mathematical and numerical analysis of the model is detailed in bazarra et al 2022 since we assume that functions b x t and l x t are positive globally bounded and lipschitz continuous the same existence uniqueness and regularity properties still hold for the solution of system proposed in bazarra et al 2022 2 2 model application xem is applied to the current epidemics of xf subsp pauca in olive groves in the apulia region southern italy in 2013 xf was identified in the salento peninsula near lecce in the southern part of the apulia where it infected millions of olive trees and caused the death of many of them at the beginning of 2019 the xf infected area included approximately 718 000 ha in the apulia region saponari et al 2019a regulation 2020b the spread of xf is still ongoing seriously threatening the apulian olive sector results of scientific studies conducted in the context of the apulian olive groves are used for estimating model functions and parameters related to the growth functions of the bacterium the development of symptoms the susceptibility of the different cultivars and the phenology of the vectors in the model application the meadow spittlebug p spumarius is considered the vector of xf to compensate for the lack of experimental data regarding the other functions and parameters of the model we referred to data in the efsa update of the scientific opinion on the risks to plant health posed by xylella fastidiosa in the eu territory 2019 2 2 1 landscape structure apulia is characterized by large olive groves with olive trees planted generally at large distances e g 6 10 m strona et al 2017 we represented this landscape by defining a homogenous mesh of 10 km x 10 km with equally spaced host plants the nodes of the mesh are the spatial units and represent cells of 10 10 m at the center of the node there is a susceptible olive tree we assumed the herbaceous cover between the hosts as not susceptible fig 1 so only olive to olive transmission is considered in this work we explored different disease dynamics scenarios by applying xem with different plant physiological responses and vector population abundance di serio et al 2019 since the situation in the apulian infected area is characterized by homogeneous fields cultivated with a predominant olive cultivar within a simulated scenario the host plants susceptibility is set equal for all nodes the typical agroecological conditions in the apulian olive growing region are included in the model the time step of the simulations is set to 1 day and the time horizon to 5 years 2 2 2 vector phenology and survival the pre imaginal stage occurs from the beginning of the year t i up to the appearance of the adult stage t v i and after oviposition t v f until the end of the year t f fig 2 the adults emerge from pre imaginal stage and occurs in the time interval t v i t v f in the this time interval the adults population abundance varies according to the survival profile a x t k m a x y t v f t t v f t v i starting from the site specific maximum carrying capacity k m a x x at t v i in the time interval t v i t v f the abundance of infected adults is defined by γ x t based on the climatic conditions of apulia and the data on adults emergence available in the literature bodino et al 2020 di serio et al 2019 we set t v i 130 may 10th and the end of period of vector feeding activities at t v f 300 october 27th the natural mortality rate of the infected adults the parameter m in eq 1 has been estimated equal to 0 015 da y 1 this value describes a survival curve that well approximates available data on the duration of the adult stage and the population abundance of p spumarius bodino et al 2019 bodino et al 2021 di serio et al 2019 2 2 3 vector dispersal only vectors in the adult stage can disperse their dispersal behavior is modelled by means of a random walk motion through the laplace operator δ and its diffusive coefficient d in eq 1 for the vector dispersal capacity we referred to the median dispersal distance of p spumarius estimated by efsa equal to 800 m year efsa plh panel 2019 the value of the diffusive coefficient d is derived using a simulation procedure an initial population of 1000 adult vectors is released in the center of the landscape at time t v i we selected the value of d such that at t v f half of the vector population is in a circular area of 800 m of radius from the point of release the estimated value of the parameter is d 1500 m 2 da y 1 2 2 4 bacteria acquisition rate to estimate the vector bacteria acquisition rate b x t eq 1 we referred to the median value 12 08 of the elicited distribution of acquisition rates of the vector reported in the efsa opinion efsa plh panel 2019 representing the daily probability of acquisition of the bacteria in optimal conditions e g the vector feeds on highly infected plants only in xem the acquisition rate of the vector in the efsa opinion is used to estimate the maximum value for b x t b m a x achievable when φ 1 to estimate b m a x a population of 1000 non infected vectors feeding on highly infected host plants is simulated after one day of feeding activity we obtained 12 08 of the vectors infected with b m a x 0 0995 d a y 1 in xem b m a x is scaled according to the health status of the plant we assumed that the probability of a successful daily feeding activity depends both on the bacterial titre in the plant and on the time spent in the feeding activity by the vector in a day to represent this process we used the ivlev model ivlev 1961 a non linear functional response widely used to describe the predator s efficiency in searching and capturing the prey as a function of prey density p x q 1 e j p in xem we set φ q b m a x and j 50 we select the value of j such that the bacteria acquisition rate is close to b m a x when φ x t 0 1 corresponding to a symptom s severity in the host plant equal to three see table 3 2 2 5 bacterial population growth function the bacterial population in an infected plant increases following the function f t eq 2 bacterial population growth varies according to the physiological state of the plant the environmental conditions and plant susceptibility concerning plant physiology and environmental conditions three periods in a year are identified i the physiological state of the host plant is not favourable to bacterial growth so f t 0 ii the host is in a favourable physiological state for the bacteria but the growth is sub optimal due to not favourable environmental conditions e g high temperature and low relative humidity so the bacterial population grows at a low rate f t r l iii both the host physiological state and the environmental conditions are favourable the bacterial population grows at a high rate f t r h the bacterial population growth function is defined as follows f t 0 t 1 t h 1 t h 4 365 r h t t h 1 t h 2 t h 3 t h 4 r l t t h 2 t h 3 with 1 t h 1 t h 2 t h 3 t h 4 365 for the apulian case we set t h 1 129 may 8th t h 2 212 july 29th t h 3 242 august 29th t h 4 287 october 12th growth rates depend also on the host plant susceptibility giampetruzzi et al 2016 saponari et al 2019b we used data from a field study on the dynamics of xf spread and symptoms development conducted in apulia in 2016 and 2017 montes borrego et al 2017 to derive the growth rates for different periods in the year and hosts susceptibility we considered a susceptible olive tree cultivar ogliarola and a tolerant cultivar leccino the best estimates for the bacteria growth functions table 2 are obtained starting from an initial bacteria inoculum φ i 0 0001 in the apulian datasets a percentage of host plants tolerant to infection n s throughout all the observation period is reported this cultivar dependent percentage table 2 has been considered in the model 2 2 6 plant susceptibility according to efsa 2019 plant susceptibility is defined as the probability that a non infected susceptible plant becomes systematically infected as a consequence of the feeding activity of an infected adult vector during a day we set the plant susceptibility s for tolerant host plant equal to the first quartile of the distribution for susceptibility elicited by efsa 2019 s 0 09 and to the median value of that distribution for susceptible host plants s 0 14 2 2 7 bacteria transmission to the plant infected vectors inoculate the bacteria into the host by feeding on the xylem sap of the plant in a plant not yet infected bacteria inoculum triggers the process of plant infection the bacteria inoculum per vector in a day is estimated equal to l 1 10 4 based on field studies on the dynamics of symptoms development xf montes borrego et al 2017 in xem the transmission of the bacteria from the vector population to the host plant population takes into account a density dependent reduction l l e 4 γ with the increase of vector population estimated based on results obtained by montes borrego et al 2017 this is to account for both the increase of the probability of vector feeding in already infected leaves of the host plants and the effects of intra species competition leading to the selection of host plants other than olive trees 2 2 8 symptoms severity we assume that during the asymptomatic period the plant is infected and infectious but it does not manifest any visual symptoms to correlate the level of infection of the plant φ t with the severity of the symptoms we referred to saponari et al 2019a these authors tested bacterial population load c for ogliarola and leccino cultivars and reported the estimation of symptoms severity measured on a 6 points scale 0 no symptoms 5 maximum level of symptoms i e the plant is no longer productive in table 3 we report the thresholds of bacteria load and the corresponding values of plant health status for each class of symptoms severity 2 3 simulation of epidemiological scenarios the xem parameterized as in section 2 2 is applied to explore the spatio temporal dynamics of xf considering two levels of vector abundance high and low and two levels of host plant susceptibility high and low table 4 based on data published in di serio et al 2019 we defined 20 adults per m2 as the high level of vector population and 1 adult per m2 as the low level of the vector population the onset of infection is simulated through the successful inoculation of nine susceptible plants in an area of 30 m radius in the center of a free area inoculation point disease dynamics are analysed for 5 years with a temporal resolution of 1 day the spatio temporal dynamics of the disease in the four scenarios are assessed at the end of each simulation year according to the following output variables infected host plants number of infected host plants disease pressure mean value of health status of the host plants φ the mean is computed only on infected plants i e φ 0 infected vector pressure mean annual density of the population abundance of infected vectors the mean is calculated only during the period of adult presence disease spread maximum distance of the infected plants from the inoculation point the simulations were conducted in matlab version r2018b applying the finite element approach to discretization further details are reported in bazarra et al 2022 2 4 simulation of management scenarios the definition of the management strategies to be tested is based on the european legislation in force at the time the study was carried out council directive 2000 29 ec 2000 decision eu 2015 789 2015 decision eu 2017 2352 2017 focusing on eradication measures in our study the management strategies are applied from the first detection of an infected plant in a free area i e an area where infected plants are not reported till the end of the simulation period following the detection of an infected plant three areas are marked out around the detection point area demarcation process the first area with a radius equal to the value of the cutting radius is defined as the infected area the second area is a circular crown with a minimum radius equal to the cutting radius and a major radius of 5000 m and is defined as the buffer zone the infected area and the buffer zone constitute the demarcated area immediately after the detection all potential xf host plants are cut and one adult vector control treatment is performed in the infected area in the years following the detection till the end of the simulation period the management strategy applied in the demarcated area consists of one weed treatment carried out in spring to control the nymph population and two vector control treatments carried out in late spring and in the summer the vector control treatments have the aim of reducing both the adult vector population in the current year and the vector population in the next year as a result of a reduction in the number of adults and then in the number of overwintering eggs that are laid therefore the repetition of treatment over years leads to a significant reduction in the abundance of the vector fig 3 graphically represents the management scheme applied in the scenario analysis the sequence and type of control treatments to be performed are different in the first year of detection than in subsequent years because it is not possible to carry out weed treatment for nymphs control in the first year of detection management strategies are applied for 5 years based on the overall structure of the management strategies described in fig 3 four factors relevant to eco epidemiological dynamics and of interest to international policymakers are tested efficacy of adult vector and weed control actions the radius of the cutting area time of the first detection time to intervention for each factor two levels are tested defining a total of 16 management scenarios low efficacy of control treatments corresponds to 60 of nymph mortality following weeds treatments and 50 of adult mortality following chemical control of the adults while high efficacy corresponds to 80 of nymph mortality following weeds treatments and 90 of adult mortality following chemical control of the adults the large cutting radius corresponds to 100 m the small cutting radius is set to 50 m two times for the first detection were considered early and late detection occurs 3 and 4 years after inoculation respectively finally we tested the impact of two different implementation times of the control actions early and late intervention occur 30 and 60 days after the detection respectively the early intervention corresponds to the first period of adult flight just after adults emergence the efficacy of the management strategies scenarios was assessed by considering the characteristics of the worst case scenario i e the eco epidemiological scenario where at the 5th year after infection the infected area was greater the management strategies were applied for 5 years including the years of the first detection at the end of the simulation the xf infection dynamics were assessed we checked whether the infection was completely eradicated or not and the spread of the infection measured in terms of the proportion of infected area under managed conditions compared with the area obtained in the unmanaged epidemiological scenario at the same time horizon 3 results 3 1 disease pressure the spatio temporal dynamics of the infection in the simulation scenarios are represented in fig 4 the mean disease level in the infected plants decreases with a common pattern over the spatial dimension in the four scenarios fig 4 a however only in the epidem hh the mean level of the disease is at least equal to the first level of severity of symptoms outside the area of radius 50 meter from the points of inoculum in the epidem lh and epidem ll cases the mean disease levels never reach the third level of severity of symptoms the temporal dynamics are then assessed on the worst case scenario i e the one with the highest average disease pressure in the epidem hh scenario the mean level of disease in infected plants grows very slowly in the first 3 years of simulation fig 4 b the threshold of visual detection of symptoms i e severity class of 1 is exceeded in the fourth year of simulation up to 50 m from the inoculation site in the fifth year symptoms are visible up to 300 m from the inoculation site 3 2 infected vector pressure the mean densities of infected vectors decrease with a common pattern over the spatial dimension in all the simulation scenarios although the maximum population values are quite different fig 5 b the temporal dynamics of the density of infected vectors are shown for the scenario epidem hh in fig 5 a in the last year of simulation the highest mean density of infected vectors for the two scenarios characterized by a low vector abundance is equal to 0 16 epidem hl and 0 08 epidem ll vectors per 100 m2 for the hh scenario the mean density of infected vectors per 100 m2 in the last year of simulation is greater than 1 only within the first 500 m from the inoculation point 3 3 infected host plants the annual distributions of infected host plants for each simulation scenario are shown in fig 6 the highest number of infected plants almost 70 000 equal to 6 58 of the host plants in the landscape occurred in the scenario epidem hh in the epidem ll there are less than 3000 infected plants at the end of the 5th year of simulation 3 4 disease spread the spread of the infection has been assessed based on the dynamics of the 5 years of simulation focusing on the initial build up of an invasion front at the end of the simulation period the maximum distance of infected plants from the initial inoculation point is approximately 1500 m for scenario hh 970 m for lh 600 m for hl and 340 m for ll the spread rates for each scenario expressed as km travelled by the invasion front per year are reported in fig 7 the spread rates increase over time with different non linear patterns based on the simulation scenario considered at the end of the simulation period the spread rate is 0 56 km per year for the scenario hh 0 43 km per year for lh and about 0 28 km per year for hl and ll 3 5 management option efficacy the basic epidemiological scenario used to define the management strategies was scenario epidem hh high density of vector population and high susceptibility of the host plant to xf the results of the scenario analysis on management strategies are shown in table 5 in nine of the 16 management scenarios xf infection was successfully eradicated with different impacts in terms of the spread of infection depending on the strategy adopted from the outcomes the effects of control efficacy cut radius time to detection and intervention can be derived the greatest effect on eradication is determined by the efficacy of nymphs and adult control treatments in the eight scenarios where high efficacy of control actions was simulated the infection was eradicated at the end of the assessment period in the eight scenarios where control actions have low efficacy only one management strategy leads to eradication early detection early intervention and a cut radius of 100 m in all the other management scenarios with low vector control efficacy eradication is not achieved furthermore in the seven scenarios where eradication is not achieved the management actions reduce the pressure of the infected vectors to less than 0 035 vectors m2 4 discussion and conclusion in xem the main biological processes related to the disease dynamics are described in detail with reference to i the vector acquisition of the bacterium from the plant ii the bacterial transmission rate from the vector to the plant iii the growth process of the pathogen inside the plant and iv the vector s dispersal rates and functions describing these processes can be adapted to environmental characteristics and host susceptibility process functions and parameters can also be adapted to different vector species and xf subspecies or strains the application of xem to the case of the spread of xf in apulia allowed estimating the spread rate of the infection under the hypothesis that the bacterium is spread by natural vector dispersal only the disease spread rate increases year by year and reaches about 0 6 km per year 5 years after the initial inoculation the average annual spread of the infection is expected to be considerably greater if long jumps are considered bodino et al 2021 a critical issue in dealing with emerging diseases is related to knowledge gaps tamborindeguy et al 2017 the lack of historical data on biological processes makes it difficult to calibrate the models on the analysed system even when it is possible to describe the dynamics in formal and modeling terms the estimations of xem parameters are affected by a set of variability and uncertainty sources related to model assumptions and to the eco epidemiological system that is studied the susceptibility of plants influences the growth rate of the bacterial population in the plant and it has a significant impact on the duration of the asymptomatic period the xem allows for the evaluation of the progression of the disease in the plants the possibility of defining specific growth rates for different periods of the year to account for plant phenology and environmental conditions and host plant susceptibilities among species or individuals within the same species allows for the application of xem to several agroecosystems furthermore associating the host plant health status with a scale of symptoms onset allows for modeling any type of disease latency i e the period in which the pathogen is present in the plant but it is not detectable neither visually nor with laboratory diagnostic procedures the calibration of xem parameters related to disease growth and latency period requires knowledge on the susceptibility of the host plants cultivars of interest and the specific bacterial growth mechanisms within these species recent studies are bringing evidence regarding the importance of weeds in the xf olive tree vector pathosystem as they represent both the habitat where the vector nymphs complete their development and a possible reservoir for the bacterium aniţa et al 2021 brunetti et al 2020 in our study the herbaceous plant community has been considered only as support in the pre imaginal stage development further developments of the model may include the weeds as a potential host for the bacterium in order to assess their contribution to the epidemiology of xf olive tree vector pathosystem the variability related to vector spread rate and dispersal patterns can be addressed by modifying the uncertainty distribution for the vector dispersal kernel a different spread rate or a non homogenous distribution of the disease could have direct effects on the assessment of spatio temporal dynamics of disease spread and therefore on the assessment of management or eradication strategies the vector acquisition rate can be modified to consider the within and between species variability in the feeding rate and preference the density of the vector population is highly variable since the scenario results showed that it had a strong impact on xf spread actions aimed to strongly reduce vector population abundance could be key elements for the success of eradication strategies for these reasons careful studies to estimate the abundance of the population should be preliminary to the implementation of the xem model in scenario analysis of epidemiological dynamics the rate of successful transmission of the pathogen from the infected vector to the host plant and from an infected plant to the vector are among the parameters that most influence system dynamics the results of new experimental studies on these factors could easily be included in xem the generality and flexibility of xem make the model a suitable tool to better understand the disease mechanisms and patterns and to evaluate the effectiveness of different risk reducing options and practices devoted to the management of the disease pressure and spread xem can also be used for the evaluation of management and or eradication strategies in our scenario analysis the high efficacy of vector and weed control intervention are identified as the key factors for a successful eradication in accordance with aniţa et al 2021 the prompt intervention after infection detection could limit the impact of xf when eradication is not achieved from simulation outcomes it emerges that the management measures are effective if performed just after adults emergence early intervention limiting the density of infected vectors that rapidly increases over the favourable season this result is an example of useful information to support decision making as it underlines the importance of limiting the delay in applying control actions other things being equal in the system considered the cut off radius is crucial for eradication only when there is early detection and timely intervention and the efficacy of vector control is low in these scenarios the 100 m cut radius allows achieving the eradication whereas a smaller radius 50 m does not allow this the management strategies influence the infection spread measured in the percentage of the infected area compared to the infected area in the unmanaged scenario in particular lower infected areas occur in all the scenarios with early detection in the scenarios where eradication is not achieved the spread of infection can be reduced by reducing the time of application of intervention measures early intervention from the analyses carried out it emerges that further knowledge is needed on the main sources of uncertainty in the eco epidemiological system analysed in particular the susceptibility of the host plants the rate at which the bacteria are acquired by the vector the range of movement of the vector and the delay in detecting the disease xem could be used to assess the outcome of the application of different detection and control strategies each process described in xem e g vector plant transmission asymptomatic period growth of the bacterium into the plant vector phenology is defined by specific parameters the inclusion in the model of detection control strategies is simplified and requires only the estimation of the impact that these actions have on related parameters of the model e g a control action of the vector will reduce the carrier s carrying capacity being spatially explicit xem allows assessing the impact of actions only in the areas where they are implemented furthermore the temporal resolution of the model and the inclusion of the phenology of both host plants and vectors allows the evaluation of the variability of the efficacy of the detection control strategies according to the period in which they are carried out the huge efforts and investments in research on xf led to an increasing amount of knowledge on both the bacterium e g the basic mechanisms of disease infection and growth in the host plant and the vectors e g phenology however this knowledge body of growing complexity urgently needs integration into efficient and readily available tools to support strategies for preventing and mitigating the effects of xf these tools should be able to stock up on low scale e g i state model to high scale p state model knowledge gyllenberg 2007 caswell and john 1992 xem allows integrating the scientific evidence at various spatial and temporal resolutions from individual plants to large scale heterogeneous landscapes including the effects of environmental drivers climate and land use and climate change therefore xem could be implemented in control strategies for xf management at different levels from field to regional from operational to policy supporting the implementation of risk reduction options in plant health and for selecting control techniques and guiding the

request 1 introduction xylella fastidiosa xf is a xylem limited gram negative bacterium originating from the americas identified in europe during the last decade when the italian authorities reported the first outbreak of xf subsp pauca in the south of the apulia region in 2013 afterward the bacterium has also been detected in france first outbreak in corse 2015 switzerland detected in 2015 now eradicated spain first outbreak in balearic islands 2012 germany an isolated infection in 2016 now eradicated and portugal first outbreak in porto 2019 efsa plh panel 2019 eppo reporting service 2018 eppo reporting service 2019 in europe the bacterium represents a significant risk for several crops and therefore a serious threat to food security efsa plh panel 2020 schneider et al 2020 host plants susceptibility and symptoms vary according to the xf subsp strains nunney et al 2013 sanderlin 2017 several important crop diseases can be associated with xf such as the pierce s disease of grapevine the plum leaf scald the citrus variegated chlorosis the phony peach disease and as confirmed in italy xf is the cause of olive quick decline syndrome which dramatically brought the apulia olive growing sector to its knees hopkins and purcell 2002 saponari et al 2017 the bacterium is transmitted by xylem sap feeding insects almeida et al 2005 perring et al 2001 purcell et al 1999 redak et al 2004 host species and bacterium strains highly influence vector competence cavalieri and porcelli 2017 lopes et al 2009 in europe xf is mainly transmitted by the indigenous vector philaenus spumarius cornara et al 2018 cruaud et al 2018 moralejo et al 2019 more recently two other spittlebug species philaenus italosignus and neophilaenus campestris have also been identified as competent vectors cavalieri et al 2019 the xf epidemiological system is characterized by high variability and heterogeneity according to prevalence and spread of the infection sicard et al 2018 efsa plh panel 2019 the spatial and temporal patterns of disease dynamics strictly depend on the interactions among bacteria vectors and host plants in the pathosystem these interactions are mediated by complex physiological and pathological processes and strongly influenced by environmental variables e g temperature water stress almeida et al 2005 cornara et al 2017 jeger and bragard 2019 several models have been proposed to investigate the key factors determining the xf dynamics and how to manipulate them to support disease management parnell et al 2017 focusing on process based models a wide variety of approaches can be found in the literature reaction diffusion models chapman et al 2015 susceptible exposed infectious removed seir models jeger and bragard 2019 white et al 2020 lattice susceptible infected removed sir models fierro et al 2019 spatially explicit simulation models short distance deterministic and long distance stochastic kernels white et al 2017 discrete time versions of standard differential equations used in epidemiological compartmental models white et al 2019 and ordinary differential equation systems brunetti et al 2020 despite the variety of models proposed there is still the need to further explore the epidemiology of xf by integrating biological elements influencing the xf disease spread and growth mechanisms and patterns to contribute to the effort of developing integrated modeling approaches in view also of the need of supporting rational disease management we propose a xf eco epidemiological model xem describing the continuous spread of xf in an area xem is a spatially explicit mechanistic model considering the following biological processes i the growth of the bacterium into the xylem of the host plant ii the acquisition of the pathogen by the vector from an infected plant and its transmission to healthy plants iii the basic elements of the vector population dynamics iv the dispersal of the vector the environmental drivers affecting xf epidemic dynamics are considered in the model in terms of the impact on both the vector population dynamics and the development of the bacterial population in the host plant xem describes the spatio temporal dynamics of the disease and the vector in a continuous or patchy landscape with any composition of the plant community through the description of the landscape structure and the accurate calibration of the functions parameters xem can easily be adapted to describe any specific context and management strategies xem is a suitable tool to evaluate the effectiveness of different risk reducing options and practices aimed to the management of the disease pressure and spread as well as to compare the efficacy of strategies aimed at the eradication of new outbreaks in section 2 1 we describe the mathematical formulation and the biological assumptions of xem in section 2 2 we apply the model to the apulia outbreak of xf therefore the model components and the parameterization for the case study are presented the management strategies and scenario analysis approach are explained in section 2 3 the results of the scenario analysis on infection spread and management strategies are reported in section 3 discussion and conclusion are presented in section 4 2 materials methods 2 1 mathematical formulation xem describes the spread dynamics of xf in a spatial domain ω during the time interval 0 t xem is based on the following biological assumptions the univoltine biological cycle of the vector p spumarius is here simplified considering two phenological stages the pre imaginal stage and the adult stage the two stages do not overlap in xem an adult vector can become infected solely by feeding on an infected plant once infected the vector can transmit the bacterium feeding on other plants infecting and or re infecting i e increasing the bacteria load them the pre imaginal stage is not able to acquire neither to transmit the bacterium vector population dynamics are represented in a simplified way the phenological processes and events are described as occurring at pre defined times in the year depending on the site under consideration change in population abundance is described only for the adult stage by means of a site specific natural mortality function the initial conditions for the adult stage are set equal to a site specific maximum abundance interpreted as the local population carrying capacity if no external mortality factor is applied e g per imaginal or adult control each year adult population dynamics has the same initial conditions this assumption corresponds to the case in which adult fecundity exactly compensates pre imaginal mortality vectors move in the spatial domain only individuals in the adult stage can disperse and the dispersal behavior is modelled by means of a random walk motion vector long distance dispersal due to both human assisted or natural movement is disregarded the health status of a plant is described by the bacterial load titre in the xylem in an infected plant the bacterial load titre grows due to the multiplication of the bacterial population within the plant a plant can receive multiple successful inoculums of the disease pathogen due to the feeding of the infected vectors these multiple inoculums also contribute to bacterial population growth we disregard plant mortality depending on bacterial load therefore for a high level of bacterial load titre the plant remains a source of bacteria for adult vectors this simplified assumption can be acceptable for a relatively short time period relevant for management consideration as considered in this paper successful transmission of the pathogen to the host plant is described by a transmission function that considers i the vector feeding behavior also including the vector preference for the target host ii the capacity of the vector to transmit the pathogen iii the susceptibility s of a specific host plant species or cv to the pathogen the possibility that vectors take and spread the disease is influenced by the bacterial titre in the host plant xem considers only the short range spread of the disease we assume the disease to propagate solely by the natural local dispersal and the feeding activities of the vectors long jumps of the disease due to natural or human assisted dispersal of infected vectors or to the trade of infected plant material are not included in the model the model state variables are the abundance of infected adult vectors in the spatial point x at time γ x t the variable γ x t assumes values in the range 0 a x t where a x t is the adult vector abundance the abundance of uninfected adult vectors can be calculated as the difference between the vector population abundance and the abundance of infected vectors a x t γ x t γ x t is equal to 0 during the pre imaginal stage the health status of a host plant in the spatial point x at time t φ x t the health status of a host plant represents the level of bacteria load in that plant at time t and it assumes values in the range 0 1 as it is normalized to a maximum level of bacteria load see table 3 in a non infected plant the bacterium is absent therefore φ x t 0 in an infected plant φ x t is greater than 0 and proportional to the bacteria load in the plant for the sake of clarity hereinafter φ x t and γ x t will be reported without their parameters the spread in space and time of the disease is described through a nonlinear system composed of a parabolic partial differential equation for γ and a first order ordinary differential equation for φ 1 γ x t d δ γ x t m γ x t b x t a x t γ x t φ x t 2 φ x t s l x t γ x t f t φ x t 1 φ x t ν γ x t γ x t υ x 0 φ x 0 φ 0 x γ x 0 γ 0 x where δ is the laplacian operator ν is the normal versor on the boundary of ω ν stands for the outward normal derivative on the boundary of ω φ 0 x and γ 0 x are the initial conditions i e the status of the system at t 0 the parameters of the xem are defined in table 1 the biological meaning of the parameters and their estimation are reported in section 2 2 the spatial domain ω is approximated with a grid mesh considering the discrete counterpart of neumann homogeneous boundary conditions on the discrete scheme brezis 1986 the structure of the mesh is defined according to the characteristics of the landscape considered in a continuous and homogeneous landscape the host plants are placed in the nodes of the mesh and arranged in a continuous space with regular or irregular space among plants in a patchy landscape the host plants are present in restricted areas surrounded by unsuitable habitats or plants for the bacterium this patchy spatial configuration can support metapopulation analysis of disease dynamics vectors are present in the whole ω and the vector stage varies in time according to vector phenological dynamics mathematical and numerical analysis of the model is detailed in bazarra et al 2022 since we assume that functions b x t and l x t are positive globally bounded and lipschitz continuous the same existence uniqueness and regularity properties still hold for the solution of system proposed in bazarra et al 2022 2 2 model application xem is applied to the current epidemics of xf subsp pauca in olive groves in the apulia region southern italy in 2013 xf was identified in the salento peninsula near lecce in the southern part of the apulia where it infected millions of olive trees and caused the death of many of them at the beginning of 2019 the xf infected area included approximately 718 000 ha in the apulia region saponari et al 2019a regulation 2020b the spread of xf is still ongoing seriously threatening the apulian olive sector results of scientific studies conducted in the context of the apulian olive groves are used for estimating model functions and parameters related to the growth functions of the bacterium the development of symptoms the susceptibility of the different cultivars and the phenology of the vectors in the model application the meadow spittlebug p spumarius is considered the vector of xf to compensate for the lack of experimental data regarding the other functions and parameters of the model we referred to data in the efsa update of the scientific opinion on the risks to plant health posed by xylella fastidiosa in the eu territory 2019 2 2 1 landscape structure apulia is characterized by large olive groves with olive trees planted generally at large distances e g 6 10 m strona et al 2017 we represented this landscape by defining a homogenous mesh of 10 km x 10 km with equally spaced host plants the nodes of the mesh are the spatial units and represent cells of 10 10 m at the center of the node there is a susceptible olive tree we assumed the herbaceous cover between the hosts as not susceptible fig 1 so only olive to olive transmission is considered in this work we explored different disease dynamics scenarios by applying xem with different plant physiological responses and vector population abundance di serio et al 2019 since the situation in the apulian infected area is characterized by homogeneous fields cultivated with a predominant olive cultivar within a simulated scenario the host plants susceptibility is set equal for all nodes the typical agroecological conditions in the apulian olive growing region are included in the model the time step of the simulations is set to 1 day and the time horizon to 5 years 2 2 2 vector phenology and survival the pre imaginal stage occurs from the beginning of the year t i up to the appearance of the adult stage t v i and after oviposition t v f until the end of the year t f fig 2 the adults emerge from pre imaginal stage and occurs in the time interval t v i t v f in the this time interval the adults population abundance varies according to the survival profile a x t k m a x y t v f t t v f t v i starting from the site specific maximum carrying capacity k m a x x at t v i in the time interval t v i t v f the abundance of infected adults is defined by γ x t based on the climatic conditions of apulia and the data on adults emergence available in the literature bodino et al 2020 di serio et al 2019 we set t v i 130 may 10th and the end of period of vector feeding activities at t v f 300 october 27th the natural mortality rate of the infected adults the parameter m in eq 1 has been estimated equal to 0 015 da y 1 this value describes a survival curve that well approximates available data on the duration of the adult stage and the population abundance of p spumarius bodino et al 2019 bodino et al 2021 di serio et al 2019 2 2 3 vector dispersal only vectors in the adult stage can disperse their dispersal behavior is modelled by means of a random walk motion through the laplace operator δ and its diffusive coefficient d in eq 1 for the vector dispersal capacity we referred to the median dispersal distance of p spumarius estimated by efsa equal to 800 m year efsa plh panel 2019 the value of the diffusive coefficient d is derived using a simulation procedure an initial population of 1000 adult vectors is released in the center of the landscape at time t v i we selected the value of d such that at t v f half of the vector population is in a circular area of 800 m of radius from the point of release the estimated value of the parameter is d 1500 m 2 da y 1 2 2 4 bacteria acquisition rate to estimate the vector bacteria acquisition rate b x t eq 1 we referred to the median value 12 08 of the elicited distribution of acquisition rates of the vector reported in the efsa opinion efsa plh panel 2019 representing the daily probability of acquisition of the bacteria in optimal conditions e g the vector feeds on highly infected plants only in xem the acquisition rate of the vector in the efsa opinion is used to estimate the maximum value for b x t b m a x achievable when φ 1 to estimate b m a x a population of 1000 non infected vectors feeding on highly infected host plants is simulated after one day of feeding activity we obtained 12 08 of the vectors infected with b m a x 0 0995 d a y 1 in xem b m a x is scaled according to the health status of the plant we assumed that the probability of a successful daily feeding activity depends both on the bacterial titre in the plant and on the time spent in the feeding activity by the vector in a day to represent this process we used the ivlev model ivlev 1961 a non linear functional response widely used to describe the predator s efficiency in searching and capturing the prey as a function of prey density p x q 1 e j p in xem we set φ q b m a x and j 50 we select the value of j such that the bacteria acquisition rate is close to b m a x when φ x t 0 1 corresponding to a symptom s severity in the host plant equal to three see table 3 2 2 5 bacterial population growth function the bacterial population in an infected plant increases following the function f t eq 2 bacterial population growth varies according to the physiological state of the plant the environmental conditions and plant susceptibility concerning plant physiology and environmental conditions three periods in a year are identified i the physiological state of the host plant is not favourable to bacterial growth so f t 0 ii the host is in a favourable physiological state for the bacteria but the growth is sub optimal due to not favourable environmental conditions e g high temperature and low relative humidity so the bacterial population grows at a low rate f t r l iii both the host physiological state and the environmental conditions are favourable the bacterial population grows at a high rate f t r h the bacterial population growth function is defined as follows f t 0 t 1 t h 1 t h 4 365 r h t t h 1 t h 2 t h 3 t h 4 r l t t h 2 t h 3 with 1 t h 1 t h 2 t h 3 t h 4 365 for the apulian case we set t h 1 129 may 8th t h 2 212 july 29th t h 3 242 august 29th t h 4 287 october 12th growth rates depend also on the host plant susceptibility giampetruzzi et al 2016 saponari et al 2019b we used data from a field study on the dynamics of xf spread and symptoms development conducted in apulia in 2016 and 2017 montes borrego et al 2017 to derive the growth rates for different periods in the year and hosts susceptibility we considered a susceptible olive tree cultivar ogliarola and a tolerant cultivar leccino the best estimates for the bacteria growth functions table 2 are obtained starting from an initial bacteria inoculum φ i 0 0001 in the apulian datasets a percentage of host plants tolerant to infection n s throughout all the observation period is reported this cultivar dependent percentage table 2 has been considered in the model 2 2 6 plant susceptibility according to efsa 2019 plant susceptibility is defined as the probability that a non infected susceptible plant becomes systematically infected as a consequence of the feeding activity of an infected adult vector during a day we set the plant susceptibility s for tolerant host plant equal to the first quartile of the distribution for susceptibility elicited by efsa 2019 s 0 09 and to the median value of that distribution for susceptible host plants s 0 14 2 2 7 bacteria transmission to the plant infected vectors inoculate the bacteria into the host by feeding on the xylem sap of the plant in a plant not yet infected bacteria inoculum triggers the process of plant infection the bacteria inoculum per vector in a day is estimated equal to l 1 10 4 based on field studies on the dynamics of symptoms development xf montes borrego et al 2017 in xem the transmission of the bacteria from the vector population to the host plant population takes into account a density dependent reduction l l e 4 γ with the increase of vector population estimated based on results obtained by montes borrego et al 2017 this is to account for both the increase of the probability of vector feeding in already infected leaves of the host plants and the effects of intra species competition leading to the selection of host plants other than olive trees 2 2 8 symptoms severity we assume that during the asymptomatic period the plant is infected and infectious but it does not manifest any visual symptoms to correlate the level of infection of the plant φ t with the severity of the symptoms we referred to saponari et al 2019a these authors tested bacterial population load c for ogliarola and leccino cultivars and reported the estimation of symptoms severity measured on a 6 points scale 0 no symptoms 5 maximum level of symptoms i e the plant is no longer productive in table 3 we report the thresholds of bacteria load and the corresponding values of plant health status for each class of symptoms severity 2 3 simulation of epidemiological scenarios the xem parameterized as in section 2 2 is applied to explore the spatio temporal dynamics of xf considering two levels of vector abundance high and low and two levels of host plant susceptibility high and low table 4 based on data published in di serio et al 2019 we defined 20 adults per m2 as the high level of vector population and 1 adult per m2 as the low level of the vector population the onset of infection is simulated through the successful inoculation of nine susceptible plants in an area of 30 m radius in the center of a free area inoculation point disease dynamics are analysed for 5 years with a temporal resolution of 1 day the spatio temporal dynamics of the disease in the four scenarios are assessed at the end of each simulation year according to the following output variables infected host plants number of infected host plants disease pressure mean value of health status of the host plants φ the mean is computed only on infected plants i e φ 0 infected vector pressure mean annual density of the population abundance of infected vectors the mean is calculated only during the period of adult presence disease spread maximum distance of the infected plants from the inoculation point the simulations were conducted in matlab version r2018b applying the finite element approach to discretization further details are reported in bazarra et al 2022 2 4 simulation of management scenarios the definition of the management strategies to be tested is based on the european legislation in force at the time the study was carried out council directive 2000 29 ec 2000 decision eu 2015 789 2015 decision eu 2017 2352 2017 focusing on eradication measures in our study the management strategies are applied from the first detection of an infected plant in a free area i e an area where infected plants are not reported till the end of the simulation period following the detection of an infected plant three areas are marked out around the detection point area demarcation process the first area with a radius equal to the value of the cutting radius is defined as the infected area the second area is a circular crown with a minimum radius equal to the cutting radius and a major radius of 5000 m and is defined as the buffer zone the infected area and the buffer zone constitute the demarcated area immediately after the detection all potential xf host plants are cut and one adult vector control treatment is performed in the infected area in the years following the detection till the end of the simulation period the management strategy applied in the demarcated area consists of one weed treatment carried out in spring to control the nymph population and two vector control treatments carried out in late spring and in the summer the vector control treatments have the aim of reducing both the adult vector population in the current year and the vector population in the next year as a result of a reduction in the number of adults and then in the number of overwintering eggs that are laid therefore the repetition of treatment over years leads to a significant reduction in the abundance of the vector fig 3 graphically represents the management scheme applied in the scenario analysis the sequence and type of control treatments to be performed are different in the first year of detection than in subsequent years because it is not possible to carry out weed treatment for nymphs control in the first year of detection management strategies are applied for 5 years based on the overall structure of the management strategies described in fig 3 four factors relevant to eco epidemiological dynamics and of interest to international policymakers are tested efficacy of adult vector and weed control actions the radius of the cutting area time of the first detection time to intervention for each factor two levels are tested defining a total of 16 management scenarios low efficacy of control treatments corresponds to 60 of nymph mortality following weeds treatments and 50 of adult mortality following chemical control of the adults while high efficacy corresponds to 80 of nymph mortality following weeds treatments and 90 of adult mortality following chemical control of the adults the large cutting radius corresponds to 100 m the small cutting radius is set to 50 m two times for the first detection were considered early and late detection occurs 3 and 4 years after inoculation respectively finally we tested the impact of two different implementation times of the control actions early and late intervention occur 30 and 60 days after the detection respectively the early intervention corresponds to the first period of adult flight just after adults emergence the efficacy of the management strategies scenarios was assessed by considering the characteristics of the worst case scenario i e the eco epidemiological scenario where at the 5th year after infection the infected area was greater the management strategies were applied for 5 years including the years of the first detection at the end of the simulation the xf infection dynamics were assessed we checked whether the infection was completely eradicated or not and the spread of the infection measured in terms of the proportion of infected area under managed conditions compared with the area obtained in the unmanaged epidemiological scenario at the same time horizon 3 results 3 1 disease pressure the spatio temporal dynamics of the infection in the simulation scenarios are represented in fig 4 the mean disease level in the infected plants decreases with a common pattern over the spatial dimension in the four scenarios fig 4 a however only in the epidem hh the mean level of the disease is at least equal to the first level of severity of symptoms outside the area of radius 50 meter from the points of inoculum in the epidem lh and epidem ll cases the mean disease levels never reach the third level of severity of symptoms the temporal dynamics are then assessed on the worst case scenario i e the one with the highest average disease pressure in the epidem hh scenario the mean level of disease in infected plants grows very slowly in the first 3 years of simulation fig 4 b the threshold of visual detection of symptoms i e severity class of 1 is exceeded in the fourth year of simulation up to 50 m from the inoculation site in the fifth year symptoms are visible up to 300 m from the inoculation site 3 2 infected vector pressure the mean densities of infected vectors decrease with a common pattern over the spatial dimension in all the simulation scenarios although the maximum population values are quite different fig 5 b the temporal dynamics of the density of infected vectors are shown for the scenario epidem hh in fig 5 a in the last year of simulation the highest mean density of infected vectors for the two scenarios characterized by a low vector abundance is equal to 0 16 epidem hl and 0 08 epidem ll vectors per 100 m2 for the hh scenario the mean density of infected vectors per 100 m2 in the last year of simulation is greater than 1 only within the first 500 m from the inoculation point 3 3 infected host plants the annual distributions of infected host plants for each simulation scenario are shown in fig 6 the highest number of infected plants almost 70 000 equal to 6 58 of the host plants in the landscape occurred in the scenario epidem hh in the epidem ll there are less than 3000 infected plants at the end of the 5th year of simulation 3 4 disease spread the spread of the infection has been assessed based on the dynamics of the 5 years of simulation focusing on the initial build up of an invasion front at the end of the simulation period the maximum distance of infected plants from the initial inoculation point is approximately 1500 m for scenario hh 970 m for lh 600 m for hl and 340 m for ll the spread rates for each scenario expressed as km travelled by the invasion front per year are reported in fig 7 the spread rates increase over time with different non linear patterns based on the simulation scenario considered at the end of the simulation period the spread rate is 0 56 km per year for the scenario hh 0 43 km per year for lh and about 0 28 km per year for hl and ll 3 5 management option efficacy the basic epidemiological scenario used to define the management strategies was scenario epidem hh high density of vector population and high susceptibility of the host plant to xf the results of the scenario analysis on management strategies are shown in table 5 in nine of the 16 management scenarios xf infection was successfully eradicated with different impacts in terms of the spread of infection depending on the strategy adopted from the outcomes the effects of control efficacy cut radius time to detection and intervention can be derived the greatest effect on eradication is determined by the efficacy of nymphs and adult control treatments in the eight scenarios where high efficacy of control actions was simulated the infection was eradicated at the end of the assessment period in the eight scenarios where control actions have low efficacy only one management strategy leads to eradication early detection early intervention and a cut radius of 100 m in all the other management scenarios with low vector control efficacy eradication is not achieved furthermore in the seven scenarios where eradication is not achieved the management actions reduce the pressure of the infected vectors to less than 0 035 vectors m2 4 discussion and conclusion in xem the main biological processes related to the disease dynamics are described in detail with reference to i the vector acquisition of the bacterium from the plant ii the bacterial transmission rate from the vector to the plant iii the growth process of the pathogen inside the plant and iv the vector s dispersal rates and functions describing these processes can be adapted to environmental characteristics and host susceptibility process functions and parameters can also be adapted to different vector species and xf subspecies or strains the application of xem to the case of the spread of xf in apulia allowed estimating the spread rate of the infection under the hypothesis that the bacterium is spread by natural vector dispersal only the disease spread rate increases year by year and reaches about 0 6 km per year 5 years after the initial inoculation the average annual spread of the infection is expected to be considerably greater if long jumps are considered bodino et al 2021 a critical issue in dealing with emerging diseases is related to knowledge gaps tamborindeguy et al 2017 the lack of historical data on biological processes makes it difficult to calibrate the models on the analysed system even when it is possible to describe the dynamics in formal and modeling terms the estimations of xem parameters are affected by a set of variability and uncertainty sources related to model assumptions and to the eco epidemiological system that is studied the susceptibility of plants influences the growth rate of the bacterial population in the plant and it has a significant impact on the duration of the asymptomatic period the xem allows for the evaluation of the progression of the disease in the plants the possibility of defining specific growth rates for different periods of the year to account for plant phenology and environmental conditions and host plant susceptibilities among species or individuals within the same species allows for the application of xem to several agroecosystems furthermore associating the host plant health status with a scale of symptoms onset allows for modeling any type of disease latency i e the period in which the pathogen is present in the plant but it is not detectable neither visually nor with laboratory diagnostic procedures the calibration of xem parameters related to disease growth and latency period requires knowledge on the susceptibility of the host plants cultivars of interest and the specific bacterial growth mechanisms within these species recent studies are bringing evidence regarding the importance of weeds in the xf olive tree vector pathosystem as they represent both the habitat where the vector nymphs complete their development and a possible reservoir for the bacterium aniţa et al 2021 brunetti et al 2020 in our study the herbaceous plant community has been considered only as support in the pre imaginal stage development further developments of the model may include the weeds as a potential host for the bacterium in order to assess their contribution to the epidemiology of xf olive tree vector pathosystem the variability related to vector spread rate and dispersal patterns can be addressed by modifying the uncertainty distribution for the vector dispersal kernel a different spread rate or a non homogenous distribution of the disease could have direct effects on the assessment of spatio temporal dynamics of disease spread and therefore on the assessment of management or eradication strategies the vector acquisition rate can be modified to consider the within and between species variability in the feeding rate and preference the density of the vector population is highly variable since the scenario results showed that it had a strong impact on xf spread actions aimed to strongly reduce vector population abundance could be key elements for the success of eradication strategies for these reasons careful studies to estimate the abundance of the population should be preliminary to the implementation of the xem model in scenario analysis of epidemiological dynamics the rate of successful transmission of the pathogen from the infected vector to the host plant and from an infected plant to the vector are among the parameters that most influence system dynamics the results of new experimental studies on these factors could easily be included in xem the generality and flexibility of xem make the model a suitable tool to better understand the disease mechanisms and patterns and to evaluate the effectiveness of different risk reducing options and practices devoted to the management of the disease pressure and spread xem can also be used for the evaluation of management and or eradication strategies in our scenario analysis the high efficacy of vector and weed control intervention are identified as the key factors for a successful eradication in accordance with aniţa et al 2021 the prompt intervention after infection detection could limit the impact of xf when eradication is not achieved from simulation outcomes it emerges that the management measures are effective if performed just after adults emergence early intervention limiting the density of infected vectors that rapidly increases over the favourable season this result is an example of useful information to support decision making as it underlines the importance of limiting the delay in applying control actions other things being equal in the system considered the cut off radius is crucial for eradication only when there is early detection and timely intervention and the efficacy of vector control is low in these scenarios the 100 m cut radius allows achieving the eradication whereas a smaller radius 50 m does not allow this the management strategies influence the infection spread measured in the percentage of the infected area compared to the infected area in the unmanaged scenario in particular lower infected areas occur in all the scenarios with early detection in the scenarios where eradication is not achieved the spread of infection can be reduced by reducing the time of application of intervention measures early intervention from the analyses carried out it emerges that further knowledge is needed on the main sources of uncertainty in the eco epidemiological system analysed in particular the susceptibility of the host plants the rate at which the bacteria are acquired by the vector the range of movement of the vector and the delay in detecting the disease xem could be used to assess the outcome of the application of different detection and control strategies each process described in xem e g vector plant transmission asymptomatic period growth of the bacterium into the plant vector phenology is defined by specific parameters the inclusion in the model of detection control strategies is simplified and requires only the estimation of the impact that these actions have on related parameters of the model e g a control action of the vector will reduce the carrier s carrying capacity being spatially explicit xem allows assessing the impact of actions only in the areas where they are implemented furthermore the temporal resolution of the model and the inclusion of the phenology of both host plants and vectors allows the evaluation of the variability of the efficacy of the detection control strategies according to the period in which they are carried out the huge efforts and investments in research on xf led to an increasing amount of knowledge on both the bacterium e g the basic mechanisms of disease infection and growth in the host plant and the vectors e g phenology however this knowledge body of growing complexity urgently needs integration into efficient and readily available tools to support strategies for preventing and mitigating the effects of xf these tools should be able to stock up on low scale e g i state model to high scale p state model knowledge gyllenberg 2007 caswell and john 1992 xem allows integrating the scientific evidence at various spatial and temporal resolutions from individual plants to large scale heterogeneous landscapes including the effects of environmental drivers climate and land use and climate change therefore xem could be implemented in control strategies for xf management at different levels from field to regional from operational to policy supporting the implementation of risk reduction options in plant health and for selecting control techniques and guiding the development of ipm strategies at the farm and area wide level credit authorship contribution statement gianni gilioli conceptualization formal analysis methodology software writing review editing
