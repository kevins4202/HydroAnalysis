3090,the hierarchical agricultural water resource management problem in shallow groundwater area is expected to be solved through establishing a practical and feasible mathematical model this study proposes a multi level programming model with considerations of process based crops growth model and uncertainties the model is solved by a fuzzy approach that ensures the decision making proceeds from top to bottom sequentially and the leader supervises the solution search direction the leeway given by each level decision maker expands the decision making space and lets stackelberg equilibrium solution more satisfactory the model is applied in hetao irrigation district in china after optimization the stackelberg equilibrium water allocation pattern and satisfaction degrees of each level decision makers can be identified summarized conclusions are as follows 1 under uncertainties of available water the water diversion is allocated in a similar pattern while the groundwater allocation has larger variabilities 2 when available water decreases local farmers can improve crop production through modifying or optimizing irrigation water amount in each growth period 3 the combined use of water diversion and groundwater is expected to become an effective approach for achieving a win win situation between government managers and local farmers the proposed model performs well in generating stackelberg equilibrium solutions satisfied by multi level decision makers it can be extended to provide decision makers a more complete decision support system and also has potential to be applied in other similar areas keywords shallow groundwater area optimization uncertainty stackelberg game multi level programming problem data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction human food demand is expected to continuously increase in the coming decades as a result of population growth progressive urbanization and socioeconomic development davis et al 2016 changing climate leads to great volatility and uncertainties in available water resource resulting in a big challenge of agricultural water resource allocation thiery et al 2021 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b recent studies have provided various strategies about water allocation among multi users towards multi objectives such as agricultural sustainable development and enhancing crops yields zhang 2021b zhang et al 2021a yue et al 2021 however most pareto solutions necessitate strong cooperation between multi benefits subjects by working out large compromises to achieve common goals yue et al 2021 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b limited researches focused on agricultural water resource system in hierarchical organizations where there is weak cooperation or noncooperation especially in shallow groundwater areas featured with shallow ground water level and high soil salt content that largely affect crops growth agricultural water resources system is a hierarchical system with multi level managers and water demanders seeking their own optimal objectives zhang f et al 2020 hierarchical problem is an extension of stackelberg game to solve decentralized planning problems where decisions are made sequentially from leaders to followers with full information but noncooperation baky i 2014 stackelberg 1952 the decision of each lower level decision maker dm is affected by actions and restrictions of upper level dms stackelberg 1952 wu et al 2022 schwarting et al 2019 where there is a complicated gaming process among multi level dms after many rounds of games a stackelberg equilibrium solution will be realized among multi level dms multi objective optimization or single bi level programming methods that are widely applied in agricultural water resource management obviously cannot represent the actual hierarchical structure zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b although some researches started to propose water allocation strategies in shallow groundwater area from the perspective of hierarchical management jiang et al 2021 the interactions and gaming process within multi level dms are still ignored and not considered additionally the complex physical processes such as crop growth process and frequent water and salt exchanges between soil and groundwater increase the difficulties in solving optimization problems zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b flourishing developments of precision agriculture and water conservancy informatization also call for more practical and inclusive decision making approaches to address high nonlinearities in studying hierarchical water resource management system mazzega et al 2014 to address hierarchical problems the multi level programming method is required for mathematical modelling and finding feasible solutions the multi level programming problem mlpp is derived from bi level programming problem blpp but more common and practical in the real world baky 2014 blpp is usually solved by vertex enumeration algorithms bialas and karwan 1982 and transformation approaches based on kkt conditions lagrangian terms and penalty functions li et al 2022a b li et al 2021 elsisy sayed 2019 zhang et al 2019 however these traditional methods will dramatically increase computational and storage requirements in solving mlpp and the complex non linearity after transformation may lead non deterministic polynomial complete problem np ben ayed blair 1990 jeroslow 1985 bard et al 2000 even make original problems unmanageable shih et al 1996 firstly proposed a fuzzy approach for solving mlpp based on fuzzy theory which is able to handle multi level linear and nonlinear problems this method has been applied in many research areas and gradually applied in more complex models and larger research scales zhang et al 2016 such as supply chain management traffic transportation network design and energy management zhang et al 2016 ahmadi et al 2021 this method was applied in arid agricultural regions with much deep groundwater level in the research of zhang et al 2020b however very few researches adopted this method to study water allocation problems in shallow groundwater area except for difficulties in the model establishment and solving method for hierarchical water resource management system uncertain factors existing agricultural systems such as uncertain available water resource price and climate changes doubtlessly increase complexities in water allocation and decision making processes zhou et al 2016 these uncertain factors are generally quantified by interval numbers fuzzy numbers and stochastic distributions based on data availabilities zhou et al 2016 yu et al 2020 rani et al 2021 uncertainty factors will lead uncertain water allocation solution resulting in a solution set instead of a deterministic solution zhao 1995 chen chen 2015 in blpp some researchers obtained multi solutions under different scenarios generated by different confidence levels of uncertainty factors jin et al 2018 osman et al 2004 sakawa et al 2000 however limited researches have revealed the impacts of uncertainties on mlpp and nash equilibrium solution in stackelberg game nor given practical suggestions facing uncertainties baky 2010 the main contribution of this study is establishing a comprehensive decision making model to solve agriculture hierarchical water management problems in shallow groundwater area with the consideration of uncertainties and process based crop growth model the proposed model is applied in hetao irrigation district in china firstly the stackelberg equilibrium water allocation pattern of groundwater and water diversion under uncertainties are determined then we examine impacts of maximum middle and minimum available water on stackelberg equilibrium solutions to try to give suggestions for tackling extreme situations and the supplementary understanding of solving method in this study is furtherly discussed the analysis in this study aims to provide theoretical foundation for hierarchical decision making thereby helping to improve decision making efficiency in shallow groundwater area 2 study area 2 1 study area the research area in this study is hetao irrigation district hid a typical shallow groundwater area located in the west of inner mongolia autonomous region 40 13 42 28 n 105 12 109 53 e in china fig 1 hid is in an arid and semi arid region under temperate continental semiarid and monsoon climate sun 2014 with average precipitation less than 250 mm per year and evaporation reaching 2011 2300 mm per year xue et al 2018 hid has flat terrain with the mean slope at 0 05 there are five sub irrigation districts in hid respectively dengkou hanghou linhe wuyuan wulateqianqi district from west to east based on local canal system distribution land use distribution irrigation condition soil characteristics and administrative division hid can be divided into 12 water supply response units luo et al 2021 in order as yigan wulahe yangjiahe huangji yongji fengji zaohuo shahe yihe tongji changji and tabu from west to east as an important commodity grain base of china over 80 planted area in hid is used for growing wheat maize and sunflower and annually around 2 324 4 036 billion m3 water is diverted from the yellow river from april to september used for hid s agricultural development at the same time plenty of water is sept down into groundwater directly raising up ground water level which fluctuates between 1 5 m and 3 m xu et al 2010 sun s et al 2016 the shallow ground water level results in frequent vertical water exchange between groundwater and surface soil water much salt rises to surface soil carried with irrigation water and groundwater evaporation owing to intense evaporation and poor drainage substantial salt remains in shallow soil and increases surface soil salt content 2 2 problem statement due to high dependency on water diversion from the yellow river the water management system in hid is a typical hierarchal management system stackelberg game is formed among three level dms in the first level the national government manager dm allows local people draw water from the yellow river for agricultural irrigation and ensuring national food security the national government manager has the largest decision making power to determine how much water hid can divert from the yellow river and how much groundwater hid can extract since they have to balance water demand of multi water users along the yellow river and avoid environment problems caused by ground water level decline in the second level the local government manager dm is response of allocating water to each water supply response unit under the given total water availability by the first level dm they care about the allocation fairness to reduce social contradictions and conflicts but should firstly satisfy the first level dm s goal in the third level the local farmers dm hope to earn high incomes by planting crops they can determine how much water to irrigate each crop in different growth periods to reduce costs during diversion gap period they prefer extracting groundwater and tend to give more water to crops with high economic efficiency these three level dms have their own objectives and decision variables the decision making of lower level dms depends on the restricts of upper level dms and in turn produce effects on upper level dms decisions it is necessary to establish an optimization model to reflect their leader follower relationship and contain the interactive process as mentioned in the section 2 1 complex water and salt movements between surface soil and groundwater increase complexities of decision making large water diversion raises groundwater level letting more capillary water from groundwater rise into crop root layers xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 at the same time the salt carried with water improves soil salinization risks and too high soil salt increases crops wilting point and then decrease crop production these two contradictory processes affect local farmers determine crops proper irrigation amount in hid the primary uncertain factor that influences multi level decision making is the available water caused by stochastic climate variability and unpredictable human activities including available water diversion and available groundwater these values relate to decision variables of dms and furtherly change obtained goals and stackelberg equilibrium states based on the above the establishment of the multi level programming model in shallow groundwater area should consider the actual demands of each level dm the rules in the hierarchical system the complex field water salt movement and uncertainties in available water 2 3 solutions and framework to solve above problems firstly this study establishes a hierarchal water resources allocation decision system based on the theory of shih et al 1996 with illustrating goals and decision variables of each level dm the goals from top to bottom are to maximize food production minimize gini coefficient and to maximize economic benefits the decision variables of national government management are total water diversion and total groundwater usage while the decision variables of local government manager are water diversion and groundwater allocation in each wsru the decision variables of local farmers are water diversion and groundwater usage of each crop in each growth period in crops growing model the detailed water salt balance model is built to show dynamic soil water and salt content changes water salt stress coefficients are used to reflect water salt stress degrees to crops which have influences on crops actual evapotranspiration based on this the actual crop yield can be calculated through jensen crop production functions according to the fuzzy theory the available water diversion and groundwater are expressed as triangle and trapezoid fuzzy numbers by setting different α c u t s the uncertain available water can be transformed to deterministic values then the obtained available water and process based crop growth model are integrated to multi level programming model which is solved by a fuzzy multi level programming method the fuzzy satisfaction membership functions can be established with leeway of goals and variables given by each level dm after adjusting membership functions to proper values the stackelberg equilibrium solutions can be obtained there are some assumptions in modeling 1 crop and soil conditions are assumed to be consistent in each water supply response unit 2 the lateral water and salt exchange among different units is ignored 3 the meteorological drought year 2011 is regarded as context for crops growth the established system framework is shown in fig 2 3 methodology 3 1 model development in order to clearly present all parameters used in the model the notations are presented in table c 1 of appendix c 3 1 1 objective functions 3 1 1 1 maximizing grain production ensuring food security is the objective of national government manager the first level dm who expects high food production according to the definition of food security wheat and maize are two grain crops while sunflower is cash crop therefore the total food production in hid contains the total yield of wheat and the total yield of maize the yield of each crop can be calculated by jensen crop production functions zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b requiring the actual evapotranspiration of crops in each crop growth period the objective function and jenson crop production function can be expressed as follow 1 maxe f 1 i 1 12 j 1 2 a ij e y aij e y aij y mij t 1 t j ee t aijt e t cijt e ijt 3 1 1 2 minimizing gini coefficient the water allocation fairness is the objective of local government manager the second level dm under limited water resources it is possible to allocate more water to areas with good soil and climate conditions to reach high crop production caused water allocation unfairness may arise conflicts between farmers and local government manager or among different water users which will cause instability in society that is not expected and an action to be avoided by local government manager as much as possible gini coefficient proposed by gini corrado 1912 is a measure of inequality of distribution defined as a ratio between 0 and 1 which is the area between lorenz curve and the perfect distribution line fig 3 gini coefficient can be used to measure the inequality of water resource allocation among different water supply response units the ratio of total water allocation the sum of water diversion and groundwater allocated in each unit to the water demand is selected as the indicator reflecting the degree of water allocation in each unit the calculation of gini coefficient in this study can be presented as follows 2 minegini k 1 12 p k e r wqk 2 k 1 12 p k 1 e a r wqk 1 e r wqk j 1 3 t 1 t j a kj e w kjt e q kjt j 1 3 t 1 t j a kj e t ckjt k 1 12 j 1 3 t 1 t j a kj e w kjt e q kjt j 1 3 t 1

degree of water allocation fairness is 0 3 1 1 3 maximizing economic benefits maximizing economic benefits is the goal of local farmers the third level dm the economic benefit depends on costs the actual crop production and the price of crops the costs required include water fees of water diversion and energy fees for extracting and purifying groundwater due to high salt content in groundwater the net economic benefits of farmers can be expressed as follows 3 maxe f 3 i 1 12 j 1 3 p r cropj a ij e y aij e c w e c e c ecw p r water i 1 12 j 1 3 t 1 t j a ij e w ijt ecec p r groundwater i 1

crop production equation 1 which is influenced by environmental conditions such as climate change and soil conditions according to the water and salt exchanges between groundwater and soil shown in fig 4 the hydrological process involves water diversion amount groundwater allocation precipitation groundwater evaporation deep percolation and actual crop water consumption the actual crop evapotranspiration equation 8 is calculated using the method demonstrated by fao 56 allen et al 1998 with considerations of water stress coefficient equation 6 and salt stress coefficient equation 7 in this method soil water content and salt content can be obtained from the water salt balance model equation 9 14 if soil water content is higher than field water holding capacity the surplus water will seep into the groundwater soil salt content has effects on withering point equation 6 salt stress coefficient equation 7 and the water amount that crops can absorb from the root zone which furtherly influence water stress coefficient equation 6 4 e p corijt p j e e c eijt e c ethj p j b j 100 ee c eijt e c ethj p j e e c eijt e c ethj 5 e w wpsijt w wpi e e c eijt e c ethj w wpi b j ee

model with uncertainties is a hierarchical management problem that can be solved by fuzzy multi level programming method proposed by shih et al 1996 that is shown in appendix a the transformation method of fuzzy numbers is shown in appendix b the key to solve this model is how to build and modify fuzzy satisfactory membership functions of each objective value and decision variable and how to transform uncertainties to deterministic values the solving process is as following steps step 1 give fuzzy membership degree α from 0 1 to 1 0 of uncertainties fuzzy available water resource step 2 based on given α transform fuzzy available water resource to deterministic available water diversion and groundwater step 3 build fuzzy satisfaction membership functions of objective values and decision variables from first level dm to third level dm step 4 solve the model by maximizing minimum satisfaction degrees through genetic algorithm on matlab r2019a if optimal solution pattern can be obtained continue to step 5 if there is no optimal solution turn to step 3 and rebuild fuzzy satisfaction membership functions step 5 change fuzzy membership degree α of uncertainties and turn to step 1 until α 1 0 step 6 analyze all generated solutions 3 3 data collection and software most data used in this study was collected from yearbooks of bayannur such as yearly available water diversion and groundwater and crops planting area in each wsru some data related to crops growth was collected from research papers that researchers conducted field experiments in hid jiang et al 2019 xue et al 2017 yue 2004 hou et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a xue et al 2018 parameters used in equations were all validated appropriate for hid li et al 2020 gao et al 2018 pen et al 1992 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b meteorological data in sub irrigation districts was collected from meteorological stations and downloaded from the website of china meteorological data service center 4 results 4 1 first level decision maker the total water diversion from the yellow river and groundwater resources decision variable of first level dm is shown in fig 5 it shows that water diversion from the yellow river is the main water resource for agricultural development under different α c u t s the water diversion accounts for around 88 02 93 15 of total agricultural water usage while groundwater accounting for 6 85 11 98 the ratio of water supplement reaches to 87 31 97 35 in hid the ratio of total water allocation to total water demand 4 2 second level decision maker figs 6 7 show water allocation results in each wsru after optimization second level dm s decision variables it shows that the water diversion should be mainly allocated to yigan yangjiahe huangji yongji fengji and yihe wsrus whose water diversion allocation is near or over 10 of total water diversion the sum water diversion allocation of these units exceeds 60 of total available water diversion and this value is relatively stable under different α c u t s the groundwater resource is also mainly allocated to yigan yangjiahe huangji yongji fengji and yihe wsrus with highest allocation in yongji zaohuo and yihe units however the groundwater allocation pattern presents significant differences among different α c u t s for example the maximum groundwater allocation in yongji and yihe units is around 517 19 and 440 of the minimum value the groundwater allocation in wulahe shahe changji and tabu units is relatively low and also changes with samll fluctuations for the perspective of water satisfaction degree the ratio of water allocation to water demand supplementary fig 1 the degree of yongji unit reaches to the maximum value with 94 44 followed by tabu 94 19 fengji 93 77 and tongji 93 53 units 4 3 third level decision maker the third level dm can determine the irrigation amount and irrigation time of each crop in each growth period fig 8 11 show that the water allocation of crops presents large differences in areas with large water demand under uncertain available water different α c u t s however obtained maize yields in each wsru show a relatively stable trend under different α c u t s as well as wheat yield except for zaohuo wsru supplementary fig 2 4 compared with food crops wheat and maize the sunflower yield largely changes as α c u t s with the difference of 1 97 44 34 this result indicates that maize and wheat have priorities being allocated more water under uncertain water availability and wheat in zaohuo unit has lower water supply priority fig 9 fig 10 for the detailed water and salt movement process this study takes yangjiahe wsru as an example to analyze crop water consumption soil water content soil salt content ground water level and groundwater evaporation at field scale under different α c u t s yangjiahe wsru is allocated relatively middle water allocation amount compared with other wsrus however small changes in wheat and maize actual evapotranspiration actual water consumption under different α c u t s can be observed fig 11 that means modifying and optimizing water diversion and groundwater in each growth stage can effectively help to meet the water demand for food crops growth meanwhile markedly different water allocation of cash crop sunflower under different α c u t s results in big changes in actual water consumption soil water content ground water level and groundwater evaporation 4 4 stackelberg equilibrium solutions stackelberg equilibrium solutions under different α c u t s are shown in fig 12 fig 13 it indicates that objective values do not all rise with increased water availability although the sum of available water diversion and groundwater is increased with α in supplementary table 1 and table 2 it can be observed that the water availability declines during may when is the water sensitivity period and critical water demand period of food crops wheat and maize the available water decline in water sensitivity period can still cause crop yield reduction though the total water availability increases in other periods april june august and september compared with economic benefits the objective of third level dm and water allocation fairness the objective of second level dm the high food production first level dm s objective and satisfaction degree of groundwater usage first level dm s decision variable are harder to realize fig 12 the satisfaction degree of groundwater usage fluctuates between 0 79 0 87 and that of total food production is all lower than 0 8 this result means realizing high food production is in a weaker position than economic benefits and water allocation equality in the stackelberg game and first level dm s objective and decision variables should be paid much attention to try to improve them as far as possible even so this result is consistent with the actual situation that local government manager has to set strict minimum area for planting food crops to ensure food security and has to limit groundwater exploitation by introducing punishment policies 5 discussion 5 1 max middle min scenarios in order to reveal effects of large decline in water availability on multi level decision making process this study divides three available water scenarios based on boundary points of triangular trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to obtain stackelberg game solutions under extreme conditions in triangular trapezoidal fuzzy numbers the left point under α 0 is the lowest water availability scenario with lowest possibility the value under α 1 is the middle water availability scenario with largest possibility the right point under α 0 is the highest water availability scenario with lowest possibility under these three scenarios the optimization is conducted and its results are shown from figs 14 19 5 1 1 stackelberg equilibrium solutions and first level decision maker in stackelberg equilibrium solutions figs 14 15 satisfaction degrees of water allocation fairness the objective of second level dm reach maximum values while that of food production and groundwater usage are at lower values and satisfaction degrees of food production all reach minimum values at 0 65 under the minimum water availability scenario and at 0 79 under the maximum water availability scenario this indicates that high food production and low groundwater usage are harder to realize whereas water allocation fairness can be easily achieved the objectives of high food production and low groundwater usage are in vulnerable positions and should be taken seriously in the case with limited available water from the perspective of first level dm fig 16 to some extent obtaining high food production is contradictory with reducing groundwater usage utilizing more groundwater for irrigation can improve food production but decrease satisfaction degree of groundwater usage thus under quite low available water scenario it is a possible thing that the satisfaction degree of groundwater usage becomes lower than that of food security what should be noticed is that satisfaction degrees of food production and economic benefits under maximum water availability scenario are all higher than that under middle water availability scenario and satisfaction degrees of water allocation fairness and groundwater usage are both lower than that under middle water availability scenario it is because higher crop production and higher benefits are obtained through extracting more groundwater under high water availability scenario realizing stackelberg equilibrium in another word persistently increasing water diversion does not help to increase food production and economic benefits but the combined use of water diversion and groundwater may be a better strategy for achieving high food production and high economic benefits the behind reason may relate to the special condition of hid where the perennial diversion of water from the yellow river has raised the groundwater level and increased soil salt content in shallow soil layers if the water diversion of the yellow river is continuously increased the groundwater level may be furtherly increased which is also not conducive to reduce soil salt content thus regularly extracting groundwater may be necessary for achieving a win win situation between government managers and local farmers using groundwater for irrigation has three advantages 1 the groundwater use efficiency is higher than water diversion due to less transport loss and evaporation 2 moderately extracting groundwater can help to decline groundwater level pretending further accumulation of soil salt on the soil surface and reducing soil salinization risks however the critical problem for loosely extracting groundwater is how to define the total amount of groundwater that can be extracted additionally the gini coefficient under low water availability scenario is significantly increased by 256 83 than that under middle water availability scenario and its satisfaction degree is declined by 10 79 that means the decline in water availability will aggravating the water allocation unfairness more water resource will be allocated towards areas with higher water use efficiency 5 1 2 second level decision maker in fig 17 similar water diversion patterns can be observed under three water availability scenarios however groundwater resource is differently allocated to wsrus which is mainly allocated to yigan yangjiahe huangji yongji fengji units the groundwater allocation rate the ratio of the groundwater allocation in one unit to the total water availability shows an increasing trend as available water declines under low water availability scenario the groundwater allocation rate in yongji unit rises to 21 92 and the rate in yigan unit increases to 16 39 the water supply ratios are all over 89 under middle and high water availability scenarios in each wsru fig 18 ratios of total water allocation to water demand as water availability decreasing significant differences of water supply ratios are presented among 12 wsrus the maximum ratio is observed in yongji wsru at 61 98 and the minimum ratio is 42 09 in shahe unit 5 1 3 third level decision maker from the perspective of crops wheat maize and sunflower are allocated approximately similar water when available water is equal to or more than middle water availability fig 19 if available water declines water supply ratios of wheat maize and sunflower are decreased by 3 27 56 04 15 14 41 02 and 57 70 71 29 respectively sunflower has the largest decrease 5 2 solving method for stackelberg game in this study the stackelberg game contains three individual levels with objectives of maximizing food production maximizing economic benefits minimizing gini coefficient as well as minimizing the total groundwater usage the method for solving stackelberg equilibrium solution is maximizing the minimum satisfaction degree of involved objectives and decision variables as results shown the satisfaction degrees sd of food production under ten α c u t s are all the minimum values at 0 7833 0 7892 compared with that of gini coefficient and economic benefits all over 0 90 in this case the food production is continually maximized until the interaction time reaches preset maximum time as long as sds of economic benefits and gini coefficient are higher than that of food production sds of economic benefits and gini coefficient are left untouched and not optimized only changes with food production the sds may not evolve towards maximum economic benefits and minimum gini coefficient but the minimum sd is improved maximizing the minimum satisfaction degree is to minimize compromises as far as possible other than traditional approaches this special solving method may be the second reason for irregular changes of sds as α c u t s changes summarily from a holistic perspective the obtained stackelberg solution is an optimal solution from the perspective of individual stakeholder the obtained solution is a satisfactory solution furthermore the sd of groundwater usage 0 6673 approaches to the sd of food production 0 6548 as available water declines to the minimum availability presumably the sd of groundwater usage may become the lowest value if available water continues to declines this means the sd of first level dms decision variable turns to a weaker position before that sds of food production and groundwater usage will be interlaced maximized until one position steadily becomes the lowest one 5 3 differences between multi level and multi objective programming problems in this study fuzzy satisfaction membership functions for solving multi level programming problems can also be used to deal with multi objective programming problems however fuzzy satisfaction membership functions have different meanings in these two games in multi level programming problems there is no cooperation among multi level dms multi dms are in leader and follower relationships leaders make decisions firstly followers have to make their decisions within the decision space given by leaders if multi level programming problems are solved through transformation approaches based on kkt or penalty conditions followers optimality conditions will become strict constraints of leaders problems that is he or she dominates the solution search process for solving multi level programming problem the introduced fuzzy satisfaction membership functions are leeway given by each level dm from the original intention of the method proposed by shih et al 1996 the leeway for establishing fuzzy satisfaction membership functions should be completely acceptable by each level dm smaller leeway may lead lower satisfaction degree but not mean the solution is unsatisfactory since unsatisfied solution will be rejected and cannot be passed to other level dms the leeway actually expands the decision making space for achieving a more satisfactory solution in the multi level structure but should not be considered as a degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction in multi objective programming problems multi stakeholders virtual or physical are in a cooperative relationship where their actions and decisions are to realize a potential goal or a vison together multi objective programming method is widely used in various researches however its internal logic is usually ignored for example in the research of zhang et al 2021a b three stakeholders virtual were set to maximize food production maximize water use efficiency and minimize energy consumption and their behind potential goal or vision is to achieve agricultural sustainable development a vague goal or vision these three stakeholders have to make compromises since their optimal solutions cannot be reached at the same time the most common compromise approach is to determine the weights of each objective function representing degrees that stakeholders compromise their optimal values then the multi objective programming problem can be solved by transforming multi objective functions of multi stakeholders in a cooperative relationship to a single objective compromise function the behind potential goal or vision during the above calculating process the objective functions can be replaced by corresponding fuzzy satisfaction membership functions generally established on the basis of available maximum objective value and minimum objective value this range is obviously wider than the leeway that is given in the multi level programming method the obtained satisfaction degree can be certainly regarded as satisfactory or dissatisfactory in the strict sense the multi objective programming problem is a broader problem involving multi stakeholders but not defining their relationships cooperative or non cooperative the multi level programming problem should be one kind of multi objective programming problems without cooperation among multi stakeholders however the multi objective programming problem is generally considered as a problem in a cooperative relationship the above we discussed is only in this case 5 4 cooperation or noncooperation in the solving method with kkt or penalty conditions the lower level dm makes decisions absolutely under rigid restraints or optimal solutions of the upper level dm there is completely no leeway and no cooperation between each level dm that is one level dm absolutely dominants the entire programming problems compared with these methods multi level dms in the fuzzy approach for solving multi level programming problems is not exactly in a noncooperation relationship as the little compromise is recognized gives a balance space to each level dm osman et al 2018 that means it is difficult for traditional methods using auxiliary functions to solve multi level nonlinear problems unless each level dm cooperates makes small concessions and intends to facilitate a pareto solution however each level decision maker will firstly seek their optimal solutions independently not violating the non cooperated nature the multi or bi programming problems without leeway or little compromise are static stackelberg game in reality the main difficulty of the fuzzy approach is that there may be many times of interactions between different level dms the solutions may be rejected again and again that makes the solving process a lengthy one baky 2010 we can distinctly see the interaction between strategies of upper level decision maker and lower level decision maker to achieve a compromise solution 5 5 limitation although the established model can well reflect the actual situation in shallow groundwater area the modelling and obtained results are based on many assumptions mentioned in section 2 3 and some specific background conditions such as specified climate conditions and social conditions the stackelberg equilibrium solutions may be altered as environmental conditions changes except for this the exploitation of groundwater is theoretically completely controlled by upper level and middle level decision makers and the decline in groundwater level caused by exploiting groundwater for irrigation is amplified into the whole water supply response unit in reality the groundwater is extracted by individual farmers privately the government opposes private this behavior through taking restrictive measure but cannot totally prevent it privately extracting groundwater will produce groundwater funnel in a short time but largely affect isolated area therefore except for the challenge of defining the amount of groundwater allowed to use local government manager should also consider how to intensively extract groundwater to avoid groundwater funnels in localized area 6 conclusions this study provides a multi level water resource management model to achieve satisfactory agricultural water resource allocation in hierarchical system uncertainties a multi level programming method based on the fuzzy approach is integrated with process based crops growth model this model has the following contributions 1 the model can well reflect the real hierarchical problems that the preference solution is delivered form upper level dms to lower level dms and the problem is solved by lower level dms with the restrictions of upper level dms requirements 2 the leeway given by each level dm expands the decision making space and lets stackelberg equilibrium solution more satisfactory in multi level dms 3 the model is applicable to shallow groundwater area as involving the detailed water and salt movement model 4 the model can deal with uncertainties existing in systems through transforming uncertainties to deterministic values the generated scenarios make the model more practical and feasible for real world problems the established model is applied in hetao irrigation district in china from the obtained results we can draw the following conclusions 1 in water allocation patterns the water diversion is allocated more similarly under uncertain available water resource different α c u t s the groundwater is allocated more flexibly with larger fluctuations as α changes 2 the decline in water availability will aggravate the water allocation unfairness from the perspective of farmers modifying and optimizing water diversion and groundwater in each growth period can effectively help to meet the water demand for food crops growth to improve food production 3 combined use of water diversion and groundwater is expected to be a better strategy for achieving a win win situation between national government managers ensuring food production and local farmers pursuing high economic benefits this study aims to provide an effective model for dealing with water allocation problems in a hierarchical water resource management system the obtained results and proposed suggestions

3090,the hierarchical agricultural water resource management problem in shallow groundwater area is expected to be solved through establishing a practical and feasible mathematical model this study proposes a multi level programming model with considerations of process based crops growth model and uncertainties the model is solved by a fuzzy approach that ensures the decision making proceeds from top to bottom sequentially and the leader supervises the solution search direction the leeway given by each level decision maker expands the decision making space and lets stackelberg equilibrium solution more satisfactory the model is applied in hetao irrigation district in china after optimization the stackelberg equilibrium water allocation pattern and satisfaction degrees of each level decision makers can be identified summarized conclusions are as follows 1 under uncertainties of available water the water diversion is allocated in a similar pattern while the groundwater allocation has larger variabilities 2 when available water decreases local farmers can improve crop production through modifying or optimizing irrigation water amount in each growth period 3 the combined use of water diversion and groundwater is expected to become an effective approach for achieving a win win situation between government managers and local farmers the proposed model performs well in generating stackelberg equilibrium solutions satisfied by multi level decision makers it can be extended to provide decision makers a more complete decision support system and also has potential to be applied in other similar areas keywords shallow groundwater area optimization uncertainty stackelberg game multi level programming problem data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction human food demand is expected to continuously increase in the coming decades as a result of population growth progressive urbanization and socioeconomic development davis et al 2016 changing climate leads to great volatility and uncertainties in available water resource resulting in a big challenge of agricultural water resource allocation thiery et al 2021 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b recent studies have provided various strategies about water allocation among multi users towards multi objectives such as agricultural sustainable development and enhancing crops yields zhang 2021b zhang et al 2021a yue et al 2021 however most pareto solutions necessitate strong cooperation between multi benefits subjects by working out large compromises to achieve common goals yue et al 2021 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b limited researches focused on agricultural water resource system in hierarchical organizations where there is weak cooperation or noncooperation especially in shallow groundwater areas featured with shallow ground water level and high soil salt content that largely affect crops growth agricultural water resources system is a hierarchical system with multi level managers and water demanders seeking their own optimal objectives zhang f et al 2020 hierarchical problem is an extension of stackelberg game to solve decentralized planning problems where decisions are made sequentially from leaders to followers with full information but noncooperation baky i 2014 stackelberg 1952 the decision of each lower level decision maker dm is affected by actions and restrictions of upper level dms stackelberg 1952 wu et al 2022 schwarting et al 2019 where there is a complicated gaming process among multi level dms after many rounds of games a stackelberg equilibrium solution will be realized among multi level dms multi objective optimization or single bi level programming methods that are widely applied in agricultural water resource management obviously cannot represent the actual hierarchical structure zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b although some researches started to propose water allocation strategies in shallow groundwater area from the perspective of hierarchical management jiang et al 2021 the interactions and gaming process within multi level dms are still ignored and not considered additionally the complex physical processes such as crop growth process and frequent water and salt exchanges between soil and groundwater increase the difficulties in solving optimization problems zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b flourishing developments of precision agriculture and water conservancy informatization also call for more practical and inclusive decision making approaches to address high nonlinearities in studying hierarchical water resource management system mazzega et al 2014 to address hierarchical problems the multi level programming method is required for mathematical modelling and finding feasible solutions the multi level programming problem mlpp is derived from bi level programming problem blpp but more common and practical in the real world baky 2014 blpp is usually solved by vertex enumeration algorithms bialas and karwan 1982 and transformation approaches based on kkt conditions lagrangian terms and penalty functions li et al 2022a b li et al 2021 elsisy sayed 2019 zhang et al 2019 however these traditional methods will dramatically increase computational and storage requirements in solving mlpp and the complex non linearity after transformation may lead non deterministic polynomial complete problem np ben ayed blair 1990 jeroslow 1985 bard et al 2000 even make original problems unmanageable shih et al 1996 firstly proposed a fuzzy approach for solving mlpp based on fuzzy theory which is able to handle multi level linear and nonlinear problems this method has been applied in many research areas and gradually applied in more complex models and larger research scales zhang et al 2016 such as supply chain management traffic transportation network design and energy management zhang et al 2016 ahmadi et al 2021 this method was applied in arid agricultural regions with much deep groundwater level in the research of zhang et al 2020b however very few researches adopted this method to study water allocation problems in shallow groundwater area except for difficulties in the model establishment and solving method for hierarchical water resource management system uncertain factors existing agricultural systems such as uncertain available water resource price and climate changes doubtlessly increase complexities in water allocation and decision making processes zhou et al 2016 these uncertain factors are generally quantified by interval numbers fuzzy numbers and stochastic distributions based on data availabilities zhou et al 2016 yu et al 2020 rani et al 2021 uncertainty factors will lead uncertain water allocation solution resulting in a solution set instead of a deterministic solution zhao 1995 chen chen 2015 in blpp some researchers obtained multi solutions under different scenarios generated by different confidence levels of uncertainty factors jin et al 2018 osman et al 2004 sakawa et al 2000 however limited researches have revealed the impacts of uncertainties on mlpp and nash equilibrium solution in stackelberg game nor given practical suggestions facing uncertainties baky 2010 the main contribution of this study is establishing a comprehensive decision making model to solve agriculture hierarchical water management problems in shallow groundwater area with the consideration of uncertainties and process based crop growth model the proposed model is applied in hetao irrigation district in china firstly the stackelberg equilibrium water allocation pattern of groundwater and water diversion under uncertainties are determined then we examine impacts of maximum middle and minimum available water on stackelberg equilibrium solutions to try to give suggestions for tackling extreme situations and the supplementary understanding of solving method in this study is furtherly discussed the analysis in this study aims to provide theoretical foundation for hierarchical decision making thereby helping to improve decision making efficiency in shallow groundwater area 2 study area 2 1 study area the research area in this study is hetao irrigation district hid a typical shallow groundwater area located in the west of inner mongolia autonomous region 40 13 42 28 n 105 12 109 53 e in china fig 1 hid is in an arid and semi arid region under temperate continental semiarid and monsoon climate sun 2014 with average precipitation less than 250 mm per year and evaporation reaching 2011 2300 mm per year xue et al 2018 hid has flat terrain with the mean slope at 0 05 there are five sub irrigation districts in hid respectively dengkou hanghou linhe wuyuan wulateqianqi district from west to east based on local canal system distribution land use distribution irrigation condition soil characteristics and administrative division hid can be divided into 12 water supply response units luo et al 2021 in order as yigan wulahe yangjiahe huangji yongji fengji zaohuo shahe yihe tongji changji and tabu from west to east as an important commodity grain base of china over 80 planted area in hid is used for growing wheat maize and sunflower and annually around 2 324 4 036 billion m3 water is diverted from the yellow river from april to september used for hid s agricultural development at the same time plenty of water is sept down into groundwater directly raising up ground water level which fluctuates between 1 5 m and 3 m xu et al 2010 sun s et al 2016 the shallow ground water level results in frequent vertical water exchange between groundwater and surface soil water much salt rises to surface soil carried with irrigation water and groundwater evaporation owing to intense evaporation and poor drainage substantial salt remains in shallow soil and increases surface soil salt content 2 2 problem statement due to high dependency on water diversion from the yellow river the water management system in hid is a typical hierarchal management system stackelberg game is formed among three level dms in the first level the national government manager dm allows local people draw water from the yellow river for agricultural irrigation and ensuring national food security the national government manager has the largest decision making power to determine how much water hid can divert from the yellow river and how much groundwater hid can extract since they have to balance water demand of multi water users along the yellow river and avoid environment problems caused by ground water level decline in the second level the local government manager dm is response of allocating water to each water supply response unit under the given total water availability by the first level dm they care about the allocation fairness to reduce social contradictions and conflicts but should firstly satisfy the first level dm s goal in the third level the local farmers dm hope to earn high incomes by planting crops they can determine how much water to irrigate each crop in different growth periods to reduce costs during diversion gap period they prefer extracting groundwater and tend to give more water to crops with high economic efficiency these three level dms have their own objectives and decision variables the decision making of lower level dms depends on the restricts of upper level dms and in turn produce effects on upper level dms decisions it is necessary to establish an optimization model to reflect their leader follower relationship and contain the interactive process as mentioned in the section 2 1 complex water and salt movements between surface soil and groundwater increase complexities of decision making large water diversion raises groundwater level letting more capillary water from groundwater rise into crop root layers xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 at the same time the salt carried with water improves soil salinization risks and too high soil salt increases crops wilting point and then decrease crop production these two contradictory processes affect local farmers determine crops proper irrigation amount in hid the primary uncertain factor that influences multi level decision making is the available water caused by stochastic climate variability and unpredictable human activities including available water diversion and available groundwater these values relate to decision variables of dms and furtherly change obtained goals and stackelberg equilibrium states based on the above the establishment of the multi level programming model in shallow groundwater area should consider the actual demands of each level dm the rules in the hierarchical system the complex field water salt movement and uncertainties in available water 2 3 solutions and framework to solve above problems firstly this study establishes a hierarchal water resources allocation decision system based on the theory of shih et al 1996 with illustrating goals and decision variables of each level dm the goals from top to bottom are to maximize food production minimize gini coefficient and to maximize economic benefits the decision variables of national government management are total water diversion and total groundwater usage while the decision variables of local government manager are water diversion and groundwater allocation in each wsru the decision variables of local farmers are water diversion and groundwater usage of each crop in each growth period in crops growing model the detailed water salt balance model is built to show dynamic soil water and salt content changes water salt stress coefficients are used to reflect water salt stress degrees to crops which have influences on crops actual evapotranspiration based on this the actual crop yield can be calculated through jensen crop production functions according to the fuzzy theory the available water diversion and groundwater are expressed as triangle and trapezoid fuzzy numbers by setting different α c u t s the uncertain available water can be transformed to deterministic values then the obtained available water and process based crop growth model are integrated to multi level programming model which is solved by a fuzzy multi level programming method the fuzzy satisfaction membership functions can be established with leeway of goals and variables given by each level dm after adjusting membership functions to proper values the stackelberg equilibrium solutions can be obtained there are some assumptions in modeling 1 crop and soil conditions are assumed to be consistent in each water supply response unit 2 the lateral water and salt exchange among different units is ignored 3 the meteorological drought year 2011 is regarded as context for crops growth the established system framework is shown in fig 2 3 methodology 3 1 model development in order to clearly present all parameters used in the model the notations are presented in table c 1 of appendix c 3 1 1 objective functions 3 1 1 1 maximizing grain production ensuring food security is the objective of national government manager the first level dm who expects high food production according to the definition of food security wheat and maize are two grain crops while sunflower is cash crop therefore the total food production in hid contains the total yield of wheat and the total yield of maize the yield of each crop can be calculated by jensen crop production functions zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b requiring the actual evapotranspiration of crops in each crop growth period the objective function and jenson crop production function can be expressed as follow 1 maxe f 1 i 1 12 j 1 2 a ij e y aij e y aij y mij t 1 t j ee t aijt e t cijt e ijt 3 1 1 2 minimizing gini coefficient the water allocation fairness is the objective of local government manager the second level dm under limited water resources it is possible to allocate more water to areas with good soil and climate conditions to reach high crop production caused water allocation unfairness may arise conflicts between farmers and local government manager or among different water users which will cause instability in society that is not expected and an action to be avoided by local government manager as much as possible gini coefficient proposed by gini corrado 1912 is a measure of inequality of distribution defined as a ratio between 0 and 1 which is the area between lorenz curve and the perfect distribution line fig 3 gini coefficient can be used to measure the inequality of water resource allocation among different water supply response units the ratio of total water allocation the sum of water diversion and groundwater allocated in each unit to the water demand is selected as the indicator reflecting the degree of water allocation in each unit the calculation of gini coefficient in this study can be presented as follows 2 minegini k 1 12 p k e r wqk 2 k 1 12 p k 1 e a r wqk 1 e r wqk j 1 3 t 1 t j a kj e w kjt e q kjt j 1 3 t 1 t j a kj e t ckjt k 1 12 j 1 3 t 1 t j a kj e w kjt e q kjt j 1 3 t 1

degree of water allocation fairness is 0 3 1 1 3 maximizing economic benefits maximizing economic benefits is the goal of local farmers the third level dm the economic benefit depends on costs the actual crop production and the price of crops the costs required include water fees of water diversion and energy fees for extracting and purifying groundwater due to high salt content in groundwater the net economic benefits of farmers can be expressed as follows 3 maxe f 3 i 1 12 j 1 3 p r cropj a ij e y aij e c w e c e c ecw p r water i 1 12 j 1 3 t 1 t j a ij e w ijt ecec p r groundwater i 1

crop production equation 1 which is influenced by environmental conditions such as climate change and soil conditions according to the water and salt exchanges between groundwater and soil shown in fig 4 the hydrological process involves water diversion amount groundwater allocation precipitation groundwater evaporation deep percolation and actual crop water consumption the actual crop evapotranspiration equation 8 is calculated using the method demonstrated by fao 56 allen et al 1998 with considerations of water stress coefficient equation 6 and salt stress coefficient equation 7 in this method soil water content and salt content can be obtained from the water salt balance model equation 9 14 if soil water content is higher than field water holding capacity the surplus water will seep into the groundwater soil salt content has effects on withering point equation 6 salt stress coefficient equation 7 and the water amount that crops can absorb from the root zone which furtherly influence water stress coefficient equation 6 4 e p corijt p j e e c eijt e c ethj p j b j 100 ee c eijt e c ethj p j e e c eijt e c ethj 5 e w wpsijt w wpi e e c eijt e c ethj w wpi b j ee

model with uncertainties is a hierarchical management problem that can be solved by fuzzy multi level programming method proposed by shih et al 1996 that is shown in appendix a the transformation method of fuzzy numbers is shown in appendix b the key to solve this model is how to build and modify fuzzy satisfactory membership functions of each objective value and decision variable and how to transform uncertainties to deterministic values the solving process is as following steps step 1 give fuzzy membership degree α from 0 1 to 1 0 of uncertainties fuzzy available water resource step 2 based on given α transform fuzzy available water resource to deterministic available water diversion and groundwater step 3 build fuzzy satisfaction membership functions of objective values and decision variables from first level dm to third level dm step 4 solve the model by maximizing minimum satisfaction degrees through genetic algorithm on matlab r2019a if optimal solution pattern can be obtained continue to step 5 if there is no optimal solution turn to step 3 and rebuild fuzzy satisfaction membership functions step 5 change fuzzy membership degree α of uncertainties and turn to step 1 until α 1 0 step 6 analyze all generated solutions 3 3 data collection and software most data used in this study was collected from yearbooks of bayannur such as yearly available water diversion and groundwater and crops planting area in each wsru some data related to crops growth was collected from research papers that researchers conducted field experiments in hid jiang et al 2019 xue et al 2017 yue 2004 hou et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a xue et al 2018 parameters used in equations were all validated appropriate for hid li et al 2020 gao et al 2018 pen et al 1992 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b meteorological data in sub irrigation districts was collected from meteorological stations and downloaded from the website of china meteorological data service center 4 results 4 1 first level decision maker the total water diversion from the yellow river and groundwater resources decision variable of first level dm is shown in fig 5 it shows that water diversion from the yellow river is the main water resource for agricultural development under different α c u t s the water diversion accounts for around 88 02 93 15 of total agricultural water usage while groundwater accounting for 6 85 11 98 the ratio of water supplement reaches to 87 31 97 35 in hid the ratio of total water allocation to total water demand 4 2 second level decision maker figs 6 7 show water allocation results in each wsru after optimization second level dm s decision variables it shows that the water diversion should be mainly allocated to yigan yangjiahe huangji yongji fengji and yihe wsrus whose water diversion allocation is near or over 10 of total water diversion the sum water diversion allocation of these units exceeds 60 of total available water diversion and this value is relatively stable under different α c u t s the groundwater resource is also mainly allocated to yigan yangjiahe huangji yongji fengji and yihe wsrus with highest allocation in yongji zaohuo and yihe units however the groundwater allocation pattern presents significant differences among different α c u t s for example the maximum groundwater allocation in yongji and yihe units is around 517 19 and 440 of the minimum value the groundwater allocation in wulahe shahe changji and tabu units is relatively low and also changes with samll fluctuations for the perspective of water satisfaction degree the ratio of water allocation to water demand supplementary fig 1 the degree of yongji unit reaches to the maximum value with 94 44 followed by tabu 94 19 fengji 93 77 and tongji 93 53 units 4 3 third level decision maker the third level dm can determine the irrigation amount and irrigation time of each crop in each growth period fig 8 11 show that the water allocation of crops presents large differences in areas with large water demand under uncertain available water different α c u t s however obtained maize yields in each wsru show a relatively stable trend under different α c u t s as well as wheat yield except for zaohuo wsru supplementary fig 2 4 compared with food crops wheat and maize the sunflower yield largely changes as α c u t s with the difference of 1 97 44 34 this result indicates that maize and wheat have priorities being allocated more water under uncertain water availability and wheat in zaohuo unit has lower water supply priority fig 9 fig 10 for the detailed water and salt movement process this study takes yangjiahe wsru as an example to analyze crop water consumption soil water content soil salt content ground water level and groundwater evaporation at field scale under different α c u t s yangjiahe wsru is allocated relatively middle water allocation amount compared with other wsrus however small changes in wheat and maize actual evapotranspiration actual water consumption under different α c u t s can be observed fig 11 that means modifying and optimizing water diversion and groundwater in each growth stage can effectively help to meet the water demand for food crops growth meanwhile markedly different water allocation of cash crop sunflower under different α c u t s results in big changes in actual water consumption soil water content ground water level and groundwater evaporation 4 4 stackelberg equilibrium solutions stackelberg equilibrium solutions under different α c u t s are shown in fig 12 fig 13 it indicates that objective values do not all rise with increased water availability although the sum of available water diversion and groundwater is increased with α in supplementary table 1 and table 2 it can be observed that the water availability declines during may when is the water sensitivity period and critical water demand period of food crops wheat and maize the available water decline in water sensitivity period can still cause crop yield reduction though the total water availability increases in other periods april june august and september compared with economic benefits the objective of third level dm and water allocation fairness the objective of second level dm the high food production first level dm s objective and satisfaction degree of groundwater usage first level dm s decision variable are harder to realize fig 12 the satisfaction degree of groundwater usage fluctuates between 0 79 0 87 and that of total food production is all lower than 0 8 this result means realizing high food production is in a weaker position than economic benefits and water allocation equality in the stackelberg game and first level dm s objective and decision variables should be paid much attention to try to improve them as far as possible even so this result is consistent with the actual situation that local government manager has to set strict minimum area for planting food crops to ensure food security and has to limit groundwater exploitation by introducing punishment policies 5 discussion 5 1 max middle min scenarios in order to reveal effects of large decline in water availability on multi level decision making process this study divides three available water scenarios based on boundary points of triangular trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to obtain stackelberg game solutions under extreme conditions in triangular trapezoidal fuzzy numbers the left point under α 0 is the lowest water availability scenario with lowest possibility the value under α 1 is the middle water availability scenario with largest possibility the right point under α 0 is the highest water availability scenario with lowest possibility under these three scenarios the optimization is conducted and its results are shown from figs 14 19 5 1 1 stackelberg equilibrium solutions and first level decision maker in stackelberg equilibrium solutions figs 14 15 satisfaction degrees of water allocation fairness the objective of second level dm reach maximum values while that of food production and groundwater usage are at lower values and satisfaction degrees of food production all reach minimum values at 0 65 under the minimum water availability scenario and at 0 79 under the maximum water availability scenario this indicates that high food production and low groundwater usage are harder to realize whereas water allocation fairness can be easily achieved the objectives of high food production and low groundwater usage are in vulnerable positions and should be taken seriously in the case with limited available water from the perspective of first level dm fig 16 to some extent obtaining high food production is contradictory with reducing groundwater usage utilizing more groundwater for irrigation can improve food production but decrease satisfaction degree of groundwater usage thus under quite low available water scenario it is a possible thing that the satisfaction degree of groundwater usage becomes lower than that of food security what should be noticed is that satisfaction degrees of food production and economic benefits under maximum water availability scenario are all higher than that under middle water availability scenario and satisfaction degrees of water allocation fairness and groundwater usage are both lower than that under middle water availability scenario it is because higher crop production and higher benefits are obtained through extracting more groundwater under high water availability scenario realizing stackelberg equilibrium in another word persistently increasing water diversion does not help to increase food production and economic benefits but the combined use of water diversion and groundwater may be a better strategy for achieving high food production and high economic benefits the behind reason may relate to the special condition of hid where the perennial diversion of water from the yellow river has raised the groundwater level and increased soil salt content in shallow soil layers if the water diversion of the yellow river is continuously increased the groundwater level may be furtherly increased which is also not conducive to reduce soil salt content thus regularly extracting groundwater may be necessary for achieving a win win situation between government managers and local farmers using groundwater for irrigation has three advantages 1 the groundwater use efficiency is higher than water diversion due to less transport loss and evaporation 2 moderately extracting groundwater can help to decline groundwater level pretending further accumulation of soil salt on the soil surface and reducing soil salinization risks however the critical problem for loosely extracting groundwater is how to define the total amount of groundwater that can be extracted additionally the gini coefficient under low water availability scenario is significantly increased by 256 83 than that under middle water availability scenario and its satisfaction degree is declined by 10 79 that means the decline in water availability will aggravating the water allocation unfairness more water resource will be allocated towards areas with higher water use efficiency 5 1 2 second level decision maker in fig 17 similar water diversion patterns can be observed under three water availability scenarios however groundwater resource is differently allocated to wsrus which is mainly allocated to yigan yangjiahe huangji yongji fengji units the groundwater allocation rate the ratio of the groundwater allocation in one unit to the total water availability shows an increasing trend as available water declines under low water availability scenario the groundwater allocation rate in yongji unit rises to 21 92 and the rate in yigan unit increases to 16 39 the water supply ratios are all over 89 under middle and high water availability scenarios in each wsru fig 18 ratios of total water allocation to water demand as water availability decreasing significant differences of water supply ratios are presented among 12 wsrus the maximum ratio is observed in yongji wsru at 61 98 and the minimum ratio is 42 09 in shahe unit 5 1 3 third level decision maker from the perspective of crops wheat maize and sunflower are allocated approximately similar water when available water is equal to or more than middle water availability fig 19 if available water declines water supply ratios of wheat maize and sunflower are decreased by 3 27 56 04 15 14 41 02 and 57 70 71 29 respectively sunflower has the largest decrease 5 2 solving method for stackelberg game in this study the stackelberg game contains three individual levels with objectives of maximizing food production maximizing economic benefits minimizing gini coefficient as well as minimizing the total groundwater usage the method for solving stackelberg equilibrium solution is maximizing the minimum satisfaction degree of involved objectives and decision variables as results shown the satisfaction degrees sd of food production under ten α c u t s are all the minimum values at 0 7833 0 7892 compared with that of gini coefficient and economic benefits all over 0 90 in this case the food production is continually maximized until the interaction time reaches preset maximum time as long as sds of economic benefits and gini coefficient are higher than that of food production sds of economic benefits and gini coefficient are left untouched and not optimized only changes with food production the sds may not evolve towards maximum economic benefits and minimum gini coefficient but the minimum sd is improved maximizing the minimum satisfaction degree is to minimize compromises as far as possible other than traditional approaches this special solving method may be the second reason for irregular changes of sds as α c u t s changes summarily from a holistic perspective the obtained stackelberg solution is an optimal solution from the perspective of individual stakeholder the obtained solution is a satisfactory solution furthermore the sd of groundwater usage 0 6673 approaches to the sd of food production 0 6548 as available water declines to the minimum availability presumably the sd of groundwater usage may become the lowest value if available water continues to declines this means the sd of first level dms decision variable turns to a weaker position before that sds of food production and groundwater usage will be interlaced maximized until one position steadily becomes the lowest one 5 3 differences between multi level and multi objective programming problems in this study fuzzy satisfaction membership functions for solving multi level programming problems can also be used to deal with multi objective programming problems however fuzzy satisfaction membership functions have different meanings in these two games in multi level programming problems there is no cooperation among multi level dms multi dms are in leader and follower relationships leaders make decisions firstly followers have to make their decisions within the decision space given by leaders if multi level programming problems are solved through transformation approaches based on kkt or penalty conditions followers optimality conditions will become strict constraints of leaders problems that is he or she dominates the solution search process for solving multi level programming problem the introduced fuzzy satisfaction membership functions are leeway given by each level dm from the original intention of the method proposed by shih et al 1996 the leeway for establishing fuzzy satisfaction membership functions should be completely acceptable by each level dm smaller leeway may lead lower satisfaction degree but not mean the solution is unsatisfactory since unsatisfied solution will be rejected and cannot be passed to other level dms the leeway actually expands the decision making space for achieving a more satisfactory solution in the multi level structure but should not be considered as a degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction in multi objective programming problems multi stakeholders virtual or physical are in a cooperative relationship where their actions and decisions are to realize a potential goal or a vison together multi objective programming method is widely used in various researches however its internal logic is usually ignored for example in the research of zhang et al 2021a b three stakeholders virtual were set to maximize food production maximize water use efficiency and minimize energy consumption and their behind potential goal or vision is to achieve agricultural sustainable development a vague goal or vision these three stakeholders have to make compromises since their optimal solutions cannot be reached at the same time the most common compromise approach is to determine the weights of each objective function representing degrees that stakeholders compromise their optimal values then the multi objective programming problem can be solved by transforming multi objective functions of multi stakeholders in a cooperative relationship to a single objective compromise function the behind potential goal or vision during the above calculating process the objective functions can be replaced by corresponding fuzzy satisfaction membership functions generally established on the basis of available maximum objective value and minimum objective value this range is obviously wider than the leeway that is given in the multi level programming method the obtained satisfaction degree can be certainly regarded as satisfactory or dissatisfactory in the strict sense the multi objective programming problem is a broader problem involving multi stakeholders but not defining their relationships cooperative or non cooperative the multi level programming problem should be one kind of multi objective programming problems without cooperation among multi stakeholders however the multi objective programming problem is generally considered as a problem in a cooperative relationship the above we discussed is only in this case 5 4 cooperation or noncooperation in the solving method with kkt or penalty conditions the lower level dm makes decisions absolutely under rigid restraints or optimal solutions of the upper level dm there is completely no leeway and no cooperation between each level dm that is one level dm absolutely dominants the entire programming problems compared with these methods multi level dms in the fuzzy approach for solving multi level programming problems is not exactly in a noncooperation relationship as the little compromise is recognized gives a balance space to each level dm osman et al 2018 that means it is difficult for traditional methods using auxiliary functions to solve multi level nonlinear problems unless each level dm cooperates makes small concessions and intends to facilitate a pareto solution however each level decision maker will firstly seek their optimal solutions independently not violating the non cooperated nature the multi or bi programming problems without leeway or little compromise are static stackelberg game in reality the main difficulty of the fuzzy approach is that there may be many times of interactions between different level dms the solutions may be rejected again and again that makes the solving process a lengthy one baky 2010 we can distinctly see the interaction between strategies of upper level decision maker and lower level decision maker to achieve a compromise solution 5 5 limitation although the established model can well reflect the actual situation in shallow groundwater area the modelling and obtained results are based on many assumptions mentioned in section 2 3 and some specific background conditions such as specified climate conditions and social conditions the stackelberg equilibrium solutions may be altered as environmental conditions changes except for this the exploitation of groundwater is theoretically completely controlled by upper level and middle level decision makers and the decline in groundwater level caused by exploiting groundwater for irrigation is amplified into the whole water supply response unit in reality the groundwater is extracted by individual farmers privately the government opposes private this behavior through taking restrictive measure but cannot totally prevent it privately extracting groundwater will produce groundwater funnel in a short time but largely affect isolated area therefore except for the challenge of defining the amount of groundwater allowed to use local government manager should also consider how to intensively extract groundwater to avoid groundwater funnels in localized area 6 conclusions this study provides a multi level water resource management model to achieve satisfactory agricultural water resource allocation in hierarchical system uncertainties a multi level programming method based on the fuzzy approach is integrated with process based crops growth model this model has the following contributions 1 the model can well reflect the real hierarchical problems that the preference solution is delivered form upper level dms to lower level dms and the problem is solved by lower level dms with the restrictions of upper level dms requirements 2 the leeway given by each level dm expands the decision making space and lets stackelberg equilibrium solution more satisfactory in multi level dms 3 the model is applicable to shallow groundwater area as involving the detailed water and salt movement model 4 the model can deal with uncertainties existing in systems through transforming uncertainties to deterministic values the generated scenarios make the model more practical and feasible for real world problems the established model is applied in hetao irrigation district in china from the obtained results we can draw the following conclusions 1 in water allocation patterns the water diversion is allocated more similarly under uncertain available water resource different α c u t s the groundwater is allocated more flexibly with larger fluctuations as α changes 2 the decline in water availability will aggravate the water allocation unfairness from the perspective of farmers modifying and optimizing water diversion and groundwater in each growth period can effectively help to meet the water demand for food crops growth to improve food production 3 combined use of water diversion and groundwater is expected to be a better strategy for achieving a win win situation between national government managers ensuring food production and local farmers pursuing high economic benefits this study aims to provide an effective model for dealing with water allocation problems in a hierarchical water resource management system the obtained results and proposed suggestions

3091,soil hydraulic properties quantify soil pore structure and are essential input parameters for simulating soil hydrological processes in the vadose zone although methods have been proposed to estimate soil hydraulic properties efficient and applicable ones are still scarce in this study we derived an approximate solution for a one dimensional upward infiltration process with initially uniform soil water content distribution founded on our solution a nonlinearly constrained optimization method was developed to simultaneously estimate the parameters k s and n h d of the brooks corey model by measuring the upward infiltration process in a 5 cm high soil column numerical experiments simulated with hydrus 1d were performed on six theoretical soils to evaluate the accuracy of the new method the results indicate that the approximate solution can accurately simulate the upward infiltration process at the low initial soil water content range with a relative error re of 2 85 to 5 47 for soil water content distribution in space and time for the cumulative infiltration curve the re ranges from 0 2 to 1 01 the estimated parameters k s and n h d of the brooks corey model are close to the actual parameter values with a re of 0 59 to 4 68 for n 0 00 to 7 91 for h d and 0 50 to 8 83 for k s respectively it is concluded that the new method provides a simple and valuable tool for the accurate estimation of soil hydraulic properties keywords soil hydraulic properties analytical solution infiltration brooks corey model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one dimensional water movement upward into an unsaturated soil or porous medium driven by capillary force is called upward infiltration philip 1966 upward infiltration is an essential component of the hydrologic cycle where groundwater rises to recharge the unsaturated root zone and further enters into the atmosphere by evaporation the study on the upward infiltration is important for the management of secondary soil salinization li et al 2014 and groundwater resources wang et al 2020 the richards equation based on the buckingham darcy law is the fundamental model used to describe soil water movement however it is challenging to solve the richards equation analytically due to its second order nonlinearity as an alternative it is always one of the most interesting topics for soil scientists to pursue approximate analytical solutions with appropriate assumptions parlange et al 1997 basha 2011 sadeghi et al 2017 without the gravity term horizontal absorption is simple in mathematical expression and thus was normally used as a starting point for solving the complex vertical problems shao and horton 1998 and wang 2002 2004 solved the one dimensional horizontal absorption problem under assumed volumetric soil water content swc profiles and developed analytical methods for estimating the parameters of the van genuchten model and the brooks corey model where the saturated hydraulic conductivity was additionally measured by a constant head method however an oversimplified relative water flux was explicitly assumed by wang 2002 2004 which does not agree with later observations ma et al 2017 actually the soil water flux saturation relation is almost independent of the time at long time scales white 1979 white et al 1979 and exhibits a simple linear relationship with the relative soil saturation philip 1973 based on the relationship proposed by philip 1973 ma et al 2009 2015 derived approximate analytical solutions for one dimensional horizontal absorption and vertical infiltration problems furthermore other studies solved the richards equation with different approaches nasseri et al 2008 2012 adopted the traveling wave method to obtain analytical solutions of the richards equation for linear or nonlinear hydraulic conductivity and linear or nonlinear diffusivity for vertical infiltration su et al 2017a 2017b 2018 converted the problem of solving one dimensional soil water movement to that of finding an extremum value of a function with the least action theory and obtained an analytical expression relating swc profile to wetting front advance with variational principle normally the upward infiltration process is handled analogously to the downward infiltration process but having an opposite gravity term philip 1966 first pointed out the possibility of using burgers equation for upward infiltration swartzendruber 2002 derived an exact solution to the burgers equation for the capillary rise problem by assuming a constant soil water diffusivity and a parabolic concave upward hydraulic conductivity the cumulative infiltration volume predicted by the exact solution increases over time but in fact the quantity of water entering into soils during capillary rise will reach equilibrium over time prevedello et al 2009 obtained an analytical solution of the richards equation in soil water potential form by assuming the similarity between the swc profile and the water retention curve however the solution is limited to coarse textured soils in materials science studies on upward infiltration mainly focused on large pore media and researchers obtained the washburn equation similar to the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 by using contact angle theory and darcy s law ishiguro and fujii 2008 ogunmokun and wallach 2021 recently the upward infiltration process has been used to develop simple and efficient approaches for estimating soil hydraulic parameters using short ring soil samples because the relatively slow process facilitates data acquisition in a short infiltration distance for example moret fernández et al 2017 2021 and latorre and moret fernández 2019 developed a series of numerical inversion methods based on the upward infiltration process nevertheless numerical inversion techniques suffer from the complexity and tedious of the estimated parameters this problem can be overcome via analytical methods as they allow the fastest computation however the existing analytical methods fail to be used due to complex solutions e g su et al 2018 or neglecting many other details e g ishiguro and fujii 2008 even so it is worth noting that su et al 2018 derived a complex but relatively accurate swc profile function that can be used for both downward and upward infiltration under constant saturation conditions the derivation method proposed by ma et al 2015 is adaptable for the downward infiltration process while fails to give an appropriate form of the swc profile in upward infiltration it is possible to combine these two methods to obtain an accurate and simple solution for upward infiltration under constant saturation inlet boundary in addition both methods above assumed a time independent shape for the swc profile based on which the mean value theorem for integrals was used to simplify derivation for the infiltration problem under constant saturation conditions this assumption is true since the shape of the swc profile is only determined by soil hydraulic properties at normal time scales philip 1957b however the swc profile shape under constant saturation conditions is different from that under zero or positive pressure head the latter contains the saturated zone philip 1958b the area of the saturated zone increases over time rather than keeping the time independent shape assumed by ma et al 2015 and su et al 2018 as a result although ma et al 2017 has corrected the boundary conditions at the inlet in the approximate analytical solution the total water fluxes maybe still underestimated for infiltration under zero pressure conditions therefore the primary objective of this study was to develop a new inversion method based on an analytical solution to simultaneously determine all hydraulic parameters of the brooks and corey model n h d and k s from an upward infiltration into a 5 cm high soil column we firstly derived an approximate analytical solution for the one dimensional upward infiltration under constant saturation conditions ascs next an approximate solution under constant pressure conditions ascp was obtained based on the ascs to verify both solutions the synthetic upward infiltration data generated by hydrus 1d for six soils with textures ranging from sandy loam soil to clay soil were used to validate the approximate solutions the influence of the initial swc and the distance of upward infiltration on the solutions were also studied finally based on the proposed ascp a nonlinearly constrained optimization method was proposed for determining soil hydraulic properties and tested through six theoretical soils 2 theory the buckingham darcy law is expressed as 1 j w k h dh dz k h where j w is the soil water flux l t 1 k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 h is the soil water pressure head l z is the vertical distance taken positive upward l based on the buckingham darcy law the richards equation for upward infiltration into a one dimensional vertical soil column with initially uniform swc can be described as 2 θ t j w z z k h h z k h θ z 0 θ i θ 0 t θ s θ t θ i where θ is the swc l3 l 3 θ s is the saturated swc l3 l 3 θ i is the initial swc l3 l 3 and t is the infiltration time t brooks and corey 1964 proposed a model to describe the soil water retention curve as 3 s θ θ r θ s θ r h d h n h h d 1 h h d and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve k h in eq 1 can be expressed as 4 k h k s h d h m k s s m n h h d k s h h d where s is the effective saturation h d is the air entry suction l k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 θ r is the residual swc l3 l 3 and n is the pore size distribution index and m 3n 2 with burdine s method burdine 1953 it is noted from eq 3 that the surface soil in eq 2 may be saturated for any pressure head h p greater than or equal to h d philip 1958b the two cases may result in diametrically different swc profiles for the existence of a possible saturated zone indeed the boundary conditions are essential for the final analytical solution and for the inversion method based on it ma et al 2016 case i the so called constant saturation condition h p h d is normally used in many derivations of analytical solutions to soil water problems however case ii constant pressure condition h p h d is more common in experiments therefore we derive and discuss the two cases respectively as follows 2 1 method under constant saturation conditions 2 1 1 swc profile expression for constant saturation conditions su et al 2018 derived an analytical solution under constant saturation conditions to the richards equation based on brooks corey model given the wetting front distance z f the swc distribution for one dimensional upward or downward infiltration into homogenous soil can be predicted as follows 5 s e n α z z f cos ϕ 1 b 0 z z f n 2 n 1 6 b 0 1 s i 2 n 1 n e 2 n 1 α cos ϕ where s i is the initial effective soil water saturation ϕ is the angle between the flow direction and the vertical axis and α 2 h d 1 5 1 z f h d when ϕ 0 eq 5 can be expressed as the swc profile for upward infiltration as 7 s e n α z z f 1 b 1 z z f n 2 n 1 8 b 1 1 s i 2 n 1 n e 2 n 1 α when ϕ 180 the swc profile for downward infiltration can be calculated by eq 5 9 s e n α z z f 1 b 2 z z f n 2 n 1 10 b 2 1 s i 2 n 1 n e 2 n 1 α it is obvious that the only difference in swc profiles between upward and downward infiltration is a negative sign on the exponent of the first term and b i i 1 2 in the eqs 7 and 9 because of the complexity however it is hard to further obtain the relationship between the z f and t either for upward or downward infiltration by integrating the swc profile as eq 7 or eq 9 with the same infiltration problem and soil hydraulic properties model i e bc model ma et al 2015 derived another form of swc profile for downward infiltration as follows 11 s 1 b 3 z z f n 2 n 2 12 b 3 1 s i 2 n 2 n the form of swc profile eq 11 is so simple and accurate that it can be integrated to build the relationships among the cumulative infiltration volume i z f and t for estimating soil hydraulic properties ma et al 2017 it is well known that the form of swc profile during upward infiltration should be different from that under downward infiltration due to the opposite effects of gravity on soil water movement using the method of ma et al 2015 however it failed to derive a different swc profile as eq 11 both eq 5 and eq 11 have been validated for their ability to describe swc distribution of upward or downward infiltration process at a normal time scale in the next step an analogue method is employed to derive a simple and integrable form of swc profile for upward infiltration from eq 7 by comparing eq 9 and eq 11 since at low θ i b 1 b 2 b 3 which are all approximated to 1 when θ i approaches θ r let 13 b 1 b 2 b 3 b comparing eq 9 with eq 11 for the same downward infiltration problem we get 14 e n α z z f 1 b z z f n 2 n 1 1 b z z f n 2 n 2 then 15 e n α z z f 1 b z z f n 2 n 2 2 n 1 substituting eq 15 into eq 7 yields the new expression of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone during upward infiltration under constant saturation conditions fig 1 a 16 s θ θ r θ s θ r 1 b z z f a where 17 a n 2 n 3 2 n 2 2 n 1 18 b 1 s i 1 a 2 1 2 approximate solutions under constant saturation conditions ascs with the same method used by ma et al 2015 the relationship among i z f and t for upward infiltration can be derived appendix a from the appendix a the approximate solutions under constant saturation conditions ascs are as follows 19 i u z f θ s θ r 1 1 a b s i b a 1 z f 20 t θ s θ i δ h k e i δ h θ s θ i ln 1 i δ h θ s θ i where i is the cumulative infiltration volume l k e is the effective hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated zone l t 1 h f is the average matric pressure head at the effective wetting front l and h h f h d l see eqs a10 a13 2 2 method under constant pressure conditions 2 2 1 swc profile expression for constant pressure conditions during the upward infiltration process boundary conditions with water pressure head h p h d allow for developing a saturated zone in the swc profile philip 1958b clearly the swc profile expression eq 16 cannot describe the swc profile with a developing saturated zone according to philip s theory philip 1957b 1957c 1958a the shape of the unsaturated zone in the swc profile is not influenced by the water pressure at the inlet boundary but determined by soil structures the equation of the profile at infinity in the article of philip 1957b similarly the flux concentration relation describing the unsaturated zone has also not altered philip 1973 then it is convenient to make an assumption that eq 16 and eq a8 hold in describing the unsaturated zone in the swc profile during upward infiltration under constant pressure conditions then the expression for the whole swc profile during upward infiltration under constant pressure conditions is fig 1b 21 θ z θ s θ r 1 b z z fw z f z fw a θ r z z fw θ s z z fw where z fw is the length of the saturated zone in swc profile red point in fig 1b 2 2 2 approximate solutions under constant pressure conditions ascp applying the method of ascs to the unsaturated zone in fig 1b soil water flux at the interface between saturated and unsaturated zones can be derived by rewriting eq a8 and eq a9 as 22 j w1 k e 1 δ h z fer 23 z fer u z fr θ s θ i 1 1 a b s i b a 1 1 s i z fr where j w1 is the soil water flux at the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones red line in fig 1b z fer is the equivalent length of the unsaturated zone in the swc profile l z fr is the length of the unsaturated zone in the swc profile l k e and h are identical to those of eq a10 and eq a11 using darcy s law to the saturated zone in fig 1b soil water flux at the inlet can be described as 24 j w0 d i d t k s h d z fw 1 where j w0 is the soil water flux at the inlet for the sake of simplicity of this presentation we take the water pressure head at the inlet h p 0 but the approach applies with the other h p value since there is no loss of soil water flux in the saturated zone the water fluxes on both sides of the saturated zone should be equal that is 25 j w1 j w0 substituting eq 22 and eq 24 into eq 25 we have 26 z fer b z fw 1 a z fw where a 1 ζ h d and b ζ η then combining with eqs 21 and 26 the cumulative infiltration into the soil is 27 i 0 z f θ θ i d z k i t z fw z f θ θ i d z 0 z fw θ θ i d z u z f z fw θ s θ i z fw θ s θ i z fer z fw θ s θ i b z fw 1 a z fw z fw where u θ s θ r 1 1 a b s i b a 1 see eq a2 substituting eq 27 into eq 24 and rearranging the expression we get 28 d t θ s θ i z fw k s h d k s z fw b z

a z fw 1 according to the definition of z fw and z fr we can get the relationship of z f and z fw by eq 23 and eq 26 30 z f z fr z fw c 1 a z fw 1 z fw where c b θ s θ i u then z fw is calculated from z f by inversion of eq 30 31 z fw a z f c 1 a z f c 1 2 4 a z f 2 a substituting eq 31 into eq 27 to eliminate z fw we obtain the relationship i and z f as follow 32 i u z f θ s θ i u 2 a a z f c 1 a

estimation of soil hydraulic properties based on the ascp an optimate method for determining the hydraulic properties of the bc model and k s is developed for a one dimensional vertical upward infiltration into a dry soil column experiment under constant pressure boundary conditions h p 0 cm for convenience the time series data of cumulative infiltration and the cumulative infiltration volume i when z f reaches the upper surface of the soil column are recorded the θ s and θ r can be measured using the method of latorre and moret fernández 2019 the specific step for estimating parameters is described below according to eqs 27 29 and 32 estimating soil hydraulic properties can be transformed into a nonlinearly constrained optimization problem the parameters n h d and k s are optimized by minimizing the objective function q 33 min q i 1 n i t i i t i n h d k s 2 n h d k s s t i u l θ s θ i u 2 a a l c 1 a l c 1 2 4 a l where l is the soil column height l i is the

nonlinear constrained in eq 33 3 materials and methods 3 1 numerical simulations and model validation in this study we first proposed an approximate solution under constant saturation conditions ascs based on ascs an approximate solution under constant pressure conditions ascp was further proposed which is more commonly used in the lab given the soil hydraulic parameters the swc distribution in space and time θ z t and the cumulative infiltration curve i t can be simulated under constant saturation or constant pressure boundary conditions for the ascs method the cumulative infiltration curve was calculated by rearranging the eq 20 in the form of f i 0 for each known time t i in which k e and h were independently calculated by the eqs a10 and a11 solving for t i was reduced to finding the roots of the f i function since that is an implicit functional form for i the newton raphson algorithm was adopted to solve the function iteratively to ensure that this algorithm converges in the iterative process the root at the moment t i 1 was taken as the initial iteration value at the moment t i with known i t the values of θ z t under constant saturation conditions can then be simulated by eq 16 and eq 19 for the ascp method with a similar method above solving the eq 29 was reduced to finding the roots of f z fw for each known time t i and solved using the newton raphson algorithm subsequently the values of i t and θ z t under constant pressure conditions can be calculated by eqs 21 27 and eq 30 the upward infiltration process generated numerically with hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 šimůnek et al 2012 was used to analyze the feasibility of the proposed approximate solutions the numerical experiment was conducted on six theoretical soils with different air entry suction covering a texture from sandy loam to clay table 1 in evaluating the accuracy of the approximate solutions the θ z t and i t were obtained by the numerical and approximate solutions under three initial swc treatments s i 0 45 fig 5 the length of each column was 30 cm in validating the ability of the parameter estimation method the time series data of the cumulative infiltration and i were measured the length of each column was 5 cm in the numerical simulation each column was discretized with a one dimensional grid of 101 cells the minimum time step used in the simulations was 0 864 s the tension at the inlet boundary was h d for the ascs method and 0 cm for the ascp method the atmospheric condition with a maximum tension of 0 cm was set at the upper boundary all the simulations stopped before z f reached the soil upper surface the relative error re was used to quantify the accuracy of the presented method 35 re x i t x i t 2 x i t 2 100 where x i t represents the numerical solution by hydrus 1d at the time t and x i t represents the approximate solution at the time t using the proposed method 3 2 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed by varying n h d and z f to evaluate the applicability scope of the approximation in eq 15 at the low θ i range the discrepancy between the left and right terms in eq 15 was quantified by calculating the relative error re between the two on the z z f domain the discrepancy value was summarized as the contour in the h d n error maps the h d n and z z f ranged from 5 to 50 cm 0 01 to 1 and 0 to 0 99 respectively all parameters were discretized into 100 points the case with n 0 01 and h d 50 cm corresponds to the finest soil while the case with n 1 and h d 5 cm represents the coarsest soil the combination of the parameters for each response surface was calculated on a rectangular grid these error maps were generated for z f 5 cm 15 cm and 30 cm respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulated swc profiles under constant saturation conditions given the soil hydraulic parameters in table 1 the ascs can predict the swc profile during the upward infiltration process with uniform θ i and constant saturation at the inlet boundary fig 2 compares the simulated swc profiles at different times by hydrus 1d and ascs for six theoretical soils the ascs and the numerical solution yielded similar results except for at z f 17 4 cm in loam soil with the re values ranging from 3 81 to 7 99 for different textured soils since the accuracy of the simulated swc profiles by acsc showed the same trend in the six soils as θ i increased the silt soil was chosen as an example to evaluate the influences of θ i on the accuracy of the ascs fig 2c and fig 3 overall the simulated swc profiles by the ascs agreed well with those calculated by the numerical solution at the low θ i range the re values varies between 1 40 and 4 52 for θ i at 0 026 0 12 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 respectively however when θ i increased to 0 32 cm3 cm 3 the shape of simulated swc profiles by ascs showed a significant deviation it can be expected that the relatively large errors produced by the ascs at high θ i are induced by the approximation at low θ i in eq 13 which assumed b1 b2 b3 the parameter b i i 1 2 3 is a function of θi with low θ i values the bi exerts weak effects on the swc profile shape however as θ i increases the b i i 1 2 3 will deviate from 1 to varying extents which leads to an obvious deformation of the simulated swc profile shape in addition the approximation error differs for different soil types for a same z f the coarser the soil texture the larger the approximation error the approximation in eq a9 may also cause simulation errors at high θ i the term k i t neglected at low θ i in eq a9 grows with a power function rate as θ i increases and becomes more important as a consequence z fe was underestimated at high θ i in general despite these differences the model is satisfactory 4 2 theoretical analysis of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone the approximation of the left and right terms in eq 15 is the key to obtaining the expression of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone eq 16 also the ascp was derived based on eq 16 and eq a8 it is therefore vital to discuss the accuracy of this approximation at the low θ i range b 1 and eq 15 can be converted to 36 e n 2 h d 1 5 1 z f h d z z f 1 z z f n 2 n 2 2 n 1 the functional form of eq 36 indicates that n h d and z f can influence the accuracy of the approximation in eq 15 and subsequently the swc distribution in eq 16 on the z z f domain normally parameters n and h d are not independent a higher value of n is related to coarser soil texture or large pore structure while large pores also lead to a lower h d stewart et al 2013 fig 4 shows the response surface of the relative error of the h d n combination for different z f values it can be noticed that the shape of error maps depends on z f on the response surface at lower z f fig 4a both low n with high h d and high n with low h d have low relative errors re 5 which indicates the validity of the approximation in eq 15 at the beginning of upward infiltration for a wide soil texture range however the intersection of the red contour with the n axis in the error maps moved to the left as z f increased fig 4 implying gradually increased approximate error in eq 15 for coarse textured soils the result is consistent with the previous reports where su et al 2018 found that eq 9 is only suitable for soils with h d 10 cm in comparison ma et al 2015 2017 verified that eq 11 applies to sandy soil with h d 7 25 cm which consequently caused the failure of the approximation thus according to the good agreement of the simulated swc profiles between the acsc and numerical solution in fig 2 it is concluded that the approximation in eq 15 and the approximate solutions acsc and acsp derived based on this approximate apply to soils with h d 10 cm in addition there is another hypothesis that needs to be verified during the downward infiltration process under constant saturation conditions the shape of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone is assumed to form rapidly at the beginning change slightly during infiltration and finally reach a stable shape philip 1957c this phenomenon was observed in the experiments by wang et al 2003 where the change of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone shape was ignorable at the middle stage of infiltration given the above situation the eqs 9 and 11 assumed a time independent swc profile in order to simplify the derivation ma et al 2015 su et al 2018 this hypothesis was also retained in eq 16 with a time independent shape parameter a given in eq 17 the results in figs 2 and 3 confirmed this hypothesis because eq 16 ran well in almost all swc profiles before z f reached the value of h d as the wetting front rises the gravitational force can balance capillary force z f h d causing the cessation of water movement in those capillaries thus the shape of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone changes over time parlange and aylor 1972 the numerical experiments based on the richards equation demonstrated that the shape of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone began to deform when z f exceeded a height larger than the value of h d fig 2 a c with z f greater than the value of h d the simulated swc profile shapes by the ascs and the numerical solution deviated more from each other especially for coarse textured soils the re is 5 74 for sandy loam soil h d 14 66 cm and 11 09 for loam soil h d 11 15 cm at z f 17 4 cm but only 1 79 for silt soil h d 20 75 cm at z f 25 cm because of the higher air entry suction value h d 25 cm of clay loam silt clay loam and clay soils the numerical solution and ascs performed equally well fig 2 d f since the time dependent shape information is missing in eq 16 this explains why the errors in the simulated swc profile by the ascs increase gradually with z f exceeding the value of h d the time varying properties of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone can be approximately derived based on the principle of least action the variational principle and taylor series expansion su et al 2017a obtained an analytical expression of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone during one dimensional vertical flow by solving the richards equation without any hypothesis on the profile shape using a similar method we obtained an swc profile for the unsaturated zone eq 37 with a time varying shape for upward infiltration 37 z θ c h d n m 1 2 m n 1 θ θ r θ s θ r m n 1 n 3 c 2 h d 2 n 2 m 1 8 2 m 2 n 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 2 m 2 n 1 n c 1 where c c 1 are constant of integration 38 c h d n m 1 2 m n 1 3 c 2 h d 2 n 2 m 1 8 2 m 2 n 1 c

simulation of the swc profile but lead to a more complex function form obviously based on a complex profile function it is almost impossible to obtain feasible expressions between i z f and t the results above show that eq 16 is valid concise and accurate enough to model the swc profile for the unsaturated zone at the early stage of an upward infiltration 4 3 comparisons of ascp and numerical solution fig 5 presents the numerical solution and ascp simulating the cumulative infiltration curves for different soil types with three initial swc treatments overall the cumulative infiltration curves predicted by both solutions were in good agreement when the θ i was close to θ r the simulated cumulative infiltration curves by two solutions were very close with re values ranging from 0 2 to 0 93 for different soil types as s i increased the re values in the cumulative infiltration curves simulated by the numerical solution and ascp remain lower than 1 the results demonstrate that the ascp can simulate accurately the cumulative infiltration process with low values of θ i fig 6 compares the simulated swc profiles by the ascp and numerical solution for six soils at different times the ascp simulated the swc profiles comparable to the numerical solutions with re values ranging from 2 85 to 5 47 the predicted z fw and z f by the ascp also agreed well with the numerical simulations the results confirmed the assumption that the shape of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone is only related to the soil hydraulic properties besides fig 6 demonstrates an evident saturated zone which is not easy to measure accurately in the laboratory colman and bodman 1944 first observed a saturated zone in an infiltration experiment with h p 0 5 cm prevedello et al 2009 also showed an experimental swc profile with a distinct transition zone but the θ in the zone was 0 378 cm3 cm 3 which was very close to the θ s of 0 387 cm3 cm 3 it is noted that since the ascp was derived based on the ascs time varying information of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone was also absent in eq 21 this resulted in the simulated swc profile errors becoming significant at z f 20 cm when the length of the unsaturated zone z fr 12 4 cm exceeded the value of h d in loam soil see fig 6b fig 7 shows the simulated upward infiltration into a 10 cm long loam soil column the results indicate that despite the lack of time varying information in the simulated swc profiles by the ascp the maximum re value is only 1 78 so to sum up the ascp can accurately describe the short upward infiltration process 4 4 hydraulic parameters estimation the parameters n and h d of the bc model and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s can be simultaneously estimated using the nonlinearly constrained optimization method as eq 33 from the upward infiltration process in a 5 cm high soil column under a constant pressure lower boundary condition h p 0 cm table 2 shows the upward infiltration data required to estimate soil hydraulic parameters and the estimated values of n h d and k s for six theoretical soils also the relatively low initial swc treatment was chosen the second swc treatment in fig 5 the estimated parameters coincided with the actual parameters fig 8 especially in fine textured soils table 2 the maximum re value of n and h d is 4 66 and 7 91 respectively both in sandy loamy soils and the maximum re value of k s is 8 83 in loam soil for short soil columns the upward infiltration is a more effective process for estimating soil hydraulic properties than downward infiltration because its relatively slow process facilitates improved data sampling frequency over a short infiltration distance also the upward infiltration provides more comprehensive porous information as it is driven by capillary forces which facilitates venting and reduces air entrapment thus the saturated hydraulic conductivity can be accurately and conveniently measured by the constant head method after the upward infiltration process once k s is determined the higher accuracy of the estimated parameters is expected because the parameters n and h d of the bc model are estimated through a system of two equations with two unknown variables as eq 33 table 3 shows that the optimization method was run on two different heights of the soil column for known k s the estimated values of h d were almost the same as the actual values for either a 5 cm or 10 cm high soil column and the maximum re value of n is 4 18 and 8 18 respectively both in loam soil these results indicate that the soil column height has a weak effect on estimating the parameters since the ascp can accurately simulate the short upward infiltration process expectedly a 5 cm high soil column is more suitable for laboratory and field applications it should be noted that improving parameter estimation accuracy by measuring k s by darcy is only appropriate for soil samples without macro porous structure such as sieved soils in the lab soil samples in the newly reclaimed land and non structured cultivated soils for some undisturbed soils with larger pores often occurring in land management such as grazing and tillage the total hydraulic conductivity measured by darcy including the soil water preferential flow region is numerically higher than the soil matrix hydraulic conductivity that represents the matrix region i e k s determined by inverse analysis of upward infiltration processes latorre and moret fernández 2022 in addition the residual and saturated swc can in principle be measured accurately by the weight method hence when optimizing for n h d and k s they were known values by default however the measurement errors of θ s and θ r are inevitable during experiments which will influence the estimation of the remaining parameters compared with θ s the influence of θ r may be weaker ma et al 2009 showed that the parameters to be estimated are insensitive to errors in θ r as it usually varies over a very narrow range although accurate measurement of θ r may improve the accuracy of the estimated parameters this improvement is extremely limited especially for coarse textured soils in contrast more efforts should be taken to improve the measurement or estimation of θ s in general the proposed inversion method based on the ascp can accurately determine soil hydraulic properties in the brooks corey model and the saturated hydraulic conductivity for soils with various textures 5 conclusions in this study we proposed an approximate solution under constant pressure conditions acsp to the one dimensional vertical water movement for the upward infiltration problem in unsaturated soils based on the brooks corey model 1964 by comparing with the numerical solution provided by hydrus 1d the acsp demonstrates consistent simulations of soil water content swc distribution in space and time and cumulative infiltration curves for six different textured soils with low initial swc s i 0 45 however the absence of time varying properties in the swc profile could deteriorate the accuracy of the acsp after the length of the unsaturated zone exceeds the air entry suction value in the future considering time varying swc profile form is expected to improve the solutions for upward infiltration in summary the proposed acsp runs well for upward infiltration into a short distance 5 cm comparable to the size of a standard ring normally used assuming θ s and θ r as known values based on the nonlinearly constrained optimization method the hydraulic parameters n and h d of the bc model and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s can be conveniently and accurately determined from a short upward infiltration process measurement however efforts still need to be made to test the method on real soil samples author contributions donghao ma and jiabao zhang designed the study sicong wu derived the method

3091,soil hydraulic properties quantify soil pore structure and are essential input parameters for simulating soil hydrological processes in the vadose zone although methods have been proposed to estimate soil hydraulic properties efficient and applicable ones are still scarce in this study we derived an approximate solution for a one dimensional upward infiltration process with initially uniform soil water content distribution founded on our solution a nonlinearly constrained optimization method was developed to simultaneously estimate the parameters k s and n h d of the brooks corey model by measuring the upward infiltration process in a 5 cm high soil column numerical experiments simulated with hydrus 1d were performed on six theoretical soils to evaluate the accuracy of the new method the results indicate that the approximate solution can accurately simulate the upward infiltration process at the low initial soil water content range with a relative error re of 2 85 to 5 47 for soil water content distribution in space and time for the cumulative infiltration curve the re ranges from 0 2 to 1 01 the estimated parameters k s and n h d of the brooks corey model are close to the actual parameter values with a re of 0 59 to 4 68 for n 0 00 to 7 91 for h d and 0 50 to 8 83 for k s respectively it is concluded that the new method provides a simple and valuable tool for the accurate estimation of soil hydraulic properties keywords soil hydraulic properties analytical solution infiltration brooks corey model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one dimensional water movement upward into an unsaturated soil or porous medium driven by capillary force is called upward infiltration philip 1966 upward infiltration is an essential component of the hydrologic cycle where groundwater rises to recharge the unsaturated root zone and further enters into the atmosphere by evaporation the study on the upward infiltration is important for the management of secondary soil salinization li et al 2014 and groundwater resources wang et al 2020 the richards equation based on the buckingham darcy law is the fundamental model used to describe soil water movement however it is challenging to solve the richards equation analytically due to its second order nonlinearity as an alternative it is always one of the most interesting topics for soil scientists to pursue approximate analytical solutions with appropriate assumptions parlange et al 1997 basha 2011 sadeghi et al 2017 without the gravity term horizontal absorption is simple in mathematical expression and thus was normally used as a starting point for solving the complex vertical problems shao and horton 1998 and wang 2002 2004 solved the one dimensional horizontal absorption problem under assumed volumetric soil water content swc profiles and developed analytical methods for estimating the parameters of the van genuchten model and the brooks corey model where the saturated hydraulic conductivity was additionally measured by a constant head method however an oversimplified relative water flux was explicitly assumed by wang 2002 2004 which does not agree with later observations ma et al 2017 actually the soil water flux saturation relation is almost independent of the time at long time scales white 1979 white et al 1979 and exhibits a simple linear relationship with the relative soil saturation philip 1973 based on the relationship proposed by philip 1973 ma et al 2009 2015 derived approximate analytical solutions for one dimensional horizontal absorption and vertical infiltration problems furthermore other studies solved the richards equation with different approaches nasseri et al 2008 2012 adopted the traveling wave method to obtain analytical solutions of the richards equation for linear or nonlinear hydraulic conductivity and linear or nonlinear diffusivity for vertical infiltration su et al 2017a 2017b 2018 converted the problem of solving one dimensional soil water movement to that of finding an extremum value of a function with the least action theory and obtained an analytical expression relating swc profile to wetting front advance with variational principle normally the upward infiltration process is handled analogously to the downward infiltration process but having an opposite gravity term philip 1966 first pointed out the possibility of using burgers equation for upward infiltration swartzendruber 2002 derived an exact solution to the burgers equation for the capillary rise problem by assuming a constant soil water diffusivity and a parabolic concave upward hydraulic conductivity the cumulative infiltration volume predicted by the exact solution increases over time but in fact the quantity of water entering into soils during capillary rise will reach equilibrium over time prevedello et al 2009 obtained an analytical solution of the richards equation in soil water potential form by assuming the similarity between the swc profile and the water retention curve however the solution is limited to coarse textured soils in materials science studies on upward infiltration mainly focused on large pore media and researchers obtained the washburn equation similar to the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 by using contact angle theory and darcy s law ishiguro and fujii 2008 ogunmokun and wallach 2021 recently the upward infiltration process has been used to develop simple and efficient approaches for estimating soil hydraulic parameters using short ring soil samples because the relatively slow process facilitates data acquisition in a short infiltration distance for example moret fernández et al 2017 2021 and latorre and moret fernández 2019 developed a series of numerical inversion methods based on the upward infiltration process nevertheless numerical inversion techniques suffer from the complexity and tedious of the estimated parameters this problem can be overcome via analytical methods as they allow the fastest computation however the existing analytical methods fail to be used due to complex solutions e g su et al 2018 or neglecting many other details e g ishiguro and fujii 2008 even so it is worth noting that su et al 2018 derived a complex but relatively accurate swc profile function that can be used for both downward and upward infiltration under constant saturation conditions the derivation method proposed by ma et al 2015 is adaptable for the downward infiltration process while fails to give an appropriate form of the swc profile in upward infiltration it is possible to combine these two methods to obtain an accurate and simple solution for upward infiltration under constant saturation inlet boundary in addition both methods above assumed a time independent shape for the swc profile based on which the mean value theorem for integrals was used to simplify derivation for the infiltration problem under constant saturation conditions this assumption is true since the shape of the swc profile is only determined by soil hydraulic properties at normal time scales philip 1957b however the swc profile shape under constant saturation conditions is different from that under zero or positive pressure head the latter contains the saturated zone philip 1958b the area of the saturated zone increases over time rather than keeping the time independent shape assumed by ma et al 2015 and su et al 2018 as a result although ma et al 2017 has corrected the boundary conditions at the inlet in the approximate analytical solution the total water fluxes maybe still underestimated for infiltration under zero pressure conditions therefore the primary objective of this study was to develop a new inversion method based on an analytical solution to simultaneously determine all hydraulic parameters of the brooks and corey model n h d and k s from an upward infiltration into a 5 cm high soil column we firstly derived an approximate analytical solution for the one dimensional upward infiltration under constant saturation conditions ascs next an approximate solution under constant pressure conditions ascp was obtained based on the ascs to verify both solutions the synthetic upward infiltration data generated by hydrus 1d for six soils with textures ranging from sandy loam soil to clay soil were used to validate the approximate solutions the influence of the initial swc and the distance of upward infiltration on the solutions were also studied finally based on the proposed ascp a nonlinearly constrained optimization method was proposed for determining soil hydraulic properties and tested through six theoretical soils 2 theory the buckingham darcy law is expressed as 1 j w k h dh dz k h where j w is the soil water flux l t 1 k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 h is the soil water pressure head l z is the vertical distance taken positive upward l based on the buckingham darcy law the richards equation for upward infiltration into a one dimensional vertical soil column with initially uniform swc can be described as 2 θ t j w z z k h h z k h θ z 0 θ i θ 0 t θ s θ t θ i where θ is the swc l3 l 3 θ s is the saturated swc l3 l 3 θ i is the initial swc l3 l 3 and t is the infiltration time t brooks and corey 1964 proposed a model to describe the soil water retention curve as 3 s θ θ r θ s θ r h d h n h h d 1 h h d and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve k h in eq 1 can be expressed as 4 k h k s h d h m k s s m n h h d k s h h d where s is the effective saturation h d is the air entry suction l k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 θ r is the residual swc l3 l 3 and n is the pore size distribution index and m 3n 2 with burdine s method burdine 1953 it is noted from eq 3 that the surface soil in eq 2 may be saturated for any pressure head h p greater than or equal to h d philip 1958b the two cases may result in diametrically different swc profiles for the existence of a possible saturated zone indeed the boundary conditions are essential for the final analytical solution and for the inversion method based on it ma et al 2016 case i the so called constant saturation condition h p h d is normally used in many derivations of analytical solutions to soil water problems however case ii constant pressure condition h p h d is more common in experiments therefore we derive and discuss the two cases respectively as follows 2 1 method under constant saturation conditions 2 1 1 swc profile expression for constant saturation conditions su et al 2018 derived an analytical solution under constant saturation conditions to the richards equation based on brooks corey model given the wetting front distance z f the swc distribution for one

effective soil water saturation ϕ is the angle between the flow direction and the vertical axis and α 2 h d 1 5 1 z f h d when ϕ 0 eq 5 can be expressed as the swc profile for upward infiltration as 7 s e n α z z f 1 b 1 z z f n 2 n 1 8 b 1 1 s i 2 n 1 n e 2 n 1 α when ϕ 180 the swc profile for downward infiltration can be calculated by eq 5 9 s e n α z z f 1 b 2 z z f n 2 n 1 10 b 2 1 s i 2 n 1 n e 2 n 1 α it is obvious that the only difference in swc profiles between upward and downward infiltration is a negative sign on the exponent of the first term and b i i 1 2 in the eqs 7 and 9 because of the complexity however it is hard to further obtain the relationship between the z f and t either for upward or downward infiltration by integrating the swc profile as eq 7 or eq 9 with the same infiltration problem and soil hydraulic properties model i e bc model ma et al 2015 derived another form of swc profile for downward infiltration as follows 11 s 1 b 3 z z f n 2 n 2 12 b 3 1 s i 2 n 2 n the form of swc profile eq 11 is so simple and accurate that it can be integrated to build the relationships among the cumulative infiltration volume i z f and t for estimating soil hydraulic properties ma et al 2017 it is well known that the form of swc profile during upward infiltration should be different from that under downward infiltration due to the opposite effects of gravity on soil water movement using the method of ma et al 2015 however it failed to derive a different swc profile as eq 11 both eq 5 and eq 11 have been validated for their ability to describe swc distribution of upward or downward infiltration process at a normal time scale in the next step an analogue method is employed to derive a simple and integrable form of swc profile for upward infiltration from eq 7 by comparing eq 9 and eq 11 since at low θ i b 1 b 2 b 3 which are all approximated to 1 when θ i approaches θ r let 13 b 1 b 2 b 3 b comparing eq 9 with eq 11 for the same

cumulative infiltration volume l k e is the effective hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated zone l t 1 h f is the average matric pressure head at the effective wetting front l and h h f h d l see eqs a10 a13 2 2 method under constant pressure conditions 2 2 1 swc profile expression for constant pressure conditions during the upward infiltration process boundary conditions with water pressure head h p h d allow for developing a saturated zone in the swc profile philip 1958b clearly the swc profile expression eq 16 cannot describe the swc profile with a developing saturated zone according to philip s theory philip 1957b 1957c 1958a the shape of the unsaturated zone in the swc profile is not influenced by the water pressure at the inlet boundary but determined by soil structures the equation of the profile at infinity in the article of philip 1957b similarly the flux concentration relation describing the unsaturated zone has also not altered philip 1973 then it is convenient to make an assumption that eq 16 and eq a8 hold in describing the unsaturated zone in the swc profile during upward infiltration under constant pressure conditions then the expression for the whole swc profile during upward infiltration under constant pressure conditions is fig 1b 21 θ z θ s θ r 1 b z z fw z f z fw a θ r z z fw θ s z z fw where z fw is the length of the saturated zone in swc profile red point in fig 1b 2 2 2 approximate solutions under constant pressure conditions ascp applying the method of ascs to the unsaturated zone in fig 1b soil water flux at the interface between saturated and unsaturated zones can be derived by rewriting eq a8 and eq a9 as 22 j w1 k e 1 δ h z fer 23 z fer u z fr θ s θ i 1 1 a b s i b a 1 1 s i z fr where j w1 is the soil water flux at the interface between the saturated and unsaturated zones red line in fig 1b z fer is the equivalent length of the unsaturated zone in the swc profile l z fr is the length of the unsaturated zone in the swc profile l k e and h are identical to those of eq a10 and eq a11 using darcy s law to the saturated zone in fig 1b soil water flux at the inlet can be described as 24 j w0 d i d t k s h d z fw 1 where j w0 is the soil water flux at the inlet for the sake of simplicity of this presentation we take the water pressure head at the inlet h p 0 but the approach applies with the other h p value since there is no loss of soil water flux in the saturated zone the water fluxes on both sides of the saturated zone should be equal that is 25 j w1 j w0 substituting eq 22 and eq 24 into eq 25 we have 26 z fer b z fw 1 a z fw where a 1 ζ h d and b ζ η then combining with eqs 21 and 26 the cumulative infiltration into the soil is 27 i 0 z f θ θ i d z k i t z fw z f θ θ i d z 0 z fw θ θ i d z u z f z fw θ s θ i z fw

a z fw 1 according to the definition of z fw and z fr we can get the relationship of z f and z fw by eq 23 and eq 26 30 z f z fr z fw c 1 a z fw 1 z fw where c b θ s θ i u then z fw is calculated from z f by inversion of eq 30 31 z fw a z f c 1 a z f c 1 2 4 a z f 2 a substituting eq 31 into eq 27 to eliminate z fw we obtain the relationship i and z f as follow 32 i u z f θ s θ i u 2 a a z f c 1 a

estimation of soil hydraulic properties based on the ascp an optimate method for determining the hydraulic properties of the bc model and k s is developed for a one dimensional vertical upward infiltration into a dry soil column experiment under constant pressure boundary conditions h p 0 cm for convenience the time series data of cumulative infiltration and the cumulative infiltration volume i when z f reaches the upper surface of the soil column are recorded the θ s and θ r can be measured using the method of latorre and moret fernández 2019 the specific step for estimating parameters is described below according to eqs 27 29 and 32 estimating soil hydraulic properties can be transformed into a nonlinearly constrained optimization problem the parameters n h d and k s are

nonlinear constrained in eq 33 3 materials and methods 3 1 numerical simulations and model validation in this study we first proposed an approximate solution under constant saturation conditions ascs based on ascs an approximate solution under constant pressure conditions ascp was further proposed which is more commonly used in the lab given the soil hydraulic parameters the swc distribution in space and time θ z t and the cumulative infiltration curve i t can be simulated under constant saturation or constant pressure boundary conditions for the ascs method the cumulative infiltration curve was calculated by rearranging the eq 20 in the form of f i 0 for each known time t i in which k e and h were independently calculated by the eqs a10 and a11 solving for t i was reduced to finding the roots of the f i function since that is an implicit functional form for i the newton raphson algorithm was adopted to solve the function iteratively to ensure that this algorithm converges in the iterative process the root at the moment t i 1 was taken as the initial iteration value at the moment t i with known i t the values of θ z t under constant saturation conditions can then be simulated by eq 16 and eq 19 for the ascp method with a similar method above solving the eq 29 was reduced to finding the roots of f z fw for each known time t i and solved using the newton raphson algorithm subsequently the values of i t and θ z t under constant pressure conditions can be calculated by eqs 21 27 and eq 30 the upward infiltration process generated numerically with hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 šimůnek et al 2012 was used to analyze the feasibility of the proposed approximate solutions the numerical experiment was conducted on six theoretical soils with different air entry suction covering a texture from sandy loam to clay table 1 in evaluating the accuracy of the approximate solutions the θ z t and i t were obtained by the numerical and approximate solutions under three initial swc treatments s i 0 45 fig 5 the length of each column was 30 cm in validating the ability of the parameter estimation method the time series data of the cumulative infiltration and i were measured the length of each column was 5 cm in the numerical simulation each column was discretized with a one dimensional grid of 101 cells the minimum time step used in the simulations was 0 864 s the tension at the inlet boundary was h d for the ascs method and 0 cm for the ascp method the atmospheric condition with a maximum tension of 0 cm was set at the upper boundary all the simulations stopped before z f reached the soil upper surface the relative error re was used to quantify the accuracy of the presented method 35 re x i t x i t 2 x i t 2 100 where x i t represents the numerical solution by hydrus 1d at the time t and x i t represents the approximate solution at the time t using the proposed method 3 2 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed by varying n h d and z f to evaluate the applicability scope of the approximation in eq 15 at the low θ i range the discrepancy between the left and right terms in eq 15 was quantified by calculating the relative error re between the two on the z z f domain the discrepancy value was summarized as the contour in the h d n error maps the h d n and z z f ranged from 5 to 50 cm 0 01 to 1 and 0 to 0 99 respectively all parameters were discretized into 100 points the case with n 0 01 and h d 50 cm corresponds to the finest soil while the case with n 1 and h d 5 cm represents the coarsest soil the combination of the parameters for each response surface was calculated on a rectangular grid these error maps were generated for z f 5 cm 15 cm and 30 cm respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulated swc profiles under constant saturation conditions given the soil hydraulic parameters in table 1 the ascs can predict the swc profile during the upward infiltration process with uniform θ i and constant saturation at the inlet boundary fig 2 compares the simulated swc profiles at different times by hydrus 1d and ascs for six theoretical soils the ascs and the numerical solution yielded similar results except for at z f 17 4 cm in loam soil with the re values ranging from 3 81 to 7 99 for different textured soils since the accuracy of the simulated swc profiles by acsc showed the same trend in the six soils as θ i increased the silt soil was chosen as an example to evaluate the influences of θ i on the accuracy of the ascs fig 2c and fig 3 overall the simulated swc profiles by the ascs agreed well with those calculated by the numerical solution at the low θ i range the re values varies between 1 40 and 4 52 for θ i at 0 026 0 12 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 respectively however when θ i increased to 0 32 cm3 cm 3 the shape of simulated swc profiles by ascs showed a significant deviation it can be expected that the relatively large errors produced by the ascs at high θ i are induced by the approximation at low θ i in eq 13 which assumed b1 b2 b3 the parameter b i i 1 2 3 is a function of θi with low θ i values the bi exerts weak effects on the swc profile shape however as θ i increases the b i i 1 2 3 will deviate from 1 to varying extents which leads to an obvious deformation of the simulated swc profile shape in addition the approximation error differs for different soil types for a same z f the coarser the soil texture the larger the approximation error the approximation in eq a9 may also cause simulation errors at high θ i the term k i t neglected at low θ i in eq a9 grows with a power function rate as θ i increases and becomes more important as a consequence z fe was underestimated at high θ i in general despite these differences the model is satisfactory 4 2 theoretical analysis of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone the approximation of the left and right terms in eq 15 is the key to obtaining the expression of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone eq 16 also the ascp was derived based on eq 16 and eq a8 it is therefore vital to discuss the accuracy of this approximation at the low θ i range b 1 and eq 15 can be converted to 36 e n 2 h d 1 5 1 z f h d z z f 1 z z f n 2 n 2 2 n 1 the functional form of eq 36 indicates that n h d and z f can influence the accuracy of the approximation in eq 15 and subsequently the swc distribution in eq 16 on the z z f domain normally parameters n and h d are not independent a higher value of n is related to coarser soil texture or large pore structure while large pores also lead to a lower h d stewart et al 2013 fig 4 shows the response surface of the relative error of the h d n combination for different z f values it can be noticed that the shape of error maps depends on z f on the response surface at lower z f fig 4a both low n with high h d and high n with low h d have low relative errors re 5 which indicates the validity of the approximation in eq 15 at the beginning of upward infiltration for a wide soil texture range however the intersection of the red contour with the n axis in the error maps moved to the left as z f increased fig 4 implying gradually increased approximate error in eq 15 for coarse textured soils the result is consistent with the previous reports where su et al 2018 found that eq 9 is only suitable for soils with h d 10 cm in comparison ma et al 2015 2017 verified that eq 11 applies to sandy soil with h d 7 25 cm which consequently caused the failure of the approximation thus according to the good agreement of the simulated swc profiles between the acsc and numerical solution in fig 2 it is concluded that the approximation in eq 15 and the approximate solutions acsc and acsp derived based on this approximate apply to soils with h d 10 cm in addition there is another hypothesis that needs to be verified during the downward infiltration process under constant saturation conditions the shape of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone is assumed to form rapidly at the beginning change slightly during infiltration and finally reach a stable shape philip 1957c this phenomenon was observed in the experiments by wang et al 2003 where the change of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone shape was ignorable at the middle stage of infiltration given the above situation the eqs 9 and 11 assumed a time independent swc profile in order to simplify the derivation ma et al 2015 su et al 2018 this hypothesis was also retained in eq 16 with a time independent shape parameter a given in eq 17 the results in figs 2 and 3 confirmed this hypothesis because eq 16 ran well in almost all swc profiles before z f reached the value of h d as the wetting front rises the gravitational force can balance capillary force z f h d causing the cessation of water movement in those capillaries thus the shape of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone changes over time parlange and aylor 1972 the numerical experiments based on the richards equation demonstrated that the shape of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone began to deform when z f exceeded a height larger than the value of h d fig 2 a c with z f greater than the value of h d the simulated swc profile shapes by the ascs and the numerical solution deviated more from each other especially for coarse textured soils the re is 5 74 for sandy loam soil h d 14 66 cm and 11 09 for loam soil h d 11 15 cm at z f 17 4 cm but only 1 79 for silt soil h d 20 75 cm at z f 25 cm because of the higher air entry suction value h d 25 cm of clay loam silt clay loam and clay soils the numerical solution and ascs performed equally well fig 2 d f since the time dependent shape information is missing in eq 16 this explains why the errors in the simulated swc profile by the ascs increase gradually with z f exceeding the value of h d the time varying properties of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone can be approximately derived based on the principle of least action the variational principle and taylor series expansion su et al 2017a obtained an analytical expression of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone during one dimensional vertical flow by solving the richards equation without any hypothesis on the profile shape using a similar method we obtained an swc profile for the unsaturated zone eq 37 with a time varying shape for upward infiltration 37 z θ c h d n m 1 2 m n 1 θ θ r θ s θ r m n 1 n 3 c 2 h d 2 n 2 m 1 8 2 m 2 n 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 2 m 2 n 1 n c 1 where c c 1 are constant of integration 38 c h d n m 1 2 m n 1 3 c 2 h d 2 n 2 m 1 8 2 m 2 n 1 c

simulation of the swc profile but lead to a more complex function form obviously based on a complex profile function it is almost impossible to obtain feasible expressions between i z f and t the results above show that eq 16 is valid concise and accurate enough to model the swc profile for the unsaturated zone at the early stage of an upward infiltration 4 3 comparisons of ascp and numerical solution fig 5 presents the numerical solution and ascp simulating the cumulative infiltration curves for different soil types with three initial swc treatments overall the cumulative infiltration curves predicted by both solutions were in good agreement when the θ i was close to θ r the simulated cumulative infiltration curves by two solutions were very close with re values ranging from 0 2 to 0 93 for different soil types as s i increased the re values in the cumulative infiltration curves simulated by the numerical solution and ascp remain lower than 1 the results demonstrate that the ascp can simulate accurately the cumulative infiltration process with low values of θ i fig 6 compares the simulated swc profiles by the ascp and numerical solution for six soils at different times the ascp simulated the swc profiles comparable to the numerical solutions with re values ranging from 2 85 to 5 47 the predicted z fw and z f by the ascp also agreed well with the numerical simulations the results confirmed the assumption that the shape of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone is only related to the soil hydraulic properties besides fig 6 demonstrates an evident saturated zone which is not easy to measure accurately in the laboratory colman and bodman 1944 first observed a saturated zone in an infiltration experiment with h p 0 5 cm prevedello et al 2009 also showed an experimental swc profile with a distinct transition zone but the θ in the zone was 0 378 cm3 cm 3 which was very close to the θ s of 0 387 cm3 cm 3 it is noted that since the ascp was derived based on the ascs time varying information of the swc profile for the unsaturated zone was also absent in eq 21 this resulted in the simulated swc profile errors becoming significant at z f 20 cm when the length of the unsaturated zone z fr 12 4 cm exceeded the value of h d in loam soil see fig 6b fig 7 shows the simulated upward infiltration into a 10 cm long loam soil column the results indicate that despite the lack of time varying information in the simulated swc profiles by the ascp the maximum re value is only 1 78 so to sum up the ascp can accurately describe the short upward infiltration process 4 4 hydraulic parameters estimation the parameters n and h d of the bc model and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s can be simultaneously estimated using the nonlinearly constrained optimization method as eq 33 from the upward infiltration process in a 5 cm high soil column under a constant pressure lower boundary condition h p 0 cm table 2 shows the upward infiltration data required to estimate soil hydraulic parameters and the estimated values of n h d and k s for six theoretical soils also the relatively low initial swc treatment was chosen the second swc treatment in fig 5 the estimated parameters coincided with the actual parameters fig 8 especially in fine textured soils table 2 the maximum re value of n and h d is 4 66 and 7 91 respectively both in sandy loamy soils and the maximum re value of k s is 8 83 in loam soil for short soil columns the upward infiltration is a more effective process for estimating soil hydraulic properties than downward infiltration because its relatively slow process facilitates improved data sampling frequency over a short infiltration distance also the upward infiltration provides more comprehensive porous information as it is driven by capillary forces which facilitates venting and reduces air entrapment thus the saturated hydraulic conductivity can be accurately and conveniently measured by the constant head method after the upward infiltration process once k s is determined the higher accuracy of the estimated parameters is expected because the parameters n and h d of the bc model are estimated through a system of two equations with two unknown variables as eq 33 table 3 shows that the optimization method was run on two different heights of the soil column for known k s the estimated values of h d were almost the same as the actual values for either a 5 cm or 10 cm high soil column and the maximum re value of n is 4 18 and 8 18 respectively both in loam soil these results indicate that the soil column height has a weak effect on estimating the parameters since the ascp can accurately simulate the short upward infiltration process expectedly a 5 cm high soil column is more suitable for laboratory and field applications it should be noted that improving parameter estimation accuracy by measuring k s by darcy is only appropriate for soil samples without macro porous structure such as sieved soils in the lab soil samples in the newly reclaimed land and non structured cultivated soils for some undisturbed soils with larger pores often occurring in land management such as grazing and tillage the total hydraulic conductivity measured by darcy including the soil water preferential flow region is numerically higher than the soil matrix hydraulic conductivity that represents the matrix region i e k s determined by inverse analysis of upward infiltration processes latorre and moret fernández 2022 in addition the residual and saturated swc can in principle be measured accurately by the weight method hence when optimizing for n h d and k s they were known values by default however the measurement errors of θ s and θ r are inevitable during experiments which will influence the estimation of the remaining parameters compared with θ s the influence of θ r may be weaker ma et al 2009 showed that the parameters to be estimated are insensitive to errors in θ r as it usually varies over a very narrow range although accurate measurement of θ r may improve the accuracy of the estimated parameters this improvement is extremely limited especially for coarse textured soils in contrast more efforts should be taken to improve the measurement or estimation of θ s in general the proposed inversion method based on the ascp can accurately determine soil hydraulic properties in the brooks corey model and the saturated hydraulic conductivity for soils with various textures 5 conclusions in this study we proposed an approximate solution under constant pressure conditions acsp to the one dimensional vertical water movement for the upward infiltration problem in unsaturated soils based on the brooks corey model 1964 by comparing with the numerical solution provided by hydrus 1d the acsp demonstrates consistent simulations of soil water content swc distribution in space and time and cumulative infiltration curves for six different textured soils with low initial swc s i 0 45 however the absence of time varying properties in the swc profile could deteriorate the accuracy of the acsp after the length of the unsaturated zone exceeds the air entry suction value in the future considering time varying swc profile form is expected to improve the solutions for upward infiltration in summary the proposed acsp runs well for upward infiltration into a short distance 5 cm comparable to the size of a standard ring normally used assuming θ s and θ r as known values based on the nonlinearly constrained optimization method the hydraulic parameters n and h d of the bc model and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s can be conveniently and accurately determined from a short upward infiltration process measurement however efforts still need to be made to test the method on real soil samples author contributions donghao ma and jiabao zhang designed the study sicong wu derived the method

3092,simulation technique is an increasingly focused method for conveniently evaluating a solution or scenario in the field of groundwater however traditional evolutionary algorithms require at least thousands of simulation executions when addressing groundwater simulation based optimization problems to find reasonable solutions intensive simulations usually yield a prohibitive computational burden if the simulation involved is time consuming to defeat the issue this paper proposes a multiobjective ensemble surrogate based optimization algorithm named mesoa for groundwater optimization designs surrogate models can reduce the continual usage of expensive cost models in a way that approximates objective functions unlike existing surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms mesoa employs surrogates with various basis functions rbfs and kriging as available surrogates and presents an adaptive switching technique to construct surrogate models in an online way in addition mesoa involves three sample infill criteria and a novel population filter with the assistance of these techniques mesoa can fully depict the outline of the true pareto front although the times of invoking simulation are limited some representative benchmark cases are provided to test the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm at first afterward mesoa is applied to solve some practical groundwater multiobjective optimization designs such as groundwater remediation and requirement optimization all empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains more availability and effectiveness than other algorithms and has wide universality for groundwater optimization designs keywords multiobjective optimization problems surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithm groundwater optimization designs pumping and treatment optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction modern groundwater optimization designs like groundwater remediation optimizations groundwater requirement optimizations the identification of contaminant source location or releasing history generally involve the simulation technique that can conveniently evaluate the effects of a design or scenario on the groundwater system gorelick and zheng 2015 these optimization projects using numerical models are also called simulation optimization s o problems singh 2015 for solving s o problems some previous studies usually integrate traditional optimization algorithms e g linear programming nonlinear programming and evolutionary algorithms and numerical models ayvaz and elci 2018 datta et al 2009 elci and ayvaz 2014 karterakis et al 2007 kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015 with the advanced simulation techniques and increasing computation power there has been a tendency for more complex well distributed and large scale groundwater models to be employed doherty and christensen 2011 leube et al 2012 the high fidelity models can fully capture the details of physical transportation and chemical reaction of state variables for the groundwater system razavi et al 2012a however such models can be time consuming per run in the order of minutes to days even months li et al 2021 since traditional evolutionary algorithms require at least thousands of model evaluations or function evaluations fes to obtain reasonable solutions huge time or resources consumed inhibit these algorithms when using higher fidelity simulation models to evaluate the fitness of the population chen et al 2017 surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms saeas have become mainstream tools to address these computationally expensive s o problems in the recent decade asher et al 2015 jin 2011 razavi et al 2012a due to the usage of simple constructed and predicting rough but fast surrogate models surrogate models can emulate the potential relations between inputs and outputs and replace the original expensive cost model to predict subsequent effects of some solutions on the groundwater system chugh et al 2019 due to the above characteristics saeas can save the vast majority of computation or resources from numerical simulation if we construct a well approximated surrogate model to the original model for saeas some promising solutions will be found in a short time common widely used surrogate models are kriging jones et al 1998 radial basis function broomhead and lowe 1988 support vector machines clarke et al 2005 response surface model bas and boyaci 2007 and artificial neural network mitchell 1997 there have been wide applications of surrogate techniques for the groundwater field yeh 2015 for instance chen uses an improved ann model to enhance the efficiency of parameter auto calibration and global sensitivity analysis for modflow chen et al 2021 guo integrates kriging and nonlinear programming achieving excellent achievement in identifying groundwater pollution sources guo et al 2019 xing proposes an ensemble surrogate based algorithm to identify the location of groundwater contaminant sources xing et al 2019 zhao compares the effects of using the kelm model with four heuristic optimization algorithms on groundwater management zhao et al 2020 the works mentioned above have a common characteristic that uses an offline algorithm structure where surrogate models do not be updated once constructed therefore they have some potential disadvantages in that one shot surrogate models cannot exactly approximate the complex simulation that represents a particular mapping between the inputs and outputs jiang and na 2020 furthermore they usually run the numerical model hundreds of times to get enough training data at preliminary sampling unlike offline algorithms online algorithms can iteratively update surrogate models and fewer training data are required at the initial epoch more significantly surrogate models can find possible optimal solutions assisted by some sampling criteria during iterative epochs afterward these possible optimal solutions will be evaluated by the expensive cost model then added to the data archive surrogate models will be rebuilt to be more approximated to the expensive cost model at the beginning of the next cycle due to the addition of new evaluated data this way thereby can maximally profit from the surrogate technique and reduce more computation requirements than offline algorithms online saeas have attracted more attention recently in the field of groundwater mo develops a taylor expansion based adaptive approach to circularly build an accurate surrogate model for sensitivity analysis of groundwater modeling mo et al 2017 majumder integrates the ann model with the grey wolf evolutionary algorithm which optimizes groundwater remediation majumder and eldho 2020 razavi builds a novel numerical assessment method for surrogate models that automatically selects the appropriate surrogate models in each epoch of the procedure razavi et al 2012b to the best of our knowledge most applied online algorithms in groundwater focus on solving single objective problems however most real world engineering applications contain multiple conflicts or independent factors deb et al 2018 for instance the treatment effect and engineering cost are equally important but conflictive objectives in pumping and treatment design kourakos and mantoglou 2013 a set of well distributed solutions belonging to the pareto front should be provided dong et al 2021 where decision makers can choose the fast or economic treatment scenarios compared to surrogate assisted single objective evolutionary algorithms higher performance of the surrogate technique and sampling criteria should be demanded when addressing multiobjective optimization problems li et al 2020 there are also many online multiobjective evolutionary algorithms using the surrogate technique for the groundwater field song develops a two stage stochastic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on the nsga ii framework for designing groundwater monitoring networks which employs sparse polynomial chaos expansion pce as the surrogate model song et al 2019 jiang presents a kriging based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm and proves that the proposed algorithm performs better than nsga ii and other offline algorithms in contamination remediation optimizations jiang and na 2020 however the above algorithms are only applied within specific situations or issues and few are compared with other state of the art saeas this paper proposes a multiobjective ensemble surrogate based optimization algorithm mesoa to address groundwater optimization designs more efficiently and universally unlike existing algorithms that employ a predetermined surrogate model before a run mesoa adopts surrogates with various radial basis functions rbfs and kriging as available surrogates with the help of the proposed adaptive switching technique ast that builds a surrogate assessment strategy the most appropriate surrogate is respectively constructed for each objective during the optimization process in this way mesoa can maximize the reuse of exact data to improve the approximated ability of surrogates since optimization problems may contain various features of multiobjective landscapes it is difficult for a sole sampling criterion to overcome easily three sampling criteria are provided to ensure the robustness of the algorithm including the dominance based optimization criterion the decomposition based optimization criterion and the improvement of surrogate criterion the adaptive switching technique and these three sampling criteria collaboratively ensure the diversity and convergence of the sampled solutions and the prediction quality of surrogate models empirical studies including zdt and dtlz instances with dimensions from 5 to 15 have tested the proposed algorithm against six other advanced algorithms furthermore three groundwater optimization designs for groundwater remediation and groundwater requirement problems are applied to investigate the effectiveness and universality of mesoa in the groundwater field all results indicate that mesoa outperforms compared algorithms the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the proposed algorithm mesoa section 3 presents experiments including benchmark functions and practical cases to demonstrate and validate mesoa section 4 makes some conclusions on mesoa 2 methodology this section briefly provides the preliminaries of knowledge about mesoa as fig 1 illustrates mesoa consists of three components preparatory epoch iterative epoch and output epoch at first mesoa will perform intialization including defining the optimization problem setting up user defined parameters and launching the algorithm procedure during the preparatory epoch the numerical model or benchmark function will be constructed as the original model in advance the purpose of the original model is used to evaluate exactly sampled solutions finally the latin hypercube sampling huntington and lyrintzis 1998 will generate the initial population at the preparatory epoch then the optimization procedure enters the iterative epoch the generated population should be evaluated exactly by invoking the original model and stored in the data archive afterward the adaptive switching technique ast accurately switches and constructs appropriate surrogates for each objective of the problem assisted by well trained surrogate models three novel criteria concurrently find promising solutions since the fusion of all sampled solutions from three criteria may generate repeated or low quality solutions a population filter that selects high quality solutions is designed finally the selected solutions are evaluated by the original model and then used to update surrogate models for the following iterative process above iterative process will go through until the fes the times of running original models gather than the pre set parameter fe max further details about each component of mesoa are presented in the following sections 2 1 the definition of the simulation based multiobjective problem the distinction between simulation based and usual optimization problems is that the executed simulation models take up a large part of total computation in the former thus we resort to constructing cheap surrogate models to approximate these expensive cost models the simulation based multiobjective optimization problem can be generally expressed as 1 minimize f x f 1 x f 2 x f m x subject to x lb ub x ℝ where x denotes decision variables lb and ub denote the lower and upper bounds of the decision variables to simplify the assumption we use f i to respectively represent i th objective function although running the simulation model once may obtain values of all objectives 2 2 simulation model there are many helpful simulation techniques in the field of groundwater delshad et al 1996 harbaugh 2005 trefry and muffels 2007 zhang et al 2021 since modflow6 is a simulation platform for integrating multiple models including hydrodynamic and transport models hughes et al 2017 this paper applies modflow6 as the simulation model to provide exact groundwater flow and pollutant transport process the partial differential equation can describe the general governing equation about groundwater flow and state variables transport process 2 x i k i j h x j w s s h t where k i j is the tensor of hydraulic conductivity l t 1 h denotes the potentiometric head l w is the sink source term s s is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 t denotes the time t the groundwater transport model of modflow6 solves the following advection dispersion reaction equation under calculated hydrogeological conditions to obtain the pollutant transport process 3 x i θ d ij c k x j x i θ v i c k q s c s k r n θ c k t where θ is effective porosity c k is the dissolved concentration of species k m l 3 d ij is the dispersion coefficient tensor l 2 t 1 v i is the linear pore water velocity l t 1 q s is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume representing sources or sinks t c s k is the source or sink concentration of species k m l 3 r n is the chemical reaction term m l 3 t 1 this paper uses the python package flopy to link modflow6 to the applied optimization algorithms bakker et al 2016 however note that any other efficient groundwater simulation models could replace the used models in this paper 2 3 surrogate modeling and the adaptive switching technique the usage of surrogate models aims to save computation from expensive cost simulation from some researches on various surrogate models the kriging model and radial basis functions rbfs outperform others gong et al 2015 because kriging can simultaneously provide the predicted value and uncertainty of the prediction jones et al 1998 rbfs may be the best models for balancing performance and building difficulty and contain various alternative basis functions regis and shoemaker 2004 thus we employ kriging in the improvement of surrogate criterion and rbfs in the dominance and decomposition based optimization criterion for the proposed algorithm 2 3 1 radial basis functions radial basis functions rbfs have broad applications in data classification data mining and function approximation using a weighted sum of basis functions to build a potential mapping between inputs and outputs if given n t training inputs s t x t 1 x t 2 x t n and their corresponding outputs f t f t 1 f t 2 f t n 4 f x i 1 n t λ i φ x x t i p x where λ i is the weighted coefficients of each basis function φ is the basis function also called kernel function kernel p m r d is the linear space of m degree polynomials and the value of m is determined by the use of the radial basis function listed in table 1 the usage of radial basis function φ may affect the performance of an rbf therefore the adaptive switch technique will be introduced for reasonably using them in section 2 3 3 there are some commonly used radial basis functions listed in table 1 in which the parameter r denotes the euclidean distance between x and the training inputs s t n denotes the dimensions of the problems and the constant γ can be specified by the user γ 1 in this paper the polynomials p x can be described as 5 p x i 1 m h i q i x where m is the dimension of m r d m m d d h i is the weighted coefficient and q i x is the basis for m r d coefficients λ and h can be solved by solving the following linear system 6 φ p p 0 λ h f 0 where the size of φ is n t n t φ ij φ x i x j the sub matrix p is defined in eq 5 2 3 2 kriging kriging also called the gaussian process is frequently applied in evolutionary algorithms due to its strong approximated ability if given n t training inputs the original model function f x can be expressed as 7 f x y μ ε x where μ is a regression model or a constant value is normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ 2 i e x n 0 σ 2 the covariance of the ε x can be obtained by 8 c o v ε x i ε x j σ 2 r r x i x j where x i and x j are any two arbitrary inputs from n t given exact data r is the correlation matrix the size of r corresponds to the size of training inputs n t the sub element r ij of r can be described by 9 r x i x j exp k 1 n θ i x k i x k j 2 where θ i is the hyperparameter the size of θ is equal to the dimension of design variables to get the hyperparameters μ and θ we can maximize the below likelihood function 10 p y x θ μ 1 2 π σ 2 n t 2 det r exp y μ 1 r 1 y μ 1 2 σ 2 where x is the input matrix y is the output matrix corresponding to x r denotes the correlation matrix after solving μ and θ from the likelihood function the predicted value f x and variance v x can be expressed 11 f x y μ r r 1 y 1 μ v x s 2 σ 2 1 r r 1 r 1 1 r 1 r 1 r 1 1 where 12 μ 1 1 t r 1 y 2 1 t r 1 1 σ 2 y 1 μ t r 1 y 1 μ n t 2 3 3 adaptive switching technique some reviews indicate that one surrogate model may be the model which gets the smallest predicted error for the objective landscape generated by a certain numerical model but this surrogate may not be suited for any other landscapes deb et al 2021 xing et al 2019 since the performance of surrogate models can be influenced by two factors a self characteristics of the simulation model b the accumulated exact data during the optimization process especially when approximating some complex landscapes the static surrogate model cannot perform best during the process thereby we propose an adaptive switching technique ast for surrogates with radial basis functions rbfs as fig 1 depicts at the beginning of the iterative epoch the adaptive switching technique adopts a greedy strategy to switch the most suitable models using the value error metric vem which is a performance metric to evaluate the error between predicted and real value the k fold cross validation is applied to evaluate the value error metric vem for rbfs if given a set d d x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n the d will be divided into k c n k pairs of sets q t q q 1 q 2 q k t t 1 t 2 t k for any pairs of sets q i t i we use set q i to train surrogate model and evaluate the accumulated error between the predicted value by the surrogate model and the real value from t i and the function e q t is defined to represent above process thus the vem of the surrogate model can be evaluated by 13 vem i 1 k e q i t i in the adaptive switching technique there are two alternative ways to select the winner from the five types of rbfs the one is to choose the surrogate model with the smallest value of vem directly another approach is to use the inversion of the value of vem as the selection probability to avoid being stuck in always using the same rbf all the process this paper uses the latter approach 2 4 the used sampling criteria from fig 1 we can see that sampling criteria guide the optimization orientation of an algorithm to improve the performance of the algorithm this paper integrates three sampling criteria for mesoa a the dominance based sampling criterion b the decomposition based sampling criterion c the improvement of surrogate criterion two former criteria aim to ensure the diversity and convergence of the pareto front while the latter devotes to improving the quality of the updated surrogate model for the next iterative 2 4 1 the dominance based sampling criterion the dominance based sampling criterion is derived from the optimization framework of nsga ii deb et al 2002 and nsga iii deb and jain 2013 the only difference is to employ surrogate models to replace the simulation model the surrogate based optimization problem solved by nsga ii or nsga iii can be described by 14 minimize f x f 1 x f 2 x f m x subject to x lb ub n s g a i i n s g a i i i p d o m where f i is the built surrogate model for the ith objective function p d o m is a set that saves the promising solutions from this criterion this paper uses nsga ii in bi objective problems and nsga iii in many objective problems 2 4 2 the decomposition based sampling criterion the decomposition based sampling criterion employs rvea cheng et al 2016 and rbfs to find satisfactory solutions unlike the dominance based optimization framework rvea will convert the multiobjective optimization problem into serval sub single optimization problems with h reference vectors generated by das and dennis s method therefore we define some achievement scalarization aggregation functions a s f x w to represent single objective problems the single objective optimization problems can be expressed by 15 minimize asf x w for w w subject to x lb ub rvea p d e c where w is the set of all reference vectors set p d e c is used to save potential solutions of the pareto front from this criterion 2 4 3 the improvement of surrogate criterion the criterion this paper used is proposed in zhan s paper zhan et al 2017 which has shown its superiority in improving the prediction quality of the surrogate model the ei metrics in single objective problems jones et al 1998 are expanded into a 2 d expected improvement matrix named eim the eim is 16 ei 1 1 x ei 1 2 x ei 1 m x ei 2 1 x ei 2 2 x ei 2 m x ei n 1 x ei n 2 x ei n m x where ei n m denotes the sub ei metric for the m th objective of the n th individuals m is the number of objective functions n is the size of evolutionary population for eim we use the following equation to select promising solutions 17 eim x min i 1 n max j 1 m ei i j x the genetic algorithm ga is applied to find optimal solutions based on eq 17 in addition the use of p i m p saves the solutions from this criterion 2 5 population filter since expensive cost simulation takes up most time consumed by the algorithm we should carefully select the proposed solutions from the above criteria we use a metric called ehv to further filter candidate solutions from set p p p dom p dec p imp 18 ehv i hv a x i hv a where a denotes the data archive that stores all exact data hv is the function that represents the hypervolume of non dominated solutions from the data archive a zitzler and thiele 1999 from eq 18 and fig 2 we can conclude that the ehv metric denotes the enhancement of hv if adding the new solution x i into the data archive a top n f solutions from set p based on ehv metric will be finally chosen 3 case study this section conducts a series of cases to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm mesoa on groundwater optimization designs before directly applying mesoa to practical groundwater problems some representative benchmark experiments are presented at first which have three merits a we can test the proposed algorithm in various landscapes including continuous non continuous convex non convex and having many local optima by abundant benchmark functions b every benchmark function has specific formulas and the pareto front c benchmark functions are easy and cheap to get the values of all objectives so as to carry out much statistical analysis 3 1 benchmark cases 3 1 1 benchmark functions and performance metric zdt instances bi objective optimization problems and dtlz instances three objective optimization problems are common benchmark cases for testing algorithms employed in this paper table 2 lists the used benchmark functions selected from zdt and dtlz instances this paper uses the inverted generational distance igd coello and sierra 2004 to provide an overall assessment of the pareto front obtained by the algorithm the value of igd can synthetically represent the diversity and convergence of non dominated solutions obtained if the true pareto front is known let set p be a set of well distributed solutions along the true pareto front in the objective space and set q be the proposed non dominated solutions in the objective space by the algorithm then igd is defined as the average distance from each point from p to q as eq 19 and fig 3 demonstrate 19 igd p q v p dist v q p where p is the size of p d i s t v q denotes the minimum euclidean distance of points v v p and set q therefore to obtain a low i g d p q the solutions of q in objective space must be well distributed and close to the true pareto front table 2 lists the number of used reference points for each benchmark case 3 1 2 comparable algorithms and parameter settings we compare the mesoa with three surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms moea d ego zhang et al 2009 k rvea chugh et al 2016 and parego knowles 2006 the results of three traditional evolutionary algorithms are also given to show the superiority of surrogate based algorithms to create a fair comparison environment all algorithms are implemented by platemo an efficient software platform tian et al 2017 in this experiment the population size of all algorithms is set to n i 10 m m is the number of objectives for user defined parameters the size of the evolutionary population or reference vectors is set to 200 the maximum number of surrogate assisted fitness approximations before updating the surrogate is set to 20 000 for special parameters of mesoa the selected number by the population filter n f is set to 15 moreover we adopt recommended values for special parameters of the compared algorithms in their original literature each algorithm independently runs 20 times for each benchmark case on platemo of matlab r2020b equipped with intel coretm i7 7700 cpu 3 60 ghz processor and 16 0 gb ram 3 1 3 experiment results the statistical results of igd are collected in table 3 wilcoxon rank sum test approach α 0 05 is used derrac et al 2011 where and indicate that mesoa is either superior or inferior to the compared algorithms indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between mesoa and the compared algorithms furthermore the visualization of experimental results is intuitively given in three forms fig 4 shows the statistical results by box plot fig 5 presents the selected basis functions during the whole optimization process of a certain case fig 6 illustrates some representative results of mesoa to display final non dominated points presented by each criterion in the objective space according to table 3 and fig 4 surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms saeas outperform traditional evolutionary algorithms implying that saeas can obtain promising solutions with limited numbers of function executions furthermore among the four saeas mesoa shows the best performance which gets 24 bold highlights in table 3 zdt1 instance is the simplest case among six benchmark cases which is easy for all surrogate models to approximate thus zdt1 is suitable for testing the ability of sampling criteria to capture the whole shape of the pareto front table 3 figures out that mesoa obtains several orders of magnitude better values than other algorithms the main reason may be the cooperation of the proposed novel criteria in this work from fig 6 1 we can conclude that the decomposition based criterion is more appropriate for zdt1 to our knowledge zdt3 and zdt6 contain more complex landscapes table 2 shows that zdt3 has the discontinuous pareto front and zdt6 has many local optima thus zdt3 and zdt6 require the close cooperation of sampling criteria and surrogate modeling mesoa gets the best performance in zdt3 and zdt6 we collect the selected type of radial basis functions listed in table 1 when constructing rbf for each cycle in zdt3 and zdt6 as fig 5 shows fig 5 indicates that almost all radial basis functions have been applied from fig 6 2 we observe that the number of non dominated solutions obtained from the dominance and decomposition based criteria are equal these results indicate that adaptive surrogate models and multiple criteria show more advantages than using a single surrogate and a single criterion for three objective cases mesoa still obtains significantly better results than other algorithms from fig 4 3 and 4 other saeas except mesoa get worse results than traditional evolutionary algorithms the reason may be that using a sole surrogate model cannot approximate these problems well with increasing dimensions and objectives however due to the adaptive switching technique mesoa overcomes these difficulties table 2 indicates that dtlz7 has the discontinuous pareto front which is a big challenge for optimization algorithms however from fig 6 6 the non dominated solutions obtained by mesoa within only 200 function evaluations roughly cover the whole pareto front in the objective space from the above detailed study the significantly better performance of mesoa on all benchmark cases indicates the superiority of the adaptive switching technique and three sampling criteria equipped with the population filter 3 2 practical groundwater cases as we know the optimization problems of groundwater usually resort to complex and computationally expensive models to evaluate the effects of input decisions on the groundwater system thus some researchers employ various surrogate techniques to reduce the requirement to invoke simulations this section will investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm on groundwater optimization designs by certain groundwater remediation and requirement optimization problems 3 2 1 case study 1 simple groundwater remediation problem in this case we consider a hypothetical confined aquifer 170 m 510 m where the contaminant has been dispersed for ten years at the location x 155 m y 85 m fig 7 1 illustrates the shape of the contaminant plume with a peak concentration of 100 g m 3 as fig 7 2 displays the aquifer domain is discretized using 867 rectangle grids and the size of each grid is 10 m 10 m the aquifer has the specified head and constant concentration on the left h l 45 m c l 0 g m 3 and right h r 42 m c r 0 g m 3 boundaries and no flow on the other sides table 4 sets out the basic hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer for removing contaminants and repairing groundwater in the next 12 years there exist three pumping wells at x 205 m y 85 m x 305 m y 85 m and x 405 m y 85 m so as to pump and treat contaminated water in this case the location of wells and remediation time are presumed fixed while the pumping rate of each well during each stress period is changeable the number of unknown decision variables is 6 or 12 3 wells s stress periods decided by s 2 4 and the maximum of simulation executions fe max is set to 200 the timestep of simulation is set to 1 2 day and the average runtime of a single simulation is about 20 s we design two bi objective problems at first represented by problem a and problem b as table 5 shows since the true pareto front is unknown i e igd is unavailable we use two other performance metrics hypervolume hv and c metric zitzler et al 2000 to compare the algorithms eq 20 shows the mathematical description of hv 20 hv r δ i 1 r v i where set r denotes non dominated solutions set δ denotes the lebesgue measure to calculate volume v i is the hypervolume of the ideal points and the i th non dominated solution from r a higher value of the hv indicates better obtained solutions c metric usually represents the dominated ratio of the set from algorithm a by the set from algorithm b 21 c a b u b v a v dominates u b a higher value of the c metric denotes that algorithm a is better than algorithm b we set up four scenarios for all comparable algorithms for brevity each scenario is constituted of a digit and a letter for example 6 b means the scenario that uses problem b as the optimization problem containing six unknown variables 3 w e l l s 2 s t r e s s p e r i o d s each algorithm runs ten times on each scenario for statistical analysis table 6 summarizes the statistical results of hv obtained by all comparable algorithms and the wilcoxon rank sum test α 0 05 is used table 7 provides the c metric of mesoa and other algorithms note that we use the fraction form to present the specific number of solutions of other algorithms dominated by mesoa for example in the scenarios 6 a of parego and mesoa 20 39 denotes that 20 of the 39 solutions are dominated by the solutions of mesoa while 0 56 denotes that none of the solutions from mesoa can be dominated by that of parego therefore the mesoa outperforms parego in the scenario 6 a when conducting the comparison of mesoa with three other advanced saeas it is obvious that mesoa is the most suitable algorithm for addressing groundwater optimization problems we can observe from table 6 and table 7 that mesoa is superior to others in both performance and stability in four scenarios furthermore by increasing the decision variables of problems mesoa can get higher hv values but other algorithms cannot the finding also indicates that separating more stress periods can obtain better solutions when requiring the goal to reach a minor contaminant concentration however it demands the excellent cooperation of the surrogate modeling and sampling criteria as far as this case is concerned mesoa achieves satisfactory success in 6 and 12 dimensional optimization cases to further show the superiority of mesoa we use the results having medium hv from seven algorithms to display the solutions which cannot be dominated by the solutions of mesoa as fig 8 illustrates from fig 8 we can speculate that the true pareto front of the case is non convex and has a long tail which belongs to the typical and challenging problems for optimization algorithms surprisingly mesoa depicts a complete pareto front using obtained well distributed solutions nevertheless k rvea parego and moea d ego cannot get better solutions than mesoa at the large discharge region the reasons may be that k rvea parego and moea d ego consume large model evaluations and get too dense solutions at the local range as fig 8 shows mesoa still finds comparable solutions in the region of low discharge under fewer model evaluations overall these cases support the view that mesoa can get better converged and diversified solutions due to the adaptive switching technique and three sampling criteria with the population filter 3 2 2 case study 2 groundwater demand problem based on case 1 we assume 18 agricultural irrigation nozzles q 0 5 m 3 d a y for agriculture water requirements and the nozzles are near the monitor wells as fig 7 1 shows if the concentration of groundwater at monitor wells gathers than 0 03 g m 3 the corresponding locations of agricultural irrigation nozzles are unavailable the pumping rate of wells in the next 12 years is optimized to simultaneously minimize the pumping cost of wells minimize the average unavailable time of irrigation nozzles and maximize the removal effect of the contaminant the number of unknown decision variables is 6 or 12 3 wells s stress periods decided by s 2 4 the user setting of all algorithms is the same as in case 1 for three objective optimization problems the simulation executions fe max is set to 300 to outline the whole pareto front the mathematical expression for this case can be described by 22 minimize f 1 t year m 1 t 1 g x m t t year t steps f 2 max m c x m s f 3 n 1 n s 1 s q x n s n s subject to x q min q max n s where 23 g x m t timestep i f c x m t c limited 0 i f c x m t c limited in eq 23 g x m t denotes a decision function for the enablement of agricultural irrigation nozzles the timestep of g x m t is set to 1 2 days c limited denotes the threshold concentration to use nozzles c max 0 03 g m 3 t steps is the total steps of the simulation for this case t steps 8760 t year is the practical simulation duration t year 12 thereby the maximum of f 1 is 12 and the minimum value is 0 other parameters are the same as in case 1 the hv and c metric like the usage of case1 are used to quantify the performance of each algorithm table 8 and table 9 provide the results of hv and c metric obtained by seven compared algorithms for three objective problems mesoa still performs best among seven algorithms for standard deviations in table 8 it is obvious that saeas are more stable than three traditional evolutionary algorithms the main reason is that using surrogate models can identify the region of non dominated solutions furthermore mesoa obtains the minimum standard deviations as we know other algorithms determine static surrogate models to approximate various landscapes before a run in contrast mesoa applies the adaptive switching technique ast to reuse known data and dynamically choose the best performance radial basis function of rbfs the results powerfully prove that the adaptive switching technique ast can keep the stability of mesoa fig 9 shows all non dominated solutions of mesoa and other solutions which mesoa cannot dominate based on fig 9 we can infer that the true pareto front of this case is an irregular long and thin continuous surface it can test the ability of algorithms to trade off exploitation and exploration fig 9 and table 9 figure out that parego krvea and moea d ego overly exploit the local region and rarely explore the global region however mesoa applying ast and three sampling criteria depicts the complete pareto front mesoa effectively reaches a balanced status in exploitation and exploration thus the presented results support the idea that mesoa can obtain significantly better results than other algorithms in three objective groundwater optimization problems 3 2 3 case study 3 complex groundwater remediation problem case 3 is about remediation of the confined aquifer based on the three dimensional simulation referred from chapter 7 of the mt3dms manual zheng and wang 1999 as fig 10 1 illustrates the simulated aquifer consists of two fine medium sand layers and two medium coarse sand layers each layer is comprised of 61 rows and 40 columns with variable row and column widths the refined grids exist near the detailed study site containing the bulk of the contaminant plume depicted by abcd in fig 10 1 the initial plume displayed in fig 10 1 is at layer 3 and we use a ratio coefficient to initialize the plume for other layers 0 2 for layer 2 and 0 for layers 1 and 4 outside the refined grid area the lengths and widths of cells progressively increase toward the model boundary specified head boundaries are used on all four sides fig 10 2 shows the initial groundwater table of the research region table 10 presents other parameters for cases a run for simulation requires an average of 2 5 min for removal of the contaminant in the next 1000 days eight wells are distributed in the abcd region the water intake of wells are located at layer 3 and q max is 3000 m 3 d a y this case aims to minimize the cost of the complete remediation and concurrently minimize the maximum concentration of the contaminant after remediation by optimizing the pumping discharge of wells the unknown decision variables are 8 or 16 splitting 1 or 2 stress periods of 1000 days s 1 2 the simulation executions fe max are set to 300 since the search space is huger than the former two cases note that the optimization needs to take up 12 5 h for each algorithm at one time preceding studies have proved that surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms outperform traditional evolutionary algorithms thereby only four surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms are compared in this case table 11 presents the statistical results of hv and c metrics mesoa performs best in these cases furthermore fig 11 illustrates the box plot for the hv metric of each algorithm when addressing an 8 dimensional case one stress period mesoa parego and krvea do better at the stable however for a 16 dimensional case it should be mentioned that only mesoa keeps the stability from fig 12 and table 11 the non dominated solutions obtained by mesoa are characterized by high diversity and stability and other algorithms pay more attention to the local region further analysis in complex cases reports that mesoa shows stronger approximated and searching ability in complex three dimensional groundwater cases by the adaptive switching technique and three sampling criteria with the novel population filter 4 conclusion this paper proposes a multiobjective ensemble surrogate based optimization algorithm named mesoa for groundwater simulation optimization problems rbfs with multiple radial basis functions and kriging are used to approximate numerical models to avoid a huge computation burden besides the adaptive switching technique ast can fully reuse known data to construct the best performance surrogate model for each objective three sampling criteria and a novel population filter cooperatively select promising solutions to balance exploitation versus exploration and improve the quality of surrogate models to investigate the performance of mesoa eight benchmark functions in 5 8 15 dimensions are employed at first the experimental results prove that surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms saeas are significantly better than traditional evolutionary algorithms furthermore mesoa obtains the best results among the four saeas afterward three groundwater cases about groundwater remediation or water requirement optimization problems in two or three objectives are used all empirical results indicate that mesoa gets the top one in performance and stability and depicts the well distributed and converged pareto front of various cases after detailed research we conclude that mesoa due to these proposed techniques shows more efficiency and universality in groundwater simulation optimization problems than other algorithms in future

3092,simulation technique is an increasingly focused method for conveniently evaluating a solution or scenario in the field of groundwater however traditional evolutionary algorithms require at least thousands of simulation executions when addressing groundwater simulation based optimization problems to find reasonable solutions intensive simulations usually yield a prohibitive computational burden if the simulation involved is time consuming to defeat the issue this paper proposes a multiobjective ensemble surrogate based optimization algorithm named mesoa for groundwater optimization designs surrogate models can reduce the continual usage of expensive cost models in a way that approximates objective functions unlike existing surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms mesoa employs surrogates with various basis functions rbfs and kriging as available surrogates and presents an adaptive switching technique to construct surrogate models in an online way in addition mesoa involves three sample infill criteria and a novel population filter with the assistance of these techniques mesoa can fully depict the outline of the true pareto front although the times of invoking simulation are limited some representative benchmark cases are provided to test the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm at first afterward mesoa is applied to solve some practical groundwater multiobjective optimization designs such as groundwater remediation and requirement optimization all empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains more availability and effectiveness than other algorithms and has wide universality for groundwater optimization designs keywords multiobjective optimization problems surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithm groundwater optimization designs pumping and treatment optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction modern groundwater optimization designs like groundwater remediation optimizations groundwater requirement optimizations the identification of contaminant source location or releasing history generally involve the simulation technique that can conveniently evaluate the effects of a design or scenario on the groundwater system gorelick and zheng 2015 these optimization projects using numerical models are also called simulation optimization s o problems singh 2015 for solving s o problems some previous studies usually integrate traditional optimization algorithms e g linear programming nonlinear programming and evolutionary algorithms and numerical models ayvaz and elci 2018 datta et al 2009 elci and ayvaz 2014 karterakis et al 2007 kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015 with the advanced simulation techniques and increasing computation power there has been a tendency for more complex well distributed and large scale groundwater models to be employed doherty and christensen 2011 leube et al 2012 the high fidelity models can fully capture the details of physical transportation and chemical reaction of state variables for the groundwater system razavi et al 2012a however such models can be time consuming per run in the order of minutes to days even months li et al 2021 since traditional evolutionary algorithms require at least thousands of model evaluations or function evaluations fes to obtain reasonable solutions huge time or resources consumed inhibit these algorithms when using higher fidelity simulation models to evaluate the fitness of the population chen et al 2017 surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms saeas have become mainstream tools to address these computationally expensive s o problems in the recent decade asher et al 2015 jin 2011 razavi et al 2012a due to the usage of simple constructed and predicting rough but fast surrogate models surrogate models can emulate the potential relations between inputs and outputs and replace the original expensive cost model to predict subsequent effects of some solutions on the groundwater system chugh et al 2019 due to the above characteristics saeas can save the vast majority of computation or resources from numerical simulation if we construct a well approximated surrogate model to the original model for saeas some promising solutions will be found in a short time common widely used surrogate models are kriging jones et al 1998 radial basis function broomhead and lowe 1988 support vector machines clarke et al 2005 response surface model bas and boyaci 2007 and artificial neural network mitchell 1997 there have been wide applications of surrogate techniques for the groundwater field yeh 2015 for instance chen uses an improved ann model to enhance the efficiency of parameter auto calibration and global sensitivity analysis for modflow chen et al 2021 guo integrates kriging and nonlinear programming achieving excellent achievement in identifying groundwater pollution sources guo et al 2019 xing proposes an ensemble surrogate based algorithm to identify the location of groundwater contaminant sources xing et al 2019 zhao compares the effects of using the kelm model with four heuristic optimization algorithms on groundwater management zhao et al 2020 the works mentioned above have a common characteristic that uses an offline algorithm structure where surrogate models do not be updated once constructed therefore they have some potential disadvantages in that one shot surrogate models cannot exactly approximate the complex simulation that represents a particular mapping between the inputs and outputs jiang and na 2020 furthermore they usually run the numerical model hundreds of times to get enough training data at preliminary sampling unlike offline algorithms online algorithms can iteratively update surrogate models and fewer training data are required at the initial epoch more significantly surrogate models can find possible optimal solutions assisted by some sampling criteria during iterative epochs afterward these possible optimal solutions will be evaluated by the expensive cost model then added to the data archive surrogate models will be rebuilt to be more approximated to the expensive cost model at the beginning of the next cycle due to the addition of new evaluated data this way thereby can maximally profit from the surrogate technique and reduce more computation requirements than offline algorithms online saeas have attracted more attention recently in the field of groundwater mo develops a taylor expansion based adaptive approach to circularly build an accurate surrogate model for sensitivity analysis of groundwater modeling mo et al 2017 majumder integrates the ann model with the grey wolf evolutionary algorithm which optimizes groundwater remediation majumder and eldho 2020 razavi builds a novel numerical assessment method for surrogate models that automatically selects the appropriate surrogate models in each epoch of the procedure razavi et al 2012b to the best of our knowledge most applied online algorithms in groundwater focus on solving single objective problems however most real world engineering applications contain multiple conflicts or independent factors deb et al 2018 for instance the treatment effect and engineering cost are equally important but conflictive objectives in pumping and treatment design kourakos and mantoglou 2013 a set of well distributed solutions belonging to the pareto front should be provided dong et al 2021 where decision makers can choose the fast or economic treatment scenarios compared to surrogate assisted single objective evolutionary algorithms higher performance of the surrogate technique and sampling criteria should be demanded when addressing multiobjective optimization problems li et al 2020 there are also many online multiobjective evolutionary algorithms using the surrogate technique for the groundwater field song develops a two stage stochastic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on the nsga ii framework for designing groundwater monitoring networks which employs sparse polynomial chaos expansion pce as the surrogate model song et al 2019 jiang presents a kriging based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm and proves that the proposed algorithm performs better than nsga ii and other offline algorithms in contamination remediation optimizations jiang and na 2020 however the above algorithms are only applied within specific situations or issues and few are compared with other state of the art saeas this paper proposes a multiobjective ensemble surrogate based optimization algorithm mesoa to address groundwater optimization designs more efficiently and universally unlike existing algorithms that employ a predetermined surrogate model before a run mesoa adopts surrogates with various radial basis functions rbfs and kriging as available surrogates with the help of the proposed adaptive switching technique ast that builds a surrogate assessment strategy the most appropriate surrogate is respectively constructed for each objective during the optimization process in this way mesoa can maximize the reuse of exact data to improve the approximated ability of surrogates since optimization problems may contain various features of multiobjective landscapes it is difficult for a sole sampling criterion to overcome easily three sampling criteria are provided to ensure the robustness of the algorithm including the dominance based optimization criterion the decomposition based optimization criterion and the improvement of surrogate criterion the adaptive switching technique and these three sampling criteria collaboratively ensure the diversity and convergence of the sampled solutions and the prediction quality of surrogate models empirical studies including zdt and dtlz instances with dimensions from 5 to 15 have tested the proposed algorithm against six other advanced algorithms furthermore three groundwater optimization designs for groundwater remediation and groundwater requirement problems are applied to investigate the effectiveness and universality of mesoa in the groundwater field all results indicate that mesoa outperforms compared algorithms the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the proposed algorithm mesoa section 3 presents experiments including benchmark functions and practical cases to demonstrate and validate mesoa section 4 makes some conclusions on mesoa 2 methodology this section briefly provides the preliminaries of knowledge about mesoa as fig 1 illustrates mesoa consists of three components preparatory epoch iterative epoch and output epoch at first mesoa will perform intialization including defining the optimization problem setting up user defined parameters and launching the algorithm procedure during the preparatory epoch the numerical model or benchmark function will be constructed as the original model in advance the purpose of the original model is used to evaluate exactly sampled solutions finally the latin hypercube sampling huntington and lyrintzis 1998 will generate the initial population at the preparatory epoch then the optimization procedure enters the iterative epoch the generated population should be evaluated exactly by invoking the original model and stored in the data archive afterward the adaptive switching technique ast accurately switches and constructs appropriate surrogates for each objective of the problem assisted by well trained surrogate models three novel criteria concurrently find promising solutions since the fusion of all sampled solutions from three criteria may generate repeated or low quality solutions a population filter that selects high quality solutions is designed finally the selected solutions are evaluated by the original model and then used to update surrogate models for the following iterative process above iterative process will go through until the fes the times of running original models gather than the pre set parameter fe max further details about each component of mesoa are presented in the following sections 2 1 the definition of the simulation based multiobjective problem the distinction between simulation based and usual optimization problems is that the executed simulation models take up a large part of total computation in the former thus we resort to constructing cheap surrogate models to approximate these expensive cost models the simulation based multiobjective optimization problem can be generally expressed as 1 minimize f x f 1 x f 2 x f m x subject to x lb ub x ℝ where x denotes decision variables lb and ub denote the lower and upper bounds of the decision variables to simplify the assumption we use f i to respectively represent i th objective function although running the simulation model once may obtain values of all objectives 2 2 simulation model there are many helpful simulation techniques in the field of groundwater delshad et al 1996 harbaugh 2005 trefry and muffels 2007 zhang et al 2021 since modflow6 is a simulation platform for integrating multiple models including hydrodynamic and transport models hughes et al 2017 this paper applies modflow6 as the simulation model to provide exact groundwater flow and pollutant transport process the partial differential equation can describe the general governing equation about groundwater flow and state variables transport process 2 x i k i j h x j w s s h t where k i j is the tensor of hydraulic conductivity l t 1 h denotes the potentiometric head l w is the sink source term s s is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 t denotes the time t the groundwater transport model of modflow6 solves the following advection dispersion reaction equation under calculated hydrogeological conditions to obtain the pollutant transport process 3 x i θ d ij c k x j x i θ v i c k q s c s k r n θ c k t where θ is effective porosity c k is the dissolved concentration of species k m l 3 d ij is the dispersion coefficient tensor l 2 t 1 v i is the linear pore water velocity l t 1 q s is the volumetric flow rate per unit volume representing sources or sinks t c s k is the source or sink concentration of species k m l 3 r n is the chemical reaction term m l 3 t 1 this paper uses the python package flopy to link modflow6 to the applied optimization algorithms bakker et al 2016 however note that any other efficient groundwater simulation models could replace the used models in this paper 2 3 surrogate modeling and the adaptive switching technique the usage of surrogate models aims to save computation from expensive cost simulation from some researches on various surrogate models the kriging model and radial basis functions rbfs outperform others gong et al 2015 because kriging can simultaneously provide the predicted value and uncertainty of the prediction jones et al 1998 rbfs may be the best models for balancing performance and building difficulty and contain various alternative basis functions regis and shoemaker 2004 thus we employ kriging in the improvement of surrogate criterion and rbfs in the dominance and decomposition based optimization criterion for the proposed algorithm 2 3 1 radial basis functions radial basis functions rbfs have broad applications in data classification data mining and function approximation using a weighted sum of basis functions to build a potential mapping between inputs and outputs if given n t training inputs s t x t 1 x t 2 x t n and their corresponding outputs f t f t 1 f t 2 f t n 4 f x i 1 n t λ i φ x x t i p x where λ i is the weighted coefficients of each basis function φ is the basis function also called kernel function kernel p m r d is the linear space of m degree polynomials and the value of m is determined by the use of the radial basis function listed in table 1 the usage of radial basis function φ may affect the performance of an rbf therefore the adaptive switch technique will be introduced for reasonably using them in section 2 3 3 there are some commonly used radial basis functions listed in table 1 in which the parameter r denotes the euclidean distance between x and the training inputs s t n denotes the dimensions of the problems and the constant γ can be specified by the user γ 1 in this paper the polynomials p x can be described as 5 p x i 1 m h i q i x where m is the dimension of m r d m m d d h i is the weighted coefficient and q i x is the basis for m r d coefficients λ and h can be solved by solving the following linear system 6 φ p p 0 λ h f 0 where the size of φ is n t n t φ ij φ x i x j the sub matrix p is defined in eq 5 2 3 2 kriging kriging also called the gaussian process is frequently applied in evolutionary algorithms due to its strong approximated ability if given n t training inputs the original model function f x can be expressed as 7 f x y μ ε x where μ is a regression model or a constant value is normally distributed with mean zero and variance σ 2 i e x n 0 σ 2 the covariance of the ε x can be obtained by 8 c o v ε x i ε x j σ 2 r r x i x j where x i and x j are any two arbitrary inputs from n t given exact data r is the correlation matrix the size of r corresponds to the size of training inputs n t the sub element r ij of r can be described by 9 r x i x j exp k 1 n θ i x k i x k j 2 where θ i is the hyperparameter the size of θ is equal to the dimension of design variables to get the hyperparameters μ and θ we can maximize the below likelihood function 10 p y x θ μ 1 2 π σ 2 n t 2 det r exp y μ 1 r 1 y μ 1 2 σ 2 where x is the input matrix y is the output matrix corresponding to x r denotes the correlation matrix after solving μ and θ from the likelihood function the predicted value f x and variance v x can be expressed 11 f x y μ r r 1 y 1 μ v x s 2 σ 2 1 r r 1 r 1 1 r 1 r 1 r 1 1 where 12 μ 1 1 t r 1 y 2 1 t r 1 1 σ 2 y 1 μ t r 1 y 1 μ n t 2 3 3 adaptive switching technique some reviews indicate that one surrogate model may be the model which gets the smallest predicted error for the objective landscape generated by a certain numerical model but this surrogate may not be suited for any other landscapes deb et al 2021 xing et al 2019 since the performance of surrogate models can be influenced by two factors a self characteristics of the simulation model b the accumulated exact data during the optimization process especially when approximating some complex landscapes the static surrogate model cannot perform best during the process thereby we propose an adaptive switching technique ast for surrogates with radial basis functions rbfs as fig 1 depicts at the beginning of the iterative epoch the adaptive switching technique adopts a greedy strategy to switch the most suitable models using the value error metric vem which is a performance metric to evaluate the error between predicted and real value the k fold cross validation is applied to evaluate the value error metric vem for rbfs if given a set d d x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n the d will be divided into k c n k pairs of sets q t q q 1 q 2 q k t t 1 t 2 t k for any pairs of sets q i t i we use set q i to train surrogate model and evaluate the accumulated error between the predicted value by the surrogate model and the real value from t i and the function e q t is defined to represent above process thus the vem of the surrogate model can be evaluated by 13 vem i 1 k e q i t i in the adaptive switching technique there are two alternative ways to select the winner from the five types of rbfs the one is to choose the surrogate model with the smallest value of vem directly another approach is to use the inversion of the value of vem as the selection probability to avoid being stuck in always using the same rbf all the process this paper uses the latter approach 2 4 the used sampling criteria from fig 1 we can see that sampling criteria guide the optimization orientation of an algorithm to improve the performance of the algorithm this paper integrates three sampling criteria for mesoa a the dominance based sampling criterion b the decomposition based sampling criterion c the improvement of surrogate criterion two former criteria aim to ensure the diversity and convergence of the pareto front while the latter devotes to improving the quality of the updated surrogate model for the next iterative 2 4 1 the dominance based sampling criterion the dominance based sampling criterion is derived from the optimization framework of nsga ii deb et al 2002 and nsga iii deb and jain 2013 the only difference is to employ surrogate models to replace the simulation model the surrogate based optimization problem solved by nsga ii or nsga iii can be described by 14 minimize f x f 1 x f 2 x f m x subject to x lb ub n s g a i i n s g a i i i p d o m where f i is the built surrogate model for the ith objective function p d o m is a set that saves the promising solutions from this criterion this paper uses nsga ii in bi objective problems and nsga iii in many objective problems 2 4 2 the decomposition based sampling criterion the decomposition based sampling criterion employs rvea cheng et al 2016 and rbfs to find satisfactory solutions unlike the dominance based optimization framework rvea will convert the multiobjective optimization problem into serval sub single optimization problems with h reference vectors generated by das and dennis s method therefore we define some achievement scalarization aggregation functions a s f x w to represent single objective problems the single objective optimization problems can be expressed by 15 minimize asf x w for w w subject to x lb ub rvea p d e c where w is the set of all reference vectors set p d e c is used to save potential solutions of the pareto front from this criterion 2 4 3 the improvement of surrogate criterion the criterion this paper used is proposed in zhan s paper zhan et al 2017 which has shown its superiority in improving the prediction quality of the surrogate model the ei metrics in single objective problems jones et al 1998 are expanded into a 2 d expected improvement matrix named eim the eim is 16 ei 1 1 x ei 1 2 x ei 1 m x ei 2 1 x ei 2 2 x ei 2 m x ei n 1 x ei n 2 x ei n m x where ei n m denotes the sub ei metric for the m th objective of the n th individuals m is the number of objective functions n is the size of evolutionary population for eim we use the following equation to select promising solutions 17 eim x min i 1 n max j 1 m ei i j x the genetic algorithm ga is applied to find optimal solutions based on eq 17 in addition the use of p i m p saves the solutions from this criterion 2 5 population filter since expensive cost simulation takes up most time consumed by the algorithm we should carefully select the proposed solutions from the above criteria we use a metric called ehv to further filter candidate solutions from set p p p dom p dec p imp 18 ehv i hv a x i hv a where a denotes the data archive that stores all exact data hv is the function that represents the hypervolume of non dominated solutions from the data archive a zitzler and thiele 1999 from eq 18 and fig 2 we can conclude that the ehv metric denotes the enhancement of hv if adding the new solution x i into the data archive a top n f solutions from set p based on ehv metric will be finally chosen 3 case study this section conducts a series of cases to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm mesoa on groundwater optimization designs before directly applying mesoa to practical groundwater problems some representative benchmark experiments are presented at first which have three merits a we can test the proposed algorithm in various landscapes including continuous non continuous convex non convex and having many local optima by abundant benchmark functions b every benchmark function has specific formulas and the pareto front c benchmark functions are easy and cheap to get the values of all objectives so as to carry out much statistical analysis 3 1 benchmark cases 3 1 1 benchmark functions and performance metric zdt instances bi objective optimization problems and dtlz instances three objective optimization problems are common benchmark cases for testing algorithms employed in this paper table 2 lists the used benchmark functions selected from zdt and dtlz instances this paper uses the inverted generational distance igd coello and sierra 2004 to provide an overall assessment of the pareto front obtained by the algorithm the value of igd can synthetically represent the diversity and convergence of non dominated solutions obtained if the true pareto front is known let set p be a set of well distributed solutions along the true pareto front in the objective space and set q be the proposed non dominated solutions in the objective space by the algorithm then igd is defined as the average distance from each point from p to q as eq 19 and fig 3 demonstrate 19 igd p q v p dist v q p where p is the size of p d i s t v q denotes the minimum euclidean distance of points v v p and set q therefore to obtain a low i g d p q the solutions of q in objective space must be well distributed and close to the true pareto front table 2 lists the number of used reference points for each benchmark case 3 1 2 comparable algorithms and parameter settings we compare the mesoa with three surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms moea d ego zhang et al 2009 k rvea chugh et al 2016 and parego knowles 2006 the results of three traditional evolutionary algorithms are also given to show the superiority of surrogate based algorithms to create a fair comparison environment all algorithms are implemented by platemo an efficient software platform tian et al 2017 in this experiment the population size of all algorithms is set to n i 10 m m is the number of objectives for user defined parameters the size of the evolutionary population or reference vectors is set to 200 the maximum number of surrogate assisted fitness approximations before updating the surrogate is set to 20 000 for special parameters of mesoa the selected number by the population filter n f is set to 15 moreover we adopt recommended values for special parameters of the compared algorithms in their original literature each algorithm independently runs 20 times for each benchmark case on platemo of matlab r2020b equipped with intel coretm i7 7700 cpu 3 60 ghz processor and 16 0 gb ram 3 1 3 experiment results the statistical results of igd are collected in table 3 wilcoxon rank sum test approach α 0 05 is used derrac et al 2011 where and indicate that mesoa is either superior or inferior to the compared algorithms indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between mesoa and the compared algorithms furthermore the visualization of experimental results is intuitively given in three forms fig 4 shows the statistical results by box plot fig 5 presents the selected basis functions during the whole optimization process of a certain case fig 6 illustrates some representative results of mesoa to display final non dominated points presented by each criterion in the objective space according to table 3 and fig 4 surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms saeas outperform traditional evolutionary algorithms implying that saeas can obtain promising solutions with limited numbers of function executions furthermore among the four saeas mesoa shows the best performance which gets 24 bold highlights in table 3 zdt1 instance is the simplest case among six benchmark cases which is easy for all surrogate models to approximate thus zdt1 is suitable for testing the ability of sampling criteria to capture the whole shape of the pareto front table 3 figures out that mesoa obtains several orders of magnitude better values than other algorithms the main reason may be the cooperation of the proposed novel criteria in this work from fig 6 1 we can conclude that the decomposition based criterion is more appropriate for zdt1 to our knowledge zdt3 and zdt6 contain more complex landscapes table 2 shows that zdt3 has the discontinuous pareto front and zdt6 has many local optima thus zdt3 and zdt6 require the close cooperation of sampling criteria and surrogate modeling mesoa gets the best performance in zdt3 and zdt6 we collect the selected type of radial basis functions listed in table 1 when constructing rbf for each cycle in zdt3 and zdt6 as fig 5 shows fig 5 indicates that almost all radial basis functions have been applied from fig 6 2 we observe that the number of non dominated solutions obtained from the dominance and decomposition based criteria are equal these results indicate that adaptive surrogate models and multiple criteria show more advantages than using a single surrogate and a single criterion for three objective cases mesoa still obtains significantly better results than other algorithms from fig 4 3 and 4 other saeas except mesoa get worse results than traditional evolutionary algorithms the reason may be that using a sole surrogate model cannot approximate these problems well with increasing dimensions and objectives however due to the adaptive switching technique mesoa overcomes these difficulties table 2 indicates that dtlz7 has the discontinuous pareto front which is a big challenge for optimization algorithms however from fig 6 6 the non dominated solutions obtained by mesoa within only 200 function evaluations roughly cover the whole pareto front in the objective space from the above detailed study the significantly better performance of mesoa on all benchmark cases indicates the superiority of the adaptive switching technique and three sampling criteria equipped with the population filter 3 2 practical groundwater cases as we know the optimization problems of groundwater usually resort to complex and computationally expensive models to evaluate the effects of input decisions on the groundwater system thus some researchers employ various surrogate techniques to reduce the requirement to invoke simulations this section will investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm on groundwater optimization designs by certain groundwater remediation and requirement optimization problems 3 2 1 case study 1 simple groundwater remediation problem in this case we consider a hypothetical confined aquifer 170 m 510 m where the contaminant has been dispersed for ten years at the location x 155 m y 85 m fig 7 1 illustrates the shape of the contaminant plume with a peak concentration of 100 g m 3 as fig 7 2 displays the aquifer domain is discretized using 867 rectangle grids and the size of each grid is 10 m 10 m the aquifer has the specified head and constant concentration on the left h l 45 m c l 0 g m 3 and right h r 42 m c r 0 g m 3 boundaries and no flow on the other sides table 4 sets out the basic hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer for removing contaminants and repairing groundwater in the next 12 years there exist three pumping wells at x 205 m y 85 m x 305 m y 85 m and x 405 m y 85 m so as to pump and treat contaminated water in this case the location of wells and remediation time are presumed fixed while the pumping rate of each well during each stress period is changeable the number of unknown decision variables is 6 or 12 3 wells s stress periods decided by s 2 4 and the maximum of simulation executions fe max is set to 200 the timestep of simulation is set to 1 2 day and the average runtime of a single simulation is about 20 s we design two bi objective problems at first represented by problem a and problem b as table 5 shows since the true pareto front is unknown i e igd is unavailable we use two other performance metrics hypervolume hv and c metric zitzler et al 2000 to compare the algorithms eq 20 shows the mathematical description of hv 20 hv r δ i 1 r v i where set r denotes non dominated solutions set δ denotes the lebesgue measure to calculate volume v i is the hypervolume of the ideal points and the i th non dominated solution from r a higher value of the hv indicates better obtained solutions c metric usually represents the dominated ratio of the set from algorithm a by the set from algorithm b 21 c a b u b v a v dominates u b a higher value of the c metric denotes that algorithm a is better than algorithm b we set up four scenarios for all comparable algorithms for brevity each scenario is constituted of a digit and a letter for example 6 b means the scenario that uses problem b as the optimization problem containing six unknown variables 3 w e l l s 2 s t r e s s p e r i o d s each algorithm runs ten times on each scenario for statistical analysis table 6 summarizes the statistical results of hv obtained by all comparable algorithms and the wilcoxon rank sum test α 0 05 is used table 7 provides the c metric of mesoa and other algorithms note that we use the fraction form to present the specific number of solutions of other algorithms dominated by mesoa for example in the scenarios 6 a of parego and mesoa 20 39 denotes that 20 of the 39 solutions are dominated by the solutions of mesoa while 0 56 denotes that none of the solutions from mesoa can be dominated by that of parego therefore the mesoa outperforms parego in the scenario 6 a when conducting the comparison of mesoa with three other advanced saeas it is obvious that mesoa is the most suitable algorithm for addressing groundwater optimization problems we can observe from table 6 and table 7 that mesoa is superior to others in both performance and stability in four scenarios furthermore by increasing the decision variables of problems mesoa can get higher hv values but other algorithms cannot the finding also indicates that separating more stress periods can obtain better solutions when requiring the goal to reach a minor contaminant concentration however it demands the excellent cooperation of the surrogate modeling and sampling criteria as far as this case is concerned mesoa achieves satisfactory success in 6 and 12 dimensional optimization cases to further show the superiority of mesoa we use the results having medium hv from seven algorithms to display the solutions which cannot be dominated by the solutions of mesoa as fig 8 illustrates from fig 8 we can speculate that the true pareto front of the case is non convex and has a long tail which belongs to the typical and challenging problems for optimization algorithms surprisingly mesoa depicts a complete pareto front using obtained well distributed solutions nevertheless k rvea parego and moea d ego cannot get better solutions than mesoa at the large discharge region the reasons may be that k rvea parego and moea d ego consume large model evaluations and get too dense solutions at the local range as fig 8 shows mesoa still finds comparable solutions in the region of low discharge under fewer model evaluations overall these cases support the view that mesoa can get better converged and diversified solutions due to the adaptive switching technique and three sampling criteria with the population filter 3 2 2 case study 2 groundwater demand problem based on case 1 we assume 18 agricultural irrigation nozzles q 0 5 m 3 d a y for agriculture water requirements and the nozzles are near the monitor wells as fig 7 1 shows if the concentration of groundwater at monitor wells gathers than 0 03 g m 3 the corresponding locations of agricultural irrigation nozzles are unavailable the pumping rate of wells in the next 12 years is optimized to simultaneously minimize the pumping cost of wells minimize the average unavailable time of irrigation nozzles and maximize the removal effect of the contaminant the number of unknown decision variables is 6 or 12 3 wells s stress periods decided by s 2 4 the user setting of all algorithms is the same as in case 1 for three objective optimization problems the simulation executions fe max is set to 300 to outline the whole pareto front the mathematical expression for this case can be described by 22 minimize f 1 t year m 1 t 1 g x m t t year t steps f 2 max m c x m s f 3 n 1 n s 1 s q x n s n s subject to x q min q max n s where 23 g x m t timestep i f c x m t c limited 0 i f c x m t c limited in eq 23 g x m t denotes a decision function for the enablement of agricultural irrigation nozzles the timestep of g x m t is set to 1 2 days c limited denotes the threshold concentration to use nozzles c max 0 03 g m 3 t steps is the total steps of the simulation for this case t steps 8760 t year is the practical simulation duration t year 12 thereby the maximum of f 1 is 12 and the minimum value is 0 other parameters are the same as in case 1 the hv and c metric like the usage of case1 are used to quantify the performance of each algorithm table 8 and table 9 provide the results of hv and c metric obtained by seven compared algorithms for three objective problems mesoa still performs best among seven algorithms for standard deviations in table 8 it is obvious that saeas are more stable than three traditional evolutionary algorithms the main reason is that using surrogate models can identify the region of non dominated solutions furthermore mesoa obtains the minimum standard deviations as we know other algorithms determine static surrogate models to approximate various landscapes before a run in contrast mesoa applies the adaptive switching technique ast to reuse known data and dynamically choose the best performance radial basis function of rbfs the results powerfully prove that the adaptive switching technique ast can keep the stability of mesoa fig 9 shows all non dominated solutions of mesoa and other solutions which mesoa cannot dominate based on fig 9 we can infer that the true pareto front of this case is an irregular long and thin continuous surface it can test the ability of algorithms to trade off exploitation and exploration fig 9 and table 9 figure out that parego krvea and moea d ego overly exploit the local region and rarely explore the global region however mesoa applying ast and three sampling criteria depicts the complete pareto front mesoa effectively reaches a balanced status in exploitation and exploration thus the presented results support the idea that mesoa can obtain significantly better results than other algorithms in three objective groundwater optimization problems 3 2 3 case study 3 complex groundwater remediation problem case 3 is about remediation of the confined aquifer based on the three dimensional simulation referred from chapter 7 of the mt3dms manual zheng and wang 1999 as fig 10 1 illustrates the simulated aquifer consists of two fine medium sand layers and two medium coarse sand layers each layer is comprised of 61 rows and 40 columns with variable row and column widths the refined grids exist near the detailed study site containing the bulk of the contaminant plume depicted by abcd in fig 10 1 the initial plume displayed in fig 10 1 is at layer 3 and we use a ratio coefficient to initialize the plume for other layers 0 2 for layer 2 and 0 for layers 1 and 4 outside the refined grid area the lengths and widths of cells progressively increase toward the model boundary specified head boundaries are used on all four sides fig 10 2 shows the initial groundwater table of the research region table 10 presents other parameters for cases a run for simulation requires an average of 2 5 min for removal of the contaminant in the next 1000 days eight wells are distributed in the abcd region the water intake of wells are located at layer 3 and q max is 3000 m 3 d a y this case aims to minimize the cost of the complete remediation and concurrently minimize the maximum concentration of the contaminant after remediation by optimizing the pumping discharge of wells the unknown decision variables are 8 or 16 splitting 1 or 2 stress periods of 1000 days s 1 2 the simulation executions fe max are set to 300 since the search space is huger than the former two cases note that the optimization needs to take up 12 5 h for each algorithm at one time preceding studies have proved that surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms outperform traditional evolutionary algorithms thereby only four surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms are compared in this case table 11 presents the statistical results of hv and c metrics mesoa performs best in these cases furthermore fig 11 illustrates the box plot for the hv metric of each algorithm when addressing an 8 dimensional case one stress period mesoa parego and krvea do better at the stable however for a 16 dimensional case it should be mentioned that only mesoa keeps the stability from fig 12 and table 11 the non dominated solutions obtained by mesoa are characterized by high diversity and stability and other algorithms pay more attention to the local region further analysis in complex cases reports that mesoa shows stronger approximated and searching ability in complex three dimensional groundwater cases by the adaptive switching technique and three sampling criteria with the novel population filter 4 conclusion this paper proposes a multiobjective ensemble surrogate based optimization algorithm named mesoa for groundwater simulation optimization problems rbfs with multiple radial basis functions and kriging are used to approximate numerical models to avoid a huge computation burden besides the adaptive switching technique ast can fully reuse known data to construct the best performance surrogate model for each objective three sampling criteria and a novel population filter cooperatively select promising solutions to balance exploitation versus exploration and improve the quality of surrogate models to investigate the performance of mesoa eight benchmark functions in 5 8 15 dimensions are employed at first the experimental results prove that surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms saeas are significantly better than traditional evolutionary algorithms furthermore mesoa obtains the best results among the four saeas afterward three groundwater cases about groundwater remediation or water requirement optimization problems in two or three objectives are used all empirical results indicate that mesoa gets the top one in performance and stability and depicts the well distributed and converged pareto front of various cases after detailed research we conclude that mesoa due to these proposed techniques shows more efficiency and universality in groundwater simulation optimization problems than other algorithms in future

3093,water quality wq data are essential for water resources as well as wq management however due to limited fiscal resources in many cases historical wq data may not be available for the watershed s of interest recently few artificial intelligent and parametric statistical approaches were proposed for the estimation of wq characteristics at ungauged watersheds in this study the main goal was to develop nonparametric statistical approaches for the estimation of the three main quartiles of different wq indicators in ungauged watersheds using watershed attributes as predictors four nonparametric approaches were based on the region of influence roi and theil sen nonparametric multiple regression tsmr the roi was used to identify watersheds similar to the ungauged watershed and tsmr was calibrated and validated to estimate wq quartiles in ungauged watersheds the main proposed approach combined the roi and tsmr in the second approach the spearman correlation analysis was introduced as a filter to identify watershed attributes that are highly correlated with the wq quartile to improve the roi performance co roi tsmr in the third approach a step forward selection technique was integrated with the tsmr to facilitate the selection of the model predictors watershed attributes roi sf tsmr in the fourth approach both the co roi and sf tsmr were used co roi sf tsmr the four nonparametric statistical approaches were calibrated and validated to estimate the three main quartiles for three different wq indicators using data from 50 watersheds in the nile delta egypt a jackknife validation procedure was applied to evaluate the performance of the four approaches the results indicated that the co roi sf tsmr approach outperformed the three other approaches keywords water quality nonparametric statistics ungauged sites nile delta water quality monitoring 1 introduction water quality wq and quantity data are essential for water resources management in general and wq management in particular khalil and ouarda 2009 water quality monitoring wqm is a principal component in wq management behmel et al 2016 ccme 2015 macdonald et al 2009 which helps to understand complex and dynamic wq processes and provides water managers with detailed information for sustainable wq management ccme 2015 khalil et al 2011a khalil and ouarda 2009 wqm program designing involves clarifying the monitoring objectives and information required why monitor the design of the wqm network what to monitor wq indicators and where to monitor sampling sites when to monitor sampling frequency and how to monitor which includes designing sampling protocols ensuring sufficient sampling equipment selecting appropriate laboratory analysis designing data verification processes designing data analysis protocols and reporting and information dissemination processes ccme 2006 wqm programs should be carefully designed and integrated in decision making chen et al 2012 robarts et al 2008 and their design should be evaluated periodically to respond to new information requirements environmental issues and or budgetary conditions ccme 2015 common wqm objectives and wq data uses include assessment of the wq conditions and trends assessment of the natural and anthropogenic influences on wq processes assessment of the levels of wq compliance with standards calibration and validation of wq models computation of wq indices and evaluation of the efficiency of environmental control measures khalil et al 2019 ccme 2015 harmancioglu and alpaslan 1992 typically detailed wq information is derived from wq data produced in gauged watersheds although wqm is a costly mission wqm program establishment and operation expenses are relatively small compared with the value of the water resource under monitoring or the health social and financial benefits associated with maintaining wq ccme 2015 however limited fiscal resources may require reducing the size of sampling sites jiang et al 2020 a literature review carried out by nguyen et al 2019 showed that among 50 assessment and redesign studies applied worldwide 25 studies recommended reducing the number of sampling sites while only 12 recommended increasing the number of sampling sites thus in many cases historical wq data may not be available for the watersheds of interest khalil et al 2019 khalil et al 2011a using numerical models such as mike11 wasp and hspf to recover wq information at ungauged sites may not always be possible due to the numerous types of data and extensive time required to calibrate and validate such models which limit conceptual models to small catchments keupers and willems 2017 khalil et al 2015 lobuglio et al 2007 bowen and hieronymus 2003 although the target ungauged watershed attribute data may be available they are simply ungauged and consequently there are no wq data available for the calibration and validation of the numerical models very limited research has been conducted in the estimation of wq data or information in ungauged watersheds rothwell et al 2010 proposed stepwise linear regression swlr models to estimate the mean value for different wq variables in northwestern england using catchment attributes as predictors different swlr models were calibrated to estimate mean values for ph calcium ca magnesium mg nitrate n no3 orthophosphate p po4 and suspended solids ss using 26 catchment attributes as predictors watershed attributes considered include catchment physical attributes as well as land cover meteorological groundwater recharge and bedrock geological attributes the results showed that ca and mg were influenced more by the land cover and catchment physical attributes while the estimation of ph relied more on the bedrock geology and land cover attributes however the swlr model for the estimation of po4 did not show good results which may be attributed to the absence of significant attributes that represent po4 processes or to the nonlinear nature of the relationship that cannot be represented accurately by a linear model e g swlr khalil et al 2011b proposed artificial neural network ann ensemble ann eann and canonical correlation analysis cca eann cca eann models for the estimation of the mean values of different wq variables at ungauged sites in the nile delta using watershed attributes as predictors the ann and eann were developed to calibrate and validate the relationship between watershed attributes and mean wq values for the cca eann models cca was applied using wq data and watershed attributes to create canonical attribute variates and the eann was then developed to model the relationship between the canonical attribute variates as predictors and mean wq values the results showed that the cca eann model provided more accurate and precise estimation than the ann and eann models tsang et al 2011 proposed region of influence swlr roi swlr models for the estimation of macroinvertebrates taxon assemblage in ungauged streams in maryland usa using 21 different catchment attributes tsang et al 2011 successfully adapted the roi concept from hydrology and developed a new datum roi nroi for the estimation of taxon assemblages in ungauged watersheds the proposed model in maryland showed better performance than the commonly used rivpacs models this study confirmed that introducing the roi approach to use only in similar watersheds has the advantage of improving model accuracy and precision more recently khalil et al 2019 proposed a cca stepwise nonlinear regression cca swnlr for the estimation of the mean value 25th percentile and 75th percentile for different wq variables electric conductivity ec sodium na and iron fe at ungauged sites in the nile delta using watershed attributes as predictors khalil et al 2019 successfully adapted the cca based neighborhood approach proposed for regional flood frequency analysis for the estimation of wq characteristics in ungauged watersheds for a target ungauged watershed the cca neighborhood approach was applied to identify similar gauged watersheds and then swnlr models were calibrated using only data from the set of similar watersheds identified by the cca the results showed that the implemented cca neighborhood approach significantly improved the accuracy and precision of the swnlr models alnahit et al 2022 proposed random forest rf and boosted regression tree brt models for the estimation of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and turbidity tur in ungauged streams in southeast atlantic region of the usa using climate and watersheds attributes the proposed model random forest rf results outperform the boosted regression tree brt results this study proved the idea of the positive correlation between the tn tp and the percentage of the cropping and urbanization wq data are characterized by the presence of missing values outliers censored records and deviation from normality which may affect or make it difficult to fulfill statistical assumptions required by parametric techniques in addition the wq data available may not be sufficient to accurately fit the appropriate statistical distribution khalil et al 2019 moreover the presence of outliers and missing values as well as the limited size of wq data may also affect or make it difficult to apply artificial intelligence techniques on the other hand nonparametric techniques are much easier to apply have distribution free assumptions and are more appropriate for the presence of outliers censored data missing values and limited wq data in this study a nonparametric statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of the three main quartiles of different wq variables in ungauged watersheds using watershed attributes as predictors the three quartiles are the lower quartile q1 25th percentile the median q2 50th percentile and the upper quartile q3 75th percentiles the three quartiles can provide an indication about the central tendency q2 the median dispersion q3 q1 interquartile range iqr coefficient of variation iqr 2 q2 and skewness q3 q2 vs q2 q1 data are positively skewed if q3 q2 q2 q1 and negatively skewed if q3 q2 q2 q1 2 methodology the proposed nonparametric approach consists of three main steps the first step is to estimate the target wq quartiles in gauged watersheds the second step consists of applying the region of influence roi approach for each ungauged watershed to identify similar gauged watersheds the third step is to calibrate and validate the theil sen multiple regression tsmr technique to estimate wq quartiles in ungauged watersheds fig 1 2 1 estimation of wq characteristics at gauged sites many researchers have recommended the use of quantile unbiased plotting positions for the construction of probability plots e g shabri 2002 where the weibull formula is the simplest formula stedinger et al 1993 cunnane 1978 1 p i i n 1 where p i is the plotting probability of the i th order statistic and n is the sample size size of wq records available in a gauged watershed many other plotting position formulas have been proposed which can be expressed in a general form as follows stedinger et al 1993 cunnane 1978 2 p i i a n 1 2 a where a is a plotting position parameter that allows approximate unbiased plotting positions for different distributions table 1 shows different plotting position parameters the associated formula and statistical distributions for instance for a 0 the general formula becomes the weibull formula while a 0 5 is the hazen 1914 formula to identify the ideal formula for wq data an experimental study was conducted to compare the estimation of the three desired percentiles 25th 50th and 75th percentiles for two different wq variables using each of the six plotting position formulas it was assumed that the estimation of the three percentiles at gauged sites using any of the six formulas should provide similar results the differences in the plotting position parameter affect the estimation of extreme percentiles e g 5th 95th and 99th more than the interquartile range the results shown in table 2 confirm that using any of the provided plotting position formulas provides similar results for the three desired percentiles except for the weibull formula the five other formulas provided almost identical results for the estimation of the three desired percentiles in this study the cunnane a 0 4 formula was adopted based on the results presented in table 2 which confirm that the estimations of the three percentiles are similar using any of the six formulas table 2 in addition cunnane s formula is a compromise formula for all distributions table 1 and is typically used by different institutions e g environment canada the city of calgary amec 2014 it should be emphasized that the availability of representative wq data is much more important than the selection of the plotting position formula representative wq data is fundamental to estimate the target wq percentile as accurate as possible 2 2 region of influence roi approach the region of influence approach proposed by burn 1990 was adopted in this study to identify gauged watersheds that can be considered similar to a target ungauged watershed the approach consists of two steps in the first step the euclidean distance between a target ungauged watershed and each of the gauged watersheds is calculated in the second step a threshold is applied to identify gauged watersheds within the roi in the first step the euclidean distance is computed using standardized watershed attributes to avoid any scale or dimension influences the euclidean distance in k dimension space k is the size of watershed attributes can be computed as follows d ij k 1 k x k i x k j 2 1 2 where d i j is the euclidean distance between station i and station j x k i is the value of watershed attribute k for station i and x k j is the value of watershed attribute k for station j the euclidean distances between a target ungauged watershed and all gauged watersheds are then ranked in ascending order the smallest distance is associated with the most similar gauged watershed while the largest distance is associated with the least similar watershed the threshold value is the distance value below which any gauged watershed will be considered inside the roi for the ungauged watershed the roi stations for a target ungauged watershed can be identified as follows 4 n i j d ij d t where n i is the group of watersheds in the roi for a target ungauged watershed i and d t is the threshold value for the target ungauged watershed i 5 targetthresholdvalue d t d l n s i n s t where d l is a lower threshold value corresponding to the minimum size of watersheds within the roi for ungauged watershed i nsi is the size of watersheds corresponding to the use of the d l and nst is the minimum size required for gauged watersheds in the roi the nst and d l are first defined if the threshold d l provides a size of gauged watersheds that is less than the desired nst a modified threshold d u is then applied as follows 6 targetthresholdvalue d t d l d u d l n s t nsi nst n s i n s t the selection of nst is mainly based on the technique of applying for information transfer e g statistical technical and artificial intelligence techniques as well as the size of gauged watersheds available the threshold values d l and d u were selected based on chosen percentiles of ranked euclidean distances three preliminary trials roi 1 roi 2 and roi 3 were considered to identify the d l d u a n d n s t values roi 1 follows the parameters used by burn 1990 d l 25th percentile d u 75th percentile and nst one third of the available gauged watersheds 33 regarding roi 2 the parameters were 35th and 85th percentiles for d l and d u respectively and nst was half of the available gauged watersheds 50 for roi 3 the d l and d u values were assumed to be 35 and 100 percentiles respectively and nst was 50 preliminary analysis indicated that the roi size ranged from 16 to 28 when roi 1 criteria were applied and from 25 to 37 and from 30 to 44 for roi 2 and roi 3 respectively in this study given that the size of available gauged watersheds was 50 49 available for the cross validation process the nst was considered 25 50 of the gauged watersheds the best roi parameters were selected based on the rrmse and rbias output values of the theil sen multiple regression approach fig 2 shows the rrmse and rbias for the estimation of nh4 in three quartiles of the roi the best accuracy and precision were identified at roi 2 with assumed parameters d l d u values 35 and 85 percentiles and nst was 25 watersheds with rrmse 55 82 44 88 and 46 20 and rbias 8 08 8 64 and 3 41 for q1 q2 and q3 respectively 2 3 theil sen regression a rank based unbiased functional regression slope estimate was given by theil 1992 as the median of pairwise slopes of the observations sen 1968 refined this estimate to address the case of ties in the ranking for univariate regression dang et al 2009 extended the univariate theil sen estimator to multivariate regression in the kendall theil sen regression suppose a sample of n pairs of observations x i y i i 1 n were taken suppose a straight line given below was used as a best fit model to the given set of data 7 y i β 0 x i β 1 ε i i 1 n where x i represents the watershed attributes predictors y i represents wq quartiles dependent variable β 0 is the estimated y intercept β 1 is the estimated regression coefficient and ε i are random errors the regression coefficient β 1 can be estimated by the median of all pairwise slopes between each pair of points in the given dataset for each regression coefficient passing through x i y i and x j y j the data point can be estimated by 8 β 1 m e d i a n y i y j x i x j x i x j 1 i j n the y intercept of the line can be estimated by the equation 9 β 0 y β 1 x where β 0 is the estimated y intercept y is the median of the dependent variable β 1 is the estimated slope and x is the median of the predictor variable in the case of multiple linear regression dang et al 2009 extended the kendall theil sen regression approach from a simple linear regression to a multiple linear regression with p independent predictors using the multivariate median first an estimator of θ β 0 β 1 t t can be found as the solution to the p 1 equations 10 y i β 0 x i t β 1 i k p 1 i 1 i p 1 where k p 1 is a p 1 subset of 1 n such that p 1 p 1 matrix x k k k p 1 is invertible and the estimator is denoted by θ k p 1 11 θ n m m e d θ k p 1 k p 1 θ k p 1 is the least square estimator of θ based on p 1 observations where p 1 m n may be chosen to construct a least square estimator θ km then a multiple theil sen estimator θ n of parameter θ is defined to be the multivariate median of all possible least square estimators 12 θ n m m e d θ km k m slop estimators were calculated for all pairwise sets of observations in the data and the theil sen estimator was taken as the slope the median of all these slopes and the y intercept were obtained by taking the median of all the differences nevitt and tam 1998 2 4 statistical approaches given the size of watershed attributes that can be available khalil et al 2019 13 watershed attributes rothwell et al 2010 26 watershed attributes some of these attributes may be irrelevant to the wq variable to estimate including these irrelevant attributes may add noise to the approach and consequently reduce estimation precision and accuracy thus two filters were added to the main approach spearman correlation analysis and a step forward selection technique these two steps were included as filters to identify relevant attributes for each wq variable spearman correlation analysis between wq quartiles and watershed attributes was applied to filter out or disregard predictors that showed no or weak correlation with the target wq quartiles attributes that showed a correlation coefficient less than an absolute value 0 1 were disregarded thus the proposed approach including the roi and tsmr can be applied using only relevant attributes in addition to facilitate tsmr calibration and validation the step forward selection sf approach was integrated the approach was calibrated using only watershed attributes and the attribute that provided the least rmse value was chosen and the process was repeated to select the 2nd best attribute by calibrating the tsmr using two attributes the best one was selected examining each of the remaining attributes the second attribute to include was the attribute that provided the lowest rmse and so on for the 3rd and 4th attributes until there was no improvement in the approach s precision to evaluate the effect of the correlation analysis co filter step as well as the sf selection component four statistical approaches were evaluated to estimate wq quartiles table 3 the four approaches included the basic proposed approach roi tsmr the basic approach with sf tsmr sf tsmr instead of a complete tsmr approach roi sf tsmr the co roi tsmr which applies the co filter and the co roi sf tsmr which includes both filters as shown in fig 3 2 5 evaluation procedures the jack knife procedure was applied to evaluate the proposed approach by considering each of the gauged watersheds in turn as a target ungauged watershed and using the remaining 49 watersheds to apply the proposed approaches four performance measures were considered in this study the root mean square error rmse relative rmse rrmse bias and relative bias rbias as follows 13 rmse 1 z i 1 z y i y i 2 1 2 rrmse 1 z i 1 z y i y i y i 2 1 2 15 bias 1 z i 1 z y i y i rbias 1 z i 1 z y i y i y i where z is the total number of watersheds and y i and y i for i 1 z are the observed and estimated wq quartile values respectively 3 study area and available data in this study the proposed approaches were applied and evaluated for the nile delta region in egypt the nile delta total area is approximately 40 000 km2 radwan et al 2019 agriculture is the main activity in the nile delta with scattered industrial activities and residential areas the nile delta drainage system consists of 22 main drains drainage systems serving 94 drainage watersheds fig 4 a drainage watershed is served by a branch drain that delivers flow to the main drains out of these 94 drainage watersheds only 50 were gauged and 33 wq parameters were measured on a monthly basis from august 1997 to may 2010 in this study nitrates no3 ammonium nh4 and total phosphorus tp measured in the 50 gauged watersheds were considered the mann kendall hypothesis test was applied to assess trends in wq variables where the results indicated that the numbers of watersheds that had significant trends in no3 nh4 and tp were 50 22 and 17 watersheds respectively for example the probability of accepting the null hypothesis that there is no trend p value for watershed eh 09 was 3 445e 06 0 399 and 0 692 for no3 nh4 and tp respectively thirteen watershed attribute datasets were used in this study to represent different watershed characteristics and main activities table 4 these 13 attributes include urban area ha cultivated area ha average soil salinity ppm average soil hydraulic conductivity m day average total annual rainfall mm year drain total lengths m irrigation canal total lengths m industrial effluent m3 day number of factories total capacity of waste water treatment plants wwtp m3 day number of wwtp livestock and total annual fertilizers applied information about the quality of the industrial effluents and wwtp effluents is not available thus analyses relying on the total capacity of wwtps and average industrial waste effluents were used instead 4 results 4 1 estimation of wq characteristics at gauged sites for the estimation of wq quartiles at gauged sites the cunnane formula was applied fig 5 shows the time series and cunnane plot position results for the nh4 and tp measured in watershed no eh 09 based on the cunnane plot position results in fig 5 one can identify different non exceedance percentiles as shown in table 5 table 5 also shows the three desired wq quartiles for the no3 nh4 and tp where q1 was 1 148 0 913 and 0 354 respectively the median q2 was 3 374 1 680 and 0 460 respectively and the upper quartile q3 was 13 374 4 391 and 0 655 respectively similarly the three selected quartiles were identified for each of the selected wq variables in each of the 50 gauged watersheds 4 2 roi results the roi approach was applied either using all available watershed attributes in approaches 1 and 2 roi tsr and roi sf tsr respectively table 3 or after applying the correlation filter using only relevant watershed attributes as in approaches 3 and 4 co roi tsr and co roi sf tsr respectively the roi approach for approaches 1 and 2 depended only on thirteen watershed attributes thus the roi was the same for the assumed ungauged watershed the co roi approach for approaches 3 and 4 depended on both watershed attributes and wq data for selected variables and quartiles therefore every quartile had its own roi the results indicated that the number of similar watersheds within the roi increased in approaches 3 and 4 compared with approaches 1 and 2 in regard to nh4 q2 and q3 no3 q1 and q3 and tp q1 q2 and q3 and the number decreased in regard to identifying similar watersheds in nh4 q1 and no3 q2 thus one could say that the number of similar watersheds within the roi increased when using the correlation filter co roi for example the estimation of nh4 q1 q2 and q3 quartiles in assumed ungauged watershed eh 09 using all available attributes indicated that 13 watersheds were similar to the target ungauged watershed eh 09 fig 6 correlation analysis was applied between watershed attributes and nh4 q1 for gauged watersheds and the results showed that seven out of thirteen attributes showed no or weak correlation the selected attributes were soil salinity soil hydraulic conductivity average rainfall industrial effluent number of factories and number of wwtps these six attributes were used in the co roi procedure as well as in the estimation of nh4 q1 under theil sen multiple regression as shown in fig 7 the correlation analysis was repeated between watershed attributes and nh4 q2 the correlation results showed that three out of thirteen attributes showed no or weak correlation and the selected attributes were urban area cultivated area average soil hydraulic conductivity average rainfall drain lengths industrial effluent number of factories total capacity of wwtps livestock and total annual fertilizers the correlation analysis was repeated again between watershed attributes and nh4 q3 correlation results showed that six out of thirteen showed no or weak correlation and the selected attributes were cultivated area average soil hydraulic conductivity irrigation canal total lengths industrial effluent livestock and total annual fertilizers the co roi results for nh4 q1 q2 and q3 showed that the numbers of similar watersheds were 30 34 and 31 respectively as shown in figs 7 to 9 4 3 approach precision and accuracy the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure are presented in tables 6 to 10 rmse and rrmse indices provide an indication of approach prediction precision while the bias and rbias indices provide an indication of approach prediction accuracy and whether an approach tends to overestimate or underestimate the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for approaches roi tsr and co roi tsr are presented in table 6 the results showed that the co roi tsr approach was more precise than the roi tsr approach in the estimation of all wq variables except for no3 q2 and they were more similar in the estimation of nh4 q1 the accuracy suggests that both approaches overestimated all wq variables except in the estimation of no3 q3 in the roi tsr approach also the results showed that the co roi tsr approach was more accurate than the roi tsr approach in the estimation of no3 q1 q2 and q3 nh4 q1 and q2 and tp q1 for all wq quartiles however the roi tsr approach was more accurate than the co roi tsr approach in the estimation of tp q1 and q2 and nh4 q3 the estimation of relative error for nh4 no3 and tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 using the roi tsr and co roi tsr approaches are shown in figs 10 11 and 12 respectively fig 10 shows that co roi tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 27 28 and 28 respectively out of the 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 11 shows that co roi tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 25 31 and 30 respectively and fig 12 shows that co roi tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 26 27 and 31 respectively the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for approaches roi sf tsr and co roi sf tsr are presented in table 7 the results showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more precise than the roi sf tsr approach in the estimation of all wq variables the accuracy suggests that both approaches overestimated all wq variables except in the estimation of nh4 q1 in model co roi sf tsr and no3 q2 in both approaches also the results showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more accurate than the roi sf tsr approach except in the estimation of no3 q3 and the roi sf tsr approach was more accurate than the co roi sf tsr approach the estimation of relative error for nh4 no3 and tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 using the roi sf tsr and co roi sf tsr approaches are shown in figs 13 14 and 15 respectively fig 13 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 25 27 and 28 respectively out of the 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 14 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 23 30 and 30 respectively and fig 15 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 27 25 and 30 respectively to evaluate the contribution of adding a correlation filter a comparison between approaches with and without the co filter was conducted as shown in tables 6 and 7 and the results indicate that approaches with the co filter provided more precise and accurate results than approaches without the co filter the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for approaches roi tsr and roi sf tsr are presented in table 8 overall the roi sf tsr approach provided more precise results than the basic roi tsr approach for all wq variables the accuracy suggests that both approaches overestimated nh4 and tp quartiles except for the no3 q3 estimation in the roi tsr approach and the no3 q2 estimation in the roi sf tsr approach however the roi sf tsr approach was more accurate than the roi tsr model for the roi tsr and roi sf tsr approaches the estimated relative errors for nh4 no3 and tp for q1 q2 and q3 at each of the 50 watersheds are shown in figs 16 17 and 18 respectively fig 16 shows that roi sf tsr led to better results in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 36 32 and 32 respectively out of the 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 17 shows that roi sf tsr led to better results in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 38 30 and 27 respectively fig 18 shows that roi sf tsr led to better results in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 32 34 and 35 respectively table 8 also shows that the roi sf tsr approaches had more accurate results except for the estimation of the nh4 first quartile thus adding the step forward selection component to the tsr technique led to more precise estimations the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for approaches co roi tsr and co roi sf tsr are presented in table 9 the results showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more precise than the co roi tsr approach in the estimation of nh4 and tp and no3 q1 and q2 and they were more similar in the estimation of no3 q3 additionally the results showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more accurate than the co roi tsr approach in the estimation of tp for all wq quartiles however the co roi tsr approach was more accurate in the estimation of no3 q3 and nh4 q2 the estimation of relative error for the nh4 no3 and tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 using the co roi tsr and co roi sf tsr approaches are shown in figs 19 20 and 21 respectively fig 19 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 32 37 and 35 respectively out of 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 20 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 36 31 and 30 respectively and fig 21 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 29 28 and 33 respectively to evaluate the effect of using the step forward selection sf approach a comparison between approaches with and without the sf approach was conducted as shown in tables 8 and 9 and the results indicate that approaches with the step forward selection sf approach provided more precise and accurate results than approaches without the sf approach the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for the basic roi tsr and co roi sf tsr approaches are presented in table 10 the accuracy suggests that both approaches overestimated all wq variables except for estimation of no3 q3 in approach roi tsr and nh4 q1 and no3 q2 in approach co roi sf tsr the results also showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more accurate and precise than the roi tsr approach in estimation of all wq variables table 10 presents an evaluation of the effect of using the co filter as well as the step forward selection sf approach and the results indicated that the approach with both the co filter and step forward selection sf approaches provided more precise and accurate results than those approaches without both filters the estimation of relative error for nh4 no3 and tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 using the roi tsr and co roi sf tsr approaches are shown in figs 22 23 and 24 respectively fig 22 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 29 31 and 35 respectively out of 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 23 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 37 34 and 28 respectively and fig 24 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 30 31 and 37 respectively table 11 shows the regression equations and their performance indices in the estimation of the nh4 q1 q2 and q3 quartiles in the assumed ungauged watershed eh 09 results showed that some watersheds such as wt 01 and et 01 had estimation errors larger than all other watersheds watershed wt 01 is located on the northwestern part of the nile delta watershed no 41 in estimation error figures caused high estimation errors in the estimation of no3 and tp for all quartiles this extreme watershed included the highest industrial effluent 12 3561 m3 day and highest number of factories compared with all other watersheds in addition to the watershed location in a coastal area with expected high population densities another example watershed et 01 is located on the northeastern part of the nile delta watershed no 17 in estimation error figures caused high estimation errors in the estimation of nh4 and tp for all quartiles this extreme watershed included the highest fertilizers applied 31 047 36 ton year compared with all other watersheds the last watershed was watershed eb 38 located on the southern part of the nile delta watershed no 3 in estimation error figures which caused a high estimation error in the estimation of no3 and nh4 for all quartiles this extreme watershed included the highest wwtp effluent 1 415 000 m3 day and highest number of wwtps compared with all other watersheds in addition the watershed location was close to cairo the capital city with an expected high population density to overcome these large errors watersheds eb 38 wt 01 and et 01 were excluded from the study and calculations were carried out to evaluate and compare the performances of the approaches after excluding these three watersheds from the study the results indicated that precision and accuracy were improved in all four proposed approaches after excluding these three watersheds as shown in table 12 the results confirm that co roi sf tsr the complete approach was the most precise and accurate approach thus these three watersheds should be measured by control stations and could not be estimated by the proposed approaches 5 conclusion in this study four nonparametric approaches were applied in the estimation of water quality quartiles in ungauged watersheds the main approach consisted of two main components a region of influence approach and theil sen multiple regression approaches the roi approach was used to identify similar watersheds so that information was transferred from gauged to ungauged watersheds using theil sen multiple regression approaches theil sen multiple nonparametric regression approaches were used to establish the relationship between watershed attributes and selected water quality variables two filters were added to the main approach spearman correlation analysis and a step forward selection technique were included as filters to identify relevant attributes for each wq variable four approaches were integrated to evaluate the effects of the correlation analysis co filter step as well as the sf selection component the performance of the proposed approaches was evaluated using the jackknife validation method by calculating rmse rrmse bias and rbias the results showed that the approach with both co filter and step forward selection sf approaches provided more precise and accurate results than those approaches without both filters this study is the first to estimate water quality parameters using the roi approach under nonstationary conditions therefore future work should consider upgrading the roi approach to estimate wq parameters or introduce a comparison between roi and other methods for delineation of homogeneous regions in addition to the estimation of the detailed wq records in ungauged watersheds by constructing a concentration duration curve in ungauged watersheds then spatial interpolation can be applied to transfer information from gauged watersheds to completely ungauged watersheds using a concentration duration curve and to estimate the detailed

3093,water quality wq data are essential for water resources as well as wq management however due to limited fiscal resources in many cases historical wq data may not be available for the watershed s of interest recently few artificial intelligent and parametric statistical approaches were proposed for the estimation of wq characteristics at ungauged watersheds in this study the main goal was to develop nonparametric statistical approaches for the estimation of the three main quartiles of different wq indicators in ungauged watersheds using watershed attributes as predictors four nonparametric approaches were based on the region of influence roi and theil sen nonparametric multiple regression tsmr the roi was used to identify watersheds similar to the ungauged watershed and tsmr was calibrated and validated to estimate wq quartiles in ungauged watersheds the main proposed approach combined the roi and tsmr in the second approach the spearman correlation analysis was introduced as a filter to identify watershed attributes that are highly correlated with the wq quartile to improve the roi performance co roi tsmr in the third approach a step forward selection technique was integrated with the tsmr to facilitate the selection of the model predictors watershed attributes roi sf tsmr in the fourth approach both the co roi and sf tsmr were used co roi sf tsmr the four nonparametric statistical approaches were calibrated and validated to estimate the three main quartiles for three different wq indicators using data from 50 watersheds in the nile delta egypt a jackknife validation procedure was applied to evaluate the performance of the four approaches the results indicated that the co roi sf tsmr approach outperformed the three other approaches keywords water quality nonparametric statistics ungauged sites nile delta water quality monitoring 1 introduction water quality wq and quantity data are essential for water resources management in general and wq management in particular khalil and ouarda 2009 water quality monitoring wqm is a principal component in wq management behmel et al 2016 ccme 2015 macdonald et al 2009 which helps to understand complex and dynamic wq processes and provides water managers with detailed information for sustainable wq management ccme 2015 khalil et al 2011a khalil and ouarda 2009 wqm program designing involves clarifying the monitoring objectives and information required why monitor the design of the wqm network what to monitor wq indicators and where to monitor sampling sites when to monitor sampling frequency and how to monitor which includes designing sampling protocols ensuring sufficient sampling equipment selecting appropriate laboratory analysis designing data verification processes designing data analysis protocols and reporting and information dissemination processes ccme 2006 wqm programs should be carefully designed and integrated in decision making chen et al 2012 robarts et al 2008 and their design should be evaluated periodically to respond to new information requirements environmental issues and or budgetary conditions ccme 2015 common wqm objectives and wq data uses include assessment of the wq conditions and trends assessment of the natural and anthropogenic influences on wq processes assessment of the levels of wq compliance with standards calibration and validation of wq models computation of wq indices and evaluation of the efficiency of environmental control measures khalil et al 2019 ccme 2015 harmancioglu and alpaslan 1992 typically detailed wq information is derived from wq data produced in gauged watersheds although wqm is a costly mission wqm program establishment and operation expenses are relatively small compared with the value of the water resource under monitoring or the health social and financial benefits associated with maintaining wq ccme 2015 however limited fiscal resources may require reducing the size of sampling sites jiang et al 2020 a literature review carried out by nguyen et al 2019 showed that among 50 assessment and redesign studies applied worldwide 25 studies recommended reducing the number of sampling sites while only 12 recommended increasing the number of sampling sites thus in many cases historical wq data may not be available for the watersheds of interest khalil et al 2019 khalil et al 2011a using numerical models such as mike11 wasp and hspf to recover wq information at ungauged sites may not always be possible due to the numerous types of data and extensive time required to calibrate and validate such models which limit conceptual models to small catchments keupers and willems 2017 khalil et al 2015 lobuglio et al 2007 bowen and hieronymus 2003 although the target ungauged watershed attribute data may be available they are simply ungauged and consequently there are no wq data available for the calibration and validation of the numerical models very limited research has been conducted in the estimation of wq data or information in ungauged watersheds rothwell et al 2010 proposed stepwise linear regression swlr models to estimate the mean value for different wq variables in northwestern england using catchment attributes as predictors different swlr models were calibrated to estimate mean values for ph calcium ca magnesium mg nitrate n no3 orthophosphate p po4 and suspended solids ss using 26 catchment attributes as predictors watershed attributes considered include catchment physical attributes as well as land cover meteorological groundwater recharge and bedrock geological attributes the results showed that ca and mg were influenced more by the land cover and catchment physical attributes while the estimation of ph relied more on the bedrock geology and land cover attributes however the swlr model for the estimation of po4 did not show good results which may be attributed to the absence of significant attributes that represent po4 processes or to the nonlinear nature of the relationship that cannot be represented accurately by a linear model e g swlr khalil et al 2011b proposed artificial neural network ann ensemble ann eann and canonical correlation analysis cca eann cca eann models for the estimation of the mean values of different wq variables at ungauged sites in the nile delta using watershed attributes as predictors the ann and eann were developed to calibrate and validate the relationship between watershed attributes and mean wq values for the cca eann models cca was applied using wq data and watershed attributes to create canonical attribute variates and the eann was then developed to model the relationship between the canonical attribute variates as predictors and mean wq values the results showed that the cca eann model provided more accurate and precise estimation than the ann and eann models tsang et al 2011 proposed region of influence swlr roi swlr models for the estimation of macroinvertebrates taxon assemblage in ungauged streams in maryland usa using 21 different catchment attributes tsang et al 2011 successfully adapted the roi concept from hydrology and developed a new datum roi nroi for the estimation of taxon assemblages in ungauged watersheds the proposed model in maryland showed better performance than the commonly used rivpacs models this study confirmed that introducing the roi approach to use only in similar watersheds has the advantage of improving model accuracy and precision more recently khalil et al 2019 proposed a cca stepwise nonlinear regression cca swnlr for the estimation of the mean value 25th percentile and 75th percentile for different wq variables electric conductivity ec sodium na and iron fe at ungauged sites in the nile delta using watershed attributes as predictors khalil et al 2019 successfully adapted the cca based neighborhood approach proposed for regional flood frequency analysis for the estimation of wq characteristics in ungauged watersheds for a target ungauged watershed the cca neighborhood approach was applied to identify similar gauged watersheds and then swnlr models were calibrated using only data from the set of similar watersheds identified by the cca the results showed that the implemented cca neighborhood approach significantly improved the accuracy and precision of the swnlr models alnahit et al 2022 proposed random forest rf and boosted regression tree brt models for the estimation of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and turbidity tur in ungauged streams in southeast atlantic region of the usa using climate and watersheds attributes the proposed model random forest rf results outperform the boosted regression tree brt results this study proved the idea of the positive correlation between the tn tp and the percentage of the cropping and urbanization wq data are characterized by the presence of missing values outliers censored records and deviation from normality which may affect or make it difficult to fulfill statistical assumptions required by parametric techniques in addition the wq data available may not be sufficient to accurately fit the appropriate statistical distribution khalil et al 2019 moreover the presence of outliers and missing values as well as the limited size of wq data may also affect or make it difficult to apply artificial intelligence techniques on the other hand nonparametric techniques are much easier to apply have distribution free assumptions and are more appropriate for the presence of outliers censored data missing values and limited wq data in this study a nonparametric statistical approach is proposed for the estimation of the three main quartiles of different wq variables in ungauged watersheds using watershed attributes as predictors the three quartiles are the lower quartile q1 25th percentile the median q2 50th percentile and the upper quartile q3 75th percentiles the three quartiles can provide an indication about the central tendency q2 the median dispersion q3 q1 interquartile range iqr coefficient of variation iqr 2 q2 and skewness q3 q2 vs q2 q1 data are positively skewed if q3 q2 q2 q1 and negatively skewed if q3 q2 q2 q1 2 methodology the proposed nonparametric approach consists of three main steps the first step is to estimate the target wq quartiles in gauged watersheds the second step consists of applying the region of influence roi approach for each ungauged watershed to identify similar gauged watersheds the third step is to calibrate and validate the theil sen multiple regression tsmr technique to estimate wq quartiles in ungauged watersheds fig 1 2 1 estimation of wq characteristics at gauged sites many researchers have recommended the use of quantile unbiased plotting positions for the construction of probability plots e g shabri 2002 where the weibull formula is the simplest formula stedinger et al 1993 cunnane 1978 1 p i i n 1 where p i is the plotting probability of the i th order statistic and n is the sample size size of wq records available in a gauged watershed many other plotting position formulas have been proposed which can be expressed in a general form as follows stedinger et al 1993 cunnane 1978 2 p i i a n 1 2 a where a is a plotting position parameter that allows approximate unbiased plotting positions for different distributions table 1 shows different plotting position parameters the associated formula and statistical distributions for instance for a 0 the general formula becomes the weibull formula while a 0 5 is the hazen 1914 formula to identify the ideal formula for wq data an experimental study was conducted to compare the estimation of the three desired percentiles 25th 50th and 75th percentiles for two different wq variables using each of the six plotting position formulas it was assumed that the estimation of the three percentiles at gauged sites using any of the six formulas should provide similar results the differences in the plotting position parameter affect the estimation of extreme percentiles e g 5th 95th and 99th more than the interquartile range the results shown in table 2 confirm that using any of the provided plotting position formulas provides similar results for the three desired percentiles except for the weibull formula the five other formulas provided almost identical results for the estimation of the three desired percentiles in this study the cunnane a 0 4 formula was adopted based on the results presented in table 2 which confirm that the estimations of the three percentiles are similar using any of the six formulas table 2 in addition cunnane s formula is a compromise formula for all distributions table 1 and is typically used by different institutions e g environment canada the city of calgary amec 2014 it should be emphasized that the availability of representative wq data is much more important than the selection of the plotting position formula representative wq data is fundamental to estimate the target wq percentile as accurate as possible 2 2 region of influence roi approach the region of influence approach proposed by burn 1990 was adopted in this study to identify gauged watersheds that can be considered similar to a target ungauged watershed the approach consists of two steps in the first step the euclidean distance between a target ungauged watershed and each of the gauged watersheds is calculated in the second step a threshold is applied to identify gauged watersheds within the roi in the first step the euclidean distance is computed using standardized watershed attributes to avoid any scale or dimension influences the euclidean distance in k dimension space k is the size of watershed attributes can be computed as follows d ij k 1 k x k i x k j 2 1 2 where d i j is the euclidean distance between station i and station j x k i is the value of watershed attribute k for station i and x k j is the value of watershed attribute k for station j the euclidean distances between a target ungauged watershed and all gauged watersheds are then ranked in ascending order the smallest distance is associated with the most similar gauged watershed while the largest distance is associated with the least similar watershed the threshold value is the distance value below which any gauged watershed will be considered inside the roi for the ungauged watershed the roi stations for a target ungauged watershed can be identified as follows 4 n i j d ij d t where n i is the group of watersheds in the roi for a target ungauged watershed i and d t is the threshold value for the target ungauged watershed i 5 targetthresholdvalue d t d l n s i n s t where d l is a lower threshold value corresponding to the minimum size of watersheds within the roi for ungauged watershed i nsi is the size of watersheds corresponding to the use of the d l and nst is the minimum size required for gauged watersheds in the roi the nst and d l are first defined if the threshold d l provides a size of gauged watersheds that is less than the desired nst a modified threshold d u is then applied as follows 6 targetthresholdvalue d t d l d u d l n s t nsi nst n s i n s t the selection of nst is mainly based on the technique of applying for information transfer e g statistical technical and artificial intelligence techniques as well as the size of gauged watersheds available the threshold values d l and d u were selected based on chosen percentiles of ranked euclidean distances three preliminary trials roi 1 roi 2 and roi 3 were considered to identify the d l d u a n d n s t values roi 1 follows the parameters used by burn 1990 d l 25th percentile d u 75th percentile and nst one third of the available gauged watersheds 33 regarding roi 2 the parameters were 35th and 85th percentiles for d l and d u respectively and nst was half of the available gauged watersheds 50 for roi 3 the d l and d u values were assumed to be 35 and 100 percentiles respectively and nst was 50 preliminary analysis indicated that the roi size ranged from 16 to 28 when roi 1 criteria were applied and from 25 to 37 and from 30 to 44 for roi 2 and roi 3 respectively in this study given that the size of available gauged watersheds was 50 49 available for the cross validation process the nst was considered 25 50 of the gauged watersheds the best roi parameters were selected based on the rrmse and rbias output values of the theil sen multiple regression approach fig 2 shows the rrmse and rbias for the estimation of nh4 in three quartiles of the roi the best accuracy and precision were identified at roi 2 with assumed parameters d l d u values 35 and 85 percentiles and nst was 25 watersheds with rrmse 55 82 44 88 and 46 20 and rbias 8 08 8 64 and 3 41 for q1 q2 and q3 respectively 2 3 theil sen regression a rank based unbiased functional regression slope estimate was given by theil 1992 as the median of pairwise slopes of the observations sen 1968 refined this estimate to address the case of ties in the ranking for univariate regression dang et al 2009 extended the univariate theil sen estimator to multivariate regression in the kendall theil sen regression suppose a sample of n pairs of observations x i y i i 1 n were taken suppose a straight line given below was used as a best fit model to the given set of data 7 y i β 0 x i β 1 ε i i 1 n where x i represents the watershed attributes predictors y i represents wq quartiles dependent variable β 0 is the estimated y intercept β 1 is the estimated regression coefficient and ε i are random errors the regression coefficient β 1 can be estimated by the median of all pairwise slopes between each pair of points in the given dataset for each regression coefficient passing through x i y i and x j y j the data point can be estimated by 8 β 1 m e d i a n y i y j x i x j x i x j 1 i j n the y intercept of the line can be estimated by the equation 9 β 0 y β 1 x where β 0 is the estimated y intercept y is the median of the dependent variable β 1 is the estimated slope and x is the median of the predictor variable in the case of multiple linear regression dang et al 2009 extended the kendall theil sen regression approach from a simple linear regression to a multiple linear regression with p independent predictors using the multivariate median first an estimator of θ β 0 β 1 t t can be found as the solution to the p 1 equations 10 y i β 0 x i t β 1 i k p 1 i 1 i p 1 where k p 1 is a p 1 subset of 1 n such that p 1 p 1 matrix x k k k p 1 is invertible and the estimator is denoted by θ k p 1 11 θ n m m e d θ k p 1 k p 1 θ k p 1 is the least square estimator of θ based on p 1 observations where p 1 m n may be chosen to construct a least square estimator θ km then a multiple theil sen estimator θ n of parameter θ is defined to be the multivariate median of all possible least square estimators 12 θ n m m e d θ km k m slop estimators were calculated for all pairwise sets of observations in the data and the theil sen estimator was taken as the slope the median of all these slopes and the y intercept were obtained by taking the median of all the differences nevitt and tam 1998 2 4 statistical approaches given the size of watershed attributes that can be available khalil et al 2019 13 watershed attributes rothwell et al 2010 26 watershed attributes some of these attributes may be irrelevant to the wq variable to estimate including these irrelevant attributes may add noise to the approach and consequently reduce estimation precision and accuracy thus two filters were added to the main approach spearman correlation analysis and a step forward selection technique these two steps were included as filters to identify relevant attributes for each wq variable spearman correlation analysis between wq quartiles and watershed attributes was applied to filter out or disregard predictors that showed no or weak correlation with the target wq quartiles attributes that showed a correlation coefficient less than an absolute value 0 1 were disregarded thus the proposed approach including the roi and tsmr can be applied using only relevant attributes in addition to facilitate tsmr calibration and validation the step forward selection sf approach was integrated the approach was calibrated using only watershed attributes and the attribute that provided the least rmse value was chosen and the process was repeated to select the 2nd best attribute by calibrating the tsmr using two attributes the best one was selected examining each of the remaining attributes the second attribute to include was the attribute that provided the lowest rmse and so on for the 3rd and 4th attributes until there was no improvement in the approach s precision to evaluate the effect of the correlation analysis co filter step as well as the sf selection component four statistical approaches were evaluated to estimate wq quartiles table 3 the four approaches included the basic proposed approach roi tsmr the basic approach with sf tsmr sf tsmr instead of a complete tsmr approach roi sf tsmr the co roi tsmr which applies the co filter and the co roi sf tsmr which includes both filters as shown in fig 3 2 5 evaluation procedures the jack knife procedure was applied to evaluate the proposed approach by considering each of the gauged watersheds in turn as a target ungauged watershed and using the remaining 49 watersheds to apply the proposed approaches four performance measures were considered in this study the root mean square error rmse relative rmse rrmse bias and relative bias rbias as follows 13 rmse 1 z i 1 z y i y i 2 1 2 rrmse 1 z i 1 z y i y i y i 2 1 2 15 bias 1 z i 1 z y i y i rbias 1 z i 1 z y i y i y i where z is the total number of watersheds and y i and y i for i 1 z are the observed and estimated wq quartile values respectively 3 study area and available data in this study the proposed approaches were applied and evaluated for the nile delta region in egypt the nile delta total area is approximately 40 000 km2 radwan et al 2019 agriculture is the main activity in the nile delta with scattered industrial activities and residential areas the nile delta drainage system consists of 22 main drains drainage systems serving 94 drainage watersheds fig 4 a drainage watershed is served by a branch drain that delivers flow to the main drains out of these 94 drainage watersheds only 50 were gauged and 33 wq parameters were measured on a monthly basis from august 1997 to may 2010 in this study nitrates no3 ammonium nh4 and total phosphorus tp measured in the 50 gauged watersheds were considered the mann kendall hypothesis test was applied to assess trends in wq variables where the results indicated that the numbers of watersheds that had significant trends in no3 nh4 and tp were 50 22 and 17 watersheds respectively for example the probability of accepting the null hypothesis that there is no trend p value for watershed eh 09 was 3 445e 06 0 399 and 0 692 for no3 nh4 and tp respectively thirteen watershed attribute datasets were used in this study to represent different watershed characteristics and main activities table 4 these 13 attributes include urban area ha cultivated area ha average soil salinity ppm average soil hydraulic conductivity m day average total annual rainfall mm year drain total lengths m irrigation canal total lengths m industrial effluent m3 day number of factories total capacity of waste water treatment plants wwtp m3 day number of wwtp livestock and total annual fertilizers applied information about the quality of the industrial effluents and wwtp effluents is not available thus analyses relying on the total capacity of wwtps and average industrial waste effluents were used instead 4 results 4 1 estimation of wq characteristics at gauged sites for the estimation of wq quartiles at gauged sites the cunnane formula was applied fig 5 shows the time series and cunnane plot position results for the nh4 and tp measured in watershed no eh 09 based on the cunnane plot position results in fig 5 one can identify different non exceedance percentiles as shown in table 5 table 5 also shows the three desired wq quartiles for the no3 nh4 and tp where q1 was 1 148 0 913 and 0 354 respectively the median q2 was 3 374 1 680 and 0 460 respectively and the upper quartile q3 was 13 374 4 391 and 0 655 respectively similarly the three selected quartiles were identified for each of the selected wq variables in each of the 50 gauged watersheds 4 2 roi results the roi approach was applied either using all available watershed attributes in approaches 1 and 2 roi tsr and roi sf tsr respectively table 3 or after applying the correlation filter using only relevant watershed attributes as in approaches 3 and 4 co roi tsr and co roi sf tsr respectively the roi approach for approaches 1 and 2 depended only on thirteen watershed attributes thus the roi was the same for the assumed ungauged watershed the co roi approach for approaches 3 and 4 depended on both watershed attributes and wq data for selected variables and quartiles therefore every quartile had its own roi the results indicated that the number of similar watersheds within the roi increased in approaches 3 and 4 compared with approaches 1 and 2 in regard to nh4 q2 and q3 no3 q1 and q3 and tp q1 q2 and q3 and the number decreased in regard to identifying similar watersheds in nh4 q1 and no3 q2 thus one could say that the number of similar watersheds within the roi increased when using the correlation filter co roi for example the estimation of nh4 q1 q2 and q3 quartiles in assumed ungauged watershed eh 09 using all available attributes indicated that 13 watersheds were similar to the target ungauged watershed eh 09 fig 6 correlation analysis was applied between watershed attributes and nh4 q1 for gauged watersheds and the results showed that seven out of thirteen attributes showed no or weak correlation the selected attributes were soil salinity soil hydraulic conductivity average rainfall industrial effluent number of factories and number of wwtps these six attributes were used in the co roi procedure as well as in the estimation of nh4 q1 under theil sen multiple regression as shown in fig 7 the correlation analysis was repeated between watershed attributes and nh4 q2 the correlation results showed that three out of thirteen attributes showed no or weak correlation and the selected attributes were urban area cultivated area average soil hydraulic conductivity average rainfall drain lengths industrial effluent number of factories total capacity of wwtps livestock and total annual fertilizers the correlation analysis was repeated again between watershed attributes and nh4 q3 correlation results showed that six out of thirteen showed no or weak correlation and the selected attributes were cultivated area average soil hydraulic conductivity irrigation canal total lengths industrial effluent livestock and total annual fertilizers the co roi results for nh4 q1 q2 and q3 showed that the numbers of similar watersheds were 30 34 and 31 respectively as shown in figs 7 to 9 4 3 approach precision and accuracy the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure are presented in tables 6 to 10 rmse and rrmse indices provide an indication of approach prediction precision while the bias and rbias indices provide an indication of approach prediction accuracy and whether an approach tends to overestimate or underestimate the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for approaches roi tsr and co roi tsr are presented in table 6 the results showed that the co roi tsr approach was more precise than the roi tsr approach in the estimation of all wq variables except for no3 q2 and they were more similar in the estimation of nh4 q1 the accuracy suggests that both approaches overestimated all wq variables except in the estimation of no3 q3 in the roi tsr approach also the results showed that the co roi tsr approach was more accurate than the roi tsr approach in the estimation of no3 q1 q2 and q3 nh4 q1 and q2 and tp q1 for all wq quartiles however the roi tsr approach was more accurate than the co roi tsr approach in the estimation of tp q1 and q2 and nh4 q3 the estimation of relative error for nh4 no3 and tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 using the roi tsr and co roi tsr approaches are shown in figs 10 11 and 12 respectively fig 10 shows that co roi tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 27 28 and 28 respectively out of the 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 11 shows that co roi tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 25 31 and 30 respectively and fig 12 shows that co roi tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 26 27 and 31 respectively the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for approaches roi sf tsr and co roi sf tsr are presented in table 7 the results showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more precise than the roi sf tsr approach in the estimation of all wq variables the accuracy suggests that both approaches overestimated all wq variables except in the estimation of nh4 q1 in model co roi sf tsr and no3 q2 in both approaches also the results showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more accurate than the roi sf tsr approach except in the estimation of no3 q3 and the roi sf tsr approach was more accurate than the co roi sf tsr approach the estimation of relative error for nh4 no3 and tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 using the roi sf tsr and co roi sf tsr approaches are shown in figs 13 14 and 15 respectively fig 13 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 25 27 and 28 respectively out of the 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 14 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 23 30 and 30 respectively and fig 15 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 27 25 and 30 respectively to evaluate the contribution of adding a correlation filter a comparison between approaches with and without the co filter was conducted as shown in tables 6 and 7 and the results indicate that approaches with the co filter provided more precise and accurate results than approaches without the co filter the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for approaches roi tsr and roi sf tsr are presented in table 8 overall the roi sf tsr approach provided more precise results than the basic roi tsr approach for all wq variables the accuracy suggests that both approaches overestimated nh4 and tp quartiles except for the no3 q3 estimation in the roi tsr approach and the no3 q2 estimation in the roi sf tsr approach however the roi sf tsr approach was more accurate than the roi tsr model for the roi tsr and roi sf tsr approaches the estimated relative errors for nh4 no3 and tp for q1 q2 and q3 at each of the 50 watersheds are shown in figs 16 17 and 18 respectively fig 16 shows that roi sf tsr led to better results in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 36 32 and 32 respectively out of the 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 17 shows that roi sf tsr led to better results in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 38 30 and 27 respectively fig 18 shows that roi sf tsr led to better results in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 32 34 and 35 respectively table 8 also shows that the roi sf tsr approaches had more accurate results except for the estimation of the nh4 first quartile thus adding the step forward selection component to the tsr technique led to more precise estimations the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for approaches co roi tsr and co roi sf tsr are presented in table 9 the results showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more precise than the co roi tsr approach in the estimation of nh4 and tp and no3 q1 and q2 and they were more similar in the estimation of no3 q3 additionally the results showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more accurate than the co roi tsr approach in the estimation of tp for all wq quartiles however the co roi tsr approach was more accurate in the estimation of no3 q3 and nh4 q2 the estimation of relative error for the nh4 no3 and tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 using the co roi tsr and co roi sf tsr approaches are shown in figs 19 20 and 21 respectively fig 19 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 32 37 and 35 respectively out of 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 20 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 36 31 and 30 respectively and fig 21 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 29 28 and 33 respectively to evaluate the effect of using the step forward selection sf approach a comparison between approaches with and without the sf approach was conducted as shown in tables 8 and 9 and the results indicate that approaches with the step forward selection sf approach provided more precise and accurate results than approaches without the sf approach the results obtained using the jackknife validation procedure for the basic roi tsr and co roi sf tsr approaches are presented in table 10 the accuracy suggests that both approaches overestimated all wq variables except for estimation of no3 q3 in approach roi tsr and nh4 q1 and no3 q2 in approach co roi sf tsr the results also showed that the co roi sf tsr approach was more accurate and precise than the roi tsr approach in estimation of all wq variables table 10 presents an evaluation of the effect of using the co filter as well as the step forward selection sf approach and the results indicated that the approach with both the co filter and step forward selection sf approaches provided more precise and accurate results than those approaches without both filters the estimation of relative error for nh4 no3 and tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 using the roi tsr and co roi sf tsr approaches are shown in figs 22 23 and 24 respectively fig 22 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of nh4 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 29 31 and 35 respectively out of 50 watersheds used in the jackknife validation procedure however fig 23 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of no3 quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 37 34 and 28 respectively and fig 24 shows that co roi sf tsmr led to smaller relative errors in the estimation of tp quartiles q1 q2 and q3 in the number of watersheds 30 31 and 37 respectively table 11 shows the regression equations and their performance indices in the estimation of the nh4 q1 q2 and q3 quartiles in the assumed ungauged watershed eh 09 results showed that some watersheds such as wt 01 and et 01 had estimation errors larger than all other watersheds watershed wt 01 is located on the northwestern part of the nile delta watershed no 41 in estimation error figures caused high estimation errors in the estimation of no3 and tp for all quartiles this extreme watershed included the highest industrial effluent 12 3561 m3 day and highest number of factories compared with all other watersheds in addition to the watershed location in a coastal area with expected high population densities another example watershed et 01 is located on the northeastern part of the nile delta watershed no 17 in estimation error figures caused high estimation errors in the estimation of nh4 and tp for all quartiles this extreme watershed included the highest fertilizers applied 31 047 36 ton year compared with all other watersheds the last watershed was watershed eb 38 located on the southern part of the nile delta watershed no 3 in estimation error figures which caused a high estimation error in the estimation of no3 and nh4 for all quartiles this extreme watershed included the highest wwtp effluent 1 415 000 m3 day and highest number of wwtps compared with all other watersheds in addition the watershed location was close to cairo the capital city with an expected high population density to overcome these large errors watersheds eb 38 wt 01 and et 01 were excluded from the study and calculations were carried out to evaluate and compare the performances of the approaches after excluding these three watersheds from the study the results indicated that precision and accuracy were improved in all four proposed approaches after excluding these three watersheds as shown in table 12 the results confirm that co roi sf tsr the complete approach was the most precise and accurate approach thus these three watersheds should be measured by control stations and could not be estimated by the proposed approaches 5 conclusion in this study four nonparametric approaches were applied in the estimation of water quality quartiles in ungauged watersheds the main approach consisted of two main components a region of influence approach and theil sen multiple regression approaches the roi approach was used to identify similar watersheds so that information was transferred from gauged to ungauged watersheds using theil sen multiple regression approaches theil sen multiple nonparametric regression approaches were used to establish the relationship between watershed attributes and selected water quality variables two filters were added to the main approach spearman correlation analysis and a step forward selection technique were included as filters to identify relevant attributes for each wq variable four approaches were integrated to evaluate the effects of the correlation analysis co filter step as well as the sf selection component the performance of the proposed approaches was evaluated using the jackknife validation method by calculating rmse rrmse bias and rbias the results showed that the approach with both co filter and step forward selection sf approaches provided more precise and accurate results than those approaches without both filters this study is the first to estimate water quality parameters using the roi approach under nonstationary conditions therefore future work should consider upgrading the roi approach to estimate wq parameters or introduce a comparison between roi and other methods for delineation of homogeneous regions in addition to the estimation of the detailed wq records in ungauged watersheds by constructing a concentration duration curve in ungauged watersheds then spatial interpolation can be applied to transfer information from gauged watersheds to completely ungauged watersheds using a concentration duration curve and to estimate the detailed

3094,the damming of rivers can significantly intercept carbon transportation and regulate dynamic biogeochemistry which then greatly influence carbon gases co2 and ch4 metabolism and emissions however little is known about the spatial temporal pattern and controls of carbon emissions from a cascaded river reservoir system in this study we investigated the spatial and seasonal partial pressure of co2 and ch4 i e pco2 and pch4 dynamics along a subtropical cascaded dammed river wubu river located in southwest china the pco2 and pch4 in the wubu river basin showed significantly spatial temporal and were generally supersaturated with gas fluxes of 89 5 89 7 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 and 1 19 1 18 mmol ch4 m 2 d 1 the pco2 and pch4 were all increasing from upstream to downstream and most of river sections had significantly higher pco2 and co2 than their downstream reservoir sections while the pch4 and ch4 flux were the opposite meanwhile released waters had invariably high pco2 and pch4 and were carbon gas emission hotspots in the river reservoir system the intercepts of carbon and nutrients by cascade damming created a series of eutrophic hotspots and enhanced primary productivity could inhibit riverine co2 emissions but promote ch4 production thus the spatial patterns of riverine pco2 pch4 and the pco2 pch4 in cascade hydroelectric river were importantly altered it was evaluated that cascade damming would reduce about 17 9 of the total co2 evasion amount but increase approximately 16 3 of ch4 the global warming potential of rivers would be enhanced when organic carbon was captured and mineralized to ch4 rather than to co2 in cascade damming river system ph dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a chl a were indicated as natural controls of pco2 in such a cascade river reservoir system while dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic carbon and chl a were significantly correlated with pch4 and acted as good predictors of ch4 emissions the temperature and autotrophic production were responsible for the different seasonal patterns of carbon gas concentrations observed between river sections and reservoir sections our study highlighted that cascaded damming decreased co2 emissions and created ch4 hotspots in river systems and may have significantly increased the complexity of the spatial temporal pattern and construction of riverine carbon gases emissions given the increasing damming of rivers worldwide for energy demand researches are needed to quantify the role of cascaded damming in the riverine c budget keywords pco2 and pch4 cascaded damming river reservoir released water system nutrient content spatial and seasonal variation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years aquatic ecosystems including rivers lakes wetlands reservoirs and ponds have been widely recognized as important sources of greenhouse gas ghg to the atmosphere bastviken et al 2011 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 stanley et al 2016 yang et al 2015 rivers receiving large quantities of terrestrial carbon act as bioreactors of the organic carbon biogeochemical cycle cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 and are identified as the most important contributors to co2 and ch4 emissions from global aquatic ecosystems raymond et al 2013 recent estimates have indicated that global rivers and streams would release approximately 1 8 2 58 pg co2 and 26 8 tg ch4 per year cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 stanley et al 2016 respectively it has been suggested that co2 and ch4 emissions from river system offset an unexpectedly large portion of the continental carbon sink globally and even exceed the total carbon export to the ocean barros et al 2011 bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 however lots of rivers worldwide have been intensively dammed to relieve the increasing energy demand and severe water shortages grill et al 2019 there are at least 70 000 large dams storage depth 15 m and countless small reservoirs all over the world syvitski et al 2005 zarfl et al 2015 these dams have intercepted and deposited abundant carbon in reservoirs and then affected co2 and ch4 generations and emissions river damming has been linked with additional complexity and uncertainty for riverine carbon emissions crawford et al 2016 ran et al 2017 rust et al 2022 shi et al 2017 at least 278 7 tg co2 yr 1 and 9 7 tg ch4 yr 1 escaped from global reservoirs into the atmosphere barros et al 2011 hertwich 2013 and these amounts should not be disregarded river segmentation and disruption by dams accompanied by the change of hydrological processes water chemistry and hydraulic residence time shi 2017 yang and lu 2014 shi et al 2020 can strongly influence the accumulation of sediments and nutrients in reservoir kummu et al 2010 maavara et al 2015 syvitski et al 2005 globally dams intercept and store approximately 1 3 pg carbon from land syvitski et al 2005 and a portion of these carbon is ultimately converted into co2 and ch4 by microorganism decomposition tranvik et al 2009 supporting reservoirs as persistent co2 and ch4 emission hotspots maeck et al 2013 prairie et al 2018 a study in the lancang river by shi et al 2017 found that reservoirs generally had higher sediment oc and higher ch4 and co2 fluxes than the upstream reach in particular the elevated water column and accumulation of fine particle carbon in reservoir lead a shift in the sediments from aerobic to anaerobic may favour ch4 production galylacaux et al 1997 maeck et al 2013 and cause substantially high emissions from reservoir spillways turbines and downstream river reaches li and zhang 2014 maeck et al 2013 in maeck s study 2013 ch4 flux in reservoir reaches were more than two orders of magnitude higher than that in river reaches meanwhile the excessive availability of decomposable organic matter due to the flooding of terrestrial vegetation and soil was argued to fuel co2 and ch4 production in reservoirs especially in the first ten years after flooding barros et al 2011 therefore carbon intercept and sedimentation caused by damming may dramatically alter the patterns and strength of riverine ch4 and co2 emissions in addition to the enhancement effect on co2 and ch4 production river damming can also influence the consumption process of co2 and ch4 in rivers campeau and del giorgio 2014 crawford et al 2016 gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 stanley et al 2016 teodoru et al 2011 the impounding of rivers and the resultant lower flow velocity higher nutrition concentration and water stratification generally lead to a high probability of algal blooms and primary production enhancement and even shift rivers from heterotrophies to net autotrophy almeida et al 2016 crawford et al 2016 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2011 crawford et al 2016 found that phytoplankton production which was stimulated by a series of low head dams drove the widely undersaturated co2 in the upper mississippi river in addition ch4 oxidation could be enhanced in reservoirs because of the longer transmission time from the sediment to the water surface gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 despite the two sided effect much of the research suggested that damming could crucially enhance the ch4 emissions from natural river systems crawford et al 2016 delsontro et al 2016 guerin et al 2008 kemenes et al 2007 the effect of river damming on the co2 emissions was still indeterminate crawford et al 2016 prairie et al 2018 ran et al 2017 wang et al 2011 regardless hydropower development would greatly change the spatial temporal pattern of ghg emissions in river systems and subsequently lead to new patterns in reservoir river systems li and zhang 2014 shi et al 2017 however more comprehensive knowledge of the spatial temporal pattern of ghg emissions from rivers reservoirs systems are still limited relative to increasing demand for hydropower until now most of the current studies have concentrated on carbon emissions from single reservoirs while little attention has been given to the spatial temporal dynamics and controlling factors of carbon emissions from cascaded reservoir river systems crawford et al 2016 shi et al 2017 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2011 even though most of the mountain rivers have been affected by cascaded hydropower development chang et al 2010 tang and zhou 2012 shi et al 2017 found that co2 and ch4 emissions from cascade hydropower reservoirs along the lancang river exhibited observable spatial heterogeneity and the first upstream reservoir had the highest co2 and ch4 fluxes and ch4 co2 ratio due to a high amount of carbon trapping meanwhile a series of cascade low head dams along the upper mississippi river dominated the spatial patterns of co2 and ch4 fluxes by affecting primary productivity and organic matter accumulation crawford et al 2016 obviously cascade dams shift a river from a free flowing continuum to a highly intercepted river with an alternating discontinuity of lentic and lotic sections especially dense dams along small rivers and then altering the carbon distribution pattern and in situ metabolism liu et al 2016 these processes can greatly alter the spatial temporal patterns of the co2 and ch4 emissions in river systems delsontro et al 2016 ran et al 2017 shi et al 2017 even so the scarcity of data from integrated reservoir river systems is critical for a thorough understanding of their spatial temporal pattern of ghg fluxes and potential role in the global ghg budget in recent decades the growing demand for energy with the development of the global economy has impelled continued hydropower development worldwide in china which is one of the largest energy consumers huang and yan 2009 cascade hydropower plant utilization has already become a strategic decision for mitigating the energy crisis chang et al 2010 tang and zhou 2012 there is a substantial opportunity and urgent need to investigate the distribution pattern of ghg emissions from cascade reservoir river systems in this study direct measurements of pco2 and pch4 were carried out in a subtropical river reservoir system in southwest china the emission fluxes of co2 and ch4 from surface water to the atmosphere were calculated the main objective of this study was to clarify the cascade dam effect on the spatial temporal patterns of co2 and ch4 emissions from fluvial systems as well as to reveal the possible controlling factors of the co2 and ch4 concentrations and fluxes in the typical river reservoir system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the wubu river 28 10 32 13 n 105 11 110 11 e a southern tributary of the yangtze river is located in chongqing china with a basin area of 439 km2 fig 1 the study area has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 18 3 c a 20 year 1996 2016 averaged precipitation is 1072 mm and most of which 76 occurs in the wet season june august ren et al 2016 annual average of wind speed is of 0 95 m s 1 and presents indistinctive seasonal fluctuation due to the peculiar geomorphology the wubu river basin features the mountainous and hilly terrain and is fed by rainfalls it is a typical mountain river with an average slope of 5 27 and the total fall between river ends amounts to 800 m the annual average of discharge and flow velocity in wubu river estuary are about 14 8 m3 s 1 and 1 35 m s 1 respectively detailed variation of hydrological and meteorological parameters was presented in supplementary information si table s1 the main types of land use in the wubu river basin are forest and cultivated land and a few sporadic urban lands are distributed in the downstream area there are three major tributaries along the wubu river catchment the ersheng river yaxi river and lugou stream with a large riverbed gradient and enormous hydropower potential there were over 10 dams built on the mainstream and tributaries of the wubu river by 2014 including chaeryan ce xiaoguan xg jianghe jh xitan xt yangjiadu yj ersheng es jianshan js and mofang mf and so on fig 1 most of these dams were constructed during the 1970 s and 1980 s for hydropower generation or irrigation these dams have created a series of cascade reservoirs whose main features are described in table s1 in our study ce xg jh xt and yj on the wubu river r1 r5 in fig 1 and es js and mf located on the ersheng river yaxi stream and lugou stream respectively shown as res ryx and rlg respectively in fig 1 were selected to perform the seasonal investigation on co2 and ch4 concentrations in surface water all 8 dams were built for power generation and the reservoir ages are over 33 years fig 1 the sampled dams are relatively small in size with heights and lengths ranging from 4 to 16 m and from 22 to 90 m respectively table s1 the backwater lengths of the selected reservoirs ranged from 0 6 to 3 2 km in each dam segment we selected 3 sections representing the river or inflow reservoir and released water respectively fig 1 depending on the range of the backwater area and the reservoir operation mode additionally we selected 3 repetitive sampling sites in each section which resulted in a total of 75 sampling sites on the mainstream and tributaries of the wubu river fig 1 currently r4 r5 and res are in state of eutrophication in warm seasons as the result of agricultural runoff and adjacent town effluent discharge 2 2 sample collection we conducted four sampling expeditions quarterly from september 2014 to june 2015 to determine the water chemistry and co2 and ch4 concentrations at each sampling site each sampling contained three replicates at each site 500 ml of surface water sample 30 cm depth under the water surface was collected using an organic glass hydrophore and held in acid washed 0 5 l high density polyethylene containers for water chemistry analyses for the determination of co2 and ch4 concentrations we used a 100 ml syringe to extract 100 ml of bubble free surface water and promptly injected it into a vacuum sealed aluminium foil bag that was inert to greenhouse gases the maximum capacity of 200 ml then 0 2 ml of saturated mercuric chloride was injected to stop microbial metabolism meanwhile three 100 ml in situ atmospheric gas samples 1 m above the water surface were collected and injected into a vacuum sealed gas sample bag to measure atmospheric background concentrations all water samples were preserved at 4 c and analysed within 7 days in situ water surface water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity turb conductivity con and chlorophyll a chl a were measured by a calibrated mantatm2 multiparameter system eureka company usa an anemogram kestrel 2500 usa was employed to record the in situ air temperature at wind speed u and air pressure in addition we measured the river width m flow velocity v and water depth h using a diastimeter current metre and depth metre respectively 2 3 sample analysis the headspace method was employed to measure dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations we firstly injected 80 ml of high purity n2 into the vacuum sealed aluminium foil bag that was filled with 100 ml water sample to create headspace then the air bag was shaken violently for 5 min to allow the dissolved gases to escape and to reach equilibrium between the liquid and gas phases koschorreck et al 2021 20 ml of headspace gas were then extracted separately and analysed by a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a agilent co usa equipped with an ecd detector to measure the co2 and ch4 concentration meanwhile 10 ml in situ gas samples were also measured for the atmospheric background concentration three commercial gas standards 300 1000 and 10 000 ppm for co2 and 2 20 and 200 ppm for ch4 were used for calibration moreover the chemical parameters of the surface water were measured in this study to analyse the potential factors regulating the co2 and ch4 emissions the total nitrogen tn were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry after water sample digestion using alkaline potassium persulfate as oxidant nitrate nitrogen no3 and ammonia nitrogen nh4 were analysed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and nessler s reagent spectrophotometry respectively using the filtered water samples total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus dtp and orthophosphate po4 3 were all determined via alkaline k2s2o8 mo sb anti luminosity wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b the analytical procedures were in accordance with the china national standard method https www sac gov cn doc and dic were measured using a toc analyser multi n c 2100 jena germany the details are described in the supporting information si 2 4 calculation of pco2 and pch4 the original surface water pco2 and pch4 were calculated with the solubility constant corrected for temperature and the volume ratio of headspace to water in the aluminium foil bag according to the following equation yu et al 2017 p co 2 p co 2 h 1 v m vol h p co 2 h k a vol w vol t 1 k s where pco2 h represents the equilibrated pco2 in the headspace unit in μatm vm in l mol 1 is the gas molar volume at the analytic temperature and volh volw and volt in litres l in this equation represent the headspace volume original water volume and total volume in the sampling bag respectively the volh volw and volt in this study were 0 08 0 1 and 0 18 l respectively ka and ks in mol l 1 are the co2 solubility constants adjusted for analysis temperature and sample temperature respectively weiss 1974 we used the same equation and the temperature adjusted ch4 solubility constant weiss 1974 wiesenburg and guinasso 1979 to calculate pch4 2 5 air water co2 and ch4 fluxes in this study the ghg emission rates fco2 and fch4 at the air water interfaces were calculated via a widely used two layer model of gas diffusion the two layer model suggested that the gas diffusion flux across the air water interface was mainly determined by the partial pressure gradient and the gas exchange velocity k0 additionally we assumed gas exchange only through molecular diffusion obeying henry s law liss and slater 1974 the calculations of the gas fluxes of co2 and ch4 were all performed according to the following equation f gas k0 k h pgwater pgatm where k h is henry s law constant for fresh water unit mol l 1 atm 1 and corrected for water temperature pgwater and pgatm are the gas partial pressure in the water and the atmosphere respectively and k0 is the gas exchange velocity here k0 was computed with the following power function k0 k600 sc 600 0 5 sc for co2 1911 1 118 11 t 3 4527 t2 0 04132 t3 sc for ch4 1897 8 114 28 t 3 2902 t2 0 039061 t3 where sc is the schmidt number for co2 and ch4 adjusted by in situ water temperature and 0 5 is a moderately turbulent coefficient of the water surface that is used widely in river systems alin et al 2011 beaulieu et al 2012 campeau and del giorgio 2014 yu et al 2017 k600 is the standard piston velocity with an sc of 600 in previous studies the k600 at the water air interface showed great variability due to the effect of the wind speed and water turbulence therefore several studies have established relatively reliable empirical models based on wind speed or water currents for k600 estimation borges et al 2004 zappa et al 2003 while the wind speed based model has been used more commonly in large rivers or immobile or slow flowing water with reasonable accuracy fundamentally it is not appropriate for use in river systems with high water turbulence alin et al 2011 beaulieu et al 2012 given the different water currents between rivers and reservoirs in the cascade reservoir system the k600 values in this study were calculated by a composite model developed by borges et al 2004 that explicitly comprised both wind and water current induced turbulence k600 1 0 1 719 v h 0 5 2 58 u10 where v is the water flow velocity m s 1 and h is the water depth m u10 is the wind speed at a height of 10 m at each sampling site to further evaluate the uncertainty in the estimates of the k600 values we calculated k600 using six different models that were based on wind speed or hydrogeomorphic conditions e g water velocity slope the k 600 values used in this study were comparatively lower than those from the hydrogeomorphic model but slightly higher than those calculated from the wind speed based model fig s1 therefore the k600 based on borges s model in this study was a relatively conservative way to estimate fco2 and fch4 2 6 annual co2 and ch4 evasion a spatial interpolation technique had been employed to calculate the total annual co2 and ch4 evasion from wubu river firstly we used the rapideye remote sensing image with 1 m pixel to generate the rasterized geospatial layer of current river surface area by manual vectorization in arcgis 10 2 software the total water surface area of the wubu river mainstream was of 3 21 km2 because of the mountain topography with deep and narrow channel combining with regulation of cascade reservoirs a tiny riparian corridor was negligible secondly the kriging method in arcgis 10 2 software was employed to interpolate co2 and ch4 fluxes of each sampling site into the entire watershed of wubu river the rasterized geospatial layer of river water surface was then extracted and further was rasterized with 0 25 m2 unit block which resulted in a total of 12 837 416 blocks finally co2 and ch4 evasion was extracted in each blocks and total annual carbon gases flux amount of the cascaded river reservoir system was calculated as the sum of values in each rasterized 0 25 m2 blocks given that the water regulation and storage capacity of cascaded reservoir system in the mainstream of wubu river here we hypothesized that the water surface area was relatively consistent in different seasons meanwhile to evaluate the effect of cascade damming on the total co2 and ch4 evasion we used the dem image river morphology and measured river width of each river section to reconstruct the river water surface with no cascaded reservoirs because all sampling dams in our study were small cascade damming caused the water surface area increasing by only about 5 0 3 05 vs 3 21 km2 then only co2 and ch4 fluxes from river sections were used as input data for interpolation here we also hypothesized that the co2 and ch4 fluxes from river sections were not affected by the cascade damming 2 7 statistical analysis the normal distribution test and variance homogeneity test were performed for all measured variables using the shapiro wilk test when needed the variables were log transformed to follow the assumptions of normality and heteroscedasticity one way analysis of variance anova coupled with paired samples t tests pairwise comparison was employed to analyse the statistically significant differences in pco2 and pch4 among seasons sampling sites and different hydrological sections correlation analysis between pco2 pch4 and auxiliary environment parameters was conducted using pearson s correlations and linear regressions meanwhile stepwise multiple linear regression mlr and principal component analysis pca were used to explore the possible controls of co2 and ch4 emissions all of the variables recorded including water chemical variables tc tn tp doc dic no3 nh4 dtp po4 3 so3 2 do ph conductivity chl a temperature and hydrological factors flow velocity averaged depth discharge open water width sediment type were condensed by principal component analysis pca then an mlr with co2 and ch4 emissions as response variables was performed using all principal components with eigenvalues 1 as predictors the variables contributing most to the principal components included in the final mlr model were considered possible controls of co2 and ch4 emissions wang et al 2017b yu et al 2017 all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 0 spss inc usa the level of significance was p 0 05 for all tests 3 results 3 1 water chemistry variables the general characteristics of the measured water chemistry variables are shown in the si table s2 and figs s2 s3 the water temperature wt ranged from 12 6 to 28 5 average of 21 3 with the highest value in autumn mean 25 4 and the lowest in winter 14 4 water with weak alkalinity was present throughout the watershed with ph values ranging from 7 2 to 9 69 and ph was slightly lower in the river section than in the reservoirs and released water fig s2a the cascade river reservoir system showed abundant do 5 3 12 8 mean of 7 8 1 5 mg l 1 while the river and released water sections had typically lower do than the reservoirs in autumn winter and spring fig s2b meanwhile the chl a concentration as an important indicator of eutrophication presented strong spatial variation 0 9 51 5 μg l 1 and some extremely high values 10 μg l 1 were found in reservoir sections e g r3 r4 r5 res and ryx especially in spring and autumn fig s2c table s2 the water conductivity ranging from 260 to 1272 μs cm 1 showed a general increase along the flow direction and was also higher in impoundment sections than in other waters fig s2e all the chemical parameters measured in this study with the exception of the tic presented an increasing trend from the upper to the lower reaches of the wubu river fig 2 a 2b 2c there was no significant difference in the tn no3 n and nh4 n concentrations among the river reservoir and released water samples fig 2d the dtp po4 3 toc and doc concentrations in all river section samples were obviously lower than those in samples from the reservoir and released water sections fig 2e 2f in contrast the tic concentrations were higher in the river sections than in the others fig 2f meanwhile the average carbon and nitrogen concentrations of all sites showed conspicuous seasonal variation throughout the whole sampling period with higher tn no3 n nh4 n toc and doc concentrations occurring during spring than these in the other three seasons p 0 05 fig s3 3 2 pco2 and pch4 profile and temporal variability the pco2 in surface water varied substantially across the whole wubu river with a wide range of 97 to 6681 μatm fig 3 and table s3 the overall mean pco2 of all sampling sites was 1977 1210 μatm mean sd exceeding the average value of atmospheric equilibrium i e 400 μatm by a factor of 4 9 it was indicated that most of the surface water was strongly supersaturated with co2 meanwhile the pco2 value showed substantial variability with season and was comparatively higher in autumn 2475 1687 μatm and summer 2128 615 μatm than that in spring 1558 603 μatm and winter 1746 1388 μatm fig 3 in addition all of the samples with unsaturated pco2 400 were found in only some eutrophic reservoir sections in spring in this study the pch4 ranged from 39 to 1092 μatm corresponding saturation ratios of 113 2978 with average of 233 200 μatm saturation ratio of 660 559 the pch4 was generally oversaturated throughout the basin wide river reservoir system highlighting the wubu river as a net source of ch4 the arithmetic means of pch4 in autumn and spring were 329 254 μatm and 331 226 μatm with medians of 318 μatm and 267 μatm respectively respectively which were significantly higher than those in winter and summer with averages of 134 69 μatm and 139 58 μatm respectively anova p 0 05 fig 3 such a seasonal pattern of water pch4 was widespread in the river reservoir and released water sections fig s3 3 3 spatial variations in pco2 and pch4 along the cascade river reservoir system the pco2 and pch4 in the surface water showed remarkable spatial variations the watershed wide investigation indicated distinct downstream increases in pco2 and pch4 along the wubu river fig 4 a 4c although different spatial patterns appeared in different sampling periods fig s4 in spring the pco2 in the water even decreased downstream due to the high primary production in the lower reach fig s4 reservoir 2 w4 w6 and reservoir 5 w13 w15 had higher pco2 values than the other river reservoir systems and formed two hotspots in the wubu river while reservoirs 3 w8 4 w11 and es e2 had lower pco2 values due to the more serious eutrophication the pch4 increased continually from the first reservoir to the downstream reservoir in four investigations fig 4c the pco2 in the river sections ranged from 534 to 6681 μatm with an overall mean of 2604 1301 μatm for all samples which was significantly higher than that in the reservoir and released water sections means of 1485 974 μatm and 1763 971 μatm p 0 05 especially in spring and autumn fig 4b in each river reservoir continuum system the annual averaged pco2 in the river sections decreased by 7 83 average 42 compared to that in its downstream reservoir sections the pco2 in upstream of the ersheng river was 6 times higher than that in the reservoir zone e1 vs e2 in fig 4a released water sections had a moderate pco2 value in all river reservoir released water systems fig 4b the average pch4 in the released water sections was extremely high with a value of 326 265 μatm range of 90 to 1092 μatm nearly 3 0 times higher than that of the river sections 107 56 μatm p 0 01 especially in autumn and spring fig 4d meanwhile the average pch4 in all reservoir sections was of 228 156 μatm and was significantly higher than that in river sections p 0 01 in spring the pch4 in reservoir sections was 1 6 6 3 times higher than that of the corresponding upstream river sections as a result the pco2 showed a high low slightly low spatial pattern in each river reservoir released water alternate system while the pch4 exhibited a pattern of low high extremely high fig 4a and 4c such patterns for pco2 and pch4 were also verified downstream of the three tributaries ersheng river yaxi stream and lugou stream 3 4 relations of pco2 and pch4 with water chemistry variables the correlation analysis using all measurements as a whole demonstrated that pco2 was significantly and negatively correlated with ph do and chl a and positively correlated with tic p 0 01 fig 5 a simple linear regressions suggested that ph and chl a were powerful predictors of surface water pco2 in such a cascaded river reservoir system with linear regression coefficients r2 of 0 60 and 0 40 respectively fig 6 meanwhile the do and tic could explain 23 and 29 respectively of the variance in the pco2 fig 6 acting as relatively weak predictors there was no significant relationship between pco2 and the nutrient concentrations including tn inorganic nitrogen tp dtp po4 3 toc or doc fig 5a implying that the variation in c n and p across the cascaded river reservoir system would have a restricted influence on pco2 moreover when we aggregated measurements in the three different sections it is worth noting that do and chl a were consistently related to pco2 in the reservoir and released water sections with the explanatory power for pco2 variation exceeding 30 while it was not remarkable in the river sections fig 6c and 6d then the pco2 in the river sections was found to be related to the dtp and water temperature wt fig 5a however in any case ph was always the most relevant factor with water pco2 fig 5b and was included in all the mlr models fig 7 a the relationships of pch4 with water chemistry variables are shown in fig 5b the pch4 was positively correlated with dtp po4 3 doc toc water temperature ph do conductivity and chl a p 0 05 and was negatively correlated with tic and no3 p 0 05 in our cascaded river reservoir system however when using all measured pch4 data points the unary linear regressions indicated that most of the related factors such as no3 dtp water temperature ph and do had poor explanation for the variability of pch4 with r2 lower than 0 10 fig s7 although the correlation analyses were statistically significant p 0 05 the doc tic and chl a explained 37 21 and 20 of the total variation in pch4 respectively and were powerful indicators fig 8 for all reservoirs it was clear that chl a and do accounted for 32 and 21 of the total pch4 variation respectively and constituted a comprehensive influence on pch4 combined with doc and tic fig 8 comparatively the values of pch4 in released waters had strong correlations with organic carbon contents but no or weak correlations were observed with tic ph do and chl a significant correlations were found between pch4 and no3 doc tic or wt in the river reaches fig 5b there were different correlation factors influencing pch4 in river reservoir or released water sections and doc were included in the corresponding mlr model that resolved 37 of the total variance in pch4 fig 7b rda was performed to illustrate interrelations among the environmental variables over the entire cascaded river reservoir system and to show habitat differentiation the two principal components pc1 and pc2 resolved 51 and 15 respectively of the variance in the variables when using all data fig 9 the pco2 and fco2 were highly correlated with pc1 which consisted of do ph and chl a referred to as the biochemical capacity while pch4 and fch4 were correlated with pc2 which consisted of wt no3 doc and po4 3 referred to as the nutrients abundance in four seasons the data points from the river reservoir and released water sections showed clear differentiation fig 9 and co2 ph and chl a constituted an independent principal component orthogonal to the nutrient abundance and ch4 3 5 co2 and ch4 fluxes and annual emissions in this study the estimated k600 values used for gas flux calculations ranged from 7 4 to 20 5 cm h 1 and were on average 15 2 9 2 and 16 3 cm h 1 for the river reservoir and released water reaches respectively there were significantly lower k600 values for reservoir reaches than for river reaches and released water reaches due to the lower turbulence fig s1 based on pco2 and k0 the calculated co2 flux for each sampling site ranged from 10 2 481 2 mmol m 2 d 1 with an overall mean of 89 5 89 7 mmol m 2 d 1 and the lowest values were found in the ersheng reservoir 0 71 10 1 mmol m 2 d 1 a seriously eutrophic site similar to pco2 the fco2 in reservoir sections 40 8 27 3 mmol m 2 d 1 was much lower than that in river sections 135 6 35 0 mmol m 2 d 1 the fco2 in released water was at an intermediate level 86 5 38 9 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 10 in spring there were 4 reservoirs having a negative fco2 value and absorbing co2 from the atmosphere the averaged fch4 for each site ranged from 0 15 to 7 88 mmol m 2 d 1 average 1 19 1 18 mmol m 2 d 1 all released water sites had the highest fch4 in the river reservoir released water systems with an average of 2 09 0 93 mmol m 2 d 1 however because of the lower k600 the fch4 in the reservoir sections average of 0 85 0 35 mmol m 2 d 1 was comparable to that in the river sections 0 84 0 49 mmol m 2 d 1 despite the higher pch4 meanwhile when the ch4 fluxes were expressed as co2 equivalents co2 eq by assuming that the 100 year warming potential of ch4 was 25 times higher than that of co2 the c gas emissions in the river and released water sections were much higher than that in the reservoir section ch4 emissions contributed only 7 25 of the total c gas emissions from each site in the river sections but 24 98 mean of 46 and 33 69 mean of 45 in the reservoir and released water sections respectively therefore cascade damming obviously changed the component ch4 co2 ratio of effluent carbon gases from surface water we estimated the annual co2 and ch4 evasion from the entire mainstream of wubu river of 1 29 gg co2 c and 0 022 gg ch4 c while the estimated values from modelled river surface with no cascade damming were of 1 58 gg co2 c and 0 019 gg ch4 c thus it was evaluated that the total co2 evasion amount from wubu river mainstream were reduced by about 17 9 while the total ch4 evasion were increased by approximately 16 3 due to the effect of cascade damming 4 discussion 4 1 regulation of the specific section patterns of pco2 and pch4 by cascade damming damming has a far reaching effect on river water physicochemical conditions as well as related carbon biogeochemical processes meybeck 2003 in this study most of the water chemistry variables in the reservoir site were obviously discrepant from their upstream channel and released water especially all reservoirs had much higher chl a than that in river sections fig 2 figs s2 s3 implying enhanced aquatic photosynthesis and primary production the enhanced primary production could then increase the doc and toc accumulation but decrease dic via co2 consumption altering the riverine carbon biogeochemical processes zhong et al 2018 it was showed a significantly positive correlation between toc and doc with chl a fig s8 given that the toc and doc in water were mainly from runoff input and the growth of phytoplankton bukaveckas et al 2011 cole et al 2007 zhong et al 2020 as well as the weak water stratification and subsequent vertical profile disturbance due to the shallower depth 10 m table s1 the increase in phytoplankton biomass would be responsible for the high toc and doc in the surface waters of most sampled reservoirs while it has been suggested that the dic were mainly dominated by the input of land waters and the in situ photosynthetic absorption zhong et al 2020 which also caused decrease in the co2 co3 2 ratios and increase in ph wang et al 2015 in this study ph in the surface water indeed increased from the upstream river to the downstream reservoirs fig s2 and there were significantly positive correlations between chl a and ph explaining 47 of dic variation fig s8 hence dam construction increased autotrophic activity and changed the ph and organic carbon contents in riverine water potentially altering carbon metabolism and in situ ch4 and co2 dynamics in this study we provided a more integrated view of the distribution patterns of pco2 and pch4 in water across river reservoir released water alternating systems fig 4 similar to most previous studies borges et al 2015 butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 pco2 and pch4 had ubiquitous supersaturation with respect to atmospheric equilibrium across the wubu river basin with a few reservoir exceptions thus the system was an emitter of atmospheric co2 and ch4 the average pco2 1976 1210 μatm and pch4 233 200 μatm in the wubu river were lower than the average of global rivers pco2 of 3100 μatm pch4 937 3581 μatm bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 the pco2 in our study was also lower than those from most subtropical rivers such as the chongqing river network 3526 3493 μatm wang et al 2017b and the shanghai rural river 5076 2602 μatm yu et al 2017 however the pch4 were higher than those in the chongqing urban river network wang et al 2018 and were comparable to those in a human dominated river network in shanghai china yu et al 2017 meanwhile the pco2 and pch4 exhibited remarkable longitudinal variations along the wubu river as the result of gas concentration increases or decreases in reservoirs and localized ch4 concentration peaks in released water fig 4a 4c the amplitudes of variation in pco2 97 6681μatm and pch4 39 1092 μatm in such a small watershed were comparable to the measurements in the mississippi river basin crawford et al 2016 the congo river wang et al 2013 the han river jin et al 2018 and some regional river stream groups butman and raymond 2011 hope et al 2001 selvam et al 2014 table s4 the spatial variability of pco2 and pch4 with coefficients of variation 60 was much stronger than the seasonal variability therefore our direct measurements confirmed widespread carbon gases supersaturation and more importantly revealed generally lower pco2 moderate level pch4 and their strong variability in the cascade dam dominated mountainous river we further explored the pco2 variability among the river reservoir and releasing water in each river reservoir released water system it was suggested that damming significantly affected the spatial distribution of pco2 in local sections of the wubu river basin fig 4a first the pco2 values in impoundment affected sections and their released waters were generally lower fig 4a 4b only approximately 58 24 of that in the respective upstream channels thus resulting in typical longitudinal patterns of high pco2 in rivers and low pco2 in reservoirs across the cascade river reservoir system that was in agreement with the comparably low pco2 levels that have been reported from some impoundment reaches in the yangtze river liu et al 2016 mississippi river crawford et al 2016 han river jin et al 2018 and wuding river ran et al 2017 they attributed the low values of pco2 in impoundment reaches to enhanced primary production and phytoplankton co2 uptake high resolution spatial survey data in the upper mississippi river confirmed that riverine co2 concentrations were greatly reduced by intense photosynthesis fixation in dammed secitons houser et al 2015 in our study a negative relation between pco2 and chl a also suggsted that increased autotrophic activity due to channel impoundment played a crucial role in the decreased pco2 values in most reservoirs in addition although enhanced co2 efflux has been reported in newly created dams due to heterotrophic metabolism fuelled by flooded soil organic matter and vegetation barros et al 2011 teodoru et al 2011 such an initial stimulatory effect would decrease with prolonged reservoir age barros et al 2011 the ages of the eight reservoirs located in the wubu river basin all exceeded 30 years so the initial stimulatory effect was extremely weak rust et al 2022 therefore we highlighted that cascade dams and the resulting lentic systems playing a series of suppresser for riverine pco2 regulated the magnitude of co2 emissions in the cascade river reservoir systems nevertheless while cascade damming impaired the pco2 and subsequent emissions the river reservoir systems remained heterotrophic in contrast the continuous trapping of allochthonous and autochthonous organic materials and the creation of anaerobic environments by dam impoundment could provide favourable conditions for ch4 production via the anaerobic degradation of sediment organic carbon then caused the reservoirs to be an important ch4 emission hotspot compared with the flowing waters maeck et al 2013 crawford et al 2016 found weak co2 emissions but significantly increased ch4 concentrations and fluxes in the upper mississippi river affected by a number of low dams similar results have also been reported for other impoundment affected rivers including the han river jin et al 2018 congo river wang et al 2013 zambezi river teodoru et al 2015 and saar river maeck et al 2013 the cascade river reservoir system in the wubu river watershed extensively contributed to this paradigm during the whole sampling period nearly all reservoir sections in our study had significantly higher pch4 than river sections p 0 05 particularly in autumn and spring the pch4 in reservoirs averaged 2 1 0 7 5 9 and 2 8 1 4 6 2 times that in their upstream channels respectively in addition methanogenic sediment trapping in the forebays directly increased the dissolved ch4 concentrations in deep waters gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 maeck et al 2013 and thus high pch4 in released water was expected crawford et al 2016 gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 we observed the pch4 in the released water sections across the cascade river reservoir system was approximately 2 7 times 4 4 and 3 4 times in autumn and spring respectively these in river sections fig 4c 4d as the end result the pch4 in the wubu river presented a typical spatial pattern of low river high reservoir higher released water fig 4d the reservoir released water segments between two adjacent river sections were either a ch4 hotspot or an evident pch4 supercharger in the whole cascade river reservoir continuum fig 4c 4d meanwhile without inflow from tributaries the obvious pch4 loss between released water sections and subsequent river sections fig 4c 4d suggested potential massive ch4 releases from such reaches along the wubu river cascade dam construction created a series of reaches with high pch4 and altered the intensity and variability of the pch4 and ch4 emissions in the riverine system 4 2 seasonal variations in pco2 and pch4 the seasonal variation in pco2 in the wubu river basin which was highest in autumn followed by that in summer and lowest winter and spring fig 3 was consistent with observations in other rivers or reservoirs almeida et al 2017 hotchkiss et al 2015 knoll et al 2013 yang et al 2013b and could be explained by the seasonal temperature rainfall and co2 consumption by photosynthesis in the surface water knoll et al 2013 teodoru et al 2015 yang et al 2013b previous studies suggested that the summer usually had higher co2 concentrations than winter almeida et al 2017 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 wilkinson et al 2016 as result of the higher exogenous co2 and organic matter inputs and enhanced respiration in summer halbedel and koschorreck 2013 wang et al 2017b wilkinson et al 2016 this result was confirmed by our study however in this cascade river reservoir system river sections had different seasonal patterns and governing factors of pco2 than did the reservoir and released water sections fig 4b fig s4a for example the lowest pco2 of the river sections appeared in winter and could be driven by low temperature and weak runoff input while the lowest values in the reservoir sections were found in spring and could be attributed to intense primary production teodoru et al 2012 furthermore intense primary production in reservoir sections resulted in universally lower pco2 and poorer seasonal variability than that in river sections fig 4b fig s4a therefore the cascade river reservoir system had a more complex seasonal variation in pco2 and we recommend increasing high resolution temporal measuring efforts in different hydrological areas the pch4 levels in winter and summer were apparently lower than those in autumn and spring wherever in the river reservoir or released water sections exhibiting clear seasonal patterns figs 3 4d such seasonal pattern were also found in small reservoirs in chongqing metropolitan area wang et al 2017a the saar river a river influenced by cascade dams maeck et al 2013 and the guadalete river burgos et al 2015 it is generally acknowledged that water temperature and precipitation regime are two important factors that influence dissolved ch4 concentrations in river waters delsontro et al 2016 kemenes et al 2007 stanley et al 2016 high temperatures would promote in situ methanogenesis activities and oxygen consumption and the latter would then facilitate ch4 accumulation in water meanwhile rainfall on the one hand increases allochthonous organic matter and ch4 inputs from lateral soils stanley et al 2016 yu et al 2017 and on the other hand generates a dilution effect on dissolved ch4 concentrations when the flow surges and turbulence is enhanced beaulieu et al 2012 kone et al 2010 sawakuchi et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the lower pch4 in summer fig 4d fig s4b which violates the temperature cycle could be explained by a strong dilutive effect caused by continuous rain and flooding wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017a moreover exceptionally high ch4 concentrations are often observed in the peak algal bloom season in natural rivers or reservoirs wang et al 2018 yang et al 2013a yang et al 2011 algal blooms not only create a more anaerobic hypolimnion but also supply a large amount of organic matter when planktonic algae die all of which partly account for the high ch4 production gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 wang et al 2017a thus a wide range of eutrophication in the cascade river reservoir system of the wubu river especially in reservoir sections fig s2c may be responsible for the high pch4 in spring in addition the variation amplitudes of pco2 and pch4 observed in winter and summer were obviously low fig s4 they were probably dominated by the ubiquitously low carbon metabolism due to the low temperatures in winter and the homogenization of gas concentrations among rivers and reservoirs as a result of high flows in summer the higher variation amplitudes of pco2 and pch4 in autumn and spring were consistent with the high variability of chl a the altered biochemical process caused by cascade damming is an important mechanism for the seasonal variation in pco2 and pch4 and this influence is controlled by temperature and flow 4 3 environmental controls on surface water pco2 and pch4 cascade damming can reshape the relationship of carbon biochemical processes with water physicochemical properties shi et al 2017 wang et al 2021 here we found a strong negative relationship between the pco2 and ph value across the whole watershed and pco2 could be predicted well by an exponential function of ph such as pco2 3 108 e 1 516 ph r2 0 62 by the inverse algorithm a ph of 8 23 was the critical threshold condition for shifting from a co2 sink to a source similar results were also underscored in other researches e g wang et al 2017b and li et al 2013 the pco2 value was extremely sensitive to ph in inland water due to the transition of the carbonate equilibrium li et al 2013 ran et al 2017 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2017 wang et al 2021 also suggested that ph was the dominant indicator parameters for tracing pco2 characteristics in the inflowing and released water of a karst cascade reservoirs system wujiang china our survey found universally higher ph as result of enhanced photosynthesis in reservoirs wang et al 2015 could explain the lower pco2 in reservoir sections meanwhile the linear regression suggested that chl a concentration was an efficient explanatory variable for the variation in reservoir pco2 r2 0 52 while it could not account for that in river sections p 0 05 fig 6d the different responses of pco2 to chl a in river sections and reservoir sections highlighted the fragmented differentiation of co2 metabolism in the cascade river reservoir systems in turn affecting the spatial pattern of pco2 research in the increasingly impounded yangtze river basin by liu et al 2016 also highlighted that regional autotrophy increased and pco2 significantly decreased 60 in impounded areas therefore it is important to understand the damming effect on carbon biogeochemical process by comparing the difference among river reservoir and released water shi et al 2017 wang et al 2011 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 although variable among rivers and reservoirs chl a concentration might also be a crucial indicator of pco2 in rivers affected by cascade dams apart from the ph value while primary production in freshwater ecosystems is associated with dissolved co2 consumption and do generation in situ respiration can reduce do and produce co2 thus to some extent the correlation between pco2 and do could reflect the contribution of heterotrophic respiration to the excess of co2 burgos et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 the linear regression between pco2 and do across the whole system fig 6c suggested that at least a portion of the dissolved co2 was derived from the internal respiration of organic carbon in the water column burgos et al 2015 ran et al 2017 however there was a poor explanatory power of do for the pco2 variation in flowing waters r2 0 07 fig 6c while prominent explanatory power for these in reservoir r2 0 24 or released waters r2 0 27 this result implied that co2 source and dependence on heterotrophic respiration in different hydrological sections were much different in reservoirs the co2 generated from respiration may be fixed by autotrophic production which then dominates the correlation between do and pco2 argerich et al 2016 ran et al 2017 in river sections the nonmetabolic processes such as the input of inorganic carbon via runoff or groundwater pathways fed exogenous riverine co2 and disturb the relationship between do with pco2 lapierre et al 2016 lapierre et al 2013 stephen c maberly et al 2013 meanwhile do was replenished by exchange with the atmosphere due to higher flow velocity and turbulence in river sections moreover the indiscernible correlation between pco2 and doc in our study contradicted the standpoints of previous studies that doc played a crucial role in affecting pco2 as the substrate for in situ respiration halbedel and koschorreck 2013 larsen et al 2011 liu et al 2016 sobek et al 2003 this result further confirms that heterotrophic respiration in the water column plays a minor role in affecting pco2 in a whole river reservoir continuum and may be attributed to the confusion of the natural metabolic framework of rivers by cascade dams argerich et al 2016 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 knoll et al 2013 in addition to ph do and chl a we found a positive correlation of wt with pco2 when using all data despite a negligible explanation for the variation in river water pco2 fig s6 this result is consistent with previous studies in inland waters that suggested that temperature could determine the riverine pco2 by accelerating the co2 produced in rivers and the surrounding landscape almeida et al 2017 beaulieu et al 2012 campeau and del giorgio 2014 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 sobek et al 2003 however the temperature sensitivity of water pco2 could be disturbed by cascade damming on the river fig s6 in comparison with insensitive pco2 responses to organic carbon oc the significant correlation of pch4 with the toc and doc concentrations fig 5a 5b suggested that the controls on riverine pch4 were highly dependent internal factors researches have shown that the sedimentation of reactive organic carbon to deep anoxic sediment strata is essential determinant of pch4 in inland waters maeck et al 2013 shi et al 2017 linear regression between surface water pch4 and doc concentrations was unambiguous in the present study fig 8b and has also been observed in a series of other inland waters campeau and del giorgio 2014 crawford et al 2016 crawford and stanley 2016 kemenes et al 2007 this correlation may indicate that the alteration of surface water doc concentrations due to cascade impoundments could act as an effective predictor for the variability of ch4 emission on the one hand river cascade damming could capture suspended particles and lead to high oc accumulation borges et al 2015 delsontro et al 2011 delsontro et al 2016 maeck et al 2013 shi et al 2017 sobek et al 2012 on the other hand the long hydrological residence time favours microbial colonization and development delsontro et al 2016 kemenes et al 2007 wang et al 2021 and in turn drives high potential of methanogenesis maeck et al 2013 and shi et al 2017 suggested that cascade damming and oc trapping could create methane emission hotspots in rivers the exceptionally high pch4 in released waters fig 4c 4d also indicated high ch4 production and accumulation in the deep water zone of reservoirs our results implied that oc trapping could support methanogenesis and that the surface water doc content could be a strong predictor of pch4 alternatively the enhanced photosynthesis in impounded sections also increased the autochthonous production of oc then fuelling methanogenesis delsontro et al 2016 selvam et al 2014 wang et al 2017a in this study the reservoirs had higher chl a and toc than the river sections fig s2c fig 2c this result affirmed that the primary production in the surface water may be associated with oc enrichment the sedimentation of algal derived c molecules or carbohydrates with higher microbial bioavailability may activate microbial respiration and oxygen consumption and eventually promote in situ methanogenesis almeida et al 2016 gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 west et al 2012 while no statistical correlation was found between chl a and pch4 in river sections fig 5b the markedly increasing pch4 with increasing chl a in reservoir sections with a correlation coefficient of 0 68 p 0 001 fig 5b and 8d highlighted that the enhancement of photosynthetic assimilation as a result of impoundment was a potential mechanism for elevated pch4 and emissions in the cascade reservoirs the negative correlation of pch4 with tic fig 7c may also be regulated by in water photosynthesis implying that co2 absorption through primary production in aquatic ecosystems may promote ch4 production in our study the poor correlation between n and p concentrations in surface water and the c gas concentrations suggested that nutrient concentrations in surface water could not explain the variability of c gas concentrations in the cascade dammed river which was contrary to previous research in human affected rivers crawford and stanley 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2017 however rda analysis suggested that water physicochemical conditions and c gas concentrations presented distinct differentiations among river reservoir and released water sections fig 9a further implying that cascade damming results in the transformation of the river continuum into a series of bioreactors with different co2 and ch4 biogeochemical processes 4 4 annual co2 and ch4 emissions from the cascade river reservoir system and their implications based on the boundary layer model the estimated fco2 range of 10 2 481 mmol m 2 d 1 overall mean of 89 5 89 7 mmol m 2 d 1 in the wubu river basin was in the upper level of those from global freshwater systems streams and rivers reservoirs lakes raymond et al 2013 the average fco2 in this study was generally higher than that found in the yellow river basin ran et al 2017 and yangtze river basin liu et al 2016 and higher than the average co2 flux from china s lakes and reservoirs calculated by li et al 2018 table s4 however the fco2 in reservoir sections 40 8 27 3 mmol m 2 d 1 significantly lower than those in river sections 136 35 mmol m 2 d 1 was consistent with previous measurements in reservoirs or lakes table s4 high k600 and pco2 are both factors responsible for high co2 emissions from streams and rivers halbedel and koschorreck 2013 flowing sections in the cascade dammed river featuring higher pco2 and k600 persistently had a stronger co2 flux even comparable with the small urban reservoir that was suggested as a co2 emission hotspot wang et al 2017a yet simultaneously the reservoir sections were a minor co2 emitter therefore cascade damming could limit the high co2 emissions from montane rivers by enhancing the in situ primary production and weakening the surface disturbance the fch4 in our study range of 0 15 7 88 mmol m 2 d 1 overall mean of 1 24 1 19 mmol m 2 d 1 was also higher than that reported in the yangtze river basin huang et al 2017 and the average level of china s reservoirs li et al 2018 however the level of our fch4 was lower than the average level of global hydroelectric reservoirs estimated by li and zhang 2014 and that of global streams and rivers estimated by bastviken et al 2011 and stanley et al 2016 table s4 as predicted although reservoir sections had higher pch4 the average ch4 flux was approximately equal to that in river sections due to the lower k600 fig s1 in maeck s report the ch4 diffusive flux from the reservoir reach 0 25 mmol m 2 d 1 was also in close proximity to that from the riverine reach 0 20 mmol m 2 d 1 maeck et al 2013 additionally the exceptionally high pch4 in released waters implied that upstream reservoirs may act as potentially high ch4 stores and emission hotspots guerin et al 2006 kemenes et al 2007 teodoru et al 2012 as a result of high flow velocity and shallow water table s1 released waters 2 09 0 87 mmol m 2 d 1 as the indirect products of dammed rivers had more than twofold higher fch4 than the river and reservoir sections fig 10 thus we also highlighted that released waters sections acted as important ch4 emission hotspots should be given more attention finally our study highlighted that cascade damming may alter the assignment pattern of co2 and ch4 in the whole carbon gas emissions amount the ch4 flux expressed as co2 equivalents warming potential of ch4 over a 100 year period was 34 times that for co2 in rivers reservoirs and released water contributed 17 46 and 45 of the total carbon gas emissions respectively carbon trapping by cascade damming have driven rivers into an autotrophic state and have reduced the averaged co2 fluxes eutrophication however could enhance ch4 fluxes from lentic systems by supplying more decomposed phytoplankton litter almeida et al 2016 ana m morales williams 2020 thus reservoir sections had much higher ch4 co2 flux ratios in the present study meanwhile the annual co2 and ch4 evasion from the entire mainstream of wubu river were estimated of 1 29 gg co2 c and 0 022 gg ch4 c or 0 75 gg co2 eq c we evaluated that cascade damming would reduce about 17 9 of the total co2 evasion amount but increase approximately 16 3 of ch4 it was indicated that the global warming potential of rivers would be enhanced when oc is trapped and mineralized to ch4 rather than to co2 in the context of increasing dams in addition an earlier study in a cascade hydropower system suggested that the first reservoir among the cascade reservoirs would have the highest carbon gas fluxes due to oc trapping and the downstream reservoirs would have lower levels due to the reduction in sediment oc delsontro et al 2016 maeck et al 2013 shi et al 2017 in contrast our study showed that the co2 and ch4 fluxes increased from upstream to downstream fig 10 dissolved carbon and nutrient concentrations in surface water increased along the wubu river fig 2 fuelled heterotrophic metabolism in the water column and then contributed to carbon gas fluxes 4 5 limitation and inspiration through four intensive investigations for dissolved greenhouse gases in water we simultaneously estimated the co2 and ch4 fluxes the water air interface the water air interface from wubu cascade river reservoir released water system however there were still some limitations affecting our estimation on the one hand co2 and ch4 fluxes from water depend on the partial pressure of gases and piston coefficient k0 the k0 is considered to be controlled by water surface turbulence and wind alin et al 2011 damming reformed the riverine flow velocity depth and width and in turn altered water turbulence in this study while the k0 values in either turbulent river sections or placid reservoir sections were calculated using the empirical model based on comprehensive wind and water current induced turbulence although the k0 with a range of 7 4 to 21 8 cm h 1 was well within the range reported for rivers worldwide table s3 river sections averaged k0 of 15 2 cm h 1 was twofold higher than that in reservoirs 8 8 cm h 1 thus k0 seemed to be prominent differential sources for calculated co2 and ch4 emissions from lentic and lotic sections similar results were also found in other damming river system halbedel and koschorreck 2013 on the other hand our study did not take the bubble flux and turbine degassing into account which have been proven to be important ch4 emission components for placid water delsontro et al 2011 maeck et al 2013 mendonca et al 2012 teodoru et al 2015 especially for nutrient rich shallow reservoirs sobek et al 2012 it was found that ch4 ebullition accounted for 97 of the total ch4 emissions from reservoir section as a result of high sediment trapping but accounted for only 16 in upstream section maeck et al 2013 therefore because of the lower k600 and because ebullitive ch4 evasion was not included our method may seriously underestimate the fch4 in reservoir sections future work to measure ghg fluxes using floating chamber method and inverted funnel method is essential to better determine total co2 and ch4 fluxes and contribution of bubble flux in the dense cascade reservoirs we supplied a rare and novel dataset about the spatial and temporal patterns of ghg emissions and dynamics in the cascade damming river our findings suggested that cascade dams make fragmentation of riverine nutrient distribution and ghg dynamics however the response of in water heterotrophic respiration and methane metabolism to the cascade damming still lack more microbiological evidence thus future research to examine the impacts of cascade dams and carbon redistribution on the aquatic carbon metabolism and ch4 relevant microbial process is needed 5 conclusion this study investigated the spatial and temporal variations in pco2 and pch4 in a cascade river reservoir released water system wubu river and estimated the carbon gas fluxes from flowing channels reservoirs and released water the results demonstrated that the pco2 in upstream river sections was generally higher than that in the downstream reservoir sections while the pch4 was the opposite meanwhile released waters had invariably high pco2 and pch4 and were carbon gas emission hotspots in the cascade river reservoir system through capturing carbon and nutrients and slowing flow velocity cascade damming created a series of eutrophic hotspots that in turn inhibited riverine co2 emissions but promoted ch4 production ph do and chl a were indicated as natural controls on pco2 enhanced autotrophic production by cascade damming determined the unique spatial pattern of high pco2 in rivers and low pco2 in reservoirs doc tic and chl a were all found to have significant correlations with pch4 and could act as good predictors of ch4 emissions from the cascade river reservoir system this result indicated that the alteration of carbon metabolism in the water column coupled with carbon capturing accounted for the high spatial temporal variations in pch4 the temperature and autotrophic production regulated by cascaded damming were responsible for the different seasonal patterns of pco2 and pch4 observed between river sections and reservoir sections our study highlighted that cascaded basin damming decreased co2 emissions and created ch4 hotspots in river systems and then may have shifted the river from a carbon gas emissions continuum to a highly intercepted alternating discontinuity of weak and strong emitters cascade damming significantly enhanced the complexity of the spatial temporal pattern and ch4 co2 ratio of emissions particularly such variability of ch4 co2 flux ratio should be considered during the cleanliness evaluation of hydropower

3094,the damming of rivers can significantly intercept carbon transportation and regulate dynamic biogeochemistry which then greatly influence carbon gases co2 and ch4 metabolism and emissions however little is known about the spatial temporal pattern and controls of carbon emissions from a cascaded river reservoir system in this study we investigated the spatial and seasonal partial pressure of co2 and ch4 i e pco2 and pch4 dynamics along a subtropical cascaded dammed river wubu river located in southwest china the pco2 and pch4 in the wubu river basin showed significantly spatial temporal and were generally supersaturated with gas fluxes of 89 5 89 7 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 and 1 19 1 18 mmol ch4 m 2 d 1 the pco2 and pch4 were all increasing from upstream to downstream and most of river sections had significantly higher pco2 and co2 than their downstream reservoir sections while the pch4 and ch4 flux were the opposite meanwhile released waters had invariably high pco2 and pch4 and were carbon gas emission hotspots in the river reservoir system the intercepts of carbon and nutrients by cascade damming created a series of eutrophic hotspots and enhanced primary productivity could inhibit riverine co2 emissions but promote ch4 production thus the spatial patterns of riverine pco2 pch4 and the pco2 pch4 in cascade hydroelectric river were importantly altered it was evaluated that cascade damming would reduce about 17 9 of the total co2 evasion amount but increase approximately 16 3 of ch4 the global warming potential of rivers would be enhanced when organic carbon was captured and mineralized to ch4 rather than to co2 in cascade damming river system ph dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a chl a were indicated as natural controls of pco2 in such a cascade river reservoir system while dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic carbon and chl a were significantly correlated with pch4 and acted as good predictors of ch4 emissions the temperature and autotrophic production were responsible for the different seasonal patterns of carbon gas concentrations observed between river sections and reservoir sections our study highlighted that cascaded damming decreased co2 emissions and created ch4 hotspots in river systems and may have significantly increased the complexity of the spatial temporal pattern and construction of riverine carbon gases emissions given the increasing damming of rivers worldwide for energy demand researches are needed to quantify the role of cascaded damming in the riverine c budget keywords pco2 and pch4 cascaded damming river reservoir released water system nutrient content spatial and seasonal variation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years aquatic ecosystems including rivers lakes wetlands reservoirs and ponds have been widely recognized as important sources of greenhouse gas ghg to the atmosphere bastviken et al 2011 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 stanley et al 2016 yang et al 2015 rivers receiving large quantities of terrestrial carbon act as bioreactors of the organic carbon biogeochemical cycle cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 and are identified as the most important contributors to co2 and ch4 emissions from global aquatic ecosystems raymond et al 2013 recent estimates have indicated that global rivers and streams would release approximately 1 8 2 58 pg co2 and 26 8 tg ch4 per year cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 stanley et al 2016 respectively it has been suggested that co2 and ch4 emissions from river system offset an unexpectedly large portion of the continental carbon sink globally and even exceed the total carbon export to the ocean barros et al 2011 bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 however lots of rivers worldwide have been intensively dammed to relieve the increasing energy demand and severe water shortages grill et al 2019 there are at least 70 000 large dams storage depth 15 m and countless small reservoirs all over the world syvitski et al 2005 zarfl et al 2015 these dams have intercepted and deposited abundant carbon in reservoirs and then affected co2 and ch4 generations and emissions river damming has been linked with additional complexity and uncertainty for riverine carbon emissions crawford et al 2016 ran et al 2017 rust et al 2022 shi et al 2017 at least 278 7 tg co2 yr 1 and 9 7 tg ch4 yr 1 escaped from global reservoirs into the atmosphere barros et al 2011 hertwich 2013 and these amounts should not be disregarded river segmentation and disruption by dams accompanied by the change of hydrological processes water chemistry and hydraulic residence time shi 2017 yang and lu 2014 shi et al 2020 can strongly influence the accumulation of sediments and nutrients in reservoir kummu et al 2010 maavara et al 2015 syvitski et al 2005 globally dams intercept and store approximately 1 3 pg carbon from land syvitski et al 2005 and a portion of these carbon is ultimately converted into co2 and ch4 by microorganism decomposition tranvik et al 2009 supporting reservoirs as persistent co2 and ch4 emission hotspots maeck et al 2013 prairie et al 2018 a study in the lancang river by shi et al 2017 found that reservoirs generally had higher sediment oc and higher ch4 and co2 fluxes than the upstream reach in particular the elevated water column and accumulation of fine particle carbon in reservoir lead a shift in the sediments from aerobic to anaerobic may favour ch4 production galylacaux et al 1997 maeck et al 2013 and cause substantially high emissions from reservoir spillways turbines and downstream river reaches li and zhang 2014 maeck et al 2013 in maeck s study 2013 ch4 flux in reservoir reaches were more than two orders of magnitude higher than that in river reaches meanwhile the excessive availability of decomposable organic matter due to the flooding of terrestrial vegetation and soil was argued to fuel co2 and ch4 production in reservoirs especially in the first ten years after flooding barros et al 2011 therefore carbon intercept and sedimentation caused by damming may dramatically alter the patterns and strength of riverine ch4 and co2 emissions in addition to the enhancement effect on co2 and ch4 production river damming can also influence the consumption process of co2 and ch4 in rivers campeau and del giorgio 2014 crawford et al 2016 gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 stanley et al 2016 teodoru et al 2011 the impounding of rivers and the resultant lower flow velocity higher nutrition concentration and water stratification generally lead to a high probability of algal blooms and primary production enhancement and even shift rivers from heterotrophies to net autotrophy almeida et al 2016 crawford et al 2016 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2011 crawford et al 2016 found that phytoplankton production which was stimulated by a series of low head dams drove the widely undersaturated co2 in the upper mississippi river in addition ch4 oxidation could be enhanced in reservoirs because of the longer transmission time from the sediment to the water surface gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 despite the two sided effect much of the research suggested that damming could crucially enhance the ch4 emissions from natural river systems crawford et al 2016 delsontro et al 2016 guerin et al 2008 kemenes et al 2007 the effect of river damming on the co2 emissions was still indeterminate crawford et al 2016 prairie et al 2018 ran et al 2017 wang et al 2011 regardless hydropower development would greatly change the spatial temporal pattern of ghg emissions in river systems and subsequently lead to new patterns in reservoir river systems li and zhang 2014 shi et al 2017 however more comprehensive knowledge of the spatial temporal pattern of ghg emissions from rivers reservoirs systems are still limited relative to increasing demand for hydropower until now most of the current studies have concentrated on carbon emissions from single reservoirs while little attention has been given to the spatial temporal dynamics and controlling factors of carbon emissions from cascaded reservoir river systems crawford et al 2016 shi et al 2017 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2011 even though most of the mountain rivers have been affected by cascaded hydropower development chang et al 2010 tang and zhou 2012 shi et al 2017 found that co2 and ch4 emissions from cascade hydropower reservoirs along the lancang river exhibited observable spatial heterogeneity and the first upstream reservoir had the highest co2 and ch4 fluxes and ch4 co2 ratio due to a high amount of carbon trapping meanwhile a series of cascade low head dams along the upper mississippi river dominated the spatial patterns of co2 and ch4 fluxes by affecting primary productivity and organic matter accumulation crawford et al 2016 obviously cascade dams shift a river from a free flowing continuum to a highly intercepted river with an alternating discontinuity of lentic and lotic sections especially dense dams along small rivers and then altering the carbon distribution pattern and in situ metabolism liu et al 2016 these processes can greatly alter the spatial temporal patterns of the co2 and ch4 emissions in river systems delsontro et al 2016 ran et al 2017 shi et al 2017 even so the scarcity of data from integrated reservoir river systems is critical for a thorough understanding of their spatial temporal pattern of ghg fluxes and potential role in the global ghg budget in recent decades the growing demand for energy with the development of the global economy has impelled continued hydropower development worldwide in china which is one of the largest energy consumers huang and yan 2009 cascade hydropower plant utilization has already become a strategic decision for mitigating the energy crisis chang et al 2010 tang and zhou 2012 there is a substantial opportunity and urgent need to investigate the distribution pattern of ghg emissions from cascade reservoir river systems in this study direct measurements of pco2 and pch4 were carried out in a subtropical river reservoir system in southwest china the emission fluxes of co2 and ch4 from surface water to the atmosphere were calculated the main objective of this study was to clarify the cascade dam effect on the spatial temporal patterns of co2 and ch4 emissions from fluvial systems as well as to reveal the possible controlling factors of the co2 and ch4 concentrations and fluxes in the typical river reservoir system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the wubu river 28 10 32 13 n 105 11 110 11 e a southern tributary of the yangtze river is located in chongqing china with a basin area of 439 km2 fig 1 the study area has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 18 3 c a 20 year 1996 2016 averaged precipitation is 1072 mm and most of which 76 occurs in the wet season june august ren et al 2016 annual average of wind speed is of 0 95 m s 1 and presents indistinctive seasonal fluctuation due to the peculiar geomorphology the wubu river basin features the mountainous and hilly terrain and is fed by rainfalls it is a typical mountain river with an average slope of 5 27 and the total fall between river ends amounts to 800 m the annual average of discharge and flow velocity in wubu river estuary are about 14 8 m3 s 1 and 1 35 m s 1 respectively detailed variation of hydrological and meteorological parameters was presented in supplementary information si table s1 the main types of land use in the wubu river basin are forest and cultivated land and a few sporadic urban lands are distributed in the downstream area there are three major tributaries along the wubu river catchment the ersheng river yaxi river and lugou stream with a large riverbed gradient and enormous hydropower potential there were over 10 dams built on the mainstream and tributaries of the wubu river by 2014 including chaeryan ce xiaoguan xg jianghe jh xitan xt yangjiadu yj ersheng es jianshan js and mofang mf and so on fig 1 most of these dams were constructed during the 1970 s and 1980 s for hydropower generation or irrigation these dams have created a series of cascade reservoirs whose main features are described in table s1 in our study ce xg jh xt and yj on the wubu river r1 r5 in fig 1 and es js and mf located on the ersheng river yaxi stream and lugou stream respectively shown as res ryx and rlg respectively in fig 1 were selected to perform the seasonal investigation on co2 and ch4 concentrations in surface water all 8 dams were built for power generation and the reservoir ages are over 33 years fig 1 the sampled dams are relatively small in size with heights and lengths ranging from 4 to 16 m and from 22 to 90 m respectively table s1 the backwater lengths of the selected reservoirs ranged from 0 6 to 3 2 km in each dam segment we selected 3 sections representing the river or inflow reservoir and released water respectively fig 1 depending on the range of the backwater area and the reservoir operation mode additionally we selected 3 repetitive sampling sites in each section which resulted in a total of 75 sampling sites on the mainstream and tributaries of the wubu river fig 1 currently r4 r5 and res are in state of eutrophication in warm seasons as the result of agricultural runoff and adjacent town effluent discharge 2 2 sample collection we conducted four sampling expeditions quarterly from september 2014 to june 2015 to determine the water chemistry and co2 and ch4 concentrations at each sampling site each sampling contained three replicates at each site 500 ml of surface water sample 30 cm depth under the water surface was collected using an organic glass hydrophore and held in acid washed 0 5 l high density polyethylene containers for water chemistry analyses for the determination of co2 and ch4 concentrations we used a 100 ml syringe to extract 100 ml of bubble free surface water and promptly injected it into a vacuum sealed aluminium foil bag that was inert to greenhouse gases the maximum capacity of 200 ml then 0 2 ml of saturated mercuric chloride was injected to stop microbial metabolism meanwhile three 100 ml in situ atmospheric gas samples 1 m above the water surface were collected and injected into a vacuum sealed gas sample bag to measure atmospheric background concentrations all water samples were preserved at 4 c and analysed within 7 days in situ water surface water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity turb conductivity con and chlorophyll a chl a were measured by a calibrated mantatm2 multiparameter system eureka company usa an anemogram kestrel 2500 usa was employed to record the in situ air temperature at wind speed u and air pressure in addition we measured the river width m flow velocity v and water depth h using a diastimeter current metre and depth metre respectively 2 3 sample analysis the headspace method was employed to measure dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations we firstly injected 80 ml of high purity n2 into the vacuum sealed aluminium foil bag that was filled with 100 ml water sample to create headspace then the air bag was shaken violently for 5 min to allow the dissolved gases to escape and to reach equilibrium between the liquid and gas phases koschorreck et al 2021 20 ml of headspace gas were then extracted separately and analysed by a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a agilent co usa equipped with an ecd detector to measure the co2 and ch4 concentration meanwhile 10 ml in situ gas samples were also measured for the atmospheric background concentration three commercial gas standards 300 1000 and 10 000 ppm for co2 and 2 20 and 200 ppm for ch4 were used for calibration moreover the chemical parameters of the surface water were measured in this study to analyse the potential factors regulating the co2 and ch4 emissions the total nitrogen tn were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry after water sample digestion using alkaline potassium persulfate as oxidant nitrate nitrogen no3 and ammonia nitrogen nh4 were analysed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and nessler s reagent spectrophotometry respectively using the filtered water samples total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus dtp and orthophosphate po4 3 were all determined via alkaline k2s2o8 mo sb anti luminosity wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b the analytical procedures were in accordance with the china national standard method https www sac gov cn doc and dic were measured using a toc analyser multi n c 2100 jena germany the details are described in the supporting information si 2 4 calculation of pco2 and pch4 the original surface water pco2 and pch4 were calculated with the solubility constant corrected for temperature and the volume ratio of headspace to water in the aluminium foil bag according to the following equation yu et al 2017 p co 2 p co 2 h 1 v m vol h p co 2 h k a vol w vol t 1 k s where pco2 h represents the equilibrated pco2 in the headspace unit in μatm vm in l mol 1 is the gas molar volume at the analytic temperature and volh volw and volt in litres l in this equation represent the headspace volume original water volume and total volume in the sampling bag respectively the volh volw and volt in this study were 0 08 0 1 and 0 18 l respectively ka and ks in mol l 1 are the co2 solubility constants adjusted for analysis temperature and sample temperature respectively weiss 1974 we used the same equation and the temperature adjusted ch4 solubility constant weiss 1974 wiesenburg and guinasso 1979 to calculate pch4 2 5 air water co2 and ch4 fluxes in this study the ghg emission rates fco2 and fch4 at the air water interfaces were calculated via a widely used two layer model of gas diffusion the two layer model suggested that the gas diffusion flux across the air water interface was mainly determined by the partial pressure gradient and the gas exchange velocity k0 additionally we assumed gas exchange only through molecular diffusion obeying henry s law liss and slater 1974 the calculations of the gas fluxes of co2 and ch4 were all performed according to the following equation f gas k0 k h pgwater pgatm where k h is henry s law constant for fresh water unit mol l 1 atm 1 and corrected for water temperature pgwater and pgatm are the gas partial pressure in the water and the atmosphere respectively and k0 is the gas exchange velocity here k0 was computed with the following power function k0 k600 sc 600 0 5 sc for co2 1911 1 118 11 t 3 4527 t2 0 04132 t3 sc for ch4 1897 8 114 28 t 3 2902 t2 0 039061 t3 where sc is the schmidt number for co2 and ch4 adjusted by in situ water temperature and 0 5 is a moderately turbulent coefficient of the water surface that is used widely in river systems alin et al 2011 beaulieu et al 2012 campeau and del giorgio 2014 yu et al 2017 k600 is the standard piston velocity with an sc of 600 in previous studies the k600 at the water air interface showed great variability due to the effect of the wind speed and water turbulence therefore several studies have established relatively reliable empirical models based on wind speed or water currents for k600 estimation borges et al 2004 zappa et al 2003 while the wind speed based model has been used more commonly in large rivers or immobile or slow flowing water with reasonable accuracy fundamentally it is not appropriate for use in river systems with high water turbulence alin et al 2011 beaulieu et al 2012 given the different water currents between rivers and reservoirs in the cascade reservoir system the k600 values in this study were calculated by a composite model developed by borges et al 2004 that explicitly comprised both wind and water current induced turbulence k600 1 0 1 719 v h 0 5 2 58 u10 where v is the water flow velocity m s 1 and h is the water depth m u10 is the wind speed at a height of 10 m at each sampling site to further evaluate the uncertainty in the estimates of the k600 values we calculated k600 using six different models that were based on wind speed or hydrogeomorphic conditions e g water velocity slope the k 600 values used in this study were comparatively lower than those from the hydrogeomorphic model but slightly higher than those calculated from the wind speed based model fig s1 therefore the k600 based on borges s model in this study was a relatively conservative way to estimate fco2 and fch4 2 6 annual co2 and ch4 evasion a spatial interpolation technique had been employed to calculate the total annual co2 and ch4 evasion from wubu river firstly we used the rapideye remote sensing image with 1 m pixel to generate the rasterized geospatial layer of current river surface area by manual vectorization in arcgis 10 2 software the total water surface area of the wubu river mainstream was of 3 21 km2 because of the mountain topography with deep and narrow channel combining with regulation of cascade reservoirs a tiny riparian corridor was negligible secondly the kriging method in arcgis 10 2 software was employed to interpolate co2 and ch4 fluxes of each sampling site into the entire watershed of wubu river the rasterized geospatial layer of river water surface was then extracted and further was rasterized with 0 25 m2 unit block which resulted in a total of 12 837 416 blocks finally co2 and ch4 evasion was extracted in each blocks and total annual carbon gases flux amount of the cascaded river reservoir system was calculated as the sum of values in each rasterized 0 25 m2 blocks given that the water regulation and storage capacity of cascaded reservoir system in the mainstream of wubu river here we hypothesized that the water surface area was relatively consistent in different seasons meanwhile to evaluate the effect of cascade damming on the total co2 and ch4 evasion we used the dem image river morphology and measured river width of each river section to reconstruct the river water surface with no cascaded reservoirs because all sampling dams in our study were small cascade damming caused the water surface area increasing by only about 5 0 3 05 vs 3 21 km2 then only co2 and ch4 fluxes from river sections were used as input data for interpolation here we also hypothesized that the co2 and ch4 fluxes from river sections were not affected by the cascade damming 2 7 statistical analysis the normal distribution test and variance homogeneity test were performed for all measured variables using the shapiro wilk test when needed the variables were log transformed to follow the assumptions of normality and heteroscedasticity one way analysis of variance anova coupled with paired samples t tests pairwise comparison was employed to analyse the statistically significant differences in pco2 and pch4 among seasons sampling sites and different hydrological sections correlation analysis between pco2 pch4 and auxiliary environment parameters was conducted using pearson s correlations and linear regressions meanwhile stepwise multiple linear regression mlr and principal component analysis pca were used to explore the possible controls of co2 and ch4 emissions all of the variables recorded including water chemical variables tc tn tp doc dic no3 nh4 dtp po4 3 so3 2 do ph conductivity chl a temperature and hydrological factors flow velocity averaged depth discharge open water width sediment type were condensed by principal component analysis pca then an mlr with co2 and ch4 emissions as response variables was performed using all principal components with eigenvalues 1 as predictors the variables contributing most to the principal components included in the final mlr model were considered possible controls of co2 and ch4 emissions wang et al 2017b yu et al 2017 all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 0 spss inc usa the level of significance was p 0 05 for all tests 3 results 3 1 water chemistry variables the general characteristics of the measured water chemistry variables are shown in the si table s2 and figs s2 s3 the water temperature wt ranged from 12 6 to 28 5 average of 21 3 with the highest value in autumn mean 25 4 and the lowest in winter 14 4 water with weak alkalinity was present throughout the watershed with ph values ranging from 7 2 to 9 69 and ph was slightly lower in the river section than in the reservoirs and released water fig s2a the cascade river reservoir system showed abundant do 5 3 12 8 mean of 7 8 1 5 mg l 1 while the river and released water sections had typically lower do than the reservoirs in autumn winter and spring fig s2b meanwhile the chl a concentration as an important indicator of eutrophication presented strong spatial variation 0 9 51 5 μg l 1 and some extremely high values 10 μg l 1 were found in reservoir sections e g r3 r4 r5 res and ryx especially in spring and autumn fig s2c table s2 the water conductivity ranging from 260 to 1272 μs cm 1 showed a general increase along the flow direction and was also higher in impoundment sections than in other waters fig s2e all the chemical parameters measured in this study with the exception of the tic presented an increasing trend from the upper to the lower reaches of the wubu river fig 2 a 2b 2c there was no significant difference in the tn no3 n and nh4 n concentrations among the river reservoir and released water samples fig 2d the dtp po4 3 toc and doc concentrations in all river section samples were obviously lower than those in samples from the reservoir and released water sections fig 2e 2f in contrast the tic concentrations were higher in the river sections than in the others fig 2f meanwhile the average carbon and nitrogen concentrations of all sites showed conspicuous seasonal variation throughout the whole sampling period with higher tn no3 n nh4 n toc and doc concentrations occurring during spring than these in the other three seasons p 0 05 fig s3 3 2 pco2 and pch4 profile and temporal variability the pco2 in surface water varied substantially across the whole wubu river with a wide range of 97 to 6681 μatm fig 3 and table s3 the overall mean pco2 of all sampling sites was 1977 1210 μatm mean sd exceeding the average value of atmospheric equilibrium i e 400 μatm by a factor of 4 9 it was indicated that most of the surface water was strongly supersaturated with co2 meanwhile the pco2 value showed substantial variability with season and was comparatively higher in autumn 2475 1687 μatm and summer 2128 615 μatm than that in spring 1558 603 μatm and winter 1746 1388 μatm fig 3 in addition all of the samples with unsaturated pco2 400 were found in only some eutrophic reservoir sections in spring in this study the pch4 ranged from 39 to 1092 μatm corresponding saturation ratios of 113 2978 with average of 233 200 μatm saturation ratio of 660 559 the pch4 was generally oversaturated throughout the basin wide river reservoir system highlighting the wubu river as a net source of ch4 the arithmetic means of pch4 in autumn and spring were 329 254 μatm and 331 226 μatm with medians of 318 μatm and 267 μatm respectively respectively which were significantly higher than those in winter and summer with averages of 134 69 μatm and 139 58 μatm respectively anova p 0 05 fig 3 such a seasonal pattern of water pch4 was widespread in the river reservoir and released water sections fig s3 3 3 spatial variations in pco2 and pch4 along the cascade river reservoir system the pco2 and pch4 in the surface water showed remarkable spatial variations the watershed wide investigation indicated distinct downstream increases in pco2 and pch4 along the wubu river fig 4 a 4c although different spatial patterns appeared in different sampling periods fig s4 in spring the pco2 in the water even decreased downstream due to the high primary production in the lower reach fig s4 reservoir 2 w4 w6 and reservoir 5 w13 w15 had higher pco2 values than the other river reservoir systems and formed two hotspots in the wubu river while reservoirs 3 w8 4 w11 and es e2 had lower pco2 values due to the more serious eutrophication the pch4 increased continually from the first reservoir to the downstream reservoir in four investigations fig 4c the pco2 in the river sections ranged from 534 to 6681 μatm with an overall mean of 2604 1301 μatm for all samples which was significantly higher than that in the reservoir and released water sections means of 1485 974 μatm and 1763 971 μatm p 0 05 especially in spring and autumn fig 4b in each river reservoir continuum system the annual averaged pco2 in the river sections decreased by 7 83 average 42 compared to that in its downstream reservoir sections the pco2 in upstream of the ersheng river was 6 times higher than that in the reservoir zone e1 vs e2 in fig 4a released water sections had a moderate pco2 value in all river reservoir released water systems fig 4b the average pch4 in the released water sections was extremely high with a value of 326 265 μatm range of 90 to 1092 μatm nearly 3 0 times higher than that of the river sections 107 56 μatm p 0 01 especially in autumn and spring fig 4d meanwhile the average pch4 in all reservoir sections was of 228 156 μatm and was significantly higher than that in river sections p 0 01 in spring the pch4 in reservoir sections was 1 6 6 3 times higher than that of the corresponding upstream river sections as a result the pco2 showed a high low slightly low spatial pattern in each river reservoir released water alternate system while the pch4 exhibited a pattern of low high extremely high fig 4a and 4c such patterns for pco2 and pch4 were also verified downstream of the three tributaries ersheng river yaxi stream and lugou stream 3 4 relations of pco2 and pch4 with water chemistry variables the correlation analysis using all measurements as a whole demonstrated that pco2 was significantly and negatively correlated with ph do and chl a and positively correlated with tic p 0 01 fig 5 a simple linear regressions suggested that ph and chl a were powerful predictors of surface water pco2 in such a cascaded river reservoir system with linear regression coefficients r2 of 0 60 and 0 40 respectively fig 6 meanwhile the do and tic could explain 23 and 29 respectively of the variance in the pco2 fig 6 acting as relatively weak predictors there was no significant relationship between pco2 and the nutrient concentrations including tn inorganic nitrogen tp dtp po4 3 toc or doc fig 5a implying that the variation in c n and p across the cascaded river reservoir system would have a restricted influence on pco2 moreover when we aggregated measurements in the three different sections it is worth noting that do and chl a were consistently related to pco2 in the reservoir and released water sections with the explanatory power for pco2 variation exceeding 30 while it was not remarkable in the river sections fig 6c and 6d then the pco2 in the river sections was found to be related to the dtp and water temperature wt fig 5a however in any case ph was always the most relevant factor with water pco2 fig 5b and was included in all the mlr models fig 7 a the relationships of pch4 with water chemistry variables are shown in fig 5b the pch4 was positively correlated with dtp po4 3 doc toc water temperature ph do conductivity and chl a p 0 05 and was negatively correlated with tic and no3 p 0 05 in our cascaded river reservoir system however when using all measured pch4 data points the unary linear regressions indicated that most of the related factors such as no3 dtp water temperature ph and do had poor explanation for the variability of pch4 with r2 lower than 0 10 fig s7 although the correlation analyses were statistically significant p 0 05 the doc tic and chl a explained 37 21 and 20 of the total variation in pch4 respectively and were powerful indicators fig 8 for all reservoirs it was clear that chl a and do accounted for 32 and 21 of the total pch4 variation respectively and constituted a comprehensive influence on pch4 combined with doc and tic fig 8 comparatively the values of pch4 in released waters had strong correlations with organic carbon contents but no or weak correlations were observed with tic ph do and chl a significant correlations were found between pch4 and no3 doc tic or wt in the river reaches fig 5b there were different correlation factors influencing pch4 in river reservoir or released water sections and doc were included in the corresponding mlr model that resolved 37 of the total variance in pch4 fig 7b rda was performed to illustrate interrelations among the environmental variables over the entire cascaded river reservoir system and to show habitat differentiation the two principal components pc1 and pc2 resolved 51 and 15 respectively of the variance in the variables when using all data fig 9 the pco2 and fco2 were highly correlated with pc1 which consisted of do ph and chl a referred to as the biochemical capacity while pch4 and fch4 were correlated with pc2 which consisted of wt no3 doc and po4 3 referred to as the nutrients abundance in four seasons the data points from the river reservoir and released water sections showed clear differentiation fig 9 and co2 ph and chl a constituted an independent principal component orthogonal to the nutrient abundance and ch4 3 5 co2 and ch4 fluxes and annual emissions in this study the estimated k600 values used for gas flux calculations ranged from 7 4 to 20 5 cm h 1 and were on average 15 2 9 2 and 16 3 cm h 1 for the river reservoir and released water reaches respectively there were significantly lower k600 values for reservoir reaches than for river reaches and released water reaches due to the lower turbulence fig s1 based on pco2 and k0 the calculated co2 flux for each sampling site ranged from 10 2 481 2 mmol m 2 d 1 with an overall mean of 89 5 89 7 mmol m 2 d 1 and the lowest values were found in the ersheng reservoir 0 71 10 1 mmol m 2 d 1 a seriously eutrophic site similar to pco2 the fco2 in reservoir sections 40 8 27 3 mmol m 2 d 1 was much lower than that in river sections 135 6 35 0 mmol m 2 d 1 the fco2 in released water was at an intermediate level 86 5 38 9 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 10 in spring there were 4 reservoirs having a negative fco2 value and absorbing co2 from the atmosphere the averaged fch4 for each site ranged from 0 15 to 7 88 mmol m 2 d 1 average 1 19 1 18 mmol m 2 d 1 all released water sites had the highest fch4 in the river reservoir released water systems with an average of 2 09 0 93 mmol m 2 d 1 however because of the lower k600 the fch4 in the reservoir sections average of 0 85 0 35 mmol m 2 d 1 was comparable to that in the river sections 0 84 0 49 mmol m 2 d 1 despite the higher pch4 meanwhile when the ch4 fluxes were expressed as co2 equivalents co2 eq by assuming that the 100 year warming potential of ch4 was 25 times higher than that of co2 the c gas emissions in the river and released water sections were much higher than that in the reservoir section ch4 emissions contributed only 7 25 of the total c gas emissions from each site in the river sections but 24 98 mean of 46 and 33 69 mean of 45 in the reservoir and released water sections respectively therefore cascade damming obviously changed the component ch4 co2 ratio of effluent carbon gases from surface water we estimated the annual co2 and ch4 evasion from the entire mainstream of wubu river of 1 29 gg co2 c and 0 022 gg ch4 c while the estimated values from modelled river surface with no cascade damming were of 1 58 gg co2 c and 0 019 gg ch4 c thus it was evaluated that the total co2 evasion amount from wubu river mainstream were reduced by about 17 9 while the total ch4 evasion were increased by approximately 16 3 due to the effect of cascade damming 4 discussion 4 1 regulation of the specific section patterns of pco2 and pch4 by cascade damming damming has a far reaching effect on river water physicochemical conditions as well as related carbon biogeochemical processes meybeck 2003 in this study most of the water chemistry variables in the reservoir site were obviously discrepant from their upstream channel and released water especially all reservoirs had much higher chl a than that in river sections fig 2 figs s2 s3 implying enhanced aquatic photosynthesis and primary production the enhanced primary production could then increase the doc and toc accumulation but decrease dic via co2 consumption altering the riverine carbon biogeochemical processes zhong et al 2018 it was showed a significantly positive correlation between toc and doc with chl a fig s8 given that the toc and doc in water were mainly from runoff input and the growth of phytoplankton bukaveckas et al 2011 cole et al 2007 zhong et al 2020 as well as the weak water stratification and subsequent vertical profile disturbance due to the shallower depth 10 m table s1 the increase in phytoplankton biomass would be responsible for the high toc and doc in the surface waters of most sampled reservoirs while it has been suggested that the dic were mainly dominated by the input of land waters and the in situ photosynthetic absorption zhong et al 2020 which also caused decrease in the co2 co3 2 ratios and increase in ph wang et al 2015 in this study ph in the surface water indeed increased from the upstream river to the downstream reservoirs fig s2 and there were significantly positive correlations between chl a and ph explaining 47 of dic variation fig s8 hence dam construction increased autotrophic activity and changed the ph and organic carbon contents in riverine water potentially altering carbon metabolism and in situ ch4 and co2 dynamics in this study we provided a more integrated view of the distribution patterns of pco2 and pch4 in water across river reservoir released water alternating systems fig 4 similar to most previous studies borges et al 2015 butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 pco2 and pch4 had ubiquitous supersaturation with respect to atmospheric equilibrium across the wubu river basin with a few reservoir exceptions thus the system was an emitter of atmospheric co2 and ch4 the average pco2 1976 1210 μatm and pch4 233 200 μatm in the wubu river were lower than the average of global rivers pco2 of 3100 μatm pch4 937 3581 μatm bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 the pco2 in our study was also lower than those from most subtropical rivers such as the chongqing river network 3526 3493 μatm wang et al 2017b and the shanghai rural river 5076 2602 μatm yu et al 2017 however the pch4 were higher than those in the chongqing urban river network wang et al 2018 and were comparable to those in a human dominated river network in shanghai china yu et al 2017 meanwhile the pco2 and pch4 exhibited remarkable longitudinal variations along the wubu river as the result of gas concentration increases or decreases in reservoirs and localized ch4 concentration peaks in released water fig 4a 4c the amplitudes of variation in pco2 97 6681μatm and pch4 39 1092 μatm in such a small watershed were comparable to the measurements in the mississippi river basin crawford et al 2016 the congo river wang et al 2013 the han river jin et al 2018 and some regional river stream groups butman and raymond 2011 hope et al 2001 selvam et al 2014 table s4 the spatial variability of pco2 and pch4 with coefficients of variation 60 was much stronger than the seasonal variability therefore our direct measurements confirmed widespread carbon gases supersaturation and more importantly revealed generally lower pco2 moderate level pch4 and their strong variability in the cascade dam dominated mountainous river we further explored the pco2 variability among the river reservoir and releasing water in each river reservoir released water system it was suggested that damming significantly affected the spatial distribution of pco2 in local sections of the wubu river basin fig 4a first the pco2 values in impoundment affected sections and their released waters were generally lower fig 4a 4b only approximately 58 24 of that in the respective upstream channels thus resulting in typical longitudinal patterns of high pco2 in rivers and low pco2 in reservoirs across the cascade river reservoir system that was in agreement with the comparably low pco2 levels that have been reported from some impoundment reaches in the yangtze river liu et al 2016 mississippi river crawford et al 2016 han river jin et al 2018 and wuding river ran et al 2017 they attributed the low values of pco2 in impoundment reaches to enhanced primary production and phytoplankton co2 uptake high resolution spatial survey data in the upper mississippi river confirmed that riverine co2 concentrations were greatly reduced by intense photosynthesis fixation in dammed secitons houser et al 2015 in our study a negative relation between pco2 and chl a also suggsted that increased autotrophic activity due to channel impoundment played a crucial role in the decreased pco2 values in most reservoirs in addition although enhanced co2 efflux has been reported in newly created dams due to heterotrophic metabolism fuelled by flooded soil organic matter and vegetation barros et al 2011 teodoru et al 2011 such an initial stimulatory effect would decrease with prolonged reservoir age barros et al 2011 the ages of the eight reservoirs located in the wubu river basin all exceeded 30 years so the initial stimulatory effect was extremely weak rust et al 2022 therefore we highlighted that cascade dams and the resulting lentic systems playing a series of suppresser for riverine pco2 regulated the magnitude of co2 emissions in the cascade river reservoir systems nevertheless while cascade damming impaired the pco2 and subsequent emissions the river reservoir systems remained heterotrophic in contrast the continuous trapping of allochthonous and autochthonous organic materials and the creation of anaerobic environments by dam impoundment could provide favourable conditions for ch4 production via the anaerobic degradation of sediment organic carbon then caused the reservoirs to be an important ch4 emission hotspot compared with the flowing waters maeck et al 2013 crawford et al 2016 found weak co2 emissions but significantly increased ch4 concentrations and fluxes in the upper mississippi river affected by a number of low dams similar results have also been reported for other impoundment affected rivers including the han river jin et al 2018 congo river wang et al 2013 zambezi river teodoru et al 2015 and saar river maeck et al 2013 the cascade river reservoir system in the wubu river watershed extensively contributed to this paradigm during the whole sampling period nearly all reservoir sections in our study had significantly higher pch4 than river sections p 0 05 particularly in autumn and spring the pch4 in reservoirs averaged 2 1 0 7 5 9 and 2 8 1 4 6 2 times that in their upstream channels respectively in addition methanogenic sediment trapping in the forebays directly increased the dissolved ch4 concentrations in deep waters gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 maeck et al 2013 and thus high pch4 in released water was expected crawford et al 2016 gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 we observed the pch4 in the released water sections across the cascade river reservoir system was approximately 2 7 times 4 4 and 3 4 times in autumn and spring respectively these in river sections fig 4c 4d as the end result the pch4 in the wubu river presented a typical spatial pattern of low river high reservoir higher released water fig 4d the reservoir released water segments between two adjacent river sections were either a ch4 hotspot or an evident pch4 supercharger in the whole cascade river reservoir continuum fig 4c 4d meanwhile without inflow from tributaries the obvious pch4 loss between released water sections and subsequent river sections fig 4c 4d suggested potential massive ch4 releases from such reaches along the wubu river cascade dam construction created a series of reaches with high pch4 and altered the intensity and variability of the pch4 and ch4 emissions in the riverine system 4 2 seasonal variations in pco2 and pch4 the seasonal variation in pco2 in the wubu river basin which was highest in autumn followed by that in summer and lowest winter and spring fig 3 was consistent with observations in other rivers or reservoirs almeida et al 2017 hotchkiss et al 2015 knoll et al 2013 yang et al 2013b and could be explained by the seasonal temperature rainfall and co2 consumption by photosynthesis in the surface water knoll et al 2013 teodoru et al 2015 yang et al 2013b previous studies suggested that the summer usually had higher co2 concentrations than winter almeida et al 2017 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 wilkinson et al 2016 as result of the higher exogenous co2 and organic matter inputs and enhanced respiration in summer halbedel and koschorreck 2013 wang et al 2017b wilkinson et al 2016 this result was confirmed by our study however in this cascade river reservoir system river sections had different seasonal patterns and governing factors of pco2 than did the reservoir and released water sections fig 4b fig s4a for example the lowest pco2 of the river sections appeared in winter and could be driven by low temperature and weak runoff input while the lowest values in the reservoir sections were found in spring and could be attributed to intense primary production teodoru et al 2012 furthermore intense primary production in reservoir sections resulted in universally lower pco2 and poorer seasonal variability than that in river sections fig 4b fig s4a therefore the cascade river reservoir system had a more complex seasonal variation in pco2 and we recommend increasing high resolution temporal measuring efforts in different hydrological areas the pch4 levels in winter and summer were apparently lower than those in autumn and spring wherever in the river reservoir or released water sections exhibiting clear seasonal patterns figs 3 4d such seasonal pattern were also found in small reservoirs in chongqing metropolitan area wang et al 2017a the saar river a river influenced by cascade dams maeck et al 2013 and the guadalete river burgos et al 2015 it is generally acknowledged that water temperature and precipitation regime are two important factors that influence dissolved ch4 concentrations in river waters delsontro et al 2016 kemenes et al 2007 stanley et al 2016 high temperatures would promote in situ methanogenesis activities and oxygen consumption and the latter would then facilitate ch4 accumulation in water meanwhile rainfall on the one hand increases allochthonous organic matter and ch4 inputs from lateral soils stanley et al 2016 yu et al 2017 and on the other hand generates a dilution effect on dissolved ch4 concentrations when the flow surges and turbulence is enhanced beaulieu et al 2012 kone et al 2010 sawakuchi et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the lower pch4 in summer fig 4d fig s4b which violates the temperature cycle could be explained by a strong dilutive effect caused by continuous rain and flooding wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017a moreover exceptionally high ch4 concentrations are often observed in the peak algal bloom season in natural rivers or reservoirs wang et al 2018 yang et al 2013a yang et al 2011 algal blooms not only create a more anaerobic hypolimnion but also supply a large amount of organic matter when planktonic algae die all of which partly account for the high ch4 production gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 wang et al 2017a thus a wide range of eutrophication in the cascade river reservoir system of the wubu river especially in reservoir sections fig s2c may be responsible for the high pch4 in spring in addition the variation amplitudes of pco2 and pch4 observed in winter and summer were obviously low fig s4 they were probably dominated by the ubiquitously low carbon metabolism due to the low temperatures in winter and the homogenization of gas concentrations among rivers and reservoirs as a result of high flows in summer the higher variation amplitudes of pco2 and pch4 in autumn and spring were consistent with the high variability of chl a the altered biochemical process caused by cascade damming is an important mechanism for the seasonal variation in pco2 and pch4 and this influence is controlled by temperature and flow 4 3 environmental controls on surface water pco2 and pch4 cascade damming can reshape the relationship of carbon biochemical processes with water physicochemical properties shi et al 2017 wang et al 2021 here we found a strong negative relationship between the pco2 and ph value across the whole watershed and pco2 could be predicted well by an exponential function of ph such as pco2 3 108 e 1 516 ph r2 0 62 by the inverse algorithm a ph of 8 23 was the critical threshold condition for shifting from a co2 sink to a source similar results were also underscored in other researches e g wang et al 2017b and li et al 2013 the pco2 value was extremely sensitive to ph in inland water due to the transition of the carbonate equilibrium li et al 2013 ran et al 2017 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2017 wang et al 2021 also suggested that ph was the dominant indicator parameters for tracing pco2 characteristics in the inflowing and released water of a karst cascade reservoirs system wujiang china our survey found universally higher ph as result of enhanced photosynthesis in reservoirs wang et al 2015 could explain the lower pco2 in reservoir sections meanwhile the linear regression suggested that chl a concentration was an efficient explanatory variable for the variation in reservoir pco2 r2 0 52 while it could not account for that in river sections p 0 05 fig 6d the different responses of pco2 to chl a in river sections and reservoir sections highlighted the fragmented differentiation of co2 metabolism in the cascade river reservoir systems in turn affecting the spatial pattern of pco2 research in the increasingly impounded yangtze river basin by liu et al 2016 also highlighted that regional autotrophy increased and pco2 significantly decreased 60 in impounded areas therefore it is important to understand the damming effect on carbon biogeochemical process by comparing the difference among river reservoir and released water shi et al 2017 wang et al 2011 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 although variable among rivers and reservoirs chl a concentration might also be a crucial indicator of pco2 in rivers affected by cascade dams apart from the ph value while primary production in freshwater ecosystems is associated with dissolved co2 consumption and do generation in situ respiration can reduce do and produce co2 thus to some extent the correlation between pco2 and do could reflect the contribution of heterotrophic respiration to the excess of co2 burgos et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 the linear regression between pco2 and do across the whole system fig 6c suggested that at least a portion of the dissolved co2 was derived from the internal respiration of organic carbon in the water column burgos et al 2015 ran et al 2017 however there was a poor explanatory power of do for the pco2 variation in flowing waters r2 0 07 fig 6c while prominent explanatory power for these in reservoir r2 0 24 or released waters r2 0 27 this result implied that co2 source and dependence on heterotrophic respiration in different hydrological sections were much different in reservoirs the co2 generated from respiration may be fixed by autotrophic production which then dominates the correlation between do and pco2 argerich et al 2016 ran et al 2017 in river sections the nonmetabolic processes such as the input of inorganic carbon via runoff or groundwater pathways fed exogenous riverine co2 and disturb the relationship between do with pco2 lapierre et al 2016 lapierre et al 2013 stephen c maberly et al 2013 meanwhile do was replenished by exchange with the atmosphere due to higher flow velocity and turbulence in river sections moreover the indiscernible correlation between pco2 and doc in our study contradicted the standpoints of previous studies that doc played a crucial role in affecting pco2 as the substrate for in situ respiration halbedel and koschorreck 2013 larsen et al 2011 liu et al 2016 sobek et al 2003 this result further confirms that heterotrophic respiration in the water column plays a minor role in affecting pco2 in a whole river reservoir continuum and may be attributed to the confusion of the natural metabolic framework of rivers by cascade dams argerich et al 2016 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 knoll et al 2013 in addition to ph do and chl a we found a positive correlation of wt with pco2 when using all data despite a negligible explanation for the variation in river water pco2 fig s6 this result is consistent with previous studies in inland waters that suggested that temperature could determine the riverine pco2 by accelerating the co2 produced in rivers and the surrounding landscape almeida et al 2017 beaulieu et al 2012 campeau and del giorgio 2014 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 sobek et al 2003 however the temperature sensitivity of water pco2 could be disturbed by cascade damming on the river fig s6 in comparison with insensitive pco2 responses to organic carbon oc the significant correlation of pch4 with the toc and doc concentrations fig 5a 5b suggested that the controls on riverine pch4 were highly dependent internal factors researches have shown that the sedimentation of reactive organic carbon to deep anoxic sediment strata is essential determinant of pch4 in inland waters maeck et al 2013 shi et al 2017 linear regression between surface water pch4 and doc concentrations was unambiguous in the present study fig 8b and has also been observed in a series of other inland waters campeau and del giorgio 2014 crawford et al 2016 crawford and stanley 2016 kemenes et al 2007 this correlation may indicate that the alteration of surface water doc concentrations due to cascade impoundments could act as an effective predictor for the variability of ch4 emission on the one hand river cascade damming could capture suspended particles and lead to high oc accumulation borges et al 2015 delsontro et al 2011 delsontro et al 2016 maeck et al 2013 shi et al 2017 sobek et al 2012 on the other hand the long hydrological residence time favours microbial colonization and development delsontro et al 2016 kemenes et al 2007 wang et al 2021 and in turn drives high potential of methanogenesis maeck et al 2013 and shi et al 2017 suggested that cascade damming and oc trapping could create methane emission hotspots in rivers the exceptionally high pch4 in released waters fig 4c 4d also indicated high ch4 production and accumulation in the deep water zone of reservoirs our results implied that oc trapping could support methanogenesis and that the surface water doc content could be a strong predictor of pch4 alternatively the enhanced photosynthesis in impounded sections also increased the autochthonous production of oc then fuelling methanogenesis delsontro et al 2016 selvam et al 2014 wang et al 2017a in this study the reservoirs had higher chl a and toc than the river sections fig s2c fig 2c this result affirmed that the primary production in the surface water may be associated with oc enrichment the sedimentation of algal derived c molecules or carbohydrates with higher microbial bioavailability may activate microbial respiration and oxygen consumption and eventually promote in situ methanogenesis almeida et al 2016 gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 west et al 2012 while no statistical correlation was found between chl a and pch4 in river sections fig 5b the markedly increasing pch4 with increasing chl a in reservoir sections with a correlation coefficient of 0 68 p 0 001 fig 5b and 8d highlighted that the enhancement of photosynthetic assimilation as a result of impoundment was a potential mechanism for elevated pch4 and emissions in the cascade reservoirs the negative correlation of pch4 with tic fig 7c may also be regulated by in water photosynthesis implying that co2 absorption through primary production in aquatic ecosystems may promote ch4 production in our study the poor correlation between n and p concentrations in surface water and the c gas concentrations suggested that nutrient concentrations in surface water could not explain the variability of c gas concentrations in the cascade dammed river which was contrary to previous research in human affected rivers crawford and stanley 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2017 however rda analysis suggested that water physicochemical conditions and c gas concentrations presented distinct differentiations among river reservoir and released water sections fig 9a further implying that cascade damming results in the transformation of the river continuum into a series of bioreactors with different co2 and ch4 biogeochemical processes 4 4 annual co2 and ch4 emissions from the cascade river reservoir system and their implications based on the boundary layer model the estimated fco2 range of 10 2 481 mmol m 2 d 1 overall mean of 89 5 89 7 mmol m 2 d 1 in the wubu river basin was in the upper level of those from global freshwater systems streams and rivers reservoirs lakes raymond et al 2013 the average fco2 in this study was generally higher than that found in the yellow river basin ran et al 2017 and yangtze river basin liu et al 2016 and higher than the average co2 flux from china s lakes and reservoirs calculated by li et al 2018 table s4 however the fco2 in reservoir sections 40 8 27 3 mmol m 2 d 1 significantly lower than those in river sections 136 35 mmol m 2 d 1 was consistent with previous measurements in reservoirs or lakes table s4 high k600 and pco2 are both factors responsible for high co2 emissions from streams and rivers halbedel and koschorreck 2013 flowing sections in the cascade dammed river featuring higher pco2 and k600 persistently had a stronger co2 flux even comparable with the small urban reservoir that was suggested as a co2 emission hotspot wang et al 2017a yet simultaneously the reservoir sections were a minor co2 emitter therefore cascade damming could limit the high co2 emissions from montane rivers by enhancing the in situ primary production and weakening the surface disturbance the fch4 in our study range of 0 15 7 88 mmol m 2 d 1 overall mean of 1 24 1 19 mmol m 2 d 1 was also higher than that reported in the yangtze river basin huang et al 2017 and the average level of china s reservoirs li et al 2018 however the level of our fch4 was lower than the average level of global hydroelectric reservoirs estimated by li and zhang 2014 and that of global streams and rivers estimated by bastviken et al 2011 and stanley et al 2016 table s4 as predicted although reservoir sections had higher pch4 the average ch4 flux was approximately equal to that in river sections due to the lower k600 fig s1 in maeck s report the ch4 diffusive flux from the reservoir reach 0 25 mmol m 2 d 1 was also in close proximity to that from the riverine reach 0 20 mmol m 2 d 1 maeck et al 2013 additionally the exceptionally high pch4 in released waters implied that upstream reservoirs may act as potentially high ch4 stores and emission hotspots guerin et al 2006 kemenes et al 2007 teodoru et al 2012 as a result of high flow velocity and shallow water table s1 released waters 2 09 0 87 mmol m 2 d 1 as the indirect products of dammed rivers had more than twofold higher fch4 than the river and reservoir sections fig 10 thus we also highlighted that released waters sections acted as important ch4 emission hotspots should be given more attention finally our study highlighted that cascade damming may alter the assignment pattern of co2 and ch4 in the whole carbon gas emissions amount the ch4 flux expressed as co2 equivalents warming potential of ch4 over a 100 year period was 34 times that for co2 in rivers reservoirs and released water contributed 17 46 and 45 of the total carbon gas emissions respectively carbon trapping by cascade damming have driven rivers into an autotrophic state and have reduced the averaged co2 fluxes eutrophication however could enhance ch4 fluxes from lentic systems by supplying more decomposed phytoplankton litter almeida et al 2016 ana m morales williams 2020 thus reservoir sections had much higher ch4 co2 flux ratios in the present study meanwhile the annual co2 and ch4 evasion from the entire mainstream of wubu river were estimated of 1 29 gg co2 c and 0 022 gg ch4 c or 0 75 gg co2 eq c we evaluated that cascade damming would reduce about 17 9 of the total co2 evasion amount but increase approximately 16 3 of ch4 it was indicated that the global warming potential of rivers would be enhanced when oc is trapped and mineralized to ch4 rather than to co2 in the context of increasing dams in addition an earlier study in a cascade hydropower system suggested that the first reservoir among the cascade reservoirs would have the highest carbon gas fluxes due to oc trapping and the downstream reservoirs would have lower levels due to the reduction in sediment oc delsontro et al 2016 maeck et al 2013 shi et al 2017 in contrast our study showed that the co2 and ch4 fluxes increased from upstream to downstream fig 10 dissolved carbon and nutrient concentrations in surface water increased along the wubu river fig 2 fuelled heterotrophic metabolism in the water column and then contributed to carbon gas fluxes 4 5 limitation and inspiration through four intensive investigations for dissolved greenhouse gases in water we simultaneously estimated the co2 and ch4 fluxes the water air interface the water air interface from wubu cascade river reservoir released water system however there were still some limitations affecting our estimation on the one hand co2 and ch4 fluxes from water depend on the partial pressure of gases and piston coefficient k0 the k0 is considered to be controlled by water surface turbulence and wind alin et al 2011 damming reformed the riverine flow velocity depth and width and in turn altered water turbulence in this study while the k0 values in either turbulent river sections or placid reservoir sections were calculated using the empirical model based on comprehensive wind and water current induced turbulence although the k0 with a range of 7 4 to 21 8 cm h 1 was well within the range reported for rivers worldwide table s3 river sections averaged k0 of 15 2 cm h 1 was twofold higher than that in reservoirs 8 8 cm h 1 thus k0 seemed to be prominent differential sources for calculated co2 and ch4 emissions from lentic and lotic sections similar results were also found in other damming river system halbedel and koschorreck 2013 on the other hand our study did not take the bubble flux and turbine degassing into account which have been proven to be important ch4 emission components for placid water delsontro et al 2011 maeck et al 2013 mendonca et al 2012 teodoru et al 2015 especially for nutrient rich shallow reservoirs sobek et al 2012 it was found that ch4 ebullition accounted for 97 of the total ch4 emissions from reservoir section as a result of high sediment trapping but accounted for only 16 in upstream section maeck et al 2013 therefore because of the lower k600 and because ebullitive ch4 evasion was not included our method may seriously underestimate the fch4 in reservoir sections future work to measure ghg fluxes using floating chamber method and inverted funnel method is essential to better determine total co2 and ch4 fluxes and contribution of bubble flux in the dense cascade reservoirs we supplied a rare and novel dataset about the spatial and temporal patterns of ghg emissions and dynamics in the cascade damming river our findings suggested that cascade dams make fragmentation of riverine nutrient distribution and ghg dynamics however the response of in water heterotrophic respiration and methane metabolism to the cascade damming still lack more microbiological evidence thus future research to examine the impacts of cascade dams and carbon redistribution on the aquatic carbon metabolism and ch4 relevant microbial process is needed 5 conclusion this study investigated the spatial and temporal variations in pco2 and pch4 in a cascade river reservoir released water system wubu river and estimated the carbon gas fluxes from flowing channels reservoirs and released water the results demonstrated that the pco2 in upstream river sections was generally higher than that in the downstream reservoir sections while the pch4 was the opposite meanwhile released waters had invariably high pco2 and pch4 and were carbon gas emission hotspots in the cascade river reservoir system through capturing carbon and nutrients and slowing flow velocity cascade damming created a series of eutrophic hotspots that in turn inhibited riverine co2 emissions but promoted ch4 production ph do and chl a were indicated as natural controls on pco2 enhanced autotrophic production by cascade damming determined the unique spatial pattern of high pco2 in rivers and low pco2 in reservoirs doc tic and chl a were all found to have significant correlations with pch4 and could act as good predictors of ch4 emissions from the cascade river reservoir system this result indicated that the alteration of carbon metabolism in the water column coupled with carbon capturing accounted for the high spatial temporal variations in pch4 the temperature and autotrophic production regulated by cascaded damming were responsible for the different seasonal patterns of pco2 and pch4 observed between river sections and reservoir sections our study highlighted that cascaded basin damming decreased co2 emissions and created ch4 hotspots in river systems and then may have shifted the river from a carbon gas emissions continuum to a highly intercepted alternating discontinuity of weak and strong emitters cascade damming significantly enhanced the complexity of the spatial temporal pattern and ch4 co2 ratio of emissions particularly such variability of ch4 co2 flux ratio should be considered during the cleanliness evaluation of hydropower
