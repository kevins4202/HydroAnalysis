425,solving image based pore scale flow and transport in porous materials is a mainstream of fundamental and industrial research to reveal the pertinent physics in the field of hydrogeology reservoir engineering paper and filter engineering this research discipline requires tremendous integration of multidisciplinary research areas of image processing computational fluid modelling and high performance computing the key challenge in pore scale multi phase flow simulation is the overwhelming computational expense in this paper we develop a new computational method that integrates gpu accelerated volumetric lattice boltzmann method vlbm with an upscaling scheme to solve the pore scale two phase flow at the centimetre level length scales the lattice boltzmann concept is employed to solve both the level set equation for image segmentation and governing equations for multi phase flow dynamics the signed distance field solved from the level set equation is used to calculate the void volume ratio of each lattice cell resulting in a seamless connection between image segmentation and computational fluid dynamics the pore scale porous materials upscaling is carried out through the average void volume ratio of the neighbouring cells the algorithm is rigorously tested in three cases contact angle test for droplets between two plates co current flow in a cylindrical tube and the two phase flow in a sandstone sample for the sandstone sample the porosity void space topology relative permeability and preferential flow channels are well retained after 8 times upscaling while the computational time is dramatically decreased keywords volumatric lattice boltzmann method level set method pore structure upscaling two phase flow gpu parallelization 1 introduction two phase flow through porous materials is a common phenomenon encountered in the energy industry e g reservoir engineering ramstad et al 2010 geological carbon storage bruant et al 2002 and fluid flow in fuel cells niblett et al 2019 given the advanced computational technologies a very significant wealth of research has been dedicated to pore scale simulations to improve in depth understanding of the physics of fluids and enhance the predictive capability joekar niasar et al 2012 image based experiments using optical godinez brizuela et al 2017 karadimitriou et al 2017 or x ray imaging gao et al 2017 tracy et al 2015 yang et al 2020 have provided the opportunity to acquire the input data for pore scale simulations and also to validate the pore scale simulations of flow and transport problems aziz et al 2018 joekar niasar et al 2010 pore scale x ray imaging started back in 1991 dunsmuir et al 1991 allow characterisation of multi phase flow and transport down to 20 nm resolution however the scarcity of experimental data is an inevitable problem because experiments are usually time consuming and costly and image processing is a very burdensome tedious task which in dynamic cases can end of tens of tb data size ramstad et al 2010 furthermore the reproducibility of experiments at small scale samples mm scale is very challenging because of fluid contamination and serious challenges in controlling the boundary conditions thus performing computational simulations based on the digital images of porous materials or designed structures is an alternative technology to overcome the aforementioned experimental challenges pore scale simulations started by pore network modelling back in 1956 by fatt 1956 have simulated two phase flow transport and more complex phenomena such as electro migration in porous materials an et al 2020 bakke and øren 1997 cornelissen et al 2019 hasan et al 2019 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 xiong et al 2016 since this method simplifies pore morphology to employ analytical expressions for physics of flow and transport it is computationally cheap but cannot resolve flow and transport in exact pore morphology this bottleneck becomes crucial if the ratio of the porous medium length scale to the pore size is very small such as gas diffusion layer or papers which are very thin the second category of simulation methods referred to the direct methods use directly the images obtained from x ray or optical imaging in these methods two phase flow through porous materials can be solved by variations of stokes or navier stokes equations an et al 2016 taylor and hood 1973 before the simulation the spatial dispersion for the pixels of void space can be realized based on the unstructured mesh which is usually composed of tetrahedrons godine brizuela and niasar 2019 however the natural porous materials typically have random and complex pore spaces e g thin tips and small isolated space an et al 2017a to avoid these challenging elements they are usually smoothed in the previous literature raeini et al 2014 both segmentation and smoothing introduce non negligible errors for the characterization of porous materials which can be crucial for imbibition and film flow processes directly converting the pixels of pore space to the structured mesh is a simple but effective way which however needs more grid cells and increases the computational demand ollivier gooch and altena 2002 using a structured mesh will provide the advantage of avoiding the smoothing procedure structured grids have been used in former volume of fluid based finite volume simulations on the openfoam platform to simulate two phase flow in porous materials raeini et al 2012 2014 a dynamic two phase drainage simulation was reported to take approximately 13 days for one berea sample with a grid size of 330 210 210 on a facility with 24 processors at a clock speed of 2ghz raeini et al 2015 lattice boltzmann methods lbm are also suitable to simulate the complex flow in the complex structures using the structured grids because of their mesoscopic features boek and venturoli 2010 ferreol and rothman 1995 genty and pot 2013 masoodi and pillai 2012 pan et al 2004 ramstad et al 2010 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 generally lbm is a computationally demanding method a single drainage simulation on 40 multiple computer processors cpus takes about 30 h for a berea sample with grid size 256 256 256 ramstad et al 2012 resulting from the properties of high density calculation the calculation speed of lbm can be effectively improved based on parallelization an et al 2017b furthermore upscaling the pore scale image is also an effective way to accelerate the calculation previous research shows that the simulation performance scales roughly linear as long as the number of grid blocks per processor is kept larger than 20 000 raeini et al 2015 however the methodology to accurately characterise the two phase flow using less lattice is a challenge not being addressed in computational physics of multi phase flow in porous materials this paper bears three novel aspects that contribute to porous materials research area a we improve the accuracy of structured mesh for the image based pore scale two phase flow simulation active contour equations are solved to detect the solid boundaries which is represented by distance field combining with local refinement method the ratio of solid in each cell can be analyzed in this schematic the structured mesh is improved to have a more accurate representation of the grey fluid solid interfaces b gpu cuda parallelization technology is used to accelerate the calculations based on the proposed volumetric lattice boltzmann method vlbm for two phase flow in porous materials this method is based on the classical shan chan multi component multi phase model shan and doolen 1995 c a pore scale upscaling method is proposed to reduce the number of lattice points in this upscaling method the average value of specific neighbour grids is calculated to represent the occupancy of solid and void space which promotes the advantages of vlbm and improves the computational efficiency of structured mesh 2 computational methodology in this section we introduce four different topics including volumetric lbm used in our flow simulation the level set equation used in image segmentation gpu parallelized lbm schematic and the pore scale upscaling algorithm 2 1 volumetric lattice boltzmann method for two phase fluid dynamics the lattice boltzmann method is an alternative way to directly solving navier stokes equations used in fluid dynamics and has ubiquitous applications in engineering for an accurate description of the complex solid fluid interface especially arbitrarily moving boundaries single phase volumetric lbm yu et al 2014 was proposed based on the d3q19 model the d3q19 model and responding discrete molecular velocities e i i 0 18 are shown in fig 1 a for the typical node based lbm fluid is discretized to particle clusters and particles are allocated to the binary nodes usually structured grids by ignoring the node volume as shown in fig 1a if we set 0 being the host 1 18 are neighbours unlike the typical node based lbm the fluid particles are assumed to have volume and the density is uniform in each lattice cell in the vlbm vlbm has been applied to the simulation of moving boundary model oil flow in sandstone and blood flow in artery and choroid capillaries an et al 2017a 2017b yu et al 2014 gelfand et al 2018 wang et al 2015 all of which are single phase flow governed by eq 1 1 n i x e i t t δ t n i x t n i x t n i e q x t τ where ni x t represents the particle population in cell x and time t n i e q x t is the equilibrium particle population index i is the predefined direction of molecular motion same with previous introduction n i x e i t t δ t is the particle population after the one step evolution τ is a relaxation time in the bgk model which is related to the kinematic viscosity as shown in eq 2 guo et al 2000 to improve the numerical stability multi relaxation time can be adopted for the collision processor premnath and abraham 2007 2 ν c s 2 τ 0 5 δ t 3 c s c 3 where c δ x δ t 1 in lattice units by assuming unit values for lattice length δ x and time scale δt cs represents the sound speed in lattice unites the equilibria of particle population is based on the d3q19 model so n i e q follows eq 4 4 n i e q x t n ω i 1 3 e i u c 2 9 e i u 2 2 c 4 3 u 2 2 c 2 5 ω 0 1 3 ω 1 6 1 18 ω 7 18 1 36 where ωi is the weighting factors n represents the macro scale density by summarizing the particle population in all directions shown in eq 6 u is the velocity vector calculated using eq 7 6 n x t i 1 b n i x t 7 u x t i 1 b e i n i x t n x t the ratio of solid volume to lattice volume p x is considered in the vlbm to more accurately express the complex solid boundaries in the porous materials compared with the binary grid an et al 2017a with the consideration of volume concept in the vlbm the solution of eq 1 will differ compared to the traditional node based lbm for a rigid boundary the collision term is similar to the node based lbm as shown in eq 8 8 n i x t n i x t n i x t n i e q x t τ where n i x t is the post collision particle population although the collision operator in vlbm and node based lbm are similar streaming operation in vlbm is different from the node based lbm due to the partial occupancy of solid fluid in a grey boundary cell 9 n i x t δ t 1 p x n i x e i δ t t p x e i δ t n i x t where n i x t is the post streaming particle population i represents the direction opposite to the ith direction in each evolution step the post streaming particle population is updated after collision as partial occupation of fluid in the grey boundary cells a fraction of the fluid particles is transferred from the upwind neighboring cells 1 p x n i x e i δ t t when the particles stream to the downwind cells parts of them are bounced back if the downwind cells are not pure fluid cells as shown in fig 1b the ratio of converted particles can be calculated using p x e i δ t n i x t considering the partialstreaming is the main highlight in the vlbm to extend the vlbm to two phase flow the classic multi component multi phase shan chen lbm model shan and doolen 1995 is adopted in this paper as it is computationally efficient more complex models e g high density high viscosity ratio model can also be combined with the concept of vlbm in the same way in the shan chen model the phase separation can be thought of as a hydrophobic interaction e g immiscible water and oil the algorithm needs two or more indices σ to traverse the fluid components each of phase components satisfies the governing eq 1 4 and 9 the macroscopic velocity u σ e q differs from the macroscopic uncoupled velocities as eq 10 10 u σ u τ σ f σ ρ σ where ρσ is the density of phase σ which is calculated in the same way as with the single component model u is a velocity common to the various components as defined in eq 11 it represents the flow of the bulk fluid and as such is the physical velocity entity to analyze for the overall fluid flow 11 u σ 1 τ σ σ f i σ e i σ ρ σ τ σ from eq 10 we can see that the force acting is one component of velocity u σ theoretically the parameter f σ can include any force affecting flow by neglecting gravity we consider the effect of interaction chemical forces to the two phase flow system shown in eq 12 12 f σ f c σ f a d s σ where f c σ is the fluid fluid cohesion and f ads σ represents fluid solid adhesion martys and chen 1996 proposed the definition for cohesion and adhesion forces as shown in eq 13 13 f c σ g c ψ σ x t i ω i ψ σ x e i δ t t e i f a d s σ g a d s σ ψ σ x t i ω i s x e i δ t t e i where gc is a parameter that controls the strength of the cohesion force between phase σ and phase σ for estimation of gc the threshold value g c c r i t 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 and a representative density ρi were proposed huang et al 2015 based on the calculations g c ρ i 1 8 is an ideal state for an impressible fluid g ads σ is used to adjust the adhesion strength between fluid and solid wall particles the parameter s x e i δ t t is the indicator function of solid equaling 1 or 0 for solid and fluid in traditional node based binary lbm to model surface tension forces in multicomponent fluids martys and chen assume that g σ σ involves only nearest neighbor interactions for simplicity martys and chen 1996 to combine with the concept of the vlbm we modify the force terms to satisfy the partialsolid occupation in lattice cells as the fluid particles are uniformly distributed in the lattice cells in the vlbm the occupation of fluid and solid in the nearest neighbours should be involved in the calculation of interaction potential we add solid ratio p x into the eq 13 to get eq 14 ψσ and ψ σ are commonly taken as the densities ψ σ ρ σ and ψ σ ρ σ 14 f c σ g c ρ σ x t i ω i 1 p x e i δ t ρ σ x e i δ t t e i f a d s σ g a d s σ ρ σ x t i ω i p x e i δ t e i young s equation cos θ σ s 2 σ s 1 σ 12 is used to determine the contact angle considering interfacial tension between the two fluids σ 12 and between each fluid and solid surface σ s1 and σ s2 young s equation can be simply reformulated by replacing the interfacial tensions by adhesion parameters g ade 1 and g ade 2 and the density factor g c ρ 1 ρ 2 2 following huang et al 2007 15 cos θ 1 g a d s 2 g a d s 1 g c ρ 1 ρ 2 2 the velocity distribution has been transferred from mesoscopic parameter in the update of discrete molecular velocities to get pressure distribution the pressure is transferred based on euler equation as shown in eq 16 considering two fluid phases overall density is calculated ρ ρ σ ρ σ 16 p c s 2 ρ c s 2 g c ρ σ ρ σ as shown in the evolution kernel of fig 2 the algorithm includes five parts namely streaming hydrodynamics update force calculation collision and boundary update after setting initial condition the streaming was operated based on eq 9 for all fluid components then the density and velocity of each phase were calculated using eqs 6 7 10 and 11 to realize hydrodynamics update following the update of hydrodynamics force calculation between different fluids were calculated based on eqs 12 15 with all updated macroscopic parameters the collision was done based on eqs 4 and 8 finally the boundary update at inlet and outlet were realized using the nonequilibrium extrapolation scheme guo et al 2002 yin and zhang 2012 2 2 level set method for image segmentation as introduced in the section 2 1 the vlbm needs an accurate solid ratio of boundary lattices which can not be satisfied using the traditional binary segmentation method thus an algorithm of image segmentation for porous materials was proposed based on the level set method an et al 2017 wang et al 2015 for brevity we do not provide a detailed description for image segmentation in this paper the x ray image was first enhanced using local and cross threshold methods to remove shading artefact and facility caused outlier points then gauss smoothing method katz 2016 was used to reduce the noise after pre processing the images the level set method lsm was adopted to detect the contour of pore space sethian 1999 lsm used a discretized pde to simulate the evolving of active contours by updating the fronts in porous materials until the stop condition was satisfied the signed distance ϕ x t was defined for the enhanced image in the objective void space the distance field evolution with time ϕ t is shown as eq 17 17 ϕ t g ϕ β g where g is a stopping function defined as the gradient of a convolution 1 1 g i 0 2 i 0 represents the gray value distribution of x ray image and g is a gaussian kernel β is an adjustable constant value mitiche and ayed 2010 the d3q7 lbm concept was employed to discretize the level set equation as it can be considered a nonlinear diffusion equation with a source term wang et al 2011 similar to eq 1 the discretized lse is written as eq 18 18 h i x e i t t δ t h i x t h i x t h i e q x t τ ϕ δ t f i x t where hi x t represents the discretized distribution of distance field ϕ x along direction e i x t and ϕ x i h i x h i e q x t is the equilibrium state of hi x t defined as h i e q x t ϕ x t 7 fi x t is the external force leading equation to balance state and f i x t β g 7 relaxation time τϕ is defined as τ ϕ 0 5 3 g δ t the lattice time step δt is usually set 1 guo et al 2000 after each collision and streaming operations the distance function and the corresponding equilibrium distance distribution function were updated until reaching the balanced state during the segmentation one initial seed is usually used in the active contour method one initial seed is suitable for continuous space even the space contains bifurcations or intersections this initial condition however is not suitable for porous materials because porous materials usually contain several paralleled or interconnecting pathways contour boundary cannot go through a solid phase meaning just one initial contour will lose part of image information during the segmentation multi point initial seed was proposed in this paper to solve this problem after segmentation the contour of the boundary was segmented by local refinement method to get the occupancy ratio of void space in the grey boundary cells 2 3 gpu parallel computing it has been well demonstrated that lbm and vlbm are ideally suited for gpu parallel computing an et al 2017b li et al 2003 the principle and optimization of gpu parallelism in single phase flow based on the vlbm was introduced in an et al 2017b and the acceleration time was more than one thousand times compared with single cpu simulation comparing against the single component model the streaming and collision are iterated for both fluids in the two component model and the shan chen force term should be updated in every step as shown in fig 2 the gpu parallelism of the two phase algorithm has a scheme similar to the single phase model as host the cpu reads data and does variable allocation at the beginning of the algorithm in this process the logically contiguous heap memory is generated for global variables only contiguous memory can be used to carry out the location transfer between gpu and cpu at the gpu device we organize the algorithm structure and data structure to realize optimal parallelization as shown in fig 2 the algorithm structure is streamlined into two kernels one includes streaming and hydrodynamic update and the other one includes force calculation collision and boundary update in each kernel the global parameter is loaded once to decrease the time to access the global memory accessing the global parameter is one of the most time consuming parts in a kernel while accessing a register on chip memory consumes zero clock cycles per instruction in most cases optimized algorithm structure and arrangement of the register are central points in the improvement of parallel efficiency the other optimal point is a data structure which determines the way how to access global memory the structure of array soa data format is utilized in this paper to addresses the recall of coalesced global memory an et al 2017b 2 4 upscaling pore scale vlbm in addition to the gpu acceleration upscaling the grid size is also an efficient approach to decrease the computational cost for numerical simulations in the macro scale numerical simulations for a reservoir effective properties are usually used to reduce the computational cost by retaining the main features christie 1996 christie and blunt 2001 salehi et al 2019 to maintain different objective parameters various averaging methods are specifically adopted e g arithmetic average for porosity harmonic average or geometric average for effective permeability and their combining procedures consequently one can carry out calculations using a coarse grid to reduce computation time making it possible to resolve larger domains the scale of a few pores is no exception to having the demand to reduce computation time with the development of x ray scanning technology and multiscale imaging methods we can obtain fine pore scale images nano scale resolution the resolution of the x ray micro ct images in this study is around 3 7 µm supposing we want to make a comparative numerical study of pore scale flow to a laboratory experiment on the centimetre scale the grid size of the simulation domain will be about billion level considering the processing power and memory requirement it is difficult for common lab computational facilities to satisfy the computational demanding of pore scale multi phase flow simulation on a centimetre scale as the size of image data describing the same area increases dramatically how to effectively utilize this information without increasing the computational consumption is challenging in this section we propose a pore scale structure upscaling method to reduce the computation grid size the upscaling method is proposed to replace the fine resolution pore structure segmented from imaging data by a coarse resolution pore structure based on the averaged solid ratio which is the geological feature of lattice in the vlbm we can perfectly realise the volume preservation during the pore structure upscaling meaning the porosity feature keeps identical in the equivalent pore structure the geological and physical properties also remain similar until the main flow tunnels merge to better illustrate the pore structure upscaling method we choose one 2d sub sample from the original 3d sample to represent fine resolution and coarse resolution samples as shown in fig 3 from the image segmentation the fine pore structure fig 3a is represented by the solid ratio function p each mesh cell is labelled by a p x value distinguishing solid cell p 1 fluid cell p 0 and the boundary cell 0 p 1 the upscaling ratio in each direction should be identical a cubic upscaling domain is designed for the adjacent cells to realise specific upscaling time e g the side length of the cubic domain is twice than lattice length to upscale 8 times for the original image as shown in fig 3b the solid occupation in the upscaled lattice cell is calculated by averaging the p value of fine cells if both fluid and solid cells are included in an upscaled cell the substitute cell will become a boundary cell by changing the size of the cubic upscaling domain we are able to continuously adjust the grid size of the image the lattice size of fig 3c is 64 times bigger than the original image although the grid becomes coarse the feature of pore structure solid ratio and void space shape is well retained thus other macroscale parameters absolute permeability relative permeability can be sufficiently preserved excessively upscaling may cause the merge of main flowing pathways with the loss of the void space topology while the porosity of porous materials is preserved flow properties can not be reflected in the excessively upscaled sample as a result the maximum upscaling time should be tested for a new sample by choosing a representative element sub volume because the degree of pore structure upscaling is limited by the original resolution of images as well as the size of the smallest pores which are in the main flow pathways the porosity and heterogeneity at the macro scale 3 application studies this section is centred on the validation of two phase vlbm and the upscaling results of two phase flow in a sandstone the computation tasks are carried out on an nvidia tesla p100 gpu card which has 3584 cuda cores with 1190 mhz clock frequency and 16 gb of global memory to evaluate the gpu parallel performance the serial computation is performed with intel x86 64 cpu which has 16 computing cores operating at 1 87 ghz and 64 gb ddr3 random access memory ram 3 1 validation of two phase vlbm as introduced in the section 2 1 the two phase vlbm method based on the shan chan model mainly includes 5 parts streaming collision updating macro scale parameters updating boundary conditions and shan chen force the first four items have been certificated in the single phase vlbm an et al 2017a which are identical equations in the two phase flow model the parameter which should be validated in this paper is the modified shan chen force for vlbm from eq 14 the contribution of the neighbour cell is a function of solid ratio p to test our mathematical model a series of droplets between two plates are designed and the static contact angles are measured under different interface conditions in all of the regions occupied by wetting or nonwetting fluid the fluids have the initial lattice density of 8 0 and initial complementary density 0 the two fluids have relaxation times τ 1 τ 2 1 therefore the cohesion parameter can be calculated g c c r i t 1 8 and g c 0 225 using eq 15 the adhesion parameters are the only unknown variables assuming g a d s 2 g a d s 1 we can change the contact angle via adjusting adhesion parameters as shown in fig 4 with g a d s 2 g a d s 1 0 45 0 225 0 0 225 to represent the corresponding contact angles 180 120 90 and 60 separately for the test of modified force the surfaces of plates are set 0 2 to represent the partial solid occupancy in vlbm the simulation results show good fitting with pre established measuring boards for quantitative comparison of the contact angles we calculate the contact angles from measurements of the base l and height h of the spherical curve on a surface the radius r can be calculated r l 2 8 h h 2 so the contact angle θ can be deduced cos θ l 2 r 0 and right angle are just total same as the curve detection based on the junction points other two cases are 59 9 and 120 0 separately during immiscible two phase flow in porous materials both phases exist and flow in the same channel for co current annular two phase flow in a cylindrical we can assume that the nonwetting fluid is in the middle of the pore and wetting fluid creates a thin layer between the solid wall and the nonwetting fluid for such a geometry eq 19 can be used to estimate the relative permeability for the wetting and nonwetting phases ramstad et al 2010 19 k r w s w 2 k r n w 2 s n w m s n w 2 1 2 m where m is the viscosity ratio m μ n w μ w we set identical viscosity for both phases m 1 the analytical solution for concurrent flow is illustrated in fig 5 based on the local refinement method an et al 2017a we generate the cylindrical tube and use grey cells 0 p 1 to describe the solid occupation of boundary cells the sub figures in fig 5 illustrate the difference between continuous data and binary data for the binary data vertical boundaries separate the fluid and solid while the transitional grey area exists in the continuous data then we perform the simulations for different resolution levels for the binary data the model with a radius 40 lattices can ideally match the analytical solution and coarsening the grid would increase the deviation from the analytical solution for the continuous data the simulation results can still fit the analytical solution even with a radius of 10 lattices in a real porous medium the radius of one pore in sandstone is usually less than 10 pixels under current imaging technology and computing level which means the binary data in low resolution cannot accurately describe the flow from the validation of 3d cylinder it can be seen that one advantage of continuous data is its accurate characterization of boundary by grey values in addition the upscaling of the structure is tested in this sample with the decrease of grid size the accuracy of simulation can still be guaranteed by maintaining the boundary information in the coarse sample 3 2 upscaling in a digital core in this section we analyze the efficiency of vlbm based upscaling and the applicability of pore structure upscaling in the course of solving pore scale flow in a digital core the micro ct microxct 400 facility was operated to scan a man made sandstone sample with resolution 3 7 µm pixel since different phases have different x ray absorption coefficients the output of the scanning is a grey scale image dark pixel represents void space a 256 cubic pixel sub sample is cut from the original image for segmentation before segmentation a local threshold and gauss smooth method are applied to enhance the quality of the raw image next the gpu paralleled lbm based level set model is applied in this digital rock to capture the contour of the boundary using a distance field after segmentation we refine the lattices to accurately scatter the distance field and calculate the solid ratio function p which realizes a seamless connection with the vlbm for simulations upscaling the structure sample from 2563 to 1283 853 643 and 323 the pressure distribution and absolute permeability show that the pore structure upscaling can retain the identical absolute permeability up until 1283 8 times an et al 2017a as the structure values in vlbm are continuous we can upscale the sample in a continuously variable level assuming the original resolution of one porous material sample is only fine enough to upscale total twice the size the level of upscaling in every coordinate direction will be 1 26 times the grid size for different samples we can first cut representative element volume to determine the appropriate level of upscaling and then apply it to the whole domain from the single phase simulation the maximum of upscaling is set 8 times for the sample used in this paper with sizes 192 192 256 152 152 203 120 120 161 and 96 96 128 respectively in the original and upscaled samples steady state two phase flow is simulated with the following specifications a two void layers are added in the inlet and outlet boundaries to design periodic boundary b the immiscible two phases are randomly assigned in the pore spaces satisfying specific saturation c the same body force as a driving force is applied for both fluids in the flowing direction d simulation of two phase flow to reach the steady state under various saturations after obtaining the velocity fields relative permeability curves are analyzed and compared under various saturation fig 6 illustrates the relative permeability curves for the original sample and the upscaled samples with 2 4 and 8 times upscaling size the curves still show a similar tendency even with 8 times coarsened resolutions at given wetting phase saturation the relative permeability slightly fluctuates but maintains the main flow characteristics to guarantee the relative permeability is well retained during pore scale upscaling the preferential flow pathways should not change dramatically because the preferential flow pathways mainly contribute to the permeability thompson et al 1987 as shown in the bottom row of fig 7 the preferential pathways of the non wetting phase have almost identical patterns in both upscaled and the original samples porosity shape of solid boundaries and void space topology control the flow and transport through porous materials the proposed pore scale upscaling method ideally preserves the porosity of porous materials by considering the partial occupation of the solid phase in boundary grey cells the upscaling method maintains smooth solid interface interface with incidental local porosity which preserves the original shape of solid void interfaces to demonstrate the local effect of upscaling on these properties 2d slices from different samples are shown in fig 7 top row after 8 times the shape of void space is well preserved we also extract the pore networks for these samples to quantitatively compare the average topology of porous materials the average coordination number defined as the number of connected throats for each pore body is 3 66 3 65 3 71 and 3 83 for the original sample and upscaled samples respectively as the slight variation in the topology and relative permeability curves in fig 6 show the upscaling does not alter the original results it should be noted that if the pore size distribution along the preferential pathways is very heterogeneous there are very tight pore spaces as bottle necks upscaling may need to be taken into account with more cautious 4 conclusion pore scale modelling of multi phase flow and transport in porous materials is one of the main research streamlines in industry and fundamental research this research presents a fundamental computational study that contributes to this topic with three different aspects a the concept of volumetric lattice boltzmann method is combined with the shan chen two phase model for the streaming part particle bounce back is considered at the solid boundaries in addition the force term is modified by adding the weighting factor of the solid ratio the volumetric lattice boltzmann method for two phase flow inherits the features of lbm that are conducive to parallelism b level set method can provide the details of boundaries location with local refinement method the solid ratio is calculated for every cell which seamlessly fed into the vlbm method c all the computational methods in a and b have been applied in a gpu based framework which allows parallelization of the results this is an important aspect of this study as it allows to simulation much larger physical scales at a shorter computational time d the pore scale upscaling method is proposed for the image based simulation to decrease the computational demand while maintaining accuracy the continuous solid ratio is used to average the adjacent cells the upscaled data set can still retain the topology of the pore structure especially for bigger channels the numerical method for upscaling was validated against the annular two phase flow and compared against the analytical solution then it was applied to steady state relative permeability study and it was shown that for the specific medium up to 8 times coarsening did not change the relative permeability results while saving significant computational cost the upscaling scheme is restricted by the smallest pore as well as pores in the main flow pathways in future studies we aim to enhance the upscaling method depending on the local pore size distribution credit authorship contribution statement senyou an conceptualization software

performance computing the key challenge in pore scale multi phase flow simulation is the overwhelming computational expense in this paper we develop a new computational method that integrates gpu accelerated volumetric lattice boltzmann method vlbm with an upscaling scheme to solve the pore scale two phase flow at the centimetre level length scales the lattice boltzmann concept is employed to solve both the level set equation for image segmentation and governing equations for multi phase flow dynamics the signed distance field solved from the level set equation is used to calculate the void volume ratio of each lattice cell resulting in a seamless connection between image segmentation and computational fluid dynamics the pore scale porous materials upscaling is carried out through the average void volume ratio of the neighbouring cells the algorithm is rigorously tested in three cases contact angle test for droplets between two plates co current flow in a cylindrical tube and the two phase flow in a sandstone sample for the sandstone sample the porosity void space topology relative permeability and preferential flow channels are well retained after 8 times upscaling while the computational time is dramatically decreased keywords volumatric lattice boltzmann method level set method pore structure upscaling two phase flow gpu parallelization 1 introduction two phase flow through porous materials is a common phenomenon encountered in the energy industry e g reservoir engineering ramstad et al 2010 geological carbon storage bruant et al 2002 and fluid flow in fuel cells niblett et al 2019 given the advanced computational technologies a very significant wealth of research has been dedicated to pore scale simulations to improve in depth understanding of the physics of fluids and enhance the predictive capability joekar niasar et al 2012 image based experiments using optical godinez brizuela et al 2017 karadimitriou et al 2017 or x ray imaging gao et al 2017 tracy et al 2015 yang et al 2020 have provided the opportunity to acquire the input data for pore scale simulations and also to validate the pore scale simulations of flow and transport problems aziz et al 2018 joekar niasar et al 2010 pore scale x ray imaging started back in 1991 dunsmuir et al 1991 allow characterisation of multi phase flow and transport down to 20 nm resolution however the scarcity of experimental data is an inevitable problem because experiments are usually time consuming and costly and image processing is a very burdensome tedious task which in dynamic cases can end of tens of tb data size ramstad et al 2010 furthermore the reproducibility of experiments at small scale samples mm scale is very challenging because of fluid contamination and serious challenges in controlling the boundary conditions thus performing computational simulations based on the digital images of porous materials or designed structures is an alternative technology to overcome the aforementioned experimental challenges pore scale simulations started by pore network modelling back in 1956 by fatt 1956 have simulated two phase flow transport and more complex phenomena such as electro migration in porous materials an et al 2020 bakke and øren 1997 cornelissen et al 2019 hasan et al 2019 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 xiong et al 2016 since this method simplifies pore morphology to employ analytical expressions for physics of flow and transport it is computationally cheap but cannot resolve flow and transport in exact pore morphology this bottleneck becomes crucial if the ratio of the porous medium length scale to the pore size is very small such as gas diffusion layer or papers which are very thin the second category of simulation methods referred to the direct methods use directly the images obtained from x ray or optical imaging in these methods two phase flow through porous materials can be solved by variations of stokes or navier stokes equations an et al 2016 taylor and hood 1973 before the simulation the spatial dispersion for the pixels of void space can be realized based on the unstructured mesh which is usually composed of tetrahedrons godine brizuela and niasar 2019 however the natural porous materials typically have random and complex pore spaces e g thin tips and small isolated space an et al 2017a to avoid these challenging elements they are usually smoothed in the previous literature raeini et al 2014 both segmentation and smoothing introduce non negligible errors for the characterization of porous materials which can be crucial for imbibition and film flow processes directly converting the pixels of pore space to the structured mesh is a simple but effective way which however needs more grid cells and increases the computational demand ollivier gooch and altena 2002 using a structured mesh will provide the advantage of avoiding the smoothing procedure structured grids have been used in former volume of fluid based finite volume simulations on the openfoam platform to simulate two phase flow in porous materials raeini et al 2012 2014 a dynamic two phase drainage simulation was reported to take approximately 13 days for one berea sample with a grid size of 330 210 210 on a facility with 24 processors at a clock speed of 2ghz raeini et al 2015 lattice boltzmann methods lbm are also suitable to simulate the complex flow in the complex structures using the structured grids because of their mesoscopic features boek and venturoli 2010 ferreol and rothman 1995 genty and pot 2013 masoodi and pillai 2012 pan et al 2004 ramstad et al 2010 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 generally lbm is a computationally demanding method a single drainage simulation on 40 multiple computer processors cpus takes about 30 h for a berea sample with grid size 256 256 256 ramstad et al 2012 resulting from the properties of high density calculation the calculation speed of lbm can be effectively improved based on parallelization an et al 2017b furthermore upscaling the pore scale image is also an effective way to accelerate the calculation previous research shows that the simulation performance scales roughly linear as long as the number of grid blocks per processor is kept larger than 20 000 raeini et al 2015 however the methodology to accurately characterise the two phase flow using less lattice is a challenge not being addressed in computational physics of multi phase flow in porous materials this paper bears three novel aspects that contribute to porous materials research area a we improve the accuracy of structured mesh for the image based pore scale two phase flow simulation active contour equations are solved to detect the solid boundaries which is represented by distance field combining with local refinement method the ratio of solid in each cell can be analyzed in this schematic the structured mesh is improved to have a more accurate representation of the grey fluid solid interfaces b gpu cuda parallelization technology is used to accelerate the calculations based on the proposed volumetric lattice boltzmann method vlbm for two phase flow in porous materials this method is based on the classical shan chan multi component multi phase model shan and doolen 1995 c a pore scale upscaling method is proposed to reduce the number of lattice points in this upscaling method the average value of specific neighbour grids is calculated to represent the occupancy of solid and void space which promotes the advantages of vlbm and improves the computational efficiency of structured mesh 2 computational methodology in this section we introduce four different topics including volumetric lbm used in our flow simulation the level set equation used in image segmentation gpu parallelized lbm schematic and the pore scale upscaling algorithm 2 1 volumetric lattice boltzmann method for two phase fluid dynamics the lattice boltzmann method is an alternative way to directly solving navier stokes equations used in fluid dynamics and has ubiquitous applications in engineering for an accurate description of the complex solid fluid interface especially arbitrarily moving boundaries single phase volumetric lbm yu et al 2014 was proposed based on the d3q19 model the d3q19 model and responding discrete molecular velocities e i i 0 18 are shown in fig 1 a for the typical node based lbm fluid is discretized to particle clusters and particles are allocated to the binary nodes usually structured grids by ignoring the node volume as shown in fig 1a if we set 0 being the host 1 18 are neighbours unlike the typical node based lbm the fluid particles are assumed to have volume and the density is uniform in each lattice cell in the vlbm vlbm has been applied to the simulation of moving boundary model oil flow in sandstone and blood flow in artery and choroid capillaries an et al 2017a 2017b yu et al 2014 gelfand et al 2018 wang et al 2015 all of which are single phase flow governed by eq 1 1 n i x e i t t δ t n i x t n i x t n i e q x t τ where ni x t represents the particle population in cell x and time t n i e q x t is the equilibrium particle population index i is the predefined direction of molecular motion same with previous introduction n i x e i t t δ t is the particle population after the one step evolution τ is a relaxation time in the bgk model which is related to the kinematic viscosity as shown in eq 2 guo et al 2000 to improve the numerical stability multi relaxation time can be adopted for the collision processor premnath and abraham 2007 2 ν c s 2 τ 0 5 δ t 3 c s c 3 where c δ x δ t 1 in lattice units by assuming unit values for lattice length δ x and time scale δt cs represents the sound speed in lattice unites the equilibria of particle population is based on the d3q19 model so n i e q follows eq 4 4 n i e q x t n ω i 1 3 e i u c 2 9 e i u 2 2 c 4 3 u 2 2 c 2 5 ω 0 1 3 ω 1 6 1 18 ω 7 18 1 36 where ωi is the weighting factors n represents the macro scale density by summarizing the particle population in all directions shown in eq 6 u is the velocity vector calculated using eq 7 6 n x t i 1 b n i x t 7 u x t i 1 b e i n i x t n x t the ratio of solid volume to lattice volume p x is considered in the vlbm to more accurately express the complex solid boundaries in the porous materials compared with the binary grid an et al 2017a with the consideration of volume concept in the vlbm the solution of eq 1 will differ compared to the traditional node based lbm for a rigid boundary the collision term is similar to the node based lbm as shown in eq 8 8 n i x t n i x t n i x t n i e q x t τ where n i x t is the post collision particle population although the collision operator in vlbm and node based lbm are similar streaming operation in vlbm is different from the node based lbm due to the partial occupancy of solid fluid in a grey boundary cell 9 n i x t δ t 1 p x n i x e i δ t t p x e i δ t n i x t where n i x t is the post streaming particle population i represents the direction opposite to the ith direction in each evolution step the post streaming particle population is updated after collision as partial occupation of fluid in the grey boundary cells a fraction of the fluid particles is transferred from the upwind neighboring cells 1 p x n i x e i δ t t when the particles stream to the downwind cells parts of them are bounced back if the downwind cells are not pure fluid cells as shown in fig 1b the ratio of converted particles can be calculated using p x e i δ t n i x t considering the partialstreaming is the main highlight in the vlbm to extend the vlbm to two phase flow the classic multi component multi phase shan chen lbm model shan and doolen 1995 is adopted in this paper as it is computationally efficient more complex models e g high density high viscosity ratio model can also be combined with the concept of vlbm in the same way in the shan chen model the phase separation can be thought of as a hydrophobic interaction e g immiscible water and oil the algorithm needs two or more indices σ to traverse the fluid components each of phase components satisfies the governing eq 1 4 and 9 the macroscopic velocity u σ e q differs from the macroscopic uncoupled velocities as eq 10 10 u σ u τ σ f σ ρ σ where ρσ is the density of phase σ which is calculated in the same way as with the single component model u is a velocity common to the various components as defined in eq 11 it represents the flow of the bulk fluid and as such is the physical velocity entity to analyze for the overall fluid flow 11 u σ 1 τ σ σ f i σ e i σ ρ σ τ σ from eq 10 we can see that the force acting is one component of velocity u σ theoretically the parameter f σ can include any force affecting flow by neglecting gravity we consider the effect of interaction chemical forces to the two phase flow system shown in eq 12 12 f σ f c σ f a d s σ where f c σ is the fluid fluid cohesion and f ads σ represents fluid solid adhesion martys and chen 1996 proposed the definition for cohesion and adhesion forces as shown in eq 13 13 f c σ g c ψ σ x t i ω i ψ σ x e i δ t t e i f a d s σ g a d s σ ψ σ x t i ω i s x e i δ t t e i where gc is a parameter that controls the strength of the cohesion force between phase σ and phase σ for estimation of gc the threshold value g c c r i t 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 and a representative density ρi were proposed huang et al 2015 based on the calculations g c ρ i 1 8 is an ideal state for an impressible fluid g ads σ is used to adjust the adhesion strength between fluid and solid wall particles the parameter s x e i δ t t is the indicator function of solid equaling 1 or 0 for solid and fluid in traditional node based binary lbm to model surface tension forces in multicomponent fluids martys and chen assume that g σ σ involves only nearest neighbor interactions for simplicity martys and chen 1996 to combine with the concept of the vlbm we modify the force terms to satisfy the partialsolid occupation in lattice cells as the fluid particles are uniformly distributed in the lattice cells in the vlbm the occupation of fluid and solid in the nearest neighbours should be involved in the calculation of interaction potential we add solid ratio p x into the eq 13 to get eq 14 ψσ and ψ σ are commonly taken as the densities ψ σ ρ σ and ψ σ ρ σ 14 f c σ g c ρ σ x t i ω i 1 p x e i δ t ρ σ x e i δ t t e i f a d s σ g a d s σ ρ σ x t i ω i p x e i δ t e i young s equation cos θ σ s 2 σ s 1 σ 12 is used to determine the contact angle considering interfacial tension between the two fluids σ 12 and between each fluid and solid surface σ s1 and σ s2 young s equation can be simply reformulated by replacing the interfacial tensions by adhesion parameters g ade 1 and g ade 2 and the density factor g c ρ 1 ρ 2 2 following huang et al 2007 15 cos θ 1 g a d s 2 g a d s 1 g c ρ 1 ρ 2 2 the velocity distribution has been transferred from

overall density is calculated ρ ρ σ ρ σ 16 p c s 2 ρ c s 2 g c ρ σ ρ σ as shown in the evolution kernel of fig 2 the algorithm includes five parts namely streaming hydrodynamics update force calculation collision and boundary update after setting initial condition the streaming was operated based on eq 9 for all fluid components then the density and velocity of each phase were calculated using eqs 6 7 10 and 11 to realize hydrodynamics update following the update of hydrodynamics force calculation between different fluids were calculated based on eqs 12 15 with all updated macroscopic parameters the collision was done based on eqs 4 and 8 finally the boundary update at inlet and outlet were realized using the nonequilibrium extrapolation scheme guo et al 2002 yin and zhang 2012 2 2 level set method for image segmentation as introduced in the section 2 1 the vlbm needs an accurate solid ratio of boundary lattices which can not be satisfied using the traditional binary segmentation method thus an algorithm of image segmentation for porous materials was proposed based on the level set method an et al 2017 wang et al 2015 for brevity we do not provide a detailed description for image segmentation in this paper the x ray image was first enhanced using local and cross threshold methods to remove shading artefact and facility caused outlier points then gauss smoothing method katz 2016 was used to reduce the noise after pre processing the images the level set method lsm was adopted to detect the contour of pore space sethian 1999 lsm used a discretized pde to simulate the evolving of active contours by updating the fronts in porous materials until the stop condition was satisfied the signed distance ϕ x t was defined for the enhanced image in the objective void space the distance field evolution with time ϕ t is shown as eq 17 17 ϕ t g ϕ β g where g is a stopping function defined as the gradient of a convolution 1 1 g i 0 2 i 0 represents the gray value distribution of x ray image and g is a gaussian kernel β is an adjustable constant value mitiche and ayed 2010 the d3q7 lbm concept was employed to discretize the level set equation as it can be considered a nonlinear diffusion equation with a source term wang et al 2011 similar to eq 1 the discretized lse is written as eq 18 18 h i x e i t t δ t h i x t h i x t h i e q x t τ ϕ δ t f i x t where hi x t represents the discretized distribution of distance field ϕ x along direction e i x t and ϕ x i h i x h i e q x t is the equilibrium state of hi x t defined as h i e q x t ϕ x t 7 fi x t is the external force leading equation to balance state and f i x t β g 7 relaxation time τϕ is defined as τ ϕ 0 5 3 g δ t the lattice time step δt is usually set 1 guo et al 2000 after each collision and streaming operations the distance function and the corresponding equilibrium distance distribution function were updated until reaching the balanced state during the segmentation one initial seed is usually used in the active contour method one initial seed is suitable for continuous space even the space contains bifurcations or intersections this initial condition however is not suitable for porous materials because porous materials usually contain several paralleled or interconnecting pathways contour boundary cannot go through a solid phase meaning just one initial contour will lose part of image information during the segmentation multi point initial seed was proposed in this paper to solve this problem after segmentation the contour of the boundary was segmented by local refinement method to get the occupancy ratio of void space in the grey boundary cells 2 3 gpu parallel computing it has been well demonstrated that lbm and vlbm are ideally suited for gpu parallel computing an et al 2017b li et al 2003 the principle and optimization of gpu parallelism in single phase flow based on the vlbm was introduced in an et al 2017b and the acceleration time was more than one thousand times compared with single cpu simulation comparing against the single component model the streaming and collision are iterated for both fluids in the two component model and the shan chen force term should be updated in every step as shown in fig 2 the gpu parallelism of the two phase algorithm has a scheme similar to the single phase model as host the cpu reads data and does variable allocation at the beginning of the algorithm in this process the logically contiguous heap memory is generated for global variables only contiguous memory can be used to carry out the location transfer between gpu and cpu at the gpu device we organize the algorithm structure and data structure to realize optimal parallelization as shown in fig 2 the algorithm structure is streamlined into two kernels one includes streaming and hydrodynamic update and the other one includes force calculation collision and boundary update in each kernel the global parameter is loaded once to decrease the time to access the global memory accessing the global parameter is one of the most time consuming parts in a kernel while accessing a register on chip memory consumes zero clock cycles per instruction in most cases optimized algorithm structure and arrangement of the register are central points in the improvement of parallel efficiency the other optimal point is a data structure which determines the way how to access global memory the structure of array soa data format is utilized in this paper to addresses the recall of coalesced global memory an et al 2017b 2 4 upscaling pore scale vlbm in addition to the gpu acceleration upscaling the grid size is also an efficient approach to decrease the computational cost for numerical simulations in the macro scale numerical simulations for a reservoir effective properties are usually used to reduce the computational cost by retaining the main features christie 1996 christie and blunt 2001 salehi et al 2019 to maintain different objective parameters various averaging methods are specifically adopted e g arithmetic average for porosity harmonic average or geometric average for effective permeability and their combining procedures consequently one can carry out calculations using a coarse grid to reduce computation time making it possible to resolve larger domains the scale of a few pores is no exception to having the demand to reduce computation time with the development of x ray scanning technology and multiscale imaging methods we can obtain fine pore scale images nano scale resolution the resolution of the x ray micro ct images in this study is around 3 7 µm supposing we want to make a comparative numerical study of pore scale flow to a laboratory experiment on the centimetre scale the grid size of the simulation domain will be about billion level considering the processing power and memory requirement it is difficult for common lab computational facilities to satisfy the computational demanding of pore scale multi phase flow simulation on a centimetre scale as the size of image data describing the same area increases dramatically how to effectively utilize this information without increasing the computational consumption is challenging in this section we propose a pore scale structure upscaling method to reduce the computation grid size the upscaling method is proposed to replace the fine resolution pore structure segmented from imaging data by a coarse resolution pore structure based on the averaged solid ratio which is the geological feature of lattice in the vlbm we can perfectly realise the volume preservation during the pore structure upscaling meaning the porosity feature keeps identical in the equivalent pore structure the geological and physical properties also remain similar until the main flow tunnels merge to better illustrate the pore structure upscaling method we choose one 2d sub sample from the original 3d sample to represent fine resolution and coarse resolution samples as shown in fig 3 from the image segmentation the fine pore structure fig 3a is represented by the solid ratio function p each mesh cell is labelled by a p x value distinguishing solid cell p 1 fluid cell p 0 and the boundary cell 0 p 1 the upscaling ratio in each direction should be identical a cubic upscaling domain is designed for the adjacent cells to realise specific upscaling time e g the side length of the cubic domain is twice than lattice length to upscale 8 times for the original image as shown in fig 3b the solid occupation in the upscaled lattice cell is calculated by averaging the p value of fine cells if both fluid and solid cells are included in an upscaled cell the substitute cell will become a boundary cell by changing the size of the cubic upscaling domain we are able to continuously adjust the grid size of the image the lattice size of fig 3c is 64 times bigger than the original image although the grid becomes coarse the feature of pore structure solid ratio and void space shape is well retained thus other macroscale parameters absolute permeability relative permeability can be sufficiently preserved excessively upscaling may cause the merge of main flowing pathways with the loss of the void space topology while the porosity of porous materials is preserved flow properties can not be reflected in the excessively upscaled sample as a result the maximum upscaling time should be tested for a new sample by choosing a representative element sub volume because the degree of pore structure upscaling is limited by the original resolution of images as well as the size of the smallest pores which are in the main flow pathways the porosity and heterogeneity at the macro scale 3 application studies this section is centred on the validation of two phase vlbm and the upscaling results of two phase flow in a sandstone the computation tasks are carried out on an nvidia tesla p100 gpu card which has 3584 cuda cores with 1190 mhz clock frequency and 16 gb of global memory to evaluate the gpu parallel performance the serial computation is performed with intel x86 64 cpu which has 16 computing cores operating at 1 87 ghz and 64 gb ddr3 random access memory ram 3 1 validation of two phase vlbm as introduced in the section 2 1 the two phase vlbm method based on the shan chan model mainly includes 5 parts streaming collision updating macro scale parameters updating boundary conditions and shan chen force the first four items have been certificated in the single phase vlbm an et al 2017a which are identical equations in the two phase flow model the parameter which should be validated in this paper is the modified shan chen force for vlbm from eq 14 the contribution of the neighbour cell is a function of solid ratio p to test our mathematical model a series of droplets between two plates are designed and the static contact angles are measured under different interface conditions in all of the regions occupied by wetting or nonwetting fluid the fluids have the initial lattice density of 8 0 and initial complementary density 0 the two fluids have relaxation times τ 1 τ 2 1 therefore the cohesion parameter can be calculated g c c r i t 1 8 and g c 0 225 using eq 15 the adhesion parameters are the only unknown variables assuming g a d s 2 g a d s 1 we can change the contact angle via adjusting adhesion parameters as shown in fig 4 with g a d s 2 g a d s 1 0 45 0 225 0 0 225 to represent the corresponding contact angles 180 120 90 and 60 separately for the test of modified force the surfaces of plates are set 0 2 to represent the partial solid occupancy in vlbm the simulation results show good fitting with pre established measuring boards for quantitative comparison of the contact angles we calculate the contact angles from measurements of the base l and height h of the spherical curve on a surface the radius r can be calculated r l 2 8 h h 2 so the contact angle θ can be deduced cos θ l 2 r 0 and right angle are just total same as the curve detection based on the junction points other two cases are 59 9 and 120 0 separately during immiscible two phase flow in porous materials both phases exist and flow in the same channel for co current annular two phase flow in a cylindrical we can assume that the nonwetting fluid is in the middle of the pore and wetting fluid creates a thin layer between the solid wall and the nonwetting fluid for such a geometry eq 19 can be used to estimate the relative permeability for the wetting and nonwetting phases ramstad et al 2010 19 k r w s w 2 k r n w 2 s n w m s n w 2 1 2 m where m is the viscosity ratio m μ n w μ w we set identical viscosity for both phases m 1 the analytical solution for concurrent flow is illustrated in fig 5 based on the local refinement method an et al 2017a we generate the cylindrical tube and use grey cells 0 p 1 to describe the solid occupation of boundary cells the sub figures in fig 5 illustrate the difference between continuous data and binary data for the binary data vertical boundaries separate the fluid and solid while the transitional grey area exists in the continuous data then we perform the simulations for different resolution levels for the binary data the model with a radius 40 lattices can ideally match the analytical solution and coarsening the grid would increase the deviation from the analytical solution for the continuous data the simulation results can still fit the analytical solution even with a radius of 10 lattices in a real porous medium the radius of one pore in sandstone is usually less than 10 pixels under current imaging technology and computing level which means the binary data in low resolution cannot accurately describe the flow from the validation of 3d cylinder it can be seen that one advantage of continuous data is its accurate characterization of boundary by grey values in addition the upscaling of the structure is tested in this sample with the decrease of grid size the accuracy of simulation can still be guaranteed by maintaining the boundary information in the coarse sample 3 2 upscaling in a digital core in this section we analyze the efficiency of vlbm based upscaling and the applicability of pore structure upscaling in the course of solving pore scale flow in a digital core the micro ct microxct 400 facility was operated to scan a man made sandstone sample with resolution 3 7 µm pixel since different phases have different x ray absorption coefficients the output of the scanning is a grey scale image dark pixel represents void space a 256 cubic pixel sub sample is cut from the original image for segmentation before segmentation a local threshold and gauss smooth method are applied to enhance the quality of the raw image next the gpu paralleled lbm based level set model is applied in this digital rock to capture the contour of the boundary using a distance field after segmentation we refine the lattices to accurately scatter the distance field and calculate the solid ratio function p which realizes a seamless connection with the vlbm for simulations upscaling the structure sample from 2563 to 1283 853 643 and 323 the pressure distribution and absolute permeability show that the pore structure upscaling can retain the identical absolute permeability up until 1283 8 times an et al 2017a as the structure values in vlbm are continuous we can upscale the sample in a continuously variable level assuming the original resolution of one porous material sample is only fine enough to upscale total twice the size the level of upscaling in every coordinate direction will be 1 26 times the grid size for different samples we can first cut representative element volume to determine the appropriate level of upscaling and then apply it to the whole domain from the single phase simulation the maximum of upscaling is set 8 times for the sample used in this paper with sizes 192 192 256 152 152 203 120 120 161 and 96 96 128 respectively in the original and upscaled samples steady state two phase flow is simulated with the following specifications a two void layers are added in the inlet and outlet boundaries to design periodic boundary b the immiscible two phases are randomly assigned in the pore spaces satisfying specific saturation c the same body force as a driving force is applied for both fluids in the flowing direction d simulation of two phase flow to reach the steady state under various saturations after obtaining the velocity fields relative permeability curves are analyzed and compared under various saturation fig 6 illustrates the relative permeability curves for the original sample and the upscaled samples with 2 4 and 8 times upscaling size the curves still show a similar tendency even with 8 times coarsened resolutions at given wetting phase saturation the relative permeability slightly fluctuates but maintains the main flow characteristics to guarantee the relative permeability is well retained during pore scale upscaling the preferential flow pathways should not change dramatically because the preferential flow pathways mainly contribute to the permeability thompson et al 1987 as shown in the bottom row of fig 7 the preferential pathways of the non wetting phase have almost identical patterns in both upscaled and the original samples porosity shape of solid boundaries and void space topology control the flow and transport through porous materials the proposed pore scale upscaling method ideally preserves the porosity of porous materials by considering the partial occupation of the solid phase in boundary grey cells the upscaling method maintains smooth solid interface interface with incidental local porosity which preserves the original shape of solid void interfaces to demonstrate the local effect of upscaling on these properties 2d slices from different samples are shown in fig 7 top row after 8 times the shape of void space is well preserved we also extract the pore networks for these samples to quantitatively compare the average topology of porous materials the average coordination number defined as the number of connected throats for each pore body is 3 66 3 65 3 71 and 3 83 for the original sample and upscaled samples respectively as the slight variation in the topology and relative permeability curves in fig 6 show the upscaling does not alter the original results it should be noted that if the pore size distribution along the preferential pathways is very heterogeneous there are very tight pore spaces as bottle necks upscaling may need to be taken into account with more cautious 4 conclusion pore scale modelling of multi phase flow and transport in porous materials is one of the main research streamlines in industry and fundamental research this research presents a fundamental computational study that contributes to this topic with three different aspects a the concept of volumetric lattice boltzmann method is combined with the shan chen two phase model for the streaming part particle bounce back is considered at the solid boundaries in addition the force term is modified by adding the weighting factor of the solid ratio the volumetric lattice boltzmann method for two phase flow inherits the features of lbm that are conducive to parallelism b level set method can provide the details of boundaries location with local refinement method the solid ratio is calculated for every cell which seamlessly fed into the vlbm method c all the computational methods in a and b have been applied in a gpu based framework which allows parallelization of the results this is an important aspect of this study as it allows to simulation much larger physical scales at a shorter computational time d the pore scale upscaling method is proposed for the image based simulation to decrease the computational demand while maintaining accuracy the continuous solid ratio is used to average the adjacent cells the upscaled data set can still retain the topology of the pore structure especially for bigger channels the numerical method for upscaling was validated against the annular two phase flow and compared against the analytical solution then it was applied to steady state relative permeability study and it was shown that for the specific medium up to 8 times coarsening did not change the relative permeability results while saving significant computational cost the upscaling scheme is restricted by the smallest pore as well as pores in the main flow pathways in future studies we aim to enhance the upscaling method depending on the local pore size distribution credit authorship contribution statement senyou an conceptualization software

partitioning evapotranspiration products was developed to fill the knowledge gap we found that 1 the mean annual total irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland in china during 1982 2015 was approximately 179 43 24 60 km3 2 the continued expansion of irrigated farmland dominated 67 2 5 6 the significant increase in annual total irrigation water consumption slope 2 03 km3 yr 1 p 0 01 followed by changes in crop management practices 16 7 6 1 and the impacts of interannual climatic variability represented by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in this research were weak 3 the annual total irrigation water consumption in the arid zone increased quicker than that in wet regions keywords irrigated crop water model irrigated area expansion interannual climatic variability evapotranspiration 1 introduction the water that meets the requirements for crop production can be separated into precipitation or green water and irrigation water or blue water falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 falkenmark 2007 romaguera et al 2014 the irrigation water from rivers lakes and aquifers is the largest portion of human freshwater consumption accounting for more than 90 of the total global freshwater consumption siebert and döll 2010 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 with the rapid growth of the global population and the increasing demand for food over the past decades irrigation water consumption has increased with the expansion of irrigated cropland siebert et al 2015 the increase in human water consumption is expected to intensify water scarcity in many countries oki and kanae 2006 hayashi et al 2013 wada et al 2016 therefore assessing irrigation water consumption and its implications for the sustainable use of freshwater related food security issues and efficient management of water resources is critical especially in water limited areas velpuri and senay 2017 huang et al 2019 quantifying and mapping regional and global irrigation water consumption have captured considerable attention siebert and döll 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 romaguera et al 2012 romaguera et al 2014 hoogeveen et al 2015 chen et al 2019 initial estimates of irrigation water consumption postel 1998 rockstrom and gordon 2001 were fairly crude based on compilations of various static and possibly inconsistent vegetation maps average crop productivities yields and et rates later global irrigation water consumption estimation methods focused on macroscale hydrological models and crop models de fraiture 2007 hanasaki et al 2008 rost et al 2008 liu and yang 2010 siebert and döll 2010 huang et al 2019 for instance rost et al 2008 reported that global irrigation water consumption was 1364 km3 by using the dynamic global vegetation and water balance model from 1971 to 2000 siebert and döll 2010 proposed a global crop water model to calculate irrigation water use and the estimated irrigation water use was 1180 km3 during 1998 2002 chen et al 2019 proposed the framework of observationally constrained cropland water consumption calculations to estimate the global irrigation water consumption which was 874 km3 in 2005 recently huang et al 2019 predicted future global agricultural irrigation water consumption by a global change assessment model and its hydrology module however these models need to be further improved before they can be applied at the regional scale as these models should incorporate high temporal and high spatial climate variables as well as improve irrigation and rain fed classification resolutions at the regional scale romaguera et al 2012 estimated the blue water consumption irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland as the difference between the two evapotranspiration et products that were calibrated one et product is driven by precipitation and only represents precipitation consumption e g global land data assimilation system noah gldas while the other et product considers irrigation practices including irrigation water consumption and precipitation consumption e g energy balance based et the et datasets will be agreed upon after reliable calibration with their difference being blue water and the value of blue water is comparable to another ecosystem et romaguera et al 2014 applied this method in irrigated agricultural areas to estimate monthly irrigation water consumption based on the gldas et 0 25 product and surface energy balance system et product 0 1 over 2001 2012 however the mismatched scale and the lack of reliable flux data make the results more uncertain velpuri and senay 2017 solved that problem by combining two identical 1 km actual et datasets one obtained from a root zone water balance model that captured precipitation water use only senay 2008 and another from an energy balance model gabriel et al 2013 as well as 21 reliable fluxnet sites over 2001 2015 however the calibration process is extremely sensitive to input data romaguera et al 2012 many reliable et observations in irrigated cropland flux tower sites used for calibration are also expensive and difficult to obtain as well as only available in data rich areas e g the united states europe which would limit the application of this method in areas where flux data are scarce hoekstra 2019 proposed a generic and physically based method to estimate irrigation water consumption but did not apply it to any research area resulting in questions of whether the simulation works well or not in addition the existing research time period at the regional scale is short and it does not characterize the long term variability in irrigation water consumption this raises the question of how to develop a consistent framework to estimate the long term irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland and make it comparable to natural ecosystem et as one of the countries with the largest irrigated area china must be able to feed the world s largest population understanding the quantity and variability in irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland helps guide water resource related policies however the specific evaluation of high resolution long term irrigation water consumption for china has not been reported thus the objective of this paper is to 1 develop an easy to implement methodology for an irrigated cropland water model for irrigation water consumption estimation 2 capture the high resolution long term temporal and spatial patterns of irrigation water consumption over china during 1982 2015 and 3 quantify the relative importance of factors affecting irrigation water consumption variation 2 material and methods 2 1 data sources table 1 describes the data sources used in this study daily meteorological data precipitation pressure maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine hours and relative humidity were collected from 840 stations across china fig 1 and these data were interpolated into an 8 km grid adopting a digital elevation model and a thin plate smoothing spline method mcvicar et al 2007 the 16 day composite normalized vegetation index ndvi was processed by the savitzky golay filter and was linearly interpolated to generate daily time series carter and liang 2018 the dataset of monthly growing area grids contains 26 irrigated crop classes the monthly growth area raster for each crop records the grid cell crop growth area in each month all spatial data were extracted and resampled to an 8 km resolution and uniformly defined in the same projection detailed information on the crop parameters maximum crop depth and crop coefficient of different crops is listed in table 2 2 2 irrigated cropland water model the irrigated cropland water model is composed of a crop water model and et decomposition method the crop water model uses two different soil water balance equations δs ir1 p i r et ir1 s p i et and r are soil water precipitation irrigation water evapotranspiration and runoff respectively and δs ir2 p r et ir2 on irrigated cropland fig 2 in the first soil water balance equation of δs ir1 p i r et ir1 irrigation water is applied when the irrigation threshold is reached chen et al 2019 rather than irrigating crops once crops are undergoing water stress the latter irrigation scheme adopted in previous global irrigation water consumption estimates davis et al 2017 rosa et al 2019 rosa et al 2018 siebert and döll 2010 is not always consistent with irrigation practices chen et al 2019 irrigated cropland water consumption in the form of etir1 is from not only precipitation but also irrigation water in the second water balance equation of δs ir2 p r et ir2 irrigation water is not applied so that crop et drops to water limited et the water consumption of irrigated cropland pwccwm is only derived from precipitation and is equal to etir2 the irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland computed by the crop water model iwccwm is the difference between etir1 and etir2 iwccwm etir1 etir2 the direct comparison between the iwccwm and other ecosystem such as forest and grassland water consumption main form of et that only originates from precipitation is not strong because the values are estimated by different methods the iwccwm is computed by the crop water model while other ecosystem water consumption is estimated by other methods e g the surface energy balance algorithm bastiaanssen et al 1998 the remote sensing based penman monteith model mu et al 2011 and the crop water model although the iwccwm and other ecosystem water consumption are both water consumption categories the uncertainty difference between different models used to calculate water consumption makes the results not very contrastive in addition the crop water model is not suitable for simulating the water consumption of other ecosystems the methods used to calculate other ecosystem water consumption can be used to simulate irrigated cropland total water consumption but these methods are not able to decompose total irrigated cropland water consumption into precipitation consumption and irrigation water consumption to fill this gap we proposed an et decomposition method that multiplies the et total water consumption in the existing et product by the ratio of iwccwm to total water consumption iwccwm pwccwm acquired by the crop water model to obtain the final irrigation water consumption iwc of irrigated cropland the above ratio should not change as the model changes the ratio calculated by the crop water model is the same as this ratio in the et product this ratio will change with the interannual climatic variability therefore we ran the crop water model every year to obtain the annual ratio of iwccwm to total water consumption iwccwm pwccwm we used the etmte product covering the 1982 2015 time period as the existing et product the etmte is produced by using model tree ensemble mte algorithms to upscale the et measured by 36 eddy covariance flux tower sites covering almost all ecosystem types in china li et al 2018 the good performance in the training data validation data and each vegetation type suggested that this product could characterize the spatiotemporal variations in china et li et al 2018 the basic framework of the irrigated cropland water model is shown in fig 2 before running the crop water model we need to produce some necessary data that are listed in fig 1 these modules are important components of crop water models these data include long term irrigated cropland distribution crop phenology crop root depth potential et daily crop coefficient and irrigation threshold the spatial distribution of the long term sequence of irrigated farmland which is one of the core underlying surface parameters has a direct impact on the results unfortunately there are only farmland classifications rather than irrigated farmland classifications in the existing high resolution 1 km land use land cover lucc products although salmon et al 2015 published a high resolution 1 km map of global rain fed irrigated and paddy croplands gripc in 2005 this map cannot reflect changes in irrigated farmland here we proposed a method of extracting the long term sequence of irrigated farmland distribution incorporating lucc maps gripc remote sensing data and statistical irrigated areas the basic process is as follows 1 merge the resampled 8 km gripc and 2005 lucc map hereafter gripc lucc if the grid type is not cropland in the 2005 lucc map the grid type in gripc is irrigated cropland this grid type becomes non cropland if the grid type in the gripc is irrigated cropland and is cropland in the 2005 lucc map this grid is irrigated cropland fig s1 shows the large spatial difference in irrigated cropland between gripc and gripc lucc in some regions which demonstrated the necessity of the merging process 2 it is assumed that the proportion of irrigated area between the counties in the province is relatively stable during 1982 2015 the proportion of irrigated area between each county in the province was acquired from gripc lucc the above proportion was multiplied by the province s irrigated area acquired from the provincial statistical yearbook to obtain the irrigated area at the county level for 34 consecutive years 3 the success of modelling the irrigated cropland distribution relied on the following three assumptions 1 irrigated crops commonly exhibit higher annual maximum ndvi values than non irrigated crops in the same small area such as at the country level brown and pervez 2014 the annual maximum ndvi was used as a proxy measure of the most vigorous state of the vegetation within the year ndvi positively correlates with the availability of moisture for vegetation ji and peters 2003 kawabata et al 2001 and most irrigated crops will have higher peak ndvis compared to the peak ndvi from the same crop without irrigation pervez and brown 2010 wardlow and egbert 2008 yizhu et al 2017 brown et al 2014 used this assumption to produce irrigated cropland in the united states 2 areas with gentle slopes are good for irrigation facilities cost less and are more likely to be potential irrigation distribution areas 3 cropland areas with less precipitation are more likely to be irrigated therefore precipitation slope and annual peak ndvi affect the distribution of irrigated farmland 4 the cropland of each county in the 2005 land use map is sorted in descending order ascending order and ascending order according to annual peak ndvi slope and precipitation respectively the three rankings are given weights a b and c a b c 1 respectively and the formula is as follows 1 o r a o r n d v i b o r s l o p e c o r p r e c a b c 1 where or means the ascending sequence and or means the descending sequence set the weights a b and c to a minimum of 0 1 and increase by 0 01 then the total number of combinations of the three weights is 4707 if the statistical irrigation area of a county is x km2 the total grid number of irrigated cropland is assumed to be n x 8 8 and the pixels ranked in the top n were set as irrigation pixels pixels ranked after n are rain fed cropland iterating over the 4707 wt combination we obtained 4707 different irrigated cropland distributions hereafter icdsimu the 4707 coincidence degrees of icdsimu and gripc lucc were calculated the formula is as follows 2 c o i n n n 100 where n is the number of pixels in gripc lucc and icdsimu that are both irrigated cropland in n pixels the weight combination with the highest degree of coincidence in the 4707 total coincidence degrees is the optimal weight combination the optimal weight combination of each country was different 5 apply the optimal weight of each county in the seven lucc maps 1980 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 to simulate the distribution map of irrigated cropland from 1982 to 2015 in china considering that land use types change little over short periods of time we used the seven lucc maps to represent the 1982 2015 land use the 1980 lucc map represents the 1982 1985 lucc maps the 1990 lucc map represents the 1982 1992 lucc maps the 1995 lucc map represents the 1993 1997 lucc maps the 2000 lucc map represents the 1998 2002 lucc maps the 2005 lucc map represents the 2003 2007 lucc maps the 2010 lucc map represents the 2008 2012 lucc maps and the 2015 lucc map represents the 2013 2015 lucc maps obtaining the crop phenology including the start of growth sog the end of growth eog the beginning of maturity of crop growth mog and the number of crop rotations rns in the region are among the prerequisites for the simulation of crop iwc in global scale research a fixed date is set in each sub crop area döll and siebert 2002 siebert and döll 2010 but this setting would ignore the spatial heterogeneity if applying the fixed date method in china therefore we developed another method to extract crop phenology based on remote sensing data the basic process is as follows 1 the mirca dataset provided the monthly crop growing area and annual harvest area for 26 crop types in 2000 monfreda et al 2008 we selected 16 major crop types planted in china table 2 the number of days a crop grows can be obtained by multiplying the total number of days 366 days by the annual harvested area divided by the total monthly growing area chen et al 2019 we weighted the growth days of 16 crops based on the annual harvest area to obtain the average growth days gd of each grid chen et al 2019 the crop gd of the missing irrigation grids was obtained by bilinear interpolation the formulas are as follows 3 g d j a h a j m 1 12 m c g m j 366 4 g d j 1 16 g d j a h a j j 1 16 a h a j where gdj represents the growth days of crop j ahaj is the annual harvest area of crop j mcgmj is the month crop growing area of crop j and gd is the grid average growth days 2 the cumulative ndvi value during the planting time is assumed to be the largest during a whole year we set the 10th day as the earliest date for the crop to start growing or turning green then the possible average crop growth values in each grid are 10 10 gd 11 11 gd 12 12 gd 13 13 gd 365 gd 365 calculate the cumulative ndvi value for each sequence a total of 365 gd 10 1 sequences the largest of which is the growth period of the crop the start and end of the sequence correspond to sog and eog respectively 3 the rn and mog are determined based on the waveform of the ndvi sequence and the number of peak points for a single peak ndvi sequence rn is 1 and the date of the peak point in a year is mog for the bimodal ndvi sequence rn is 2 and the dates of the two peak points are the first beginning date of maturity of crop growth fmog and the second beginning date of maturity of crop growth smog the date of the lowest point between fmog and smog is considered to be the start date of the second crop growth ssog the specific figure is shown in fig s2 crop root depth varies with crop growth and is not static it is difficult to accurately obtain crop root depth at a regional scale because it is impossible to measure therefore we used a rough estimate according to the following three factors 1 the vegetation growth is closely related to the depth of the root system 2 crop root depth growth approximates the gaussian distribution dunbabin et al 2002 in the presence of soil water stress and 3 ndvi can reflect the growth of vegetation and a crop ndvi curve can be well fit to a gaussian distribution based on the above three factors we set the maximum root depth to correspond to the maximum ndvi thus daily crop depth can be calculated by the following equation 5 r d max j 1 16 r d max j a h a j s p a m j 1 16 a h a j s p a m 6 r d i n d v i i n d v i max r d max i f s o g i m

i f s m o g i e o g r n 2 0 i f i e o g o r i s o g where rd max j is the maximum root depth of crop j table 2 a h a j s p a m is the annual harvest area of crop j provided by the spam in the 2005 spatial production allocation model dataset you et al 2017 rdmax is the grid maximum root depth which was obtained by weighted average of the harvested area reported by spam you et al 2017 i is julian day in a year rdi is the daily grid root depth m ndvii is the grid daily ndvi and ndvimax is the grid maximum ndvi of the year when the crop matured the root depth was assumed to be at its maximum and remained constant until reaching 0 after harvest daily potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated using the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 the formula is as follows 7 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where pet is the day potential evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 es ea represents the vapour pressure deficit of the air kpa δ represents the slope of the saturation vapour pressure temperature relationship kpa c 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m above ground surface m s 1 the above parameters could be calculated by meteorological variables daily relative humidity daily wind speed at 10 m above the ground surface m s 1 daily pressure kpa daily maximum and minimum temperature c daily sunshine hours h latitude and elevation m these meteorological variables were interpolated to grids see section 2 1 the crop coefficient kc reflects the capabilities of et and the higher the kc is the stronger the et will be senay 2008 reported that there was a strong correlation between kc and ndvi the formulas are as follows 8 k c k c max k c min n d v i max n d v i o n d v i i n d v i o k c min 9 n d v i o 0 3 i f d v i max 0 4 0 33 n d v im a x n d v i min n d v i min i f n d v i max 0 4 10 k c max j 1 16 k c max j a h a j s p a m j 1 16 a h a j s p a m 11 k c min j 1 16 k c min j a h a j s p a m j 1 16 a h a j s p a m where kc max and kc min represent the grid maximum and minimum crop coefficient values respectively kc max j and kc min j represent the maximum and minimum crop coefficient values of crop j respectively acquired from allen et al 1998 ndvi max and ndvi min represent the grid maximum and minimum ndvi values within one year respectively ndvii is the daily ndvi soil evaporation is limited by potential evaporation esp and soil exfiltration eex the detailed calculation processes of esp and eex are the same as those shown in jin et al 2017 12 e s min e s p e e x the irrigation threshold kst originally proposed by jägermeyr et al 2015 was defined as the allowable degree of soil water depletion prior to irrigation however when the pet is sufficiently high crops may also suffer from water stress and then be irrigated by farmers even if soil water depletion is not serious chen et al 2019 therefore our previous research proposed that kst is the allowable degree of crop water stress ks prior to irrigation chen et al 2019 the estimation of kst is mainly based on fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 which is the relationship between the crop yield and et the original formula is as follows 13 1 y a j y x j k y j 1 e t a j e t x j where yaj and yxj which are acquired from the spam dataset you et al 2017 are the actual and maximum yields of crop j under irrigated conditions respectively kyj is the specific yield response factor of crop j acquired from fao paper 33 table 2 etaj and etxj are the actual et and maximum et of crop j respectively which are calculated as follows 14 e t x j p e t j k c j k s j 15 e t a j p e t j k c j then eq 13 can be rewritten as follows 16 1 y a j y x j k y j 1 k s a a g s j finally the grid averaged actual growing season ks ksaags is calculated by averaging ksaagsj which is weighted by the harvested area of each crop reported by spam the formula is as follows 17 k s a a g s j 1 16 k s a a g s j a h a j s p a m j 1 16 a h a j s p a m the calculation algorithm of kst is as follows first we set a series of possible kst values for each grid these ks values are the possible irrigation threshold k s t pi not the final true irrigation threshold the minimum k s t pi is 0 01 and the maximum k s t pi is 1 therefore there are 100 possible k s t p values in each grid 18 k s t p i 0 01 0 01 1 then the crop water model section 2 2 under the irrigation scenario is repeated 100 times in the crop water model when ks is lower than k s t pi irrigation will be applied we can obtain 100 simulated average growing season water stresses kssagsi for each grid under each k s t pi the absolute difference between each kssagsi is calculated with the grid averaged actual growing season ks ksaags the formula is as follows 19 δ k s i k s a a g s k s s a g s i finally the ks sags i corresponding to the minimum δksi value is kst 20 k s t k s s a g s i i f m i n 1 i 100 δ k s i the crop water model of china is based on the soil water balances iwc was simulated by performing soil water balances in irrigation scenarios and non irrigation scenarios for china in each 8 km irrigated cropland grid cell in daily time steps for the irrigation scenarios the soil water balances are in the following general form 21 s i 1 s i p i e t r where i represents the julian day in each year s is the soil moisture content within the effective root zone mm day and p is the amount of precipitation mm day i is the irrigation water application mm day and et is the evapotranspiration mm day irrigation water is assumed to be applied to the soil if ks kst surface runoff r is computed from precipitation by the soil conservation service curve number method the daily et of irrigated cropland is computed as follows 22 e t p e t k c k s where pet is the daily potential evapotranspiration and kc is the daily crop coefficient pet and kc are the inputs of the crop water model ks is computed as follows 23 k s s 1 1 ρ s max i f s 1 ρ s max 1 o t h e r w i s e 24 ρ ρ s t d 0 04 5 p e t k c where ρ is a crop specific depletion fraction ρ std is a crop specific depletion fraction valid for an et level of approximately 5 mm per day table 2 allen et al 1998 s max is the total available soil water capacity within the effective root zone mm which is computed as follows 25 s max r d a w c where rd is the crop root depth awc is the available water capacity in different soil layers when ks is less than the irrigation threshold kst on the i th day the irrigated cropland is irrigated the above simulation process occurs in the irrigated cropland growing season which requires the soil water content within the effective root on the first day of the crop growth phase to drive the model effectively the soil water content within the effective root on the first day of the crop growth phase is provided by running the soil water balance equation in the non growing season during the non growing season of irrigated cropland the soil water balance is obtained in the following general form 26 s i 1 s i p e t r where et is replaced by soil evaporation es because of low vegetation coverage in the crop s non growing season for the non irrigated scenarios there is no irrigation option and the other process is the same the initial value of the soil moisture for the first day is set to 0 which will reach a normal level after two years of circulation choudhury and digirolamo 1998 to avoid the accumulation of errors the annual simulations are simulated separately 2 3 relative importance a stepwise multiple regression model was used to identify the interannual climatic variability and human activity drivers affecting the temporal trend in the total iwc of irrigated cropland in china the determined regression and predictor are represented by the following equation 27 i w c a r e a n d v i p p e t where iwc is the annual total irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland area is the total irrigated area of china km2 year and ndvi p and pet are the mean maximum ndvi dimensionless mean annual precipitation mm year and mean annual pet mm year respectively of all irrigated cropland in the growing season months of may october area change represents irrigated expansion decrease ndvi change reflects crop management change p and pet changes represent the interannual climatic variability a relative importance analysis based on the multiple regression frameworks of these combined variables provided the strength of each predictor in relation to year iwc in china 1982 2015 to reduce the uncertainty of the impacts of different factors four different relative importance techniques including the lmg lindeman et al 1980 first gromping 2006 genizi genizi 1993 and car zuber and strimmer 2011 models were used lmg is the r2 contribution averaged over orderings among regressors lindeman et al 1980 first is each variable s contribution when included first which is just the squared covariance between y and the variable gromping 2006 genizi is the decomposition of r2 in a multiple regression with correlated regressors genizi 1993 car decomposes the proportion of the variance explained and it is an intermediate between the marginal correlation and standardized regression coefficient zuber and strimmer 2011 all models were bootstrapped using 1000 replicates producing 95 confidence intervals this method is completed by the r package relaimpo gromping 2006 2 4 trend analysis a linear regression method based on the least squares method was used to analyse the time trend of iwc in china during 1982 2015 the f test was used to analyse the trend significance 3 results 3 1 validation of iwc of irrigated cropland we collected statistical data of iwc in 30 provinces total 34 provinces from the province s water resources bulletin as valid data with the valid year concentrated after 2000 especially in 2010 2015 fig 3 the result shows that there is good agreement between the simulated iwc and statistics iwc at the provincial level with a high coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 77 the slope of the fitted line is 0 99 and the rmse root mean square error is 2 38 km3 yr 1 therefore the irrigated cropland water model could be suitable for simulating the iwc of irrigated cropland in china 3 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigation water consumption in china the annual iwc of irrigated cropland showed strong spatial heterogeneity with a pattern of high values in southeastern china fig 4 despite high precipitation levels in eastern china the iwc still shows a high value this result may be related to the region s main crops being water consuming rice flood irrigation and the mismatch between rainfall dates and crop water requirement dates in the north china plain which is the main production area of winter wheat and summer corn the average annual unit iwc is concentrated at 100 300 mm yr 1 in the hetao irrigation district the average annual unit iwc is high at 400 500 mm yr 1 which is related to low precipitation below 250 mm yr 1 high pet above 1000 mm yr 1 and very convenient irrigation conditions the main channel of the yellow river flows here in xinjiang province the range of iwc is approximately 300 600 mm yr 1 the proportion of irrigated pixels with significant changes p 0 05 is 47 0 the significant change is concentrated on the significant increase with a ratio of 84 8 the significantly increased rate of iwc is concentrated at 0 10 mm yr 1 the significant decrease in iwc is mainly concentrated in southern china fig 5 especially in the provinces along the coast of china such as guangdong province and zhejiang province which may be related to changes in irrigation methods the significant increase in iwc is mainly concentrated in northern china such as henan province hebei province heilongjiang province xinjiang province and inner mongolia china s total annual iwc red line gradually increased from 149 09 km3 yr 1 to 193 43 km3 yr 1 in 2015 at a rate of 2 03 km3 yr 1 the increased proportion of china s total annual iwc from 1982 to 2015 was 29 74 while the increased proportion of the total irrigated cropland area was 48 59 fig 6 the increased irrigated cropland was mainly distributed in north china fig s3 the mean values of china s annual total iwc for 1982 2000 2000 2015 and 1982 2015 were 163 23 15 73 km3 yr 1 199 83 16 86 km3 yr 1 and 179 43 24 60 km3 yr 1 respectively the china annual unit iwc showed a slight decline p 0 05 and a dramatic fluctuation with a coefficient of variation of 8 39 3 3 contribution of subregion iwc to china iwc irrigation farmland is distributed in various wet and dry areas the iwc trend varies in different areas fig 5 irrigation usually increases crop yield and decouples productivity from drought li and troy 2018 zipper et al 2016 however the continuous increase in annual total iwc in arid areas has potentially negative effects on water resources such as serious groundwater exploitation li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 while in humid areas this continuous increase may lead to fewer negative effects thus further decomposition into subregions is necessary to explore the contributions of each subregion to china s overall annual total iwc trend fig 7 demonstrates that the annual total iwc of the four regions humid area dry subhumid area semiarid area and arid area all significantly increased p 0 05 the contribution of the mean annual total iwc of the region from 1982 to 2015 to the mean annual total mean iwc of china from 1982 to 2015 is consistent with the order of irrigated cropland humid semiarid dry subhumid arid the annual total iwc of the humid zone dominated china s annual total iwc with a contribution rate of 71 94 followed by the semiarid subhumid and arid zones the trend in the annual total iwc in the humid zone contributes most to china s trend in the annual total iwc with a contribution rate of 51 46 although the average and trend of the annual total iwc from 1982 to 2015 in the arid region contributed less to the mean and trend of the china annual total iwc from 1982 to 2015 than in other regions fig 7b the definite degree of increase in the trend reflected by the r2 is reduced from the arid area to the humid zone which may be an unfavourable signal for arid water management furthermore the proportion of annual total iwc in arid regions to china s annual total iwc showed a significant trend of continuous increase which was related to the higher increased amplitude 96 7 vs 78 1 57 8 and 39 2 and the extremely significant increase rate of area since 1982 fig 7c d these results indicate that iwc in arid areas in particular needs to be highlighted 3 4 relative importance of the influencing factors on the variation in china s annual total iwc of irrigated cropland the variation in the total annual iwc of irrigated cropland is influenced by human activities and interannual climatic variability both annual total irrigated cropland area and mean ndvi of total irrigated cropland showed a significant upward trend while growing season precipitation and pet did not change significantly fig s4 which indicated that the significant increase in annual total iwc of irrigated cropland was more likely related to human activities analysis of the relative importance of affecting the trend in the annual total iwc factors showed strong agreement in terms of the importance ranking of predictors using the lmg first genizi and car models during 1982 2015 the set of human activities and interannual climatic variability drivers within the multiple linear regression accounted for 80 4 of china s annual total iwc of irrigated cropland variance the total irrigated cropland area and mean ndvi of the annual total irrigated cropland combined were 83 95 1 2 of the lmg first the genizi and car model r2 values with the total irrigated cropland area having the highest relative importance 67 2 5 6 fig 8 demonstrate that human activities represented by the total area and mean ndvi are the main driving factors affecting the annual total iwc of irrigated cropland variation 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty limitations and assumptions the complexity of a long term national analysis often requires the adoption of suitable assumptions we developed a methodology to assess iwc based on existing gripc maps for the year 2005 salmon et al 2015 seven different period lucc maps covering 1980 2015 liu et al 2014 and 34 year continuous provincial statistics however it is important to note that the estimation of irrigated areas would change significantly using different input data and statistics meier et al 2018 first we checked the effective irrigated crop area from statistics against the gripc at the provincial level paddy was classified as irrigated cropland in this research we found that the gripc overestimated the actual irrigated cropland area in 28 provinces except the qinghai and xizang provinces fig s5 because gripc irrigated areas in tibet province and qinghai province are lower than the statistical values 695 km2 and 826 km2 respectively which are underestimated at 42 8 and 46 7 respectively the estimated annual total iwc in these two provinces will be low the underestimated irrigation area accounts for only 0 27 of china s total irrigated area so this underestimation has little effect on the overall iwc of china but has great effects on the tibet province and qinghai province iwc estimates the exceeding proportions reached 100 500 in northern china the paddy rice amount is small the exceeding proportions in northern china have also reached 100 300 this result means that the accuracy of gripc is not good in china we think the gripc map can only provide possible distributions of irrigated cropland because the original land cover map was produced based on a 30 m landsat tm etm satellite image with manual visual interpretation it has been validated in previous research liu et al 2014 we think this product is the best long term continuous 1980 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 high precision product covering all of china that is freely and publicly available during the production of the long term continuous irrigated cropland distribution the long term irrigated cropland statistical area at the country level is very difficult to obtain especially in some counties where there is no record of effective irrigated area to obtain the country irrigated cropland area we assumed that the proportion of irrigated area between the counties in the province was relatively stable during 1982 2015 this proportion could change due to the change in the direction of country economic development which causes uncertainties in long term chinese irrigated cropland mapping but these uncertainties are difficult to assess when distributing the total irrigated farmland area at the county level to each farmland grid we adopted an aggregation method see section 2 2 to make the area of all irrigation grids in the county consistent with the total statistical area only when the county level cropped area is lower than the statistical irrigated area will the county s irrigated cropland area be underestimated therefore each country s irrigated area will be underestimated rather than overestimated we compared the annual total irrigated cropland area with the statistical irrigated cropland and found that the difference was very small with an rmse of 2600 km2 yr fig s6 the rmse value is only approximately 0 41 of the average annual total irrigated cropland of china the r2 was very close to 1 missing data in hainan province and taiwan province will also result in the underestimation of china s iwc but do not have a great effect because of the small irrigated cropland area different crop datasets were used for different crop parameters which could increase the crop parameter uncertainty because of the mismatches among different crop datasets when extracting the key nodes of crop growth we used the monthly crop growing area and annual harvest area data from 2000 provided by monfreda et al 2008 when extracting the irrigation threshold the crop area annual irrigated crop yield and annual potential irrigated yield of 2005 produced by the spatial production allocation model you et al 2017 were used although a single crop parameter involves multiple crop data these crop data are from the same dataset we assumed that the crop growth length is stable and does not change however because of the change in crop types e g from 2 crop rotations to 1 crop rotation over a long term period 1982 2015 the crop growth length could have changed in some irrigated grids we used data from the year 2000 in the middle of 1982 2015 for extraction which may be able to reduce the changes in crop types in addition the spatial pattern of irrigation water consumption is based on the spatial location of irrigated cropland in this paper the annual maximum ndvi was used as one of three important factors to map the annual irrigated cropland distribution however ndvi saturates at full canopy development regardless of irrigation therefore there are also some uncertainties in the mapping irrigated cropland distribution the development of a more scientific and accurate irrigated cropland mapping method is supposed to improve the accuracy of irrigation water consumption the et product used for decomposition etmte is another source of uncertainty in this study due to the complexity of the et process and the underlying surface uncertainty in et products is inevitable when applying the irrigated cropland water model in other areas and time periods researchers should first validate the decomposed et data since iwc is simulated based on the parameters of the grid average it is difficult to determine the specific crop type changes that caused the overall iwc change to our knowledge there is a lack of long term records on the crops that are irrigated and their corresponding irrigated areas in china 4 2 the role of chinese iwc in the global iwc the rapid expansion of irrigated cropland 48 59 was the dominant factor contributing to the significant increase in total iwc in china 29 74 during 1982 2015 this finding is consistent with the global findings during their research periods rost et al 2008 wada and bierkens 2014 wisser et al 2010 both china and the global annual total iwc of irrigated cropland are increasing significantly but will the role of the annual total iwc of irrigated cropland in the global annual total iwc change over time we collected the global annual total iwc of irrigated cropland from published literature within the research period table 3 we noticed that the estimated global iwc in the same year period are different due to different models especially in 1998 2002 the median of these values is taken to perform a regression to eliminate the errors caused by the different models the result shows that the ratio of china annual total iwc to global annual total iwc increased slightly p 0 38 from 1987 to 2010 which indicates that the answer to the above question is no furthermore the ratio of china annual total iwc to global iwc is from 13 43 19 25 4 3 policy implications china is one of the most water deficient countries in the world surface water and total water resources have decreased by 5 and 4 in the past 50 years respectively liu and huang 2013 with climate change and global economic integration the shortage of water resources in china has become more uncertain wu et al 2017 our results show that the continued expansion of irrigated farmland has triggered a dramatic increase in total iwc not only in humid areas but also in dry lands which may intensify conflicts among irrigation water demand social water demand and natural vegetation water demand especially in the context of large scale ecological restoration projects in water limited areas that increase vegetation et feng et al 2016 jin et al 2017 and decrease water yield feng et al 2012 irrigated cropland in water restricted areas also often draws groundwater for irrigation because of the mismatch between water supply and water demand which have declined the groundwater level and caused much water funnelling in northern china such as the heihe river basin zhang et al 2018 north china plain hu et al 2016 and loess plateau chinese ministry of water resources http www yellowriver gov cn other hhgb if the significant increase in the iwc does not slow this trend may have a more profound impact on groundwater to solve the above problem river regulation by artificial water diversion may be a powerfully effective method this method enables the reallocation of water for ecological societal and economic uses improves water use efficiency and achieves sustainable development everard et al 2018 the second way to alleviate water conflicts is optimization of the implementation of ecological restoration projects which aids in decreasing the increase in green vegetation et the third way is to change crop management such as implementing more intensive farming and adjusting the crop planting structure chen et al 2019 since our results show that the increase in the mean ndvi of annual total irrigated cropland is the second most important factor in the increase in total iwc the last way is to identify socioeconomic strategies in arid and semiarid regions to allow irrigation water use reduction by increasing virtual water imports siebert and döll 2010 5 conclusion an irrigated cropland water model was developed to compute the irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland at a spatial resolution of 8 km by 8 km over china during 1982 2015 the quantified mean annual total irrigation water consumption is approximately 179 43 24 60 km3 this method is also suitable at the basin scale when applying this method decomposition of the et product selection needs to be treated with caution our simulation results identified more rapid growth in the annual total iwc in water deficient areas arid and semiarid regions than in the water sufficient areas humid and dry subhumid regions during 1982 2015 through a trend attribution analysis we determined that human activities which consist of irrigation cropland expansion and manage crop ways change are the major factors increasing china s total iwc of irrigated cropland with a contribution of 83 95 1 2 while interannual climatic variability plays a weaker role the annual total iwc in the arid zone increased more quickly than in the semiarid regions rapid growth of annual total iwc in the arid zone may intensify water scarcity credit authorship contribution statement lichang yin conceptualization methodology writing original draft software validation visualization xiaoming feng

426,quantifying and mapping regional and global irrigation water consumption have attracted considerable attention from researchers the existing models cannot accurately estimate the long term sequence of irrigation water consumption at the regional scale despite being among the countries with the largest irrigated areas china has not been specifically evaluated in terms of high resolution long term irrigation water consumption in this paper an irrigated cropland water model incorporating irrigated cropland mapping the soil water balance equation irrigated crop phenology and partitioning evapotranspiration products was developed to fill the knowledge gap we found that 1 the mean annual total irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland in china during 1982 2015 was approximately 179 43 24 60 km3 2 the continued expansion of irrigated farmland dominated 67 2 5 6 the significant increase in annual total irrigation water consumption slope 2 03 km3 yr 1 p 0 01 followed by changes in crop management practices 16 7 6 1 and the impacts of interannual climatic variability represented by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in this research were weak 3 the annual total irrigation water consumption in the arid zone increased quicker than that in wet regions keywords irrigated crop water model irrigated area expansion interannual climatic variability evapotranspiration 1 introduction the water that meets the requirements for crop production can be separated into precipitation or green water and irrigation water or blue water falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 falkenmark 2007 romaguera et al 2014 the irrigation water from rivers lakes and aquifers is the largest portion of human freshwater consumption accounting for more than 90 of the total global freshwater consumption siebert and döll 2010 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 with the rapid growth of the global population and the increasing demand for food over the past decades irrigation water consumption has increased with the expansion of irrigated cropland siebert et al 2015 the increase in human water consumption is expected to intensify water scarcity in many countries oki and kanae 2006 hayashi et al 2013 wada et al 2016 therefore assessing irrigation water consumption and its implications for the sustainable use of freshwater related food security issues and efficient management of water resources is critical especially in water limited areas velpuri and senay 2017 huang et al 2019 quantifying and mapping regional and global irrigation water consumption have captured considerable attention siebert and döll 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 romaguera et al 2012 romaguera et al 2014 hoogeveen et al 2015 chen et al 2019 initial estimates of irrigation water consumption postel 1998 rockstrom and gordon 2001 were fairly crude based on compilations of various static and possibly inconsistent vegetation maps average crop productivities yields and et rates later global irrigation water consumption estimation methods focused on macroscale hydrological models and crop models de fraiture 2007 hanasaki et al 2008 rost et al 2008 liu and yang 2010 siebert and döll 2010 huang et al 2019 for instance rost et al 2008 reported that global irrigation water consumption was 1364 km3 by using the dynamic global vegetation and water balance model from 1971 to 2000 siebert and döll 2010 proposed a global crop water model to calculate irrigation water use and the estimated irrigation water use was 1180 km3 during 1998 2002 chen et al 2019 proposed the framework of observationally constrained cropland water consumption calculations to estimate the global irrigation water consumption which was 874 km3 in 2005 recently huang et al 2019 predicted future global agricultural irrigation water consumption by a global change assessment model and its hydrology module however these models need to be further improved before they can be applied at the regional scale as these models should incorporate high temporal and high spatial climate variables as well as improve irrigation and rain fed classification resolutions at the regional scale romaguera et al 2012 estimated the blue water consumption irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland as the difference between the two evapotranspiration et products that were calibrated one et product is driven by precipitation and only represents precipitation consumption e g global land data assimilation system noah gldas while the other et product considers irrigation practices including irrigation water consumption and precipitation consumption e g energy balance based et the et datasets will be agreed upon after reliable calibration with their difference being blue water and the value of blue water is comparable to another ecosystem et romaguera et al 2014 applied this method in irrigated agricultural areas to estimate monthly irrigation water consumption based on the gldas et 0 25 product and surface energy balance system et product 0 1 over 2001 2012 however the mismatched scale and the lack of reliable flux data make the results more uncertain velpuri and senay 2017 solved that problem by combining two identical 1 km actual et datasets one obtained from a root zone water balance model that captured precipitation water use only senay 2008 and another from an energy balance model gabriel et al 2013 as well as 21 reliable fluxnet sites over 2001 2015 however the calibration process is extremely sensitive to input data romaguera et al 2012 many reliable et observations in irrigated cropland flux tower sites used for calibration are also expensive and difficult to obtain as well as only available in data rich areas e g the united states europe which would limit the application of this method in areas where flux data are scarce hoekstra 2019 proposed a generic and physically based method to estimate irrigation water consumption but did not apply it to any research area resulting in questions of whether the simulation works well or not in addition the existing research time period at the regional scale is short and it does not characterize the long term variability in irrigation water consumption this raises the question of how to develop a consistent framework to estimate the long term irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland and make it comparable to natural ecosystem et as one of the countries with the largest irrigated area china must be able to feed the world s largest population understanding the quantity and variability in irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland helps guide water resource related policies however the specific evaluation of high resolution long term irrigation water consumption for china has not been reported thus the objective of this paper is to 1 develop an easy to implement methodology for an irrigated cropland water model for irrigation water consumption estimation 2 capture the high resolution long term temporal and spatial patterns of irrigation water consumption over china during 1982 2015 and 3 quantify the relative importance of factors affecting irrigation water consumption variation 2 material and methods 2 1 data sources table 1 describes the data sources used in this study daily meteorological data precipitation pressure maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed sunshine hours and relative humidity were collected from 840 stations across china fig 1 and these data were interpolated into an 8 km grid adopting a digital elevation model and a thin plate smoothing spline method mcvicar et al 2007 the 16 day composite normalized vegetation index ndvi was processed by the savitzky golay filter and was linearly interpolated to generate daily time series carter and liang 2018 the dataset of monthly growing area grids contains 26 irrigated crop classes the monthly growth area raster for each crop records the grid cell crop growth area in each month all spatial data were extracted and resampled to an 8 km resolution and uniformly defined in the same projection detailed information on the crop parameters maximum crop depth and crop coefficient of different crops is listed in table 2 2 2 irrigated cropland water model the irrigated cropland water model is composed of a crop water model and et decomposition method the crop water model uses two different soil water balance equations δs ir1 p i r et ir1 s p i et and r are soil water precipitation irrigation water evapotranspiration and runoff respectively and δs ir2 p r et ir2 on irrigated cropland fig 2 in the first soil water balance equation of δs ir1 p i r et ir1 irrigation water is applied when the irrigation threshold is reached chen et al 2019 rather than irrigating crops once crops are undergoing water stress the latter irrigation scheme adopted in previous global irrigation water consumption estimates davis et al 2017 rosa et al 2019 rosa et al 2018 siebert and döll 2010 is not always consistent with irrigation practices chen et al 2019 irrigated cropland water consumption in the form of etir1 is from not only precipitation but also irrigation water in the second water balance equation of δs ir2 p r et ir2 irrigation water is not applied so that crop et drops to water limited et the water consumption of irrigated cropland pwccwm is only derived from precipitation and is equal to etir2 the irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland computed by the crop water model iwccwm is the difference between etir1 and etir2 iwccwm etir1 etir2 the direct comparison between the iwccwm and other ecosystem such as forest and grassland water consumption main form of et that only originates from precipitation is not strong because the values are estimated by different methods the iwccwm is computed by the crop water model while other ecosystem water consumption is estimated by other methods e g the surface energy balance algorithm bastiaanssen et al 1998 the remote sensing based penman monteith model mu et al 2011 and the crop water model although the iwccwm and other ecosystem water consumption are both water consumption categories the uncertainty difference between different models used to calculate water consumption makes the results not very contrastive in addition the crop water model is not suitable for simulating the water consumption of other ecosystems the methods used to calculate other ecosystem water consumption can be used to simulate irrigated cropland total water consumption but these methods are not able to decompose total irrigated cropland water consumption into precipitation consumption and irrigation water consumption to fill this gap we proposed an et decomposition method that multiplies the et total water consumption in the existing et product by the ratio of iwccwm to total water consumption iwccwm pwccwm acquired by the crop water model to obtain the final irrigation water consumption iwc of irrigated cropland the above ratio should not change as the model changes the ratio calculated by the crop water model is the same as this ratio in the et product this ratio will change with the interannual climatic variability therefore we ran the crop water model every year to obtain the annual ratio of iwccwm to total water consumption iwccwm pwccwm we used the etmte product covering the 1982 2015 time period as the existing et product the etmte is produced by using model tree ensemble mte algorithms to upscale the et measured by 36 eddy covariance flux tower sites covering almost all ecosystem types in china li et al 2018 the good performance in the training data validation data and each vegetation type suggested that this product could characterize the spatiotemporal variations in china et li et al 2018 the basic framework of the irrigated cropland water model is shown in fig 2 before running the crop water model we need to produce some necessary data that are listed in fig 1 these modules are important components of crop water models these data include long term irrigated cropland distribution crop phenology crop root depth potential et daily crop coefficient and irrigation threshold the spatial distribution of the long term sequence of irrigated farmland which is one of the core underlying surface parameters has a direct impact on the results unfortunately there are only farmland classifications rather than irrigated farmland classifications in the existing high resolution 1 km land use land cover lucc products although salmon et al 2015 published a high resolution 1 km map of global rain fed irrigated and paddy croplands gripc in 2005 this map cannot reflect changes in irrigated farmland here we proposed a method of extracting the long term sequence of irrigated farmland distribution incorporating lucc maps gripc remote sensing data and statistical irrigated areas the basic process is as follows 1 merge the resampled 8 km gripc and 2005 lucc map hereafter gripc lucc if the grid type is not cropland in the 2005 lucc map the grid type in gripc is irrigated cropland this grid type becomes non cropland if the grid type in the gripc is irrigated cropland and is cropland in the 2005 lucc map this grid is irrigated cropland fig s1 shows the large spatial difference in irrigated cropland between gripc and gripc lucc in some regions which demonstrated the necessity of the merging process 2 it is assumed that the proportion of irrigated area between the counties in the province is relatively stable during 1982 2015 the proportion of irrigated area between each county in the province was acquired from gripc lucc the above proportion was multiplied by the province s irrigated area acquired from the provincial statistical yearbook to obtain the irrigated area at the county level for 34 consecutive years 3 the success of modelling the irrigated cropland distribution relied on the following three assumptions 1 irrigated crops commonly exhibit higher annual maximum ndvi values than non irrigated crops in the same small area such as at the country level brown and pervez 2014 the annual maximum ndvi was used as a proxy measure of the most vigorous state of the vegetation within the year ndvi positively correlates with the availability of moisture for vegetation ji and peters 2003 kawabata et al 2001 and most irrigated crops will have higher peak ndvis compared to the peak ndvi from the same crop without irrigation pervez and brown 2010 wardlow and egbert 2008 yizhu et al 2017 brown et al 2014 used this assumption to produce irrigated cropland in the united states 2 areas with gentle slopes are good for irrigation facilities cost less and are more likely to be potential irrigation distribution areas 3 cropland areas with less precipitation are more likely to be irrigated therefore precipitation slope and annual peak ndvi affect the distribution of irrigated farmland 4 the cropland of each county in the 2005 land use map is sorted in descending order ascending order and ascending order according to annual peak ndvi slope and precipitation respectively the three rankings are given weights a b and c a b c 1 respectively and the formula is as follows 1 o r a o r n d v i b o r s l o p e c o r p r e c a b c 1 where or means the ascending sequence and or means the descending sequence set the weights a b and c to a minimum of 0 1 and increase by 0 01 then the total number of combinations of the three weights is 4707 if the statistical irrigation area of a county is x km2 the total grid number of irrigated cropland is assumed to be n x 8 8 and the pixels ranked in the top n were set as irrigation pixels pixels ranked after n are rain fed cropland iterating over the 4707 wt combination we obtained 4707 different irrigated cropland distributions hereafter icdsimu the 4707 coincidence degrees of icdsimu and gripc lucc were calculated the formula is as follows 2 c o i n n n 100 where n is the number of pixels in gripc lucc and icdsimu that are both irrigated cropland in n pixels the weight combination with the highest degree of coincidence in the 4707 total coincidence degrees is the optimal weight combination the optimal weight combination of each country was different 5 apply the optimal weight of each county in the seven lucc maps 1980 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 to simulate the distribution map of irrigated cropland from 1982 to 2015 in china considering that land use types change little over short periods of time we used the seven lucc maps to represent the 1982 2015 land use the 1980 lucc map represents the 1982 1985 lucc maps the 1990 lucc map represents the 1982 1992 lucc maps the 1995 lucc map represents the 1993 1997 lucc maps the 2000 lucc map represents the 1998 2002 lucc maps the 2005 lucc map represents the 2003 2007 lucc maps the 2010 lucc map represents the 2008 2012 lucc maps and the 2015 lucc map represents the 2013 2015 lucc maps obtaining the crop phenology including the start of growth sog the end of growth eog the beginning of maturity of crop growth mog and the number of crop rotations rns in the region are among the prerequisites for the simulation of crop iwc in global scale research a fixed date is set in each sub crop area döll and siebert 2002 siebert and döll 2010 but this setting would ignore the spatial heterogeneity if applying the fixed date method in china therefore we developed another method to extract crop phenology based on remote sensing data the basic process is as follows 1 the mirca dataset provided the monthly crop growing area and annual harvest area for 26 crop types in 2000 monfreda et al 2008 we selected 16 major crop types planted in china table 2 the number of days a crop grows can be obtained by multiplying the total number of days 366 days by the annual harvested area divided by the total monthly growing area chen et al 2019 we weighted the growth days of 16 crops based on the annual harvest area to obtain the average growth days gd of each grid chen et al 2019 the crop gd of the missing irrigation grids was obtained by bilinear interpolation the formulas are as follows 3 g d j a h a j m 1 12 m c g m j 366 4 g d j 1 16 g d j a h a j j 1 16 a h a j where gdj represents the growth days of crop j ahaj is the annual harvest area of crop j mcgmj is the month crop growing area of crop j and gd is the grid average growth days 2 the cumulative ndvi value during the planting time is assumed to be the largest during a whole year we set the 10th day as the earliest date for the crop to start growing or turning green then the possible average crop growth values in each grid are 10 10 gd 11 11 gd 12 12 gd 13 13 gd 365 gd 365 calculate the cumulative ndvi value for each sequence a total of 365 gd 10 1 sequences the largest of which is the growth period of the crop the start and end of the sequence correspond to sog and eog respectively 3 the rn and mog are determined based on the waveform of the ndvi sequence and the number of peak points for a single peak ndvi sequence rn is 1 and the date of the peak point in a year is mog for the bimodal ndvi sequence rn is 2 and the dates of the two peak points are the first beginning date of maturity of crop growth fmog and the second beginning date of maturity of crop growth smog the date of the lowest point between fmog and smog is considered to be the start date of the second crop growth ssog the specific figure is shown in fig s2 crop root depth varies with crop growth and is not static it is difficult to accurately obtain crop root depth at a regional scale because it is impossible to measure therefore we used a rough estimate according to the following three factors 1 the vegetation growth is closely related to the depth of the root system 2 crop root depth growth approximates the gaussian distribution dunbabin et al 2002 in the presence of soil water stress and 3 ndvi can reflect the growth of vegetation and a crop ndvi curve can be well fit to a gaussian distribution based on the above three factors we set the maximum root depth to correspond to the maximum ndvi thus daily crop depth can be calculated by the following equation 5 r d max j 1 16 r d max j a h a j s p a m j 1 16 a h a j s p a m 6 r d i n d v i i n d v i max r d max i f s o g i m

crop coefficient kc reflects the capabilities of et and the higher the kc is the stronger the et will be senay 2008 reported that there was a strong correlation between kc and ndvi the formulas are as

respectively kc max j and kc min j represent the maximum and minimum crop coefficient values of crop j respectively acquired from allen et al 1998 ndvi max and ndvi min represent the grid maximum and minimum ndvi values within one year respectively ndvii is the daily ndvi soil evaporation is limited by potential evaporation esp and soil exfiltration eex the detailed calculation processes of esp and eex are the same as those shown in jin et al 2017 12 e s min e s p e e x the irrigation threshold kst originally proposed by jägermeyr et al 2015 was defined as the allowable degree of soil water depletion prior to irrigation however when the pet is sufficiently high crops may also suffer from water stress and then be irrigated by farmers even if soil water depletion is not serious chen et al 2019 therefore our previous research proposed that kst is the allowable degree of crop water stress ks prior to irrigation chen et al 2019 the estimation of kst is mainly based on fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 which is the relationship between the crop yield and et the original formula is as follows 13 1 y a j y x j k y j 1 e t a j e t x j where yaj and yxj which are acquired from the spam dataset you et al 2017 are the actual and maximum yields of crop j under irrigated conditions respectively kyj is the specific yield response factor of crop j acquired from fao paper 33 table 2 etaj and etxj are the actual et and maximum et of crop j respectively which are calculated as follows 14 e t x j p e t j k c j k s j 15 e t a j p e t j k c j then eq 13 can be rewritten as follows 16 1 y a j y x j k y j 1 k s a a g s j finally the grid averaged actual growing season ks ksaags is calculated by averaging ksaagsj which is weighted by the harvested area of each crop reported by spam the formula is as follows 17 k s a a g s j 1 16 k s a a g s j a h a j s p a m j 1 16 a h a j s p a m the calculation algorithm of kst is as follows first we set a series of possible kst values for each grid these ks values are the possible irrigation threshold k s t pi not the final true irrigation threshold the minimum k s t pi is 0 01 and the maximum k s t pi is 1 therefore there are 100 possible k s t p values in each grid 18 k s t p i 0 01 0 01 1 then the crop water model section 2 2 under the irrigation scenario is repeated 100 times in the crop water model when ks is lower than k s t pi irrigation will be applied we can obtain 100 simulated average growing season water stresses kssagsi for each grid under each k s t pi the absolute difference between each kssagsi is calculated with the grid averaged actual growing season ks ksaags the formula is as follows 19 δ k s i k s a a g s k s s a g s i finally the ks sags i corresponding to the minimum δksi value is kst 20 k s t k s s a g s i i f m i n 1 i 100 δ k s i the crop water model of china is based on the soil water balances iwc was simulated by performing soil water balances in irrigation scenarios and non irrigation scenarios for china in each 8 km irrigated cropland grid cell in daily time steps for the irrigation scenarios the soil water balances are in the following general form 21 s i 1 s i p i e t r where i represents the julian day in each year s is the soil moisture content within the effective root zone mm day and p is the amount of precipitation mm day i is the irrigation water application mm day and et is the evapotranspiration mm day irrigation water is assumed to be applied to the soil if ks kst surface runoff r is computed from precipitation by the soil conservation service curve number method the daily et of irrigated cropland is computed as follows 22 e t p e t k c k s where pet is the daily potential evapotranspiration and kc is the daily crop coefficient pet and kc are the inputs of the crop water model ks is computed as follows 23 k s s 1 1 ρ s max i f s 1 ρ s max 1 o t h e r w i s e 24 ρ ρ s t d 0 04 5 p e t k c where ρ is a crop specific depletion fraction ρ std is a crop specific depletion fraction valid for an et level of approximately 5 mm per day table 2 allen et al 1998 s max is the total available soil water capacity within the effective root zone mm which is computed as follows 25 s max r d a w c where rd is the crop root depth awc is the available water capacity in different soil layers when ks is less than the irrigation threshold kst on the i th day the irrigated cropland is irrigated the above simulation process occurs in the irrigated cropland growing season which requires the soil water content within the effective root on the first day of the crop growth phase to drive the model effectively the soil water content within the effective root on the first day of the crop growth phase is provided by running the soil water balance equation in the non growing season during the non growing season of irrigated cropland the soil water balance is obtained in the following general form 26 s i 1 s i p e t r where et is replaced by soil evaporation es because of low vegetation coverage in the crop s non growing season for the non irrigated scenarios there is no irrigation option and the other process is the same the initial value of the soil moisture for the first day is set to 0 which will reach a normal level after two years of circulation choudhury and digirolamo 1998 to avoid the accumulation of errors the annual simulations are simulated separately 2 3 relative importance a stepwise multiple regression model was used to identify the interannual climatic variability and human activity drivers affecting the temporal trend in the total iwc of irrigated cropland in china the determined regression and predictor are represented by the following equation 27 i w c a r e a n d v i p p e t where iwc is the annual total irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland area is the total irrigated area of china km2 year and ndvi p and pet are the mean maximum ndvi dimensionless mean annual precipitation mm year and mean annual pet mm year respectively of all irrigated cropland in the growing season months of may october area change represents irrigated expansion decrease ndvi change reflects crop management change p and pet changes represent the interannual climatic variability a relative importance analysis based on the multiple regression frameworks of these combined variables provided the strength of each predictor in relation to year iwc in china 1982 2015 to reduce the uncertainty of the impacts of different factors four different relative importance techniques including the lmg lindeman et al 1980 first gromping 2006 genizi genizi 1993 and car zuber and strimmer 2011 models were used lmg is the r2 contribution averaged over orderings among regressors lindeman et al 1980 first is each variable s contribution when included first which is just the squared covariance between y and the variable gromping 2006 genizi is the decomposition of r2 in a multiple regression with correlated regressors genizi 1993 car decomposes the proportion of the variance explained and it is an intermediate between the marginal correlation and standardized regression coefficient zuber and strimmer 2011 all models were bootstrapped using 1000 replicates producing 95 confidence intervals this method is completed by the r package relaimpo gromping 2006 2 4 trend analysis a linear regression method based on the least squares method was used to analyse the time trend of iwc in china during 1982 2015 the f test was used to analyse the trend significance 3 results 3 1 validation of iwc of irrigated cropland we collected statistical data of iwc in 30 provinces total 34 provinces from the province s water resources bulletin as valid data with the valid year concentrated after 2000 especially in 2010 2015 fig 3 the result shows that there is good agreement between the simulated iwc and statistics iwc at the provincial level with a high coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 77 the slope of the fitted line is 0 99 and the rmse root mean square error is 2 38 km3 yr 1 therefore the irrigated cropland water model could be suitable for simulating the iwc of irrigated cropland in china 3 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigation water consumption in china the annual iwc of irrigated cropland showed strong spatial heterogeneity with a pattern of high values in southeastern china fig 4 despite high precipitation levels in eastern china the iwc still shows a high value this result may be related to the region s main crops being water consuming rice flood irrigation and the mismatch between rainfall dates and crop water requirement dates in the north china plain which is the main production area of winter wheat and summer corn the average annual unit iwc is concentrated at 100 300 mm yr 1 in the hetao irrigation district the average annual unit iwc is high at 400 500 mm yr 1 which is related to low precipitation below 250 mm yr 1 high pet above 1000 mm yr 1 and very convenient irrigation conditions the main channel of the yellow river flows here in xinjiang province the range of iwc is approximately 300 600 mm yr 1 the proportion of irrigated pixels with significant changes p 0 05 is 47 0 the significant change is concentrated on the significant increase with a ratio of 84 8 the significantly increased rate of iwc is concentrated at 0 10 mm yr 1 the significant decrease in iwc is mainly concentrated in southern china fig 5 especially in the provinces along the coast of china such as guangdong province and zhejiang province which may be related to changes in irrigation methods the significant increase in iwc is mainly concentrated in northern china such as henan province hebei province heilongjiang province xinjiang province and inner mongolia china s total annual iwc red line gradually increased from 149 09 km3 yr 1 to 193 43 km3 yr 1 in 2015 at a rate of 2 03 km3 yr 1 the increased proportion of china s total annual iwc from 1982 to 2015 was 29 74 while the increased proportion of the total irrigated cropland area was 48 59 fig 6 the increased irrigated cropland was mainly distributed in north china fig s3 the mean values of china s annual total iwc for 1982 2000 2000 2015 and 1982 2015 were 163 23 15 73 km3 yr 1 199 83 16 86 km3 yr 1 and 179 43 24 60 km3 yr 1 respectively the china annual unit iwc showed a slight decline p 0 05 and a dramatic fluctuation with a coefficient of variation of 8 39 3 3 contribution of subregion iwc to china iwc irrigation farmland is distributed in various wet and dry areas the iwc trend varies in different areas fig 5 irrigation usually increases crop yield and decouples productivity from drought li and troy 2018 zipper et al 2016 however the continuous increase in annual total iwc in arid areas has potentially negative effects on water resources such as serious groundwater exploitation li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 while in humid areas this continuous increase may lead to fewer negative effects thus further decomposition into subregions is necessary to explore the contributions of each subregion to china s overall annual total iwc trend fig 7 demonstrates that the annual total iwc of the four regions humid area dry subhumid area semiarid area and arid area all significantly increased p 0 05 the contribution of the mean annual total iwc of the region from 1982 to 2015 to the mean annual total mean iwc of china from 1982 to 2015 is consistent with the order of irrigated cropland humid semiarid dry subhumid arid the annual total iwc of the humid zone dominated china s annual total iwc with a contribution rate of 71 94 followed by the semiarid subhumid and arid zones the trend in the annual total iwc in the humid zone contributes most to china s trend in the annual total iwc with a contribution rate of 51 46 although the average and trend of the annual total iwc from 1982 to 2015 in the arid region contributed less to the mean and trend of the china annual total iwc from 1982 to 2015 than in other regions fig 7b the definite degree of increase in the trend reflected by the r2 is reduced from the arid area to the humid zone which may be an unfavourable signal for arid water management furthermore the proportion of annual total iwc in arid regions to china s annual total iwc showed a significant trend of continuous increase which was related to the higher increased amplitude 96 7 vs 78 1 57 8 and 39 2 and the extremely significant increase rate of area since 1982 fig 7c d these results indicate that iwc in arid areas in particular needs to be highlighted 3 4 relative importance of the influencing factors on the variation in china s annual total iwc of irrigated cropland the variation in the total annual iwc of irrigated cropland is influenced by human activities and interannual climatic variability both annual total irrigated cropland area and mean ndvi of total irrigated cropland showed a significant upward trend while growing season precipitation and pet did not change significantly fig s4 which indicated that the significant increase in annual total iwc of irrigated cropland was more likely related to human activities analysis of the relative importance of affecting the trend in the annual total iwc factors showed strong agreement in terms of the importance ranking of predictors using the lmg first genizi and car models during 1982 2015 the set of human activities and interannual climatic variability drivers within the multiple linear regression accounted for 80 4 of china s annual total iwc of irrigated cropland variance the total irrigated cropland area and mean ndvi of the annual total irrigated cropland combined were 83 95 1 2 of the lmg first the genizi and car model r2 values with the total irrigated cropland area having the highest relative importance 67 2 5 6 fig 8 demonstrate that human activities represented by the total area and mean ndvi are the main driving factors affecting the annual total iwc of irrigated cropland variation 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty limitations and assumptions the complexity of a long term national analysis often requires the adoption of suitable assumptions we developed a methodology to assess iwc based on existing gripc maps for the year 2005 salmon et al 2015 seven different period lucc maps covering 1980 2015 liu et al 2014 and 34 year continuous provincial statistics however it is important to note that the estimation of irrigated areas would change significantly using different input data and statistics meier et al 2018 first we checked the effective irrigated crop area from statistics against the gripc at the provincial level paddy was classified as irrigated cropland in this research we found that the gripc overestimated the actual irrigated cropland area in 28 provinces except the qinghai and xizang provinces fig s5 because gripc irrigated areas in tibet province and qinghai province are lower than the statistical values 695 km2 and 826 km2 respectively which are underestimated at 42 8 and 46 7 respectively the estimated annual total iwc in these two provinces will be low the underestimated irrigation area accounts for only 0 27 of china s total irrigated area so this underestimation has little effect on the overall iwc of china but has great effects on the tibet province and qinghai province iwc estimates the exceeding proportions reached 100 500 in northern china the paddy rice amount is small the exceeding proportions in northern china have also reached 100 300 this result means that the accuracy of gripc is not good in china we think the gripc map can only provide possible distributions of irrigated cropland because the original land cover map was produced based on a 30 m landsat tm etm satellite image with manual visual interpretation it has been validated in previous research liu et al 2014 we think this product is the best long term continuous 1980 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 high precision product covering all of china that is freely and publicly available during the production of the long term continuous irrigated cropland distribution the long term irrigated cropland statistical area at the country level is very difficult to obtain especially in some counties where there is no record of effective irrigated area to obtain the country irrigated cropland area we assumed that the proportion of irrigated area between the counties in the province was relatively stable during 1982 2015 this proportion could change due to the change in the direction of country economic development which causes uncertainties in long term chinese irrigated cropland mapping but these uncertainties are difficult to assess when distributing the total irrigated farmland area at the county level to each farmland grid we adopted an aggregation method see section 2 2 to make the area of all irrigation grids in the county consistent with the total statistical area only when the county level cropped area is lower than the statistical irrigated area will the county s irrigated cropland area be underestimated therefore each country s irrigated area will be underestimated rather than overestimated we compared the annual total irrigated cropland area with the statistical irrigated cropland and found that the difference was very small with an rmse of 2600 km2 yr fig s6 the rmse value is only approximately 0 41 of the average annual total irrigated cropland of china the r2 was very close to 1 missing data in hainan province and taiwan province will also result in the underestimation of china s iwc but do not have a great effect because of the small irrigated cropland area different crop datasets were used for different crop parameters which could increase the crop parameter uncertainty because of the mismatches among different crop datasets when extracting the key nodes of crop growth we used the monthly crop growing area and annual harvest area data from 2000 provided by monfreda et al 2008 when extracting the irrigation threshold the crop area annual irrigated crop yield and annual potential irrigated yield of 2005 produced by the spatial production allocation model you et al 2017 were used although a single crop parameter involves multiple crop data these crop data are from the same dataset we assumed that the crop growth length is stable and does not change however because of the change in crop types e g from 2 crop rotations to 1 crop rotation over a long term period 1982 2015 the crop growth length could have changed in some irrigated grids we used data from the year 2000 in the middle of 1982 2015 for extraction which may be able to reduce the changes in crop types in addition the spatial pattern of irrigation water consumption is based on the spatial location of irrigated cropland in this paper the annual maximum ndvi was used as one of three important factors to map the annual irrigated cropland distribution however ndvi saturates at full canopy development regardless of irrigation therefore there are also some uncertainties in the mapping irrigated cropland distribution the development of a more scientific and accurate irrigated cropland mapping method is supposed to improve the accuracy of irrigation water consumption the et product used for decomposition etmte is another source of uncertainty in this study due to the complexity of the et process and the underlying surface uncertainty in et products is inevitable when applying the irrigated cropland water model in other areas and time periods researchers should first validate the decomposed et data since iwc is simulated based on the parameters of the grid average it is difficult to determine the specific crop type changes that caused the overall iwc change to our knowledge there is a lack of long term records on the crops that are irrigated and their corresponding irrigated areas in china 4 2 the role of chinese iwc in the global iwc the rapid expansion of irrigated cropland 48 59 was the dominant factor contributing to the significant increase in total iwc in china 29 74 during 1982 2015 this finding is consistent with the global findings during their research periods rost et al 2008 wada and bierkens 2014 wisser et al 2010 both china and the global annual total iwc of irrigated cropland are increasing significantly but will the role of the annual total iwc of irrigated cropland in the global annual total iwc change over time we collected the global annual total iwc of irrigated cropland from published literature within the research period table 3 we noticed that the estimated global iwc in the same year period are different due to different models especially in 1998 2002 the median of these values is taken to perform a regression to eliminate the errors caused by the different models the result shows that the ratio of china annual total iwc to global annual total iwc increased slightly p 0 38 from 1987 to 2010 which indicates that the answer to the above question is no furthermore the ratio of china annual total iwc to global iwc is from 13 43 19 25 4 3 policy implications china is one of the most water deficient countries in the world surface water and total water resources have decreased by 5 and 4 in the past 50 years respectively liu and huang 2013 with climate change and global economic integration the shortage of water resources in china has become more uncertain wu et al 2017 our results show that the continued expansion of irrigated farmland has triggered a dramatic increase in total iwc not only in humid areas but also in dry lands which may intensify conflicts among irrigation water demand social water demand and natural vegetation water demand especially in the context of large scale ecological restoration projects in water limited areas that increase vegetation et feng et al 2016 jin et al 2017 and decrease water yield feng et al 2012 irrigated cropland in water restricted areas also often draws groundwater for irrigation because of the mismatch between water supply and water demand which have declined the groundwater level and caused much water funnelling in northern china such as the heihe river basin zhang et al 2018 north china plain hu et al 2016 and loess plateau chinese ministry of water resources http www yellowriver gov cn other hhgb if the significant increase in the iwc does not slow this trend may have a more profound impact on groundwater to solve the above problem river regulation by artificial water diversion may be a powerfully effective method this method enables the reallocation of water for ecological societal and economic uses improves water use efficiency and achieves sustainable development everard et al 2018 the second way to alleviate water conflicts is optimization of the implementation of ecological restoration projects which aids in decreasing the increase in green vegetation et the third way is to change crop management such as implementing more intensive farming and adjusting the crop planting structure chen et al 2019 since our results show that the increase in the mean ndvi of annual total irrigated cropland is the second most important factor in the increase in total iwc the last way is to identify socioeconomic strategies in arid and semiarid regions to allow irrigation water use reduction by increasing virtual water imports siebert and döll 2010 5 conclusion an irrigated cropland water model was developed to compute the irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland at a spatial resolution of 8 km by 8 km over china during 1982 2015 the quantified mean annual total irrigation water consumption is approximately 179 43 24 60 km3 this method is also suitable at the basin scale when applying this method decomposition of the et product selection needs to be treated with caution our simulation results identified more rapid growth in the annual total iwc in water deficient areas arid and semiarid regions than in the water sufficient areas humid and dry subhumid regions during 1982 2015 through a trend attribution analysis we determined that human activities which consist of irrigation cropland expansion and manage crop ways change are the major factors increasing china s total iwc of irrigated cropland with a contribution of 83 95 1 2 while interannual climatic variability plays a weaker role the annual total iwc in the arid zone increased more quickly than in the semiarid regions rapid growth of annual total iwc in the arid zone may intensify water scarcity credit authorship contribution statement lichang yin conceptualization methodology writing original draft software validation visualization xiaoming feng

427,the collapse of a submerged granular pile under the action of the gravity force is investigated by means of a depth averaged model hereinafter dam the granular pile is a mixture of solid particles and ambient liquid totally covered by a layer of ambient liquid the dam is obtained by depth averaging the mass and momentum equations of the mixture and the ambient fluid and is aimed at providing estimates of technical quantities regarding the considered phenomenon the dam is numerically solved by adopting an equivalent discrete boltzmann equation model hereinafter dbe as solution method the main advantage yielded by the dbe is the possibility to turn the original system of strongly non linear partial differential equations which would require the resort to complex numerical schemes into a purely advective linear first order one previously published experimental and numerical data relative to the collapse of loose rectangular granular piles in water are reproduced by the proposed model and a satisfactory agreement is found revealing that the dam is able to describe reliably the overall dynamics in terms of quantities of technical interest as the height of the submerged granular flow and the instantaneous position of its front keywords submerged granular flows shallow water model discrete boltzmann method 1 introduction submerged granular flows generated by the collapse of a column consisting of a mixture of solid particles and ambient liquid under a layer of ambient liquid are a suitable model of underwater natural phenomena such as sub marine avalanches debris flows landslides and turbidity currents these gravity driven flows may be very hazardous for underwater structures as cables and other subsea facilities furthermore they can even change the geo morphology of waterways and cause tsunamis pinzon and cabrera 2019 all this motivates the ongoing research on the still open issues of the dynamics of submerged granular flows fully three dimensional mathematical models of these flows are used in theoretical computational approaches and are derived considering the fluid sediment mixtures as consisting of separate continuum phases interacting with each other these mathematical models can be obtained either considering the mixture of a single solid phase and an ambient fluid monodisperse granular flow or the mixture of np solid phases np 1 and the ambient fluid polydisperse granular flow they give a detailed description of the considered phenomenon but result in complex formulations hardly suitable for technical purposes some recent interesting examples are represented by baumgarten and kamrin 2019 lee and huang 2018 nucci et al 2019 savage et al 2014 bürger et al 2000 tory et al 2003 thornton et al 2006 tunuguntla et al 2014 wang et al 2017 where regardless of the computational aspects most of the attention is dedicated to the analysis of rheological models such as the definition of suitable constitutive equations and forces exchanged between the granular flow and the ambient fluid an accurate and exhaustive discussion on the rheology of granular flows is given in armanini 2013 an important issue in defining the rheological models of hyperconcentrated granular flows as those considered in this work whose sediment concentration is greater than 0 3 is that the flow regime depends sensibly on the sediment concentration thus different flow regimes are simultaneously present along the depth because the concentration of sediment changes with the depth moreover rheological models able to account for the different flow regimes obtained combining the kinetic theory valid in the collisional regime near the free surface and the coulombian model valid in the frictional regime near the bed have been developed in meruane et al 2010 armanini et al 2014 constitutive relations based on the kinetic theory have been formulated in the framework of steady uniform granular flows in berzi and jenkins 2011 berzi and fraccarollo 2013 gollin et al 2017 and even more recently in berzi et al 2020 these constitutive relations account for the spatial variations of the granular flow quantities along the coordinate perpendicular to the flow and have proven very useful as they permit the definition of boundary conditions at solid surfaces and phase interfaces submerged granular flows can be given an effective technical description based on depth averaged quantities the thicknesses of the granular flow and the top ambient fluid layer such a technical description can be obtained by depth averaging the fully three dimensional model and is consistent when the characteristic wavelength of the streamwise perturbations is much larger than the thickness of the flow examples of this procedure are given in pitman and le 2005 fernández nieto et al 2013 halsey et al 2017 the resulting mathematical model the shallow granular flow equations hereinafter referred to as the depth averaged model hereinafter dam is a rather complex partial differential system in non conservative form not necessarily hyperbolic fernández nieto et al 2013 and whose integration needs particular care the aim of this paper is to propose a dam for submerged granular flows and to verify if it is able to capture the overall dynamics of the flow in la rocca et al 2018 and la rocca et al 2019 dams have been formulated and successfully applied to investigate the dynamics of two phase and polydisperse granular flows respectively in this work the proposed dam is obtained by depth averaging both the governing equations of the granular flow and the top layer of ambient fluid for the sake of completeness the granular flow is considered as polydisperse i e as a mixture of np solid phases np 1 and an ambient fluid phase the resulting mathematical model is a set of 3 n p 2 partial differential equations in non conservative form an important point is that in the dam of the granular flow the sediment concentration is by definition constant along the depth then the rheological model of the granular flow must be suitably adapted this aspect has been treated in armanini 2015 where a set of closure relations valid for a large range of slopes and concentrations is obtained in the framework of the dam of a two phase flow of water and sediment in armanini 2015 a bagnoldian rheology over the entire depth of the flow is assumed and leads to the definition of a friction factor which depends among other quantities on the depth averaged sediment concentration the average grain size and the average distance between particles however as observed in armanini 2015 the stress in the granular flow can be defined adopting a coulombian scheme too defining appropriately bottom friction and interphase drag coefficients such an approach is quite common see e g pitman and le 2005 halsey et al 2017 armanini 2015 and will be adopted here the main limitation of the coulombian model is that it does not take into account the flow velocity thus also the bagnoldian model defined in armanini 2015 will be considered in order to ascertain if the use of these models give rise to meanigful differences the extension of rheological models based on the kinetic theory although interesting is beyond the scope of this work the discrete boltzmann equation model hereinafter dbe firstly introduced to simulate shallow water flows la rocca et al 2015 then successfully extended to investigate the propagation of discontinuities in two phase la rocca et al 2018 and polydisperse granular flows la rocca et al 2019 will be adopted as computational solution method it is worth highlighting that the main advantage of the dbe lies in its extreme simplicity and versatility as it consists of purely advective linear first order partial differential equations being nonlinearities relegated into the forcing term the above feature stems from the kinetic nature of the approach succi 2001 as a consequence the numerical solutions of the dbe are easily obtainable with no need for sophisticated numerical methods as those based on the approximate riemann solvers used for hyperbolic partial differential equation in non conservative form fernández nieto et al 2013 in order to assess the validity of the proposed dam the submerged two phase granular flows of rondon et al 2011 and lee et al 2018 are reproduced these submerged granular flows are realized by lifting a gate separating two different domains one filled with the mixture of sediment and ambient fluid mostly water and the other filled with ambient fluid a very important parameter is the initial volume concentration ϕ whose value determines the loose or dense condition for the granular column according to rondon et al 2011 a value of ϕ 0 55 determines the loose condition while a value of ϕ 0 58 determines the dense condition the initial volume concentration has a significant effect on the collapse of a submerged granular column for an initially loose condition the collapse process is rapid and the deposition layer is thin and long for an initially dense condition the collapse process is slow and the runout distance is much shorter lee and huang 2018 this work is focused on initially loose submerged granular flows the structure of the paper is as follows first the dam of submerged granular flows is obtained second the dbe model as solution method is briefly introduced third suitable closure relations are presented for bottom and inter phase stresses fourth the considered experimental submerged granular flows are described fifth results are discussed and conclusions drawn 2 the mathematical model we consider a two dimensional lower layer of thickness h h x y t containing a mixture of an ambient liquid of

particles contained in the lower layer are divided into np homogeous groups each one with given size di and density ρ i i 1 n p fig 1 each group of particles occupies a fraction ϕ i i 1 n p of the available volume while the ambient liquid occupies the fraction ϕ 0 fig 1 the sum of these volume fractions satisfies the constraint 1 i 0 n p ϕ i 1 the dynamics of the top layer of ambient liquid and

pressure at the separation surface between the top layer of ambient liquid and the granular flow pi be defined as 3 p i ρ 0 g h according to thornton et al 2006 tunuguntla et al 2014 la rocca et al

h l f l g l contain the conservative terms of eq 10 while vectors s i b i s l b l express the nonconservative and forcing terms inter phase momentum exchange and bottom friction terms respectively eq 10 are the 3 1 n p depth averaged or shallow granular flow equations for a mixture consisting of the liquid phase and np solid phases and the 3 shallow water equations of the top layer of ambient liquid α i i 1 n p α l are the depth averaged drag coefficients of the ith solid phase and the top layer respectively the quantities γ i i 1 n p are the ratio of the density of the liquid phase and the density of the ith solid phase γ i ρ 0 ρ i ui vi ul vl umix vmix are the cartesian components of the depth averaged velocity vector of the ith phase i 0 n p of the top layer and of the depth averaged mixture velocity vector the quantities h i i 0 n p are the fractions of the flow thickness h occupied by the ith phase fig 1 they are defined as h i h ϕ i and hereinafter referred to as phase thicknesses h is the thickness of the top layer fig 1 tixz tiyz are the cartesian components of the bottom friction stresses acting on the ith phase i 0 n p finally m x i j m y i j i j 1 n p are defined by depth averaging the cartesian components of the vector m ij the force per unit mass exerted by the jth on the ith solid phase tangential stresses acting at z h z f i e on the separation surface between the shallow granular flow and the top layer of ambient liquid have been accounted by the drag force term 8 the validity of the dam 10 is limited to the cases where segregation of the solid phase within the single layer does not affect the overall dynamics these cases include impulsive phenomena for which the evolution is dominated by inertial effects and as such segregation which is a buoyancy effect is counterbalanced by mixing for example the dynamics developing during initial stages of collapses such as the ones considered here are likely to be weakly dependent on successive segregation when segregation cannot be ruled out a priori one may resort to model the subtraction of mass from the layers by means of suitable terms added to the right hand sides of the mass conservation equations of the solid phases fernández nieto et al 2013 3 closure relations suitable closure relations must be introduced to model the momentum exchange among the phases and the rheology of the granular flow in the framework of a dam and with reference to the considered flow the momentum exchange among phases can be represented by means of the drag force exerted by the liquid phase on the ith solid phase by the drag force exerted by the top liquid layer on the granular flow and by the momentum exchange among solid phases the drag force exerted by the liquid phase on the ith solid phase is expressed by means of the depth averaged drag coefficient α i defined as 12 α i f i u 0 u i i e by means of the dimensionless coefficient f i whose definition can be given in terms of the flow variables as in la rocca et al 2018 in this work the cofficient f i is given a constant value for the sake of simplicity the drag force exerted by the top liquid layer on the granular flow is expressed similarly by means of the depth averaged drag coefficient α l 13 α l f l u l u m i x i e by means of the dimensionless coefficient f l assumed constant for the sake of simplicity the momentum exchange among solid phases is represented by the cartesian components m x i j m y i j of the vector m ij which can be expressed by the nakamura capes formula tory et al 2003 14 m x i j 3 2 μ e h i d i ϕ i ϕ j 1 d j d i 2 γ j γ i d j d i 3 u i u j u i u j m y i j 3 2 μ e h i d i ϕ i ϕ j 1 d j d i 2 γ j γ i d j d i 3 u i u j v i v j where the dimensionless parameter μe accounts for the elastic or plastic nature of the collisions among particles and its values belong to the range 0 μe 5 tory et al 2003 in order to characterize the rheology of the granular flow in the framework of a dam it is necessary to define the shear stresses tixz tiyz acting on the ith phase at the bottom the darcy weisbach formula can be adopted for the stresses t 0xz t 0yz acting on the liquid phase 15 t 0 x z λ 8 u 0 u 0 t 0 y z λ 8 v 0 u 0 being λ the friction coefficient a coulombian model as in pouliquen and forterre 2002 is adopted for the cartesian components of the bottom stresses acting on the ith solid phase tixz tiyz 16 t i x z μ i g h i cos θ u i u i μ i g h i cos θ v i u i being θ μi the angle between the bottom and the horizontal direction and the friction coefficient of the ith solid phase respectively in hyperconcentrated granular flows as those considered here the rheological behavior changes along the depth from the frictional regime which occurs near the bottom where the contacts among the particles are prolonged to the collisional regime near the surface separating the granular flow from the top liquid layer the former can be represented by a coulombian model while the latter can be described by the dispersive pressure theory of bagnold or by the analogy with the theory of a dense gas armanini 2015 in the framework of a dam as that developed here it is has been shown that it is possible to define a model matching the frictional and the collisional behavior adopting the bagnoldian theory armanini 2015 however in this work we assume that the whole behavior of the granular flow is characterised by the frictional regime and its rheology expressed by the coulombian model eq 16 a rather common choice according to armanini 2015 the friction cofficient μi can be expressed in terms of flow quantities pressure velocity etc savage et al 2014 armanini et al 2014 but if the bottom roughness is smaller than the order of the particle diameter pouliquen and forterre 2002 the friction cofficient μi can be considered as constant and this hypothesis is assumed here the main limitation of the coulombian model is that it does not take into account the flow velocity thus also the bagnoldian model defined in armanini 2015 will be considered in order to ascertain if the use of these models give rise to meanigful differences 4 discrete boltzmann equation model for the submerged polydisperse shallow granular flow equations the dbe model developed in la rocca et al 2015 for transcritical shallow water flows and extended in la rocca et al 2018 la rocca et al 2019 to two phase and polydisperse shallow granular flows respectively is here extended as solution method for the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 it is necessary to add to the dbe model presented in la rocca et al 2019 a set of probability density functions f k l which propagate throughout the flow domain with given velocity c k k 0 n defined as the propagation velocity along the kth spatial direction see la rocca et al 2015 the evolution of the probability density functions is governed by the discrete boltzmann equations 17 f k l t c k f k l f k l e f k l τ 2 f l c k k 0 n c k c k being τ f l the relaxation time and the external force vector acting on the top layer of ambient liquid respectively the quantity f k l is a vector whose components are f k l x f k l y it is worth observing that the external force vector f l as those acting on the solid and liquid phases of the granular flow la rocca et al 2019 gathers both non conservative and forcing terms expressed by vectors s l b l in eq 11 the equilibrium probability density functions f k l e are defined as in la rocca et al 2015 it can be shown that eq 17 together with those for the probability density functions of the solid and liquid phases of the granular flow la rocca et al 2019 are equivalent to the shallow water equations of the submerged granular flow 10 i e the latter can be obtained by performing a chapman enskog perturbation expansion on eq 17 according to the procedure shown in la rocca et al 2015 within this framework the macroscopic flow quantities 18 h l k 0 n f k l h l u l k 0 n c k f k l and those relative to the solid and the liquid phases in the granular flow defined as the 0th and first order statistical moments of the probability density functions with respect to the particle velocity coincide with those obtained by solving eq 10 if the dimensionless parameter ϵ is small la rocca et al 2018 19 ϵ c τ δ t δ s h 0 where c is the courant number δs δt are the grid spacing and the time interval respectively and h 0 is the vertical lengthscale the courant number weighs the relative importance of the physical celerity compared with the numerical one in explicit numerical methods as the one used in this study stability conditions require courant number to be in the range 0 c 1 5 results 5 1 computational aspects all the numerical simulations have been performed by applying to the dbe the discretization described in la rocca et al 2015 and adopted for granular flows in la rocca et al 2018 la rocca et al 2019 it consists in a first order finite difference discretization performed on a structured 2d uniform cartesian grid the considered fluid domains are characterized by the fact that the spatial dimension along which the granular flow propagates prevails on the other the dimension of the numerical grids are typically between 250 4 and 500 4 with an order of magnitude of the dimension of the grid spacing δs equal to o 10 3 m the time step is defined as δ t δ s c 0 being c 0 the modulus of the particle velocity the order of magnitude of δt is equal to o 10 4 s able to reduce the numerical diffusion proportional to δs 2 δt a set of thirteen velocities c k k 0 1 12 distributed on two circles as in la rocca et al 2015 has been adopted the dimensionless relaxation time τ δt has been set to 0 7 the order of magnitude of the courant number has been set to 10 1 as a consequence the order of magnitude of the dimensionless parameter 19 is equal to 10 4 thus ensuring the convergence of the dbe system of equations to the shallow water equations of the submerged granular flow 10 5 2 effect of the drag and friction coefficients the collapse of a loose submerged granular column investigated experimentally in rondon et al 2011 is considered the experimental setup consists of a perspex tank 0 7 m long 0 15 m high and 0 15 m wide partially filled with the ambient liquid and with the submerged granular column a sliding gate placed at x l separates the ambient liquid from the granular column fig 1 after the gate is removed a dam break like flow of the submerged granular column is originated as for the considered case the gate is positioned at 0 06 m from the upstream end of the tank the granular column is realized with only one solid phase consisting of glass beads density ρ 1 2500 k g m 3 diameter 225 μm and a mixture of water 87 and ucon oil 13 as ambient liquid mixture density ρ 0 1000 k g m 3 viscosity μ 0 0 012 p a s the submerged granular column has an initial height of 0 048 m while the total height of the submerging ambient liquid and the granular column is equal to 0 15 m the initial value of the aspect ratio a of the granular column defined as the ratio of the initial height of the column on the position of the gate is given by a 0 8 the initial value of the solid volume fraction ϕ 1 is equal to 0 55 although this value is characteristic for the loose condition nevertheless it is representative for a hyperconcentrated granular flow ϕ 1 0 3 armanini 2015 this fact justifies the choice of the coulombian rheological model for the representation of the tangential stress acting at the bottom on the solid phase initial values of the solid volume fraction ϕ 1 such that ϕ 1 0 58 rondon et al 2011 are characteristic for the dense condition the initial value of the solid volume fraction has a deep influence on the dynamics of the collapse according to rondon et al 2011 an initial loose condition of the granular column causes a rapid submerged granular flow with an elongated shape for the final deposit on the contrary an initial dense condition causes a slow submerged granular flow with a shape for the final deposit determined by the angle of repose of the material the interpretation of such a behavior is based on the fact that the fluidization of the material looses importance with the increase of the volume fraction where particle particle interactions become more and more important rondon et al 2011 in the following only the loose condition will be taken into account the position xf of the front of the submerged granular flow versus time is plotted in fig 2 the square dots are the experimental values obtained by rondon et al 2011 and reported in wang et al 2017 the curves a b c are the time histories of the numerical front position for different values of the friction factors μ 1 λ respectively pertaining to the solid and the ambient liquid phase of the granular flow for both of them the range 0 1 0 3 has been found to yield results encompassing the whole experimental time series with 0 15 representing the best fit value curve c in fig 2 while the front position shows a strong dependence on the values of the friction factors λ μ 1 it weakly depends on the drag coefficients f 1 f l and they are thus not varied curve c in fig 2 shows a very good agreement between numerical and experimental results at least for 0 t 4s for t 4s numerical and experimental results diverge gradually due to the fact that the spreading of the experimental granular column slows down at a much higher rate than the numerical granular column this behavior emerges probably as a consequence of the use of constant values of the friction factors λ μ 1 which is likely to be a too crude representation of the dynamics of the considered phenomenon a more accurate modelling of dissipative processes should be based on flow depending values of the friction factors indeed the strong dependence of the position of the front on the friction factor indicates that the flow regime is probably dominated by the viscosity with friction factors depending on the inverse of the reynolds number this fact is supported by the fact that during the collapse the order of magnitude of the values achieved by the reynolds number of the granular flow reg are in the range o 102 o 101 the reynolds number of the granular flow has been defined as 20 r e g ρ u m i x h μ g being μg the viscosity of the granular flow estimated by means of the dougherty krieger equation woods and krieger 1970 the instantaneous profiles of the submerged granular flow at t 0 66 s t 1 32 s t 1 98 s t 3 96 s are reported in fig 3 where dots represent the experimental results reported in wang et al 2017 rondon et al 2011 the coulombian model defined in the previous section and adopted to express the friction stress on the solid phase permits to obtain results plotted with a black solid line in fairly good agreement with the experimental results of rondon et al 2011 it is worth mentioning that a similar agreement is achieved considering the results plotted with a black dashed line obtained by expressing the friction stress by means of a bagnoldian model defined according to armanini 2015 the differences between the numerical results obtained with the coulombian and the bagnoldian models decay in time this is presumably due to the fact that the loose condition ϕ 1 0 55 can be considered to belong to a sort of overlapping zone as for the validity of the two rheological models in conclusion the agreement between experimental and dam numerical results is fairly good and comparable to that obtained with fully three dimensional model as e g in savage et al 2014 wang et al 2017 and baumgarten and kamrin 2019 5 3 effect of the initial aspect ratio on the collapse and the final deposit morphology of the granular column the initial aspect ratio a has an important effect on the dynamics of the collapse of the submerged granular column as noted e g by pinzon and cabrera 2019 rondon et al 2011 and lee et al 2018 the aspect ratio affects both the initial collapse process driven by the gravitational force and the final deposit morphology according to lee et al 2018 there is a main critical value a l of the aspect ratio such that for a a l the collapse occurs as a descending process as the solid particles in the lower portion of the column slide forward down along a smaller failure surface for values of the aspect ratio such that a a l the collapse occurs as a sliding process as the solid particles in the lower portion of the column slide forward down along a larger failure surface the dependency of the final deposit morphology of the granular column on the aspect ratio is more complicate following lee et al 2018 for a a l the shape of the final deposit can be either a mexican hat or triangular wether a a m a a m respectively being a m a second critical value of the aspect ratio for for a a l the shape of the final deposit can be either triangular or trapezoidal wether a a h a a h respectively being a h a third critical value of the aspect ratio the critical values a l a m have been numerically determined by lee et al 2018 and found equal to 3 8 respectively the critical value a h depends on the size of the particles the numerical values found by lee et al 2018 are in the range 0 60 a h 0 75 being the minimum value relative to fine particles diameter d 1 210 4 m the maximum value to coarse particles diameter d 5 610 4 m it is worth observing that the numerical and experimental results of lee et al 2018 have been obtained in low viscous fluid water higher values of the viscosity as those considered in rondon et al 2011 affect the values of the abovementioned critical values of the aspect ratio mainly a h in fig 4 the front position xf of the granular column is plotted versus time for four different values of the initial aspect ratio a 10 a 5 a 1 67 a 0 5 from top to bottom respectively the dots are the numerical results of lee et al 2018 obtained by solving a fully three dimensional model relative to a submerged granular flow realized with coarse glass particles diameter d 1 0 56 m m density ρ 1 2530 k g m 3 initial volume fraction ϕ 1 0 55 the solid lines are the numerical results obtained by solving the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 by means of the dbe model it is evident that the smaller the aspect ratio the better the agreement this fact makes sense as in correspondence of increasingly low values of the aspect ratio a 1 is expected that the physical consistency of the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 increases the trapezoidal shape of the final deposit morphology of the granular column corresponding to the aspect ratio a 0 5 is shown in fig 5 the dots represent the numerical results of lee et al 2018 while the solid line represents the numerical results obtained by solving the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 by means of the dbe model the shape of the final deposit morphology of the granular column is obtained at t 1 4 s it is interesting to observe that the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 yield a final configuration of the deposit in good agreement with that obtained by the much more sophisticated three dimensional model applied in lee et al 2018 5 4 effect of the initial aspect ratio on the spreading velocity according to lee et al 2018 three stages of the submerged granular flow can be identified with respect to the advancing velocity of the front the accelerating the constant velocity and the decelerating stage the constant velocity which characterizes the second stage is defined as the spreading velocity uf of the granular flow the latter depends on the reduced gravity g g g ρ 1 ρ 0 ρ 0 the initial height h and length l of the granular column 21 u f f g h l thanks to dimensional analysis it is possible to express the normalised spreading velocity as 22 u f g l f h l from the numerical simulations of lee et al 2018 based on a fully three dimensional model the following empirical relation can be obtained for the normalised spreading velocity 23 u f g l a 1 2 a a l u f g l a 1 3 a a l in fig 6 the log log plot of the empirical law 23 for a a l is shown solid line the dots represent the numerical values of the normalised spreading velocity obtained by solving the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 by means of the dbe model the dots fit well with the empirical law 24 u f g l 0 0831 a 0 45 a 1 u f g l 0 0772 a 0 2091 1 5 a a l in other words the empirical law 24 obtained from the present numerical data for a 1 approximates quite well the empirical law 23 assumed as benchmark on the contrary for 1 5 a a l the empirical law 24 is quite different from the empirical law 23 this fact is not surprising as increasing values of the aspect ratio correspond to physical conditions not consistent with the dam 5 5 effect of the initial aspect ratio on the final height of the gravity current the ratio of the maximum final height hf and the initial length li of the granular flow depends on the aspect ratio a according to the following empirical law deduced from experiments and fully three dimensional numerical simulations lee et al 2018 25 h f l i a a a h h f l i a 1 3 a h a a l the value of a h is in the range 0 60 a h 0 75 depending on the size of the particles lee et al 2018 in fig 7 the ratio h f l i is shown versus a in a log log plot the continuous line is the empirical law 25 while dots are relative to numerical results the dashed line is the interpolation curve of the numerical data the latter shows a slightly different trend with respect to the empirical law 25 for a 0 7 indicated by the exponent 0 81 of the power law interpolation for a 0 7 the numerical data follow a completely different trend with respect to that foreseen by the empirical law 25 this is a further confirmation of the fact that for increasing values a the dam looses consistency 6 concluding remarks in this work a depth averaged model dam for submerged granular flows is developed and solved by means of the discrete boltzmann equation dbe method experiments and fully three dimensional numerical simulations reported in literature are considered as benchmark cases the dam describes the evolution of the submerged granular flow in terms of thickness of the flow and propagation velocity the comparison of dbe numerical results with experimental or fully three dimensional numerical results shows a fairly good agreement for small values of the aspect ratio a 1 while the agreement becomes poor for values of the aspect ratiosuch that a 1 this is consistent with the fact that the dam is considered valid within the limit of small values of the aspect ratio the rheology of the granular flow has been defined in the framework of a coulombian model anyway the results obtained considering a suitable depth averaged bagnoldian model are closely similar to those obtained with the coulombian model the role of dissipative forces has been highlighted as fundamental in determining the dynamics of the submerged granular flow probably due to the fact that the motion belongs to the viscous dominated regime in conclusion the dam has proven to be a suitable tool to simulate the collapse of submerged granular flow for small values of the aspect ratio the dbe has confirmed its ability as computational solution method finally the fairly good agreement between present numerical and benchmark data has been obtained assuming constant values for friction and drag coefficients a more refined model of these coefficients including dependency on the flow variables is expected to yield a positive impact

427,the collapse of a submerged granular pile under the action of the gravity force is investigated by means of a depth averaged model hereinafter dam the granular pile is a mixture of solid particles and ambient liquid totally covered by a layer of ambient liquid the dam is obtained by depth averaging the mass and momentum equations of the mixture and the ambient fluid and is aimed at providing estimates of technical quantities regarding the considered phenomenon the dam is numerically solved by adopting an equivalent discrete boltzmann equation model hereinafter dbe as solution method the main advantage yielded by the dbe is the possibility to turn the original system of strongly non linear partial differential equations which would require the resort to complex numerical schemes into a purely advective linear first order one previously published experimental and numerical data relative to the collapse of loose rectangular granular piles in water are reproduced by the proposed model and a satisfactory agreement is found revealing that the dam is able to describe reliably the overall dynamics in terms of quantities of technical interest as the height of the submerged granular flow and the instantaneous position of its front keywords submerged granular flows shallow water model discrete boltzmann method 1 introduction submerged granular flows generated by the collapse of a column consisting of a mixture of solid particles and ambient liquid under a layer of ambient liquid are a suitable model of underwater natural phenomena such as sub marine avalanches debris flows landslides and turbidity currents these gravity driven flows may be very hazardous for underwater structures as cables and other subsea facilities furthermore they can even change the geo morphology of waterways and cause tsunamis pinzon and cabrera 2019 all this motivates the ongoing research on the still open issues of the dynamics of submerged granular flows fully three dimensional mathematical models of these flows are used in theoretical computational approaches and are derived considering the fluid sediment mixtures as consisting of separate continuum phases interacting with each other these mathematical models can be obtained either considering the mixture of a single solid phase and an ambient fluid monodisperse granular flow or the mixture of np solid phases np 1 and the ambient fluid polydisperse granular flow they give a detailed description of the considered phenomenon but result in complex formulations hardly suitable for technical purposes some recent interesting examples are represented by baumgarten and kamrin 2019 lee and huang 2018 nucci et al 2019 savage et al 2014 bürger et al 2000 tory et al 2003 thornton et al 2006 tunuguntla et al 2014 wang et al 2017 where regardless of the computational aspects most of the attention is dedicated to the analysis of rheological models such as the definition of suitable constitutive equations and forces exchanged between the granular flow and the ambient fluid an accurate and exhaustive discussion on the rheology of granular flows is given in armanini 2013 an important issue in defining the rheological models of hyperconcentrated granular flows as those considered in this work whose sediment concentration is greater than 0 3 is that the flow regime depends sensibly on the sediment concentration thus different flow regimes are simultaneously present along the depth because the concentration of sediment changes with the depth moreover rheological models able to account for the different flow regimes obtained combining the kinetic theory valid in the collisional regime near the free surface and the coulombian model valid in the frictional regime near the bed have been developed in meruane et al 2010 armanini et al 2014 constitutive relations based on the kinetic theory have been formulated in the framework of steady uniform granular flows in berzi and jenkins 2011 berzi and fraccarollo 2013 gollin et al 2017 and even more recently in berzi et al 2020 these constitutive relations account for the spatial variations of the granular flow quantities along the coordinate perpendicular to the flow and have proven very useful as they permit the definition of boundary conditions at solid surfaces and phase interfaces submerged granular flows can be given an effective technical description based on depth averaged quantities the thicknesses of the granular flow and the top ambient fluid layer such a technical description can be obtained by depth averaging the fully three dimensional model and is consistent when the characteristic wavelength of the streamwise perturbations is much larger than the thickness of the flow examples of this procedure are given in pitman and le 2005 fernández nieto et al 2013 halsey et al 2017 the resulting mathematical model the shallow granular flow equations hereinafter referred to as the depth averaged model hereinafter dam is a rather complex partial differential system in non conservative form not necessarily hyperbolic fernández nieto et al 2013 and whose integration needs particular care the aim of this paper is to propose a dam for submerged granular flows and to verify if it is able to capture the overall dynamics of the flow in la rocca et al 2018 and la rocca et al 2019 dams have been formulated and successfully applied to investigate the dynamics of two phase and polydisperse granular flows respectively in this work the proposed dam is obtained by depth averaging both the governing equations of the granular flow and the top layer of ambient fluid for the sake of completeness the granular flow is considered as polydisperse i e as a mixture of np solid phases np 1 and an ambient fluid phase the resulting mathematical model is a set of 3 n p 2 partial differential equations in non conservative form an important point is that in the dam of the granular flow the sediment concentration is by definition constant along the depth then the rheological model of the granular flow must be suitably adapted this aspect has been treated in armanini 2015 where a set of closure relations valid for a large range of slopes and concentrations is obtained in the framework of the dam of a two phase flow of water and sediment in armanini 2015 a bagnoldian rheology over the entire depth of the flow is assumed and leads to the definition of a friction factor which depends among other quantities on the depth averaged sediment concentration the average grain size and the average distance between particles however as observed in armanini 2015 the stress in the granular flow can be defined adopting a coulombian scheme too defining appropriately bottom friction and interphase drag coefficients such an approach is quite common see e g pitman and le 2005 halsey et al 2017 armanini 2015 and will be adopted here the main limitation of the coulombian model is that it does not take into account the flow velocity thus also the bagnoldian model defined in armanini 2015 will be considered in order to ascertain if the use of these models give rise to meanigful differences the extension of rheological models based on the kinetic theory although interesting is beyond the scope of this work the discrete boltzmann equation model hereinafter dbe firstly introduced to simulate shallow water flows la rocca et al 2015 then successfully extended to investigate the propagation of discontinuities in two phase la rocca et al 2018 and polydisperse granular flows la rocca et al 2019 will be adopted as computational solution method it is worth highlighting that the main advantage of the dbe lies in its extreme simplicity and versatility as it consists of purely advective linear first order partial differential equations being nonlinearities relegated into the forcing term the above feature stems from the kinetic nature of the approach succi 2001 as a consequence the numerical solutions of the dbe are easily obtainable with no need for sophisticated numerical methods as those based on the approximate riemann solvers used for hyperbolic partial differential equation in non conservative form fernández nieto et al 2013 in order to assess the validity of the proposed dam the submerged two phase granular flows of rondon et al 2011 and lee et al 2018 are reproduced these submerged granular flows are realized by lifting a gate separating two different domains one filled with the mixture of sediment and ambient fluid mostly water and the other filled with ambient fluid a very important parameter is the initial volume concentration ϕ whose value determines the loose or dense condition for the granular column according to rondon et al 2011 a value of ϕ 0 55 determines the loose condition while a value of ϕ 0 58 determines the dense condition the initial volume concentration has a significant effect on the collapse of a submerged granular column for an initially loose condition the collapse process is rapid and the deposition layer is thin and long for an initially dense condition the collapse process is slow and the runout distance is much shorter lee and huang 2018 this work is focused on initially loose submerged granular flows the structure of the paper is as follows first the dam of submerged granular flows is obtained second the dbe model as solution method is briefly introduced third suitable closure relations are presented for bottom and inter phase stresses fourth the considered experimental submerged granular flows are described fifth results are discussed and conclusions drawn 2 the mathematical model we consider a two dimensional lower layer of thickness h h x y t containing a mixture of an ambient liquid of density ρ 0 and solid particles and a top layer of ambient liquid of thickness h h x y t of density ρ 0 fig 1 the bottom is considered as fixed and described by the function z z f x y the solid particles contained in the lower layer are divided into np homogeous groups each one with given size di and density ρ i i 1 n p fig 1 each group of particles occupies a fraction ϕ i i 1 n p of the available volume while the ambient liquid occupies the fraction ϕ 0 fig 1 the sum of these volume fractions satisfies the constraint 1 i 0 n p ϕ i 1 the dynamics of the top layer of ambient liquid and of the mixture of solid particles and ambient liquid assuming the continuum approach of the theory of mixtures bürger et al 2000 tory et al 2003 thornton et al 2006 is governed by the equations of conservation of mass and momentum of the ambient liquid and each homogeneous group of particles 2 t ρ i ϕ i ϕ i ρ i u i 0 t ϕ i ρ i u i ϕ i ρ i u i u i p i ρ i ϕ i g k t i b i b l i t ρ 0 ρ 0 u l 0 t

velocity pressure and residual stress tensor of the ambient liquid in the top layer finally b li is the force exerted on the ith phase by the top layer let us assume that the thickness of the mixture and the top layer h h are small with respect to the horizontal wavelength l of the perturbations of the flow quantities and that consequently the pressure distribution is overall hydrostatic let the pressure at the separation surface between the top layer of ambient liquid and the granular flow pi be defined as 3 p i ρ 0 g h according to thornton et al 2006 tunuguntla et al 2014 la rocca et al 2019 and to eq 3 the pressure distributions in the ith layer i 0 n p and in the top layer are given by 4 p 0 ϕ 0 ρ 0 g h z f z ϕ 0 p i p i ϕ i ρ 0 f i ρ ρ 0 g h z f z ϕ i p i i 1 n p p l ρ 0 g h h z f

depth averaged equations for the liquid and the solid phases and the top layer the forces b i b li must be defined the force b i is exerted on the ith phase by the others if the ith phase is a solid

drag force exerted by the liquid phase and the sum of the forces exerted by the j j 1 2 n p j i solid phases on the ith one αi is the drag coefficient the force b 0 exerted on the liquid phase by the solid phases in the mixture is given by la rocca et al 2019 7 b 0 i 1 n p b i p i ρ 0 g h z f z ϕ 0 ρ 0 i 1 n p α i u 0 u i finally the force b li exerted by the top layer on the ith phase of the

h l f l g l contain the conservative terms of eq 10 while vectors s i b i s l b l express the nonconservative and forcing terms inter phase momentum exchange and bottom friction terms respectively eq 10 are the 3 1 n p depth averaged or shallow granular flow equations for a mixture consisting of the liquid phase and np solid phases and the 3 shallow water equations of the top layer of ambient liquid α i i 1 n p α l are the depth averaged drag coefficients of the ith solid phase and the top layer respectively the quantities γ i i 1 n p are the ratio of the density of the liquid phase and the density of the ith solid phase γ i ρ 0 ρ i ui vi ul vl umix vmix are the cartesian components of the depth averaged velocity vector of the ith phase i 0 n p of the top layer and of the depth averaged mixture velocity vector the quantities h i i 0 n p are the fractions of the flow thickness h occupied by the ith phase fig 1 they are defined as h i h ϕ i and hereinafter referred to as phase thicknesses h is the thickness of the top layer fig 1 tixz tiyz are the cartesian components of the bottom friction stresses acting on the ith phase i 0 n p finally m x i j m y i j i j 1 n p are defined by depth averaging the cartesian components of the vector m ij the force per unit mass exerted by the jth on the ith solid phase tangential stresses acting at z h z f i e on the separation surface between the shallow granular flow and the top layer of ambient liquid have been accounted by the drag force term 8 the validity of the dam 10 is limited to the cases where segregation of the solid phase within the single layer does not affect the overall dynamics these cases include impulsive phenomena for which the evolution is dominated by inertial effects and as such segregation which is a buoyancy effect is counterbalanced by mixing for example the dynamics developing during initial stages of collapses such as the ones considered here are likely to be weakly dependent on successive segregation when segregation cannot be ruled out a priori one may resort to model the subtraction of mass from the layers by means of suitable terms added to the right hand sides of the mass conservation equations of the solid phases fernández nieto et al 2013 3 closure relations suitable closure relations must be introduced to model the momentum exchange among the phases and the rheology of the granular flow in the framework of a dam and with reference to the considered flow the momentum exchange among phases can be represented by means of the drag force exerted by the liquid phase on the ith solid phase by the drag force exerted by the top liquid layer on the granular flow and by the momentum exchange among solid phases the drag force exerted by the liquid phase on the ith solid phase is expressed by means of the depth averaged drag coefficient α i defined as 12 α i f i u 0 u i i e by means of the dimensionless coefficient f i whose definition can be given in terms of the flow variables as in la rocca et al 2018 in this work the cofficient f i is given a constant value for the sake of simplicity the drag force exerted by the top liquid layer on the granular flow is expressed similarly by means of the depth averaged drag coefficient α l 13 α l f l u l u m i x i e by means of the dimensionless coefficient f l assumed constant for the sake of simplicity the momentum exchange among solid phases is represented by the cartesian components m x i j m y i j of the vector m ij which can be expressed by the nakamura capes formula tory et al 2003 14 m x i j 3 2 μ e h i d i ϕ i ϕ j 1 d j d i 2 γ j γ i d j d i 3 u i u j u i u j m y i j 3 2 μ e h i d i ϕ i ϕ j 1 d j d i 2 γ j γ i d j d i 3 u i u j v i v j where the dimensionless parameter μe accounts for the elastic or plastic nature of the collisions among particles and its values belong to the range 0 μe 5 tory et al 2003 in order to characterize the rheology of the granular flow in the framework of a dam it is necessary to define the shear stresses tixz tiyz acting on the ith phase at the bottom the darcy weisbach formula can be adopted for the stresses t 0xz t 0yz acting on the liquid phase 15 t 0 x z λ 8 u 0 u 0 t 0 y z λ 8 v 0 u 0 being λ the friction coefficient a coulombian model as in pouliquen and forterre 2002 is adopted for the cartesian components of the bottom stresses acting on the ith solid phase tixz tiyz 16 t i x z μ i g h i cos θ u i u i μ i g h i cos θ v i u i being θ μi the angle between the bottom and the horizontal direction and the friction coefficient of the ith solid phase respectively in hyperconcentrated granular flows as those considered here the rheological behavior changes along the depth from the frictional regime which occurs near the bottom where the contacts among the particles are prolonged to the collisional regime near the surface separating the granular flow from the top liquid layer the former can be represented by a coulombian model while the latter can be described by the dispersive pressure theory of bagnold or by the analogy with the theory of a dense gas armanini 2015 in the framework of a dam as that developed here it is has been shown that it is possible to define a model matching the frictional and the collisional behavior adopting the bagnoldian theory armanini 2015 however in this work we assume that the whole behavior of the granular flow is characterised by the frictional regime and its rheology expressed by the coulombian model eq 16 a rather common choice according to armanini 2015 the friction cofficient μi can be expressed in terms of flow quantities pressure velocity etc savage et al 2014 armanini et al 2014 but if the bottom roughness is smaller than the order of the particle diameter pouliquen and forterre 2002 the friction cofficient μi can be considered as constant and this hypothesis is assumed here the main limitation of the coulombian model is that it does not take into account the flow velocity thus also the bagnoldian model defined in armanini 2015 will be considered in order to ascertain if the use of these models give rise to meanigful differences 4 discrete boltzmann equation model for the submerged polydisperse shallow granular flow equations the dbe model developed in la rocca et al 2015 for transcritical shallow water flows and extended in la rocca et al 2018 la rocca et al 2019 to two phase and polydisperse shallow granular flows respectively is here extended as solution method for the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 it is necessary to add to the dbe model presented in la rocca et al 2019 a set of probability density functions f k l which propagate throughout the flow domain with given velocity c k k 0 n defined as the propagation velocity along the kth spatial direction see la rocca et al 2015 the evolution of the probability density functions is governed by the discrete boltzmann equations 17 f k l t c k f k l f k l e f k l τ 2 f l c k k 0 n c k c k being τ f l the relaxation time and the external force vector acting on the top layer of ambient liquid respectively the quantity f k l is a vector whose components are f k l x f k l y it is worth observing that the external force vector f l as those acting on the solid and liquid phases of the granular flow la rocca et al 2019 gathers both non conservative and forcing terms expressed by vectors s l b l in eq 11 the equilibrium probability density functions f k l e are defined as in la rocca et al 2015 it can be shown that eq 17 together with those for the probability density functions of the solid and liquid phases of the granular flow la rocca et al 2019 are equivalent to the shallow water equations of the submerged granular flow 10 i e the latter can be obtained by performing a chapman enskog perturbation expansion on eq 17 according to the procedure shown in la rocca et al 2015 within this framework the macroscopic flow quantities 18 h l k 0 n f k l h l u l k 0 n c k f k l and those relative to the solid and the liquid phases in the granular flow defined as the 0th and first order statistical moments of the probability density functions with respect to the particle velocity coincide with those obtained by solving eq 10 if the dimensionless parameter ϵ is small la rocca et al 2018 19 ϵ c τ δ t δ s h 0 where c is the courant number δs δt are the grid spacing and the time interval respectively and h 0 is the vertical lengthscale the courant number weighs the relative importance of the physical celerity compared with the numerical one in explicit numerical methods as the one used in this study stability conditions require courant number to be in the range 0 c 1 5 results 5 1 computational aspects all the numerical simulations have been performed by applying to the dbe the discretization described in la rocca et al 2015 and adopted for granular flows in la rocca et al 2018 la rocca et al 2019 it consists in a first order finite difference discretization performed on a structured 2d uniform cartesian grid the considered fluid domains are characterized by the fact that the spatial dimension along which the granular flow propagates prevails on the other the dimension of the numerical grids are typically between 250 4 and 500 4 with an order of magnitude of the dimension of the grid spacing δs equal to o 10 3 m the time step is defined as δ t δ s c 0 being c 0 the modulus of the particle velocity the order of magnitude of δt is equal to o 10 4 s able to reduce the numerical diffusion proportional to δs 2 δt a set of thirteen velocities c k k 0 1 12 distributed on two circles as in la rocca et al 2015 has been adopted the dimensionless relaxation time τ δt has been set to 0 7 the order of magnitude of the courant number has been set to 10 1 as a consequence the order of magnitude of the dimensionless parameter 19 is equal to 10 4 thus ensuring the convergence of the dbe system of equations to the shallow water equations of the submerged granular flow 10 5 2 effect of the drag and friction coefficients the collapse of a loose submerged granular column investigated experimentally in rondon et al 2011 is considered the experimental setup consists of a perspex tank 0 7 m long 0 15 m high and 0 15 m wide partially filled with the ambient liquid and with the submerged granular column a sliding gate placed at x l separates the ambient liquid from the granular column fig 1 after the gate is removed a dam break like flow of the submerged granular column is originated as for the considered case the gate is positioned at 0 06 m from the upstream end of the tank the granular column is realized with only one solid phase consisting of glass beads density ρ 1 2500 k g m 3 diameter 225 μm and a mixture of water 87 and ucon oil 13 as ambient liquid mixture density ρ 0 1000 k g m 3 viscosity μ 0 0 012 p a s the submerged granular column has an initial height of 0 048 m while the total height of the submerging ambient liquid and the granular column is equal to 0 15 m the initial value of the aspect ratio a of the granular column defined as the ratio of the initial height of the column on the position of the gate is given by a 0 8 the initial value of the solid volume fraction ϕ 1 is equal to 0 55 although this value is characteristic for the loose condition nevertheless it is representative for a hyperconcentrated granular flow ϕ 1 0 3 armanini 2015 this fact justifies the choice of the coulombian rheological model for the representation of the tangential stress acting at the bottom on the solid phase initial values of the solid volume fraction ϕ 1 such that ϕ 1 0 58 rondon et al 2011 are characteristic for the dense condition the initial value of the solid volume fraction has a deep influence on the dynamics of the collapse according to rondon et al 2011 an initial loose condition of the granular column causes a rapid submerged granular flow with an elongated shape for the final deposit on the contrary an initial dense condition causes a slow submerged granular flow with a shape for the final deposit determined by the angle of repose of the material the interpretation of such a behavior is based on the fact that the fluidization of the material looses importance with the increase of the volume fraction where particle particle interactions become more and more important rondon et al 2011 in the following only the loose condition will be taken into account the position xf of the front of the submerged granular flow versus time is plotted in fig 2 the square dots are the experimental values obtained by rondon et al 2011 and reported in wang et al 2017 the curves a b c are the time histories of the numerical front position for different values of the friction factors μ 1 λ respectively pertaining to the solid and the ambient liquid phase of the granular flow for both of them the range 0 1 0 3 has been found to yield results encompassing the whole experimental time series with 0 15 representing the best fit value curve c in fig 2 while the front position shows a strong dependence on the values of the friction factors λ μ 1 it weakly depends on the drag coefficients f 1 f l and they are thus not varied curve c in fig 2 shows a very good agreement between numerical and experimental results at least for 0 t 4s for t 4s numerical and experimental results diverge gradually due to the fact that the spreading of the experimental granular column slows down at a much higher rate than the numerical granular column this behavior emerges probably as a consequence of the use of constant values of the friction factors λ μ 1 which is likely to be a too crude representation of the dynamics of the considered phenomenon a more accurate modelling of dissipative processes should be based on flow depending values of the friction factors indeed the strong dependence of the position of the front on the friction factor indicates that the flow regime is probably dominated by the viscosity with friction factors depending on the inverse of the reynolds number this fact is supported by the fact that during the collapse the order of magnitude of the values achieved by the reynolds number of the granular flow reg are in the range o 102 o 101 the reynolds number of the granular flow has been defined as 20 r e g ρ u m i x h μ g being μg the viscosity of the granular flow estimated by means of the dougherty krieger equation woods and krieger 1970 the instantaneous profiles of the submerged granular flow at t 0 66 s t 1 32 s t 1 98 s t 3 96 s are reported in fig 3 where dots represent the experimental results reported in wang et al 2017 rondon et al 2011 the coulombian model defined in the previous section and adopted to express the friction stress on the solid phase permits to obtain results plotted with a black solid line in fairly good agreement with the experimental results of rondon et al 2011 it is worth mentioning that a similar agreement is achieved considering the results plotted with a black dashed line obtained by expressing the friction stress by means of a bagnoldian model defined according to armanini 2015 the differences between the numerical results obtained with the coulombian and the bagnoldian models decay in time this is presumably due to the fact that the loose condition ϕ 1 0 55 can be considered to belong to a sort of overlapping zone as for the validity of the two rheological models in conclusion the agreement between experimental and dam numerical results is fairly good and comparable to that obtained with fully three dimensional model as e g in savage et al 2014 wang et al 2017 and baumgarten and kamrin 2019 5 3 effect of the initial aspect ratio on the collapse and the final deposit morphology of the granular column the initial aspect ratio a has an important effect on the dynamics of the collapse of the submerged granular column as noted e g by pinzon and cabrera 2019 rondon et al 2011 and lee et al 2018 the aspect ratio affects both the initial collapse process driven by the gravitational force and the final deposit morphology according to lee et al 2018 there is a main critical value a l of the aspect ratio such that for a a l the collapse occurs as a descending process as the solid particles in the lower portion of the column slide forward down along a smaller failure surface for values of the aspect ratio such that a a l the collapse occurs as a sliding process as the solid particles in the lower portion of the column slide forward down along a larger failure surface the dependency of the final deposit morphology of the granular column on the aspect ratio is more complicate following lee et al 2018 for a a l the shape of the final deposit can be either a mexican hat or triangular wether a a m a a m respectively being a m a second critical value of the aspect ratio for for a a l the shape of the final deposit can be either triangular or trapezoidal wether a a h a a h respectively being a h a third critical value of the aspect ratio the critical values a l a m have been numerically determined by lee et al 2018 and found equal to 3 8 respectively the critical value a h depends on the size of the particles the numerical values found by lee et al 2018 are in the range 0 60 a h 0 75 being the minimum value relative to fine particles diameter d 1 210 4 m the maximum value to coarse particles diameter d 5 610 4 m it is worth observing that the numerical and experimental results of lee et al 2018 have been obtained in low viscous fluid water higher values of the viscosity as those considered in rondon et al 2011 affect the values of the abovementioned critical values of the aspect ratio mainly a h in fig 4 the front position xf of the granular column is plotted versus time for four different values of the initial aspect ratio a 10 a 5 a 1 67 a 0 5 from top to bottom respectively the dots are the numerical results of lee et al 2018 obtained by solving a fully three dimensional model relative to a submerged granular flow realized with coarse glass particles diameter d 1 0 56 m m density ρ 1 2530 k g m 3 initial volume fraction ϕ 1 0 55 the solid lines are the numerical results obtained by solving the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 by means of the dbe model it is evident that the smaller the aspect ratio the better the agreement this fact makes sense as in correspondence of increasingly low values of the aspect ratio a 1 is expected that the physical consistency of the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 increases the trapezoidal shape of the final deposit morphology of the granular column corresponding to the aspect ratio a 0 5 is shown in fig 5 the dots represent the numerical results of lee et al 2018 while the solid line represents the numerical results obtained by solving the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 by means of the dbe model the shape of the final deposit morphology of the granular column is obtained at t 1 4 s it is interesting to observe that the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 yield a final configuration of the deposit in good agreement with that obtained by the much more sophisticated three dimensional model applied in lee et al 2018 5 4 effect of the initial aspect ratio on the spreading velocity according to lee et al 2018 three stages of the submerged granular flow can be identified with respect to the advancing velocity of the front the accelerating the constant velocity and the decelerating stage the constant velocity which characterizes the second stage is defined as the spreading velocity uf of the granular flow the latter depends on the reduced gravity g g g ρ 1 ρ 0 ρ 0 the initial height h and length l of the granular column 21 u f f g h l thanks to dimensional analysis it is possible to express the normalised spreading velocity as 22 u f g l f h l from the numerical simulations of lee et al 2018 based on a fully three dimensional model the following empirical relation can be obtained for the normalised spreading velocity 23 u f g l a 1 2 a a l u f g l a 1 3 a a l in fig 6 the log log plot of the empirical law 23 for a a l is shown solid line the dots represent the numerical values of the normalised spreading velocity obtained by solving the depth averaged equations of the submerged granular flow 10 by means of the dbe model the dots fit well with the empirical law 24 u f g l 0 0831 a 0 45 a 1 u f g l 0 0772 a 0 2091 1 5 a a l in other words the empirical law 24 obtained from the present numerical data for a 1 approximates quite well the empirical law 23 assumed as benchmark on the contrary for 1 5 a a l the empirical law 24 is quite different from the empirical law 23 this fact is not surprising as increasing values of the aspect ratio correspond to physical conditions not consistent with the dam 5 5 effect of the initial aspect ratio on the final height of the gravity current the ratio of the maximum final height hf and the initial length li of the granular flow depends on the aspect ratio a according to the following empirical law deduced from experiments and fully three dimensional numerical simulations lee et al 2018 25 h f l i a a a h h f l i a 1 3 a h a a l the value of a h is in the range 0 60 a h 0 75 depending on the size of the particles lee et al 2018 in fig 7 the ratio h f l i is shown versus a in a log log plot the continuous line is the empirical law 25 while dots are relative to numerical results the dashed line is the interpolation curve of the numerical data the latter shows a slightly different trend with respect to the empirical law 25 for a 0 7 indicated by the exponent 0 81 of the power law interpolation for a 0 7 the numerical data follow a completely different trend with respect to that foreseen by the empirical law 25 this is a further confirmation of the fact that for increasing values a the dam looses consistency 6 concluding remarks in this work a depth averaged model dam for submerged granular flows is developed and solved by means of the discrete boltzmann equation dbe method experiments and fully three dimensional numerical simulations reported in literature are considered as benchmark cases the dam describes the evolution of the submerged granular flow in terms of thickness of the flow and propagation velocity the comparison of dbe numerical results with experimental or fully three dimensional numerical results shows a fairly good agreement for small values of the aspect ratio a 1 while the agreement becomes poor for values of the aspect ratiosuch that a 1 this is consistent with the fact that the dam is considered valid within the limit of small values of the aspect ratio the rheology of the granular flow has been defined in the framework of a coulombian model anyway the results obtained considering a suitable depth averaged bagnoldian model are closely similar to those obtained with the coulombian model the role of dissipative forces has been highlighted as fundamental in determining the dynamics of the submerged granular flow probably due to the fact that the motion belongs to the viscous dominated regime in conclusion the dam has proven to be a suitable tool to simulate the collapse of submerged granular flow for small values of the aspect ratio the dbe has confirmed its ability as computational solution method finally the fairly good agreement between present numerical and benchmark data has been obtained assuming constant values for friction and drag coefficients a more refined model of these coefficients including dependency on the flow variables is expected to yield a positive impact

428,hydro climatic extremes such as droughts and floods have most likely increased due to climatic change and could lead to severe impacts on socio economic structural and environmental sectors with nearly 4000 publications the soil and water assessment tool swat is clearly one of the most extensively used ecohydrological models worldwide the model has been widely used for projecting the impacts of future hydro climatic changes but application for extreme streamflow conditions is still rarely reported to date swat application reviews have focused on compilations of swat studies for specific or relatively new applications such as eco hydrological modelling ecosystem services sub daily simulations and pesticide fate and transport simulations however no existing swat review studies have focused on simulation of hydro climatic extremes therefore this research aims to bridge this gap by compiling and reviewing the findings of studies reporting swat hydro climatic extremes including highlighting the performance and future research needs a total of 111 articles have been identified since 1999 most of these studies were conducted in the united states and china these articles can be divided into extreme flow assessments drought studies flood studies drought and flood studies swat coupling with other models and swat improvements most of the extreme performance assessment studies reported satisfactory performance with a particular emphasis on peak flow comparisons future research needs regarding this topic include 1 a unified swat extreme performance assessment framework 2 swat improvements that result in improved replication of peak and low flows 3 reliability assessment of global and satellite products for swat extreme simulations 4 bias correction of cmip6 and regional climate projections 5 comparison of swat and swat for extreme flow simulations in different types of basins 6 development of an extreme flow module within an overall swat modelling system and 7 integration of artificial intelligence within swat modelling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords swat flood drought extreme peak flow climate change 1 introduction hydro climatic extremes such as droughts and floods have most likely increased due to climate change and could lead to severe impacts on socio economic sectors giorgi et al 2018 raikes et al 2019 concern about hydro climatic extremes and their consequences has been rising in recent years as evidenced by the large effort of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in summarising climate extreme impacts on droughts sub chapter 3 1 and floods sub chapter 3 2 in the special report on extremes srex ipcc 2012 the report stated that some regions have experienced increasing length and intensity of flood and or drought events by referring to the definition of climate extreme in the srex the present study defines hydro climatic extreme as the occurrence of a hydro climatic variable s value higher or lower than a defined extremely high or low threshold value quantification of hydro climatic extremes benefits local authorities and researchers in understanding the current status and potential risks of water related disasters it is advantageous to use long term observation data to measure the trends of hydro climatic extremes for a specific region because it is the most reliable source for understanding the hydro climatic system fu et al 2010 however in many regions the availability of reliable long term observations remains a strong limitation mishra and singh 2011 richts and vrba 2016 ummenhofer and meehl 2017 moreover reliable long term hydrological data are normally even less available as compared to climate data therefore provided the models are accurate ecohydrological modelling could be used to simulate and understand the hydro climatic extremes and associated environmental impacts in regions without reliable hydrological observations ecohydrological modelling is an indispensable tool in understandig the interaction of hydrological processes and environmental issues major advantages of ecohydrological modelling include applicability for a wide range of basin scales and environment conditions and their capability to perform cost effectiveness assessments and simulate what if scenarios for planning purposes simulated streamflow could be used to further calculate hydrological and pollutant extremes at locations without a streamflow gauge moreover ecohydrological models can be used to understand the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in hydro climatic events an extensive array of hydrological and ecohydrological models have been developed many of which are described in previous review studies shepherd et al 1999 singh and woolhiser 2002 borah and bera 2004 daniel 2011 fu et al 2019 the soil and water assessment tool swat ecohydrological model arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012a williams et al 2008 bieger et al 2017 is one of the most widely used models worldwide and has been applied for an extensive suite of water resource issues across a broad range of basin scales and environmental conditions as evidenced by approximately 4000 documented publications card 2019 to date several swat review studies have been reported in the literature which can be divided into four main categories 1 general review 2 special issue review 3 specific region review and 4 specific application review general reviews include broad overviews of swat applications performance and future research needs gassman et al 2007 as well as descriptions of specific versions of swat bieger et al 2017 arnold et al 1998 special issue reviews provide a summary of the topics and findings of multiple swat studies that were published in a special issue of a specific journal e g krysanova and white 2015 gassman et al 2014 douglas mankin et al 2010 gassman and wang 2015 and tuppad et al 2011 as swat is increasingly applied across the globe compilations of swat study findings could be useful for swat developers or new users to identify its major applications capabilities challenges and limitations in a specific region to date regional based swat reviews have been conducted for the upper nile river basin region van griensven et al 2012 brazil bressiani et al 2015 and southeast asia tan et al 2019a lastly a specific application review refers to a compilation of swat results and issues for studies focused on specific or relatively new applications such as eco hydrological modelling krysanova and arnold 2008 ecosystem services francesconi et al 2016 pesticide fate and transport wang et al 2019 and sub daily applications brighenti et al 2019 one of the earliest swat hydro climatic extreme studies was conducted by van liew et al 2003 to understand how flood retention structures would affect streamflow characteristics during dry average and wet climate conditions narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and hwang et al 2006 used swat simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration to measure drought indices for studying drought patterns similar studies have been increasingly conducted in different regions of the world with more specific focus on extreme hydrological conditions including coupling models and developing extreme indices as part of the analyses however a review of studies that report application of swat for the assessment of hydro climatic extremes has not been previously reported therefore this study was conducted to fill this research gap the overall aim of this study is to summarize the findings of existing studies of swat for the assessment of hydro climatic extremes for answering common questions that might arise before during and after the swat simulation as shown in fig 1 the scope of this review is limited to hydrologic assessment only due to the need to provide an in depth analysis of swat s ability to replicate extreme hydrological events however the insights gained from this research are foundational for any swat application and have important implications regarding use of the model for testing or scenarios that include simulation of pollutant transport 2 swat model description selected articles and statistical evaluation 2 1 swat current versions of swat feature a legacy of nearly continuous model development over multiple decades as described in several previous studies arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012a gassman et al 2007 williams et al 2008 bieger et al 2017 swat is comprised of several different components including climatic inputs crop growth and yield hydrological cycling representation of management practices erosion processes and resulting sediment transport and pollutant nutrient pesticide and pathogen cycling and transport the model is usually executed using a daily time step although options are also provided to apply it using a sub daily time step arnold et al 2012b partitioning of precipitation at the soil surface between runoff and infiltration for daily time step simulations is performed using one of three variants of the u s department of agriculture usda natural resources conservation service nrcs runoff curve number rcn method arnold et al 2012b usda nrcs 2004a usda nrcs 2004b williams et al 2012 the green and ampt mein larson gaml excess rainfall method mein and larson 1973 an adaption of the original green and ampt infiltration method green and ampt 1911 is used to partition precipitation between surface runoff and infiltration for sub daily time step applications jeong et al 2010 arnold et al 2012b brighenti et al 2019 basins simulated in swat are first delineated into sub basins which are then sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus which represent landscapes consisting of homogeneous soil topographic land use and management characteristics these hrus represent percentage land areas within a sub basin and are not spatially recognized by swat version 2012 gassman and wang 2015 enhanced spatial representation of cropland landscapes and other features are possible in newer swat codes although hrus are primarily configured within larger landscape units as described by bieger et al 2017 which represent the latest version of swat that was released in 2019 swat 2019c landscape level hydrology flows and pollutant losses are estimated at the hru level which are then summed to the corresponding sub basins outlet and routed via the stream network to the overall basin outlet further details regarding the required inputs for swat and the range of available outputs are provided in arnold et al 2012b 2 2 article selection process the swat literature database card 2019 and web of science wos database were used to identify swat hydro climatic extremes related research articles four main criteria were used for the selection of articles first the article title should contain the keywords extreme flood drought peak flow high flow and or low flow this criterion was adopted to ensure that the selected studies specifically focused on the topic second only articles that were published from 1998 on were considered because that was the year that the first major description of swat was published arnold et al 1998 and also marked the beginning of when the extensive swat literature began to expand card 2019 third peer reviewed articles that were included in wos core collection cc indexed journals analytics 2019 were the primary source of information considered in this study grey literature such as government reports technical reports conference papers and non english articles were thus excluded from this review finally the selection of articles was also based on the authors judgement who have considerable knowledge of the existing swat related literature for example some articles were included even though their keywords did not match the searching criteria searching priority was given to the 3821 articles contained in the swat literature database as of july 15 2019 because the articles have been filtered and grouped according to specific categories card 2019 then the article selection was based on the four criteria that were mentioned earlier including the wos cc which contains additional up to date articles that have not been entered in the swat literature database yet a total of 147 articles were initially identified in the wos cc again on july 15 2019 based on one or more of the previous keywords within the article title in combination with the additional term swat as a topic in the wos unrelated studies were then excluded from the review e g flood modelling for the swat river pakistan in total 111 articles related to swat hydro climatic extreme simulations were ultimately identified table 1 based on the two searches the selected articles were further analysed in terms of region publication year and basin size fig 2 most of the swat hydro climatic studies were conducted in the united states 34 51 and china 13 27 as shown in fig 2c the reason for the high rate of application in the united states is that the swat model was originally developed using united states environmental land and soil conditions arnold et al 1998 moreover a series of swat workshops and hands on training organized by texas a m agrilife has been a further catalyst for increased studies in the united states similar studies have also been conducted in transboundary basins 10 62 such as the brahmaputra river basin mohammed et al 2017b and mekong river basin arias et al 2014 showing that understanding of extreme changes is very important for transnational basin management publication of swat studies has increased dramatically since 2009 tan et al 2019a card 2019 but swat assessment of hydro climatic extremes has only started to increase rapidly from 2017 fig 2a indicates that the number of articles published in 2017 was three times greater than those published in 2016 a possible explanation for this might be the increase of flood and drought disasters around the world in the past few years chou et al 2013 naveendrakumar et al 2019 increasing awareness of climate change and its impact on regional hydrological processes has resulted in the urgent formulation of hydro climatic related policies based on the possible effects of future extreme events swat has been utilized for future assessment of hydro climatic extremes in dozens of studies card 2019 because it can simulate what if scenarios easily another reason for the recent increase in swat applications for extremes applications could be the availability of hydro climatic related international grants for example an international research grant on understanding the impacts of hydro meteorological hazards in southeast asia was funded by the newton fund the uk s natural environment research council nerc the economic and social research council esrc and local governments such funding could result in increased numbers of swat hydro climatic studies in southeast asia netwon nerc 2019 fig 2b indicates the studies that report application of swat for the assessment of hydro climatic extremes were mainly conducted in basins of 10 001 100 000 km2 34 19 in size followed by 100 000 km2 17 95 101 1000 km2 16 24 and 1001 5000 km2 15 38 by contrast only 5 13 of the studies were conducted in basins that were smaller than 100 km2 fig 2b these trends underscore that swat hydro climatic extreme studies were mainly applied in basins of medium to large scales the biggest study area was the zambezi river basin with a drainage area of 1 400 000 km2 which drains parts of angola botswana malawi mozambique namibia tanzania zambia and zimbabwe the result shows that more studies should be conducted in smaller scale basins in the future 2 3 evaluation of the accuracy of swat output explicit standards have not been established for evaluating the accuracy of hydrological and eco hydrological models although various protocols have been proposed for judging simulated hydrological and or pollutant outputs engel et al 2007 arnold et al 2012a nair 2011 harmel et al 2018 typically both graphical and statistical measures are used to judge model accuracy arnold et al 2012a coffey et al 2004 describe over a dozen different statistical measures that can be used to evaluate hydrological model output including the root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse krause et al 2005 provide further insights regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the r2 and nse statistics other statistical measures have been introduced more recently such as the kling gupta efficiency kge which is described by guse et al 2017 to date the r2 and nse statistics remain the dominant measures that have been used to assess the accuracy of swat model output gassman et al 2007 gassman et al 2014 tuppad et al 2011 bressiani et al 2015 tan et al 2019a criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 are frequently used to interpret whether calculated nse and r2 values reflect satisfactory model results and are used in this study to discuss the accuracy of reported model outcomes the distribution of r2 and nse statistics that were reported among the 111 articles reviewed for this study is shown in fig 4 these statistics are based on comparisons of swat simulated streamflow values versus corresponding measured values for monthly aggregated over daily values daily and sub daily time periods nearly 90 of the nse statistics and over 90 of the r2 statistics exceed 0 5 and 0 6 respectively which are the thresholds suggested by moriasi et al 2007 and or moriasi et al 2015 for satisfactory simulation results many of the computed statistics would further satisfy criteria of good and very good streamflow simulation results as proposed by moriasi et al 2007 the relative distribution of the monthly and daily statistics shown in fig 4 is consistent with previous similar distributions reported by tuppad et al 2011 gassman et al 2014 and tan et al 2019a the distribution of sub daily statistics fig 4 is similar to the graphical summaries of nse statistics reported by brighenti et al 2019 as part of their review of studies that focused on swat sub daily time step applications 3 application the 111 articles were further divided into six major swat categories based on their primary focus 1 swat performance regarding replication of extreme flows 2 swat drought related studies 3 swat flood related studies 4 swat studies that incorporate both drought and flood analyses 5 swat coupling with other models and 6 swat model applications featuring modifications enhanced pre or post processing capabilities and or some other improvement table 1 the rationale of these categories is to better describe the major findings that are reported in each article some articles might fall under two or three categories but the first priority was given to the swat performance regarding replication of extreme flows category this is because the reliability of swat to replicate extreme flows is among the major concerns of swat users before applying the model for hydro climatic extremes studies also the majority of existing studies did not evaluate the ability of swat to replicate extreme flows 3 1 swat performance regarding simulation of extreme flows this section addresses questions related to swat s reliability regarding replication of extreme events such as 1 how to calibrate and validate swat for simulating extreme events and 2 how accurately does swat replicate extreme events fig 1 swat is a continuous time model and thus hydrologic calibration and validation are mainly based on continuous observed streamflow data performance of swat for continuous simulations has been well proven in many regions and documented in fig 4 and in previous swat reviews tan et al 2019a bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2014 tuppad et al 2011 besides that a comprehensive review covering swat sub daily scale simulations has recently been conducted by brighenti et al 2019 therefore this review only focuses on swat performance assessments that report further validation in terms of specific flood events event based peak flow low flow different precipitation intensities and or flow duration curve simulations which were analysed beyond typical continuous time assessment most of the studies only considered one of the criteria specific flood event peak flow low flow different precipitation intensities or flow duration curve for their respective swat extreme assessment for example bacopoulos et al 2017 calibrated and validated swat using an hourly time step for specific flood events for the st johns river in the united states they concluded that swat could reasonably capture flood events based on nse values of 0 85 and 0 45 computed for the simulated calibration and validation periods respectively campbell et al 2018 calibrated and validated swat for pawtuxet river basin in the united states using a daily time step for respective one year periods in 2010 and 2013 that resulted in nse values ranging from 0 62 to 0 69 they then assessed the effects of urbanization on flood events with swat using a sub daily simulation time step of 5 min pfannerstill et al 2014 is among the limited studies that evaluated the ability of swat to reproduce both extreme high and low flows they developed a multi metric performance framework by dividing a flow duration curve into five different segments very low low medium high and very high flows they concluded that the use of this performance framework could result in improved calibration of swat which in turn could lead to better prediction of extreme flows boithias et al 2017 and yu et al 2018a merged both continuous time and event based assessments in their respective studies the latter authors developed a swat event model that refined the lumped unit hydrograph from the original swat into a set of distributed units to represent spatial variability of a basin the model was able to accurately reproduce 24 flood events that occurred in the wangjiaba river china as evidenced by nse values as high as 0 95 li et al 2018a incorporated a flow duration curve assessment as part of their overall evaluation approach that included the continuous time and event based approaches mentioned earlier meanwhile yaduvanshi et al 2018 introduced precipitation intensity assessment to better understand the performance of swat under low moderate or extreme precipitation events both studies reported that swat performed well in the context of flood simulations a combination of continuous time and peak flows comparison assessment is among the typical approaches used to evaluate peak flows dakhlalla and parajuli 2016 javaheri and babbar sebens 2014 spellman et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 javaheri and babbar sebens 2014 estimated simulated sub daily peak flows for the eagle creek basin located in central indiana in the united states based on an relationship between the continuous time daily flows and the sub daily flows they found the errors of the predicted swat based peak flows varied only from 1 to 18 relative to the corresponding observed peak flows due to the development of satellite technologies kumar and lakshmi 2018 and tan et al 2018 studied the performance of satellite precipitation products in relation to swat estimates of extreme events for the gandak river basin india china and nepal and the kelantan river basin malaysia respectively kumar and lakshmi 2018 evaluated the performance of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 product using a continuous time simulation coupled with varying precipitation intensities light moderate heavy and extremely heavy precipitation they found that the trmm based swat model performed better for the moderate and heavy precipitation periods versus the light and extremely heavy precipitation periods in contrast tan et al 2018 used a combined continuous time and event based assessment to test the reliability of driving swat with three global precipitation mission gpm products hou et al 2014 a satisfactory performance was reported for swat in replicating the big yellow flood event using the gpm products 3 2 swat studies on drought understanding of historical and future droughts in terms of intensity duration severity and spatial extent is very important for freshwater management and planning mishra and singh 2011 for example priority irrigation systems could be built for sub basins with high drought risk to reduce agricultural losses drought can be mainly divided into meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2011 swat is commonly used to evaluate the impacts of meteorological and hydrological droughts in general swat based drought studies can be divided into two main groups 1 index based which are based on calculation and analysis of drought indices from swat outputs and 2 non index based which involve analysis of swat simulated streamflow in specific low flow periods in general future climate projections are incorporated into a calibrated swat model to assess the effects of predicted future drought processes the projected future swat outputs are then compared with historical values using various drought indices the comparison could be done by considering the potential drought risks such as intensity occurrences severity and duration in the future a drought index is a simplified variable representation of drought severity that uses hydro climatic inputs such as precipitation temperature and streamflow information about commonly used drought indices including their strengths and weaknesses is available in a drought indices handbook published by the world meteorological organization wmo and global water partnership gwp 2016 standardized precipitation index spi standardized streamflow index ssi standardized soil moisture index ssmi and palmer drought severity index pdsi are popular indices that are frequently used in swat drought studies tan et al 2019b vu et al 2015 and zhao et al 2019 incorporated climate projections into the swat model to calculate future spi and ssi for river basins in malaysia vietnam and china respectively meanwhile the ssmi was considered and measured by narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 kamali et al 2017 and li et al 2017 using swat simulated soil moisture data kang and sridhar 2017b and zou et al 2017 modified the pdsi to study drought impact in the united states and china respectively using streamflow soil moisture and evapotranspiration data within swat most of the studies reported that more severe drought conditions might occur in the future some swat drought studies concentrated on analysing potential future low flows rahman et al 2010 evaluated the climate change impact on low flows of the ruscom river basin located in southern ontario in the eastern part of canada they found a potential reduction of up to 50 in the annual minimum monthly flow of a five year return period they also reported that the low flows might decrease in the summer and fall but increase in the spring the lowest 7 day low flow of each year with a 10 year return period 7q10 flow was also considered in swat analyses conducted in south korea ryu et al 2011 and the united states shrestha et al 2017 shrestha et al 2019 ryu et al 2011 found a significant reduction of the 7q10 flow from 1 54 m3s 1 to 0 03 m3s 1 under the most severe scenario on the geum river basin in south korea on the other hand a flow duration curve fdc calculated from swat outputs has also been applied in drought analysis brown et al 2015 hoyos et al 2019 rahman et al 2010 the 75 q75 and 95 q95 percentiles are normally considered as the threshold for extreme low flow and low flow respectively shrestha et al 2017 li et al 2018b applied the 80 q80 percentile to precipitation station streamflow swat and soil moisture swat for comparison of meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts over the luanhe river basin china the modelling results showed that the number of hydrological and agricultural droughts were less than meteorological droughts but the durations was longer 3 3 swat flood studies in recent decades floods have become more frequent and intense around the world quantification of future flood risk is vital to reduce damage to infrastructure and human lives cloke and pappenberger 2009 although swat is not designed for flood modelling there still have been reported swat flood studies overall swat was used to understand the impact of land use and or climate changes on floods at the basin scale besides that the effectiveness of flood mitigation or retention strategies can also be simulated easily with swat to date it has been calibrated and validated at the daily scale in most of the swat flood related studies maghsood et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 mohammed et al 2017a versus monthly scale testing that is normally reported in swat drought studies tan et al 2019b bayissa et al 2018 further subdivision of the swat based flood studies table 1 results in three main categories based on the type of analyses land use change climate change and land use and climate change assessment of the impact of land use management on flood risk using the swat model has been conducted in china zhang et al 2016 spain jodar abellan et al 2019 south korea lee et al 2017 and the united states mitchell et al 2018 schilling et al 2014 van liew et al 2003 besides that angelidis et al 2010 compared the flood hydrographs that were simulated by the evrofloods model they developed versus swat for the evros maritza river basin that drains portions of bulgaria greece and turkey they found an approximately 5 8 difference between the historical and future peak flows mitchell et al 2018 proved that water retention sites wrs could effectively reduce the high flows of a minnesota river sub basin using the swat model schilling et al 2014 found a conversion of 50 to 100 of the cropland to perennial vegetation could dramatically reduce the flood risk in the raccoon river basin in west central iowa swat based climate change impact assessments are conducted by comparing the impacts of historical climate patterns with projected future climate inputs within a calibrated swat model the future climate input is usually extracted from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip 3 meehl et al 2007 and cmip5 taylor et al 2012 general circulation models gcms maghsood et al 2019 iqbal et al 2018 kharel and kirilenko 2018 or based on potential synthetic precipitation and temperature changes gao et al 2018 kehew et al 2010 kharel and kirilenko 2018 found the overspill risk ranged from 7 3 to 47 1 for devils lake in north dakota u s in response to cmip3 and cmip5 climate projections maghsood et al 2019 evaluated the flood impact using the flood frequency index ffi and sub basin flood source area index sfsai as measured from swat outputs in the talar river basin in northern iran their findings showed that high potential flood risk is found in sub basins mainly located in the eastern part of the basin iqbal et al 2018 used hec ssp a statistical software packages developed by us army corps of engineers to conduct flood frequency analysis as a function of swat simulated streamflow for the kabul river basin that drains parts of afghanistan and pakistan they found that a 50 year return period flood is likely to occur more frequently in the future assessing combined land use change and climate change impacts could provide a more robust flood risk assessment huang et al 2018 igarashi et al 2019 incorporated synthetic climate projections and future projected land use changes from the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model verburg et al 2002 into swat to study high flows in the song khwae district thailand the modelling showed that the high flows are projected to decline in the future even with an increase of cropland up to 50 within the basin cheng et al 2017 proposed the need for flood retention sites to reduce potential future flooding based on swat simulations driven by low and moderate emission scenarios climate projections in charles river basin which drains portions of the boston metropolitan area in eastern massachusetts u s similarly walters and babbar sebens 2016 applied climate projections from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2009 in swat to study the effectiveness of wetlands in mitigating high flows in the eagle creek basin u s they concluded that the wetlands could reduce the intensity of peak flows by 15 to 20 3 4 swat studies on drought and flood consideration of both low and peak flows could provide an overview of hydro climatic extreme changes and help to identify which natural hazard will have more impact in the future local authorities can thereafter allocate more funding and expertise to mitigate the specific hazard interestingly the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex giorgi et al 2009 has proven to be one of the most popular climate projections applied for this topic the cordex south asia domain database with a spatial resolution of 0 5o 50 km was incorporated into swat to study low and peak flows for the brahmaputra river system in south asia mohammed et al 2017b mohammed et al 2017a the modelling results showed that floods are projected to become more frequent and intense compared to droughts in the future tirupathi et al 2018 also incorporated the cordex south asia domains within swat to investigate the impacts of future climate projections on monsoonal rainfall patterns and excessive precipitation events similarly the cordex africa domain was used by näschen et al 2018 to assess the effects of future climate on wetland resources for the kilombero river basin in tanzania several innovative computer tools have been developed to transfer swat and other hydrologic output into useful hydrological extremes information the water engineering time series processing tool wetspro was used by leta and bauwens 2018 and leta et al 2018 to extract daily extreme low and peak flows from the swat simulated daily streamflow in belgium and hawaii respectively the tool is capable of selecting low and peak flows using the independent peak over threshold pot method by contrast chen et al 2019a measured hydrological extremes using the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha tool richter et al 1996 the iha provides 67 statistical parameters related to river ecosystems including several parameters related to hydrological extremes i e annual 1 3 7 30 90 day max or min flows frequency and duration flood or extreme low flows that can be selected by users these parameters could be measured using swat simulated historical and future streamflow projections followed by a comparison between the two periods with statistical analysis stewart et al 2015 compared historical monthly low and peak flows from 1961 to 1990 with a future period 2071 2099 using swat to understand their impact on the sierra nevada and upper colorado river basin ucrb eco hydrological system in the u s their findings showed a significant increase in the number of high flows in the winter and spring seasons particularly in the ucrb by contrast the extreme low flows of both basins are projected to increase in spring and summer this information is important to ecological scientists studying fish habitat and potential fish movement in the future 3 5 swat model coupling with other models in some cases a modeller might want to know the impact of hydro climatic extremes on swat outputs that are not based on flow characteristics e g flood extent aquatic life agricultural yield economic losses and hydro electricity capacity coupling of swat with other models helps to expand the assessment to other parameters in general hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras usace 2016 mike flood dhi 2017 and sobek deltares 2019 are some of the most widely used flood models to study potential future flood patterns via couplings with swat arunyanart et al 2017 song et al 2014 kuntiyawichai et al 2011 for example robi et al 2019 coupled swat with mike flood to identify the flood inundation extent and flooding depth under cmip5 climate projections for the ribb river basin which is located in northwest ethiopia they found that the future flood extent area could cover up to 61 01 km2 similarly chinnasamy et al 2018 coupled swat mod flow waterloo 2011 and hec ras to test the potential of the underground of taming of floods for irrigation utfi system in reducing groundwater depletion and flood extent in the ramganga river basin in india the simulation results showed that the implementation of utfi can reduce the flood inundation areas by 10 and increase the groundwater level by 7 m an insurance fund simulator called hydrologic risk transfer model mtrh shs righetto and mendiondo 2007 has been developed by coupling swat with various vulnerability and financial modules to explore drought and flood risks from an economic perspective mohor and mendiondo 2017 a case study of the piracicaba river basin in southeast brazil showed that premiums up to 1 of the local gross domestic product gdp are required when water demand increases to 20 gies et al 2014 evaluated the impacts of three different drought adaptation policies in for juba river in east africa using swat and a system dynamics model they concluded a combination of hydraulic infrastructure and new agricultural practices are the most effective policy to reduce drought impact based on guidance provided by the coupled modelling system in southeast asia arias et al 2014 coupled swat the integrated quantity and quality model iqqm simons et al 1996 the hydrologic engineering center s reservoir system simulation hec ressim usace 2013 and the two dimensional environmental impact assessment model 2d eia to quantify how hydropower development could change the hydrological regime in the sesan srepok and sekong 3s river system they found that full damming will cause significant hydrological alternations and that the local authorities should practice sustainable hydropower practices in the future 3 6 swat improvement efforts to improve swat to support more accurate hydro climatic extreme simulations have focused on development of a new drought or flood index calibration method improvement uncertainty analysis and or swat modification a specific crop based drought index calculated from precipitation temperature soil moisture depletion transpiration and biomass production with the latter three variables simulated by swat was developed to quantify agricultural drought in the united states mcdaniel et al 2017a mcdaniel et al 2017b mcdaniel et al 2017c esfahanian et al 2017 developed a new drought index called meteorological agricultural stream health and hydrological mash that merges 13 drought indices these newly developed indices could effectively identify the risk of flood or drought reliable model calibration is essential for providing a strong foundation to support scientific analysis and decision making chilkoti et al 2018 proposed a multi objective auto calibration method for improving swat low flow simulations the results showed that the volume efficiency and time series of low flow simulations in the saugeen river canada were improved by 135 and 65 respectively trudel et al 2017 evaluated low flow uncertainties based on the swat structure and approach that was simulated for the yamaska river basin in canada they found that the calibration objective function is one of the main uncertainty sources for swat low flow simulations another swat extreme flow uncertainty study was conducted by zhang et al 2014 in the qiantang river basin china the authors considered three major uncertainties that normally arise in swat for the assessment of hydro climatic extremes namely climate emission scenarios a1b a2 and b2 extreme values model generalized pareto distribution generalized extreme value distribution and pearson type 3 distribution and swat parameters sequential uncertainty method in their extreme uncertainty analysis interestingly the swat model parameters showed a larger uncertainty than the emission scenario and extreme value models for small return periods simulations meanwhile the uncertainties of the three sources for large return period simulations are likely to be similar duan et al 2018 modified the snow melting and flood process modules to improve peak flow simulation in swat by incorporating the accumulated temperature and maximum temperature elements in a snow melt processes module within swat they tested the modified swat for the tizinafu river basin in china and found a 43 improvement in the representation of the observed peak flows cohen liechti et al 2014 developed a swat reservoir model to better model flood plain behaviour in the zambezi basin in the southern african continent for instance they modified the outflow of the reservoir sub model of the swat2009 model by separating overflow from base flow the findings indicated that the modified swat model resulted in superior replication of low and high flows versus the original swat model other efforts have focused on modifying the rcn method or other hydrological functions in swat resulting in improved representation of peak flows and overall replication of measured streamflows and other hydrological indicators xie et al 2020 d white et al 2009 kim and lee 2008 4 future research directions 4 1 swat low and high flows assessment framework general procedures for building a swat model include 1 creating the model with a gis interface e g arcgis swat arcswat olivera et al 2006 swat 2019a or the qswat interface dile et al 2016 swat 2019b 2 parameter sensitivity analysis 3 calibration and uncertainty analyses 4 validation of the calibrated model and 5 performing an impact assessment typically observed streamflow data is divided into two time periods with one time period used for sensitivity analysis and calibration while the other one is used for validation this split time calibration and validation framework has been applied in the most of the swat hydro climatic extreme studies reviewed here general guidelines main issues and solutions for swat sensitivity analysis calibration and validation are available in many previous studies arnold et al 2012a abbaspour et al 2018 moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 here we only discuss the main issues and possible solutions for simulating extreme events fig 3 shows the percentage of the finest time scale streamflow observations that were used in the selected publications daily streamflow was used for calibration validation in nearly half of the studies versus monthly streamflow in the calibration process for about 25 of the studies only about 5 of the studies calibrated their model with streamflow data at a sub daily scale in general monthly scale calibration and validation was used to support drought studies this is because most of the drought index calculations only need monthly data e g standardized streamflow index ssi meanwhile swat based flood studies were mainly calibrated using daily data maghsood et al 2019 xu et al 2017 although some required hourly scale time steps to capture specific flood events widespread availability of hourly streamflow observations and hourly climate data to drive the model are still lacking particularly in developing and less developed countries however daily streamflow data are sufficient for most long term flood and drought analyses but a more comprehensive calibration and validation framework is needed for these type of applications generally studies that relied on a time continuous framework considered only a single objective function particularly the nse or r2 the squared error statistics used for the nse have been shown to be biased toward high flows chilkoti et al 2018 in addition strong r2 values can still occur even when systematic over or under prediction occurs krause et al 2005 beyond that validation of swat was only performed in a few studies as discussed in section 3 1 the current testing approaches that have been used for swat extreme assessments seem to be inconsistent for instance yaduvanshi et al 2018 and bacopoulos et al 2017 validated swat s capability to replicate specific flood events while spellman et al 2018 and dakhlalla and parajuli 2016 focused on the comparisons between simulated and measured peak flows a new unified swat based extreme assessment framework should be developed to produce more reliable outputs that could also facilitate better comparison among studies another future need is the incorporation of further calibration and validation for drought or flood index calculations for example if the study objectives are related to drought assessment using ssi then calibration and validation should be done by comparing the swat derived ssi values with corresponding observations hence the framework should consider both the general assessment and extreme flows 4 2 swat low and high flows improvement tan et al 2018 clearly showed that swat underestimated the volume of peak flow in the kelantan river basin during the big yellow flood event by 25 2 to 33 9 similarly bacopoulos et al 2017 found that swat poorly simulated the timing of peak flows in the lower st johns river basin in northeast florida piniewski et al 2017 reported swat underestimated low flows in small sub basins of the vistula and odra basins in poland these inaccurate representations of extreme flows along with similar results found in other studies zhang et al 2015 shrestha et al 2019 indicate that modification of swat s internal algorithms are essential to enable the model to more accurately and realistically simulate low and high flows the need for improving flood plain deposition algorithms within swat has been noted in previous research krysanova and arnold 2008 yu et al 2018a as noted in section 3 1 yu et al 2018a modified swat to more accurately simulate flood events using a sub daily time step similar modifications are needed to strengthen swat flood event predictions for daily time step simulations these issues have been considered during the development of swat bieger et al 2017 however swat has not yet been widely applied in different regions across the world future research is needed to compare the capability of swat versus previous swat versions regarding replicating low and peak flows for river basins representing different topographic geographical and climatic conditions another area of future research need is the development of an extreme flows module that would be directly linked with the swat model such a module would feature functions capable of providing extreme analyses that would be available in swat for users who want to study the impacts of extreme flows some common extreme indices such as flow duration curve 7q10 ssi 1 day maximum or minimum flow and 7 day maximum or minimum flows could be considered as components of an extreme flows module and should also be incorporated as part of the standard swat outputs hydrological extremes classification can unfortunately be unclear for example stewart et al 2015 defined extreme flows using a pre defined threshold method where high flows are the months with streamflow that are 100 125 and 150 greater than historical flows whereas low flows are 25 50 and 75 lower than historical flows by contrast tzoraki et al 2013 applied the pot method to classify floods into usual ecological and hazardous therefore future research is needed to identify a simple and well accepted extreme flows classification approach which can be plugged into a swat extreme flows module a standardized extreme flows classification method would facilitate comparison of flood or drought events in different regions 4 3 swat with gridded precipitation data availability of satellite climate data offers another source of input data to swat modelling particularly for regions with limited ground based climate observations modellers should test as many available climate and other input data to choose the best data for a swat application abbaspour et al 2018 reliable precipitation data is especially crucial as one of the main inputs to the swat model observed precipitation data is almost always regarded as the most reliable precipitation input but there are many limitations in reality such as missing values inhomogeneous measurements uneven station distribution and limited station coverage tan and santo 2018 for instance tan and yang 2020 reported that missing values of more than 20 in precipitation data would significantly impact on the tropical streamflow simulation especially in low flow simulations all of these issues might affect the simulation of peak and low flows to date there are more than 30 global precipitation datasets available that can serve as alternative precipitation data sources including gauge based reanalysis and satellite data sun et al 2018 these data sets are available for either long term hydro climatic extreme analysis at least 30 years or short term events up to 30 min temporal scale although the long term national centers for environmental ncep cfsr data are available at the swat website swat 2019a it seems to be less reliable in replicating rainfall for some regions and corresponding streamflow simulation by swat for example the ncep cfsr data did not perform well in swat applications for river basins in china yang et al 2014 brazil bressiani et al 2015 monteiro et al 2016 ethiopia roth and lemann 2016 and kenya and tanzania alemayehu et al 2017 in contrast tan et al 2017 found that the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water aphrodite dataset yatagai et al 2012 ncar 2019 performed better than the ncep cfsr for two river basins simulated in swat in malaysia yang et al 2014 also report that aphrodite precipitation data resulted in improved streamflow predictions relative to cfsr data for a swat application in central china therefore more effort is required to test the reliability of freely available precipitation products for swat extreme simulations moreover integration of global satellite and observed precipitation data might produce better precipitation inputs for swat modelling 4 4 swat climate projections the cmip3 cmip5 and cmip6 gcm climate projections provide a general view on how the earth climate system may change in the future ipcc 2013 these projections have been widely applied in swat for long term hydro climatic extreme assessments incorporation of the new cmip6 gcm projections llnl 2019 into swat applications will likely increase significantly in the near future as climate change analysis is one of the major applications of swat modelling tan et al 2019a gassman et al 2014 card 2019 providing the cmip6 climate projections in a swat user friendly format would facilitate increased usage of swat a tool called climate model data for hydrologic modelling cmhyd is designed to extract and bias correct climate projection data rathjens et al 2016 and is freely available at the swat website https swat tamu edu software cmhyd the climate change toolkit cct has been developed for similar objectives ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 and is comprised of five modules 1 data download 2 data extraction 3 global climate data management 4 bias correction using statistical downscaling 5 spatial interpolation of climate data and 6 critical consecutive day analyser ccda however these toolkits mainly focused on the manipulation of cmip5 gcms hence future research needs to be concentrated on the extraction and bias correction of data from cmip6 gcms moreover studies on the regional climate downscaling of cmip6 gcms projections within swat are necessary to provide more accurate details for representing localised extreme conditions climate projections are commonly known as one of the major uncertainties in any hydro climatic modelling focused on future conditions tan et al 2014 kundzewicz et al 2018 these uncertainties include the selection of future socio economic scenarios potential greenhouse gases and aerosol emissions gcms climate sensitivity regional climate models rcms downscaling and bias correction approaches climate projection uncertainty reduction or minimization is among the most urgent future research needs kundzewicz et al 2018 but obviously depends on the future decisions on the degree of anthropogenic mitigation and adaptation therefore a range of potential scenarios is required to fully capture the possible future changes however the problem of mismatch of scales between global scale climate models and basin scale hydrological models needs to studied and solved with the advent of greater computing power higher resolution modelling studies are becoming available and will reduce this problem but the computational intensity tends to mean that there are fewer ensemble members of climate scenarios haarsma et al 2016 additionally the use of rcms can overcome mismatch problems but the usefulness of rcms is generally limited to large scale basins for small basins only a limited subset of the rcms grid points will overlay the entire basin which will not accurately represent the climate system for the entire basin thus basin scale climate models could be among future climate change modeling development trends rapid development of knowledge computer and internet technologies could result in basin scale climate models becoming easily available in the future also users are expecting large amounts of data to be freely available and immediately and easily accessible brodaric and piasecki 2016 availability of bias corrected multiple rcms or basin scale climate data in swat format that can be freely downloaded from the swat website would undoubtedly boost swat hydro climatic extremes applications in the near future 4 5 swat comparison with other models selection of the most accurate hydrological model could reduce the uncertainty for hydro climatic extreme simulations however the uncertainty of different hydrological models in regards to estimating extreme streamflows is still poorly understood singh et al 2005 compared the performance of swat with the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model in the iroquois river watershed in illinois and indiana they found that swat performed slightly better than hspf particularly in low flows simulation on the other hand chen et al 2019b concluded that both swat and hspf were unable to reproduce the extreme flows i e annual maximum discharge and annual 7 day minimum discharge accurately in the xitiaoxi river basin that is located in eastern china moreover swat and hspf resulted in different extreme trend directions showing that a careful consideration is needed when choosing hydrological models misuse of hydrological models when simulating extreme streamflows might lead to erroneous decision making therefore comparisons of swat with other hydrological models for extreme flow simulations including between swat2012 and swat should be conducted to identify the best model for further analysis for a respective application the application of artificial intelligence sometime also known as machine learning or deep learning is increasing in many research fields to date a small set of studies have been conducted to compare swat versus artificial intelligence ai models which include comparisons for general flow singh 2016 and sediment yield singh et al 2012 outputs for extreme flow comparisons jimeno sáez et al 2018 compared the capability of the artificial neural network ann and swat models in spain they found that the ann model performed better for high flow simulations whereas swat was superior at simulating low flows a similar finding was reported by kim et al 2015 for the taehwa river watershed in the southern south korea where high flows were simulated more accurately by both an ann ai model and a self organizing map som ai model while swat was better at capturing low flows however such comparisons are still relatively limited in the literature and therefore require more investigation integration of ai within swat modelling is a research direction that merits further exploration towards the goals of improving high flow simulations 5 summary swat is now one of the top hydrological models that has been applied widely in ecological hydrological and environmental studies application of swat in hydro climatic extreme studies has increased rapidly in the past few years particularly since 2017 as evidenced by the factor of three increases in the number of publications compared to previous years nearly half of the reviewed studies were conducted in the united states and china 52 of the studies were conducted for river basins that drain more than 10 000 km2 showing the need to understand the effects of potential extreme changes on the hydrology of medium to large scale basins similar to other applications calibration and validation of swat for extreme applications were conducted mainly using the time continuous approach by daily or monthly streamflow data only a few studies further validated the model for specific flood events peak flow low flow flow duration curves and different precipitation intensity comparisons hydrological drought indices such as ssi ssmi pdsi and 7q10 are among the popular indices used in swat based drought studies swat was used to study how land use changes such as water retention sites hydropower development and wetlands could reduce flood risk besides that swat was also coupled with flood economic and habitat suitability models to further study the impacts of extreme events improvement of swat for hydro climatic extremes studies will require development of new drought or flood indices calibration method improvement uncertainty analysis and swat modifications the lack of an extreme based calibration and validation assessment is among the main problems revealed in this study a new unified swat based extreme assessment framework that combines both traditional extreme flows and indices calculation should be developed for more reliable analysis and comparison as described by bieger et al 2017 several of these limitations have been considered in the development of swat resulting in an improved flood plain module and streamflow aquifer interaction however testing of swat has so far been limited to basins in the united states bieger et al 2017 bieger et al 2019 wu et al 2020 further research is necessary to compare the newly released swat to previous swat versions for extreme flow simulations in multiple basins in various regions that are characterized by different topographic geographical and climatic conditions another key problem is that swat often does not accurately match peak and low flows so future research needs to focus on improving the replication of these extreme flows besides that development of an extreme flow module within an overall swat modelling system is another area of future need this would help address the need for reliable impact assessments in relatively short time frames that are required by policy makers also a swat extreme module could help support more consistent and improved comparisons between studies which is important for understanding current trends as stated in ipcc reports ipcc 2013 ipcc 2012 some common extreme indices such as ssi and 7q10 and a standardised extreme classification should also be incorporated in the swat output availability of observations as inputs for swat modelling remains a big challenge in many regions tan et al 2019a bressiani et al 2015 van griensven et al 2012 application of global and satellite precipitation data is becoming a new trend in swat modelling therefore development of a swat based input data selection framework is essential to choose the most reliable data for extreme simulations moreover integration of global data satellite products and ground based observation is an additional future need another future research direction is incorporation of cmip6 gcms in swat hydro climatic extreme studies this would involve extraction downscaling and bias correction improvement and availability on the swat website credit authorship contribution statement mou leong tan conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

428,hydro climatic extremes such as droughts and floods have most likely increased due to climatic change and could lead to severe impacts on socio economic structural and environmental sectors with nearly 4000 publications the soil and water assessment tool swat is clearly one of the most extensively used ecohydrological models worldwide the model has been widely used for projecting the impacts of future hydro climatic changes but application for extreme streamflow conditions is still rarely reported to date swat application reviews have focused on compilations of swat studies for specific or relatively new applications such as eco hydrological modelling ecosystem services sub daily simulations and pesticide fate and transport simulations however no existing swat review studies have focused on simulation of hydro climatic extremes therefore this research aims to bridge this gap by compiling and reviewing the findings of studies reporting swat hydro climatic extremes including highlighting the performance and future research needs a total of 111 articles have been identified since 1999 most of these studies were conducted in the united states and china these articles can be divided into extreme flow assessments drought studies flood studies drought and flood studies swat coupling with other models and swat improvements most of the extreme performance assessment studies reported satisfactory performance with a particular emphasis on peak flow comparisons future research needs regarding this topic include 1 a unified swat extreme performance assessment framework 2 swat improvements that result in improved replication of peak and low flows 3 reliability assessment of global and satellite products for swat extreme simulations 4 bias correction of cmip6 and regional climate projections 5 comparison of swat and swat for extreme flow simulations in different types of basins 6 development of an extreme flow module within an overall swat modelling system and 7 integration of artificial intelligence within swat modelling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords swat flood drought extreme peak flow climate change 1 introduction hydro climatic extremes such as droughts and floods have most likely increased due to climate change and could lead to severe impacts on socio economic sectors giorgi et al 2018 raikes et al 2019 concern about hydro climatic extremes and their consequences has been rising in recent years as evidenced by the large effort of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in summarising climate extreme impacts on droughts sub chapter 3 1 and floods sub chapter 3 2 in the special report on extremes srex ipcc 2012 the report stated that some regions have experienced increasing length and intensity of flood and or drought events by referring to the definition of climate extreme in the srex the present study defines hydro climatic extreme as the occurrence of a hydro climatic variable s value higher or lower than a defined extremely high or low threshold value quantification of hydro climatic extremes benefits local authorities and researchers in understanding the current status and potential risks of water related disasters it is advantageous to use long term observation data to measure the trends of hydro climatic extremes for a specific region because it is the most reliable source for understanding the hydro climatic system fu et al 2010 however in many regions the availability of reliable long term observations remains a strong limitation mishra and singh 2011 richts and vrba 2016 ummenhofer and meehl 2017 moreover reliable long term hydrological data are normally even less available as compared to climate data therefore provided the models are accurate ecohydrological modelling could be used to simulate and understand the hydro climatic extremes and associated environmental impacts in regions without reliable hydrological observations ecohydrological modelling is an indispensable tool in understandig the interaction of hydrological processes and environmental issues major advantages of ecohydrological modelling include applicability for a wide range of basin scales and environment conditions and their capability to perform cost effectiveness assessments and simulate what if scenarios for planning purposes simulated streamflow could be used to further calculate hydrological and pollutant extremes at locations without a streamflow gauge moreover ecohydrological models can be used to understand the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in hydro climatic events an extensive array of hydrological and ecohydrological models have been developed many of which are described in previous review studies shepherd et al 1999 singh and woolhiser 2002 borah and bera 2004 daniel 2011 fu et al 2019 the soil and water assessment tool swat ecohydrological model arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012a williams et al 2008 bieger et al 2017 is one of the most widely used models worldwide and has been applied for an extensive suite of water resource issues across a broad range of basin scales and environmental conditions as evidenced by approximately 4000 documented publications card 2019 to date several swat review studies have been reported in the literature which can be divided into four main categories 1 general review 2 special issue review 3 specific region review and 4 specific application review general reviews include broad overviews of swat applications performance and future research needs gassman et al 2007 as well as descriptions of specific versions of swat bieger et al 2017 arnold et al 1998 special issue reviews provide a summary of the topics and findings of multiple swat studies that were published in a special issue of a specific journal e g krysanova and white 2015 gassman et al 2014 douglas mankin et al 2010 gassman and wang 2015 and tuppad et al 2011 as swat is increasingly applied across the globe compilations of swat study findings could be useful for swat developers or new users to identify its major applications capabilities challenges and limitations in a specific region to date regional based swat reviews have been conducted for the upper nile river basin region van griensven et al 2012 brazil bressiani et al 2015 and southeast asia tan et al 2019a lastly a specific application review refers to a compilation of swat results and issues for studies focused on specific or relatively new applications such as eco hydrological modelling krysanova and arnold 2008 ecosystem services francesconi et al 2016 pesticide fate and transport wang et al 2019 and sub daily applications brighenti et al 2019 one of the earliest swat hydro climatic extreme studies was conducted by van liew et al 2003 to understand how flood retention structures would affect streamflow characteristics during dry average and wet climate conditions narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and hwang et al 2006 used swat simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration to measure drought indices for studying drought patterns similar studies have been increasingly conducted in different regions of the world with more specific focus on extreme hydrological conditions including coupling models and developing extreme indices as part of the analyses however a review of studies that report application of swat for the assessment of hydro climatic extremes has not been previously reported therefore this study was conducted to fill this research gap the overall aim of this study is to summarize the findings of existing studies of swat for the assessment of hydro climatic extremes for answering common questions that might arise before during and after the swat simulation as shown in fig 1 the scope of this review is limited to hydrologic assessment only due to the need to provide an in depth analysis of swat s ability to replicate extreme hydrological events however the insights gained from this research are foundational for any swat application and have important implications regarding use of the model for testing or scenarios that include simulation of pollutant transport 2 swat model description selected articles and statistical evaluation 2 1 swat current versions of swat feature a legacy of nearly continuous model development over multiple decades as described in several previous studies arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012a gassman et al 2007 williams et al 2008 bieger et al 2017 swat is comprised of several different components including climatic inputs crop growth and yield hydrological cycling representation of management practices erosion processes and resulting sediment transport and pollutant nutrient pesticide and pathogen cycling and transport the model is usually executed using a daily time step although options are also provided to apply it using a sub daily time step arnold et al 2012b partitioning of precipitation at the soil surface between runoff and infiltration for daily time step simulations is performed using one of three variants of the u s department of agriculture usda natural resources conservation service nrcs runoff curve number rcn method arnold et al 2012b usda nrcs 2004a usda nrcs 2004b williams et al 2012 the green and ampt mein larson gaml excess rainfall method mein and larson 1973 an adaption of the original green and ampt infiltration method green and ampt 1911 is used to partition precipitation between surface runoff and infiltration for sub daily time step applications jeong et al 2010 arnold et al 2012b brighenti et al 2019 basins simulated in swat are first delineated into sub basins which are then sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus which represent landscapes consisting of homogeneous soil topographic land use and management characteristics these hrus represent percentage land areas within a sub basin and are not spatially recognized by swat version 2012 gassman and wang 2015 enhanced spatial representation of cropland landscapes and other features are possible in newer swat codes although hrus are primarily configured within larger landscape units as described by bieger et al 2017 which represent the latest version of swat that was released in 2019 swat 2019c landscape level hydrology flows and pollutant losses are estimated at the hru level which are then summed to the corresponding sub basins outlet and routed via the stream network to the overall basin outlet further details regarding the required inputs for swat and the range of available outputs are provided in arnold et al 2012b 2 2 article selection process the swat literature database card 2019 and web of science wos database were used to identify swat hydro climatic extremes related research articles four main criteria were used for the selection of articles first the article title should contain the keywords extreme flood drought peak flow high flow and or low flow this criterion was adopted to ensure that the selected studies specifically focused on the topic second only articles that were published from 1998 on were considered because that was the year that the first major description of swat was published arnold et al 1998 and also marked the beginning of when the extensive swat literature began to expand card 2019 third peer reviewed articles that were included in wos core collection cc indexed journals analytics 2019 were the primary source of information considered in this study grey literature such as government reports technical reports conference papers and non english articles were thus excluded from this review finally the selection of articles was also based on the authors judgement who have considerable knowledge of the existing swat related literature for example some articles were included even though their keywords did not match the searching criteria searching priority was given to the 3821 articles contained in the swat literature database as of july 15 2019 because the articles have been filtered and grouped according to specific categories card 2019 then the article selection was based on the four criteria that were mentioned earlier including the wos cc which contains additional up to date articles that have not been entered in the swat literature database yet a total of 147 articles were initially identified in the wos cc again on july 15 2019 based on one or more of the previous keywords within the article title in combination with the additional term swat as a topic in the wos unrelated studies were then excluded from the review e g flood modelling for the swat river pakistan in total 111 articles related to swat hydro climatic extreme simulations were ultimately identified table 1 based on the two searches the selected articles were further analysed in terms of region publication year and basin size fig 2 most of the swat hydro climatic studies were conducted in the united states 34 51 and china 13 27 as shown in fig 2c the reason for the high rate of application in the united states is that the swat model was originally developed using united states environmental land and soil conditions arnold et al 1998 moreover a series of swat workshops and hands on training organized by texas a m agrilife has been a further catalyst for increased studies in the united states similar studies have also been conducted in transboundary basins 10 62 such as the brahmaputra river basin mohammed et al 2017b and mekong river basin arias et al 2014 showing that understanding of extreme changes is very important for transnational basin management publication of swat studies has increased dramatically since 2009 tan et al 2019a card 2019 but swat assessment of hydro climatic extremes has only started to increase rapidly from 2017 fig 2a indicates that the number of articles published in 2017 was three times greater than those published in 2016 a possible explanation for this might be the increase of flood and drought disasters around the world in the past few years chou et al 2013 naveendrakumar et al 2019 increasing awareness of climate change and its impact on regional hydrological processes has resulted in the urgent formulation of hydro climatic related policies based on the possible effects of future extreme events swat has been utilized for future assessment of hydro climatic extremes in dozens of studies card 2019 because it can simulate what if scenarios easily another reason for the recent increase in swat applications for extremes applications could be the availability of hydro climatic related international grants for example an international research grant on understanding the impacts of hydro meteorological hazards in southeast asia was funded by the newton fund the uk s natural environment research council nerc the economic and social research council esrc and local governments such funding could result in increased numbers of swat hydro climatic studies in southeast asia netwon nerc 2019 fig 2b indicates the studies that report application of swat for the assessment of hydro climatic extremes were mainly conducted in basins of 10 001 100 000 km2 34 19 in size followed by 100 000 km2 17 95 101 1000 km2 16 24 and 1001 5000 km2 15 38 by contrast only 5 13 of the studies were conducted in basins that were smaller than 100 km2 fig 2b these trends underscore that swat hydro climatic extreme studies were mainly applied in basins of medium to large scales the biggest study area was the zambezi river basin with a drainage area of 1 400 000 km2 which drains parts of angola botswana malawi mozambique namibia tanzania zambia and zimbabwe the result shows that more studies should be conducted in smaller scale basins in the future 2 3 evaluation of the accuracy of swat output explicit standards have not been established for evaluating the accuracy of hydrological and eco hydrological models although various protocols have been proposed for judging simulated hydrological and or pollutant outputs engel et al 2007 arnold et al 2012a nair 2011 harmel et al 2018 typically both graphical and statistical measures are used to judge model accuracy arnold et al 2012a coffey et al 2004 describe over a dozen different statistical measures that can be used to evaluate hydrological model output including the root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse krause et al 2005 provide further insights regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the r2 and nse statistics other statistical measures have been introduced more recently such as the kling gupta efficiency kge which is described by guse et al 2017 to date the r2 and nse statistics remain the dominant measures that have been used to assess the accuracy of swat model output gassman et al 2007 gassman et al 2014 tuppad et al 2011 bressiani et al 2015 tan et al 2019a criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 are frequently used to interpret whether calculated nse and r2 values reflect satisfactory model results and are used in this study to discuss the accuracy of reported model outcomes the distribution of r2 and nse statistics that were reported among the 111 articles reviewed for this study is shown in fig 4 these statistics are based on comparisons of swat simulated streamflow values versus corresponding measured values for monthly aggregated over daily values daily and sub daily time periods nearly 90 of the nse statistics and over 90 of the r2 statistics exceed 0 5 and 0 6 respectively which are the thresholds suggested by moriasi et al 2007 and or moriasi et al 2015 for satisfactory simulation results many of the computed statistics would further satisfy criteria of good and very good streamflow simulation results as proposed by moriasi et al 2007 the relative distribution of the monthly and daily statistics shown in fig 4 is consistent with previous similar distributions reported by tuppad et al 2011 gassman et al 2014 and tan et al 2019a the distribution of sub daily statistics fig 4 is similar to the graphical summaries of nse statistics reported by brighenti et al 2019 as part of their review of studies that focused on swat sub daily time step applications 3 application the 111 articles were further divided into six major swat categories based on their primary focus 1 swat performance regarding replication of extreme flows 2 swat drought related studies 3 swat flood related studies 4 swat studies that incorporate both drought and flood analyses 5 swat coupling with other models and 6 swat model applications featuring modifications enhanced pre or post processing capabilities and or some other improvement table 1 the rationale of these categories is to better describe the major findings that are reported in each article some articles might fall under two or three categories but the first priority was given to the swat performance regarding replication of extreme flows category this is because the reliability of swat to replicate extreme flows is among the major concerns of swat users before applying the model for hydro climatic extremes studies also the majority of existing studies did not evaluate the ability of swat to replicate extreme flows 3 1 swat performance regarding simulation of extreme flows this section addresses questions related to swat s reliability regarding replication of extreme events such as 1 how to calibrate and validate swat for simulating extreme events and 2 how accurately does swat replicate extreme events fig 1 swat is a continuous time model and thus hydrologic calibration and validation are mainly based on continuous observed streamflow data performance of swat for continuous simulations has been well proven in many regions and documented in fig 4 and in previous swat reviews tan et al 2019a bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2014 tuppad et al 2011 besides that a comprehensive review covering swat sub daily scale simulations has recently been conducted by brighenti et al 2019 therefore this review only focuses on swat performance assessments that report further validation in terms of specific flood events event based peak flow low flow different precipitation intensities and or flow duration curve simulations which were analysed beyond typical continuous time assessment most of the studies only considered one of the criteria specific flood event peak flow low flow different precipitation intensities or flow duration curve for their respective swat extreme assessment for example bacopoulos et al 2017 calibrated and validated swat using an hourly time step for specific flood events for the st johns river in the united states they concluded that swat could reasonably capture flood events based on nse values of 0 85 and 0 45 computed for the simulated calibration and validation periods respectively campbell et al 2018 calibrated and validated swat for pawtuxet river basin in the united states using a daily time step for respective one year periods in 2010 and 2013 that resulted in nse values ranging from 0 62 to 0 69 they then assessed the effects of urbanization on flood events with swat using a sub daily simulation time step of 5 min pfannerstill et al 2014 is among the limited studies that evaluated the ability of swat to reproduce both extreme high and low flows they developed a multi metric performance framework by dividing a flow duration curve into five different segments very low low medium high and very high flows they concluded that the use of this performance framework could result in improved calibration of swat which in turn could lead to better prediction of extreme flows boithias et al 2017 and yu et al 2018a merged both continuous time and event based assessments in their respective studies the latter authors developed a swat event model that refined the lumped unit hydrograph from the original swat into a set of distributed units to represent spatial variability of a basin the model was able to accurately reproduce 24 flood events that occurred in the wangjiaba river china as evidenced by nse values as high as 0 95 li et al 2018a incorporated a flow duration curve assessment as part of their overall evaluation approach that included the continuous time and event based approaches mentioned earlier meanwhile yaduvanshi et al 2018 introduced precipitation intensity assessment to better understand the performance of swat under low moderate or extreme precipitation events both studies reported that swat performed well in the context of flood simulations a combination of continuous time and peak flows comparison assessment is among the typical approaches used to evaluate peak flows dakhlalla and parajuli 2016 javaheri and babbar sebens 2014 spellman et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 javaheri and babbar sebens 2014 estimated simulated sub daily peak flows for the eagle creek basin located in central indiana in the united states based on an relationship between the continuous time daily flows and the sub daily flows they found the errors of the predicted swat based peak flows varied only from 1 to 18 relative to the corresponding observed peak flows due to the development of satellite technologies kumar and lakshmi 2018 and tan et al 2018 studied the performance of satellite precipitation products in relation to swat estimates of extreme events for the gandak river basin india china and nepal and the kelantan river basin malaysia respectively kumar and lakshmi 2018 evaluated the performance of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 product using a continuous time simulation coupled with varying precipitation intensities light moderate heavy and extremely heavy precipitation they found that the trmm based swat model performed better for the moderate and heavy precipitation periods versus the light and extremely heavy precipitation periods in contrast tan et al 2018 used a combined continuous time and event based assessment to test the reliability of driving swat with three global precipitation mission gpm products hou et al 2014 a satisfactory performance was reported for swat in replicating the big yellow flood event using the gpm products 3 2 swat studies on drought understanding of historical and future droughts in terms of intensity duration severity and spatial extent is very important for freshwater management and planning mishra and singh 2011 for example priority irrigation systems could be built for sub basins with high drought risk to reduce agricultural losses drought can be mainly divided into meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2011 swat is commonly used to evaluate the impacts of meteorological and hydrological droughts in general swat based drought studies can be divided into two main groups 1 index based which are based on calculation and analysis of drought indices from swat outputs and 2 non index based which involve analysis of swat simulated streamflow in specific low flow periods in general future climate projections are incorporated into a calibrated swat model to assess the effects of predicted future drought processes the projected future swat outputs are then compared with historical values using various drought indices the comparison could be done by considering the potential drought risks such as intensity occurrences severity and duration in the future a drought index is a simplified variable representation of drought severity that uses hydro climatic inputs such as precipitation temperature and streamflow information about commonly used drought indices including their strengths and weaknesses is available in a drought indices handbook published by the world meteorological organization wmo and global water partnership gwp 2016 standardized precipitation index spi standardized streamflow index ssi standardized soil moisture index ssmi and palmer drought severity index pdsi are popular indices that are frequently used in swat drought studies tan et al 2019b vu et al 2015 and zhao et al 2019 incorporated climate projections into the swat model to calculate future spi and ssi for river basins in malaysia vietnam and china respectively meanwhile the ssmi was considered and measured by narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 kamali et al 2017 and li et al 2017 using swat simulated soil moisture data kang and sridhar 2017b and zou et al 2017 modified the pdsi to study drought impact in the united states and china respectively using streamflow soil moisture and evapotranspiration data within swat most of the studies reported that more severe drought conditions might occur in the future some swat drought studies concentrated on analysing potential future low flows rahman et al 2010 evaluated the climate change impact on low flows of the ruscom river basin located in southern ontario in the eastern part of canada they found a potential reduction of up to 50 in the annual minimum monthly flow of a five year return period they also reported that the low flows might decrease in the summer and fall but increase in the spring the lowest 7 day low flow of each year with a 10 year return period 7q10 flow was also considered in swat analyses conducted in south korea ryu et al 2011 and the united states shrestha et al 2017 shrestha et al 2019 ryu et al 2011 found a significant reduction of the 7q10 flow from 1 54 m3s 1 to 0 03 m3s 1 under the most severe scenario on the geum river basin in south korea on the other hand a flow duration curve fdc calculated from swat outputs has also been applied in drought analysis brown et al 2015 hoyos et al 2019 rahman et al 2010 the 75 q75 and 95 q95 percentiles are normally considered as the threshold for extreme low flow and low flow respectively shrestha et al 2017 li et al 2018b applied the 80 q80 percentile to precipitation station streamflow swat and soil moisture swat for comparison of meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts over the luanhe river basin china the modelling results showed that the number of hydrological and agricultural droughts were less than meteorological droughts but the durations was longer 3 3 swat flood studies in recent decades floods have become more frequent and intense around the world quantification of future flood risk is vital to reduce damage to infrastructure and human lives cloke and pappenberger 2009 although swat is not designed for flood modelling there still have been reported swat flood studies overall swat was used to understand the impact of land use and or climate changes on floods at the basin scale besides that the effectiveness of flood mitigation or retention strategies can also be simulated easily with swat to date it has been calibrated and validated at the daily scale in most of the swat flood related studies maghsood et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 mohammed et al 2017a versus monthly scale testing that is normally reported in swat drought studies tan et al 2019b bayissa et al 2018 further subdivision of the swat based flood studies table 1 results in three main categories based on the type of analyses land use change climate change and land use and climate change assessment of the impact of land use management on flood risk using the swat model has been conducted in china zhang et al 2016 spain jodar abellan et al 2019 south korea lee et al 2017 and the united states mitchell et al 2018 schilling et al 2014 van liew et al 2003 besides that angelidis et al 2010 compared the flood hydrographs that were simulated by the evrofloods model they developed versus swat for the evros maritza river basin that drains portions of bulgaria greece and turkey they found an approximately 5 8 difference between the historical and future peak flows mitchell et al 2018 proved that water retention sites wrs could effectively reduce the high flows of a minnesota river sub basin using the swat model schilling et al 2014 found a conversion of 50 to 100 of the cropland to perennial vegetation could dramatically reduce the flood risk in the raccoon river basin in west central iowa swat based climate change impact assessments are conducted by comparing the impacts of historical climate patterns with projected future climate inputs within a calibrated swat model the future climate input is usually extracted from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip 3 meehl et al 2007 and cmip5 taylor et al 2012 general circulation models gcms maghsood et al 2019 iqbal et al 2018 kharel and kirilenko 2018 or based on potential synthetic precipitation and temperature changes gao et al 2018 kehew et al 2010 kharel and kirilenko 2018 found the overspill risk ranged from 7 3 to 47 1 for devils lake in north dakota u s in response to cmip3 and cmip5 climate projections maghsood et al 2019 evaluated the flood impact using the flood frequency index ffi and sub basin flood source area index sfsai as measured from swat outputs in the talar river basin in northern iran their findings showed that high potential flood risk is found in sub basins mainly located in the eastern part of the basin iqbal et al 2018 used hec ssp a statistical software packages developed by us army corps of engineers to conduct flood frequency analysis as a function of swat simulated streamflow for the kabul river basin that drains parts of afghanistan and pakistan they found that a 50 year return period flood is likely to occur more frequently in the future assessing combined land use change and climate change impacts could provide a more robust flood risk assessment huang et al 2018 igarashi et al 2019 incorporated synthetic climate projections and future projected land use changes from the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model verburg et al 2002 into swat to study high flows in the song khwae district thailand the modelling showed that the high flows are projected to decline in the future even with an increase of cropland up to 50 within the basin cheng et al 2017 proposed the need for flood retention sites to reduce potential future flooding based on swat simulations driven by low and moderate emission scenarios climate projections in charles river basin which drains portions of the boston metropolitan area in eastern massachusetts u s similarly walters and babbar sebens 2016 applied climate projections from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2009 in swat to study the effectiveness of wetlands in mitigating high flows in the eagle creek basin u s they concluded that the wetlands could reduce the intensity of peak flows by 15 to 20 3 4 swat studies on drought and flood consideration of both low and peak flows could provide an overview of hydro climatic extreme changes and help to identify which natural hazard will have more impact in the future local authorities can thereafter allocate more funding and expertise to mitigate the specific hazard interestingly the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex giorgi et al 2009 has proven to be one of the most popular climate projections applied for this topic the cordex south asia domain database with a spatial resolution of 0 5o 50 km was incorporated into swat to study low and peak flows for the brahmaputra river system in south asia mohammed et al 2017b mohammed et al 2017a the modelling results showed that floods are projected to become more frequent and intense compared to droughts in the future tirupathi et al 2018 also incorporated the cordex south asia domains within swat to investigate the impacts of future climate projections on monsoonal rainfall patterns and excessive precipitation events similarly the cordex africa domain was used by näschen et al 2018 to assess the effects of future climate on wetland resources for the kilombero river basin in tanzania several innovative computer tools have been developed to transfer swat and other hydrologic output into useful hydrological extremes information the water engineering time series processing tool wetspro was used by leta and bauwens 2018 and leta et al 2018 to extract daily extreme low and peak flows from the swat simulated daily streamflow in belgium and hawaii respectively the tool is capable of selecting low and peak flows using the independent peak over threshold pot method by contrast chen et al 2019a measured hydrological extremes using the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha tool richter et al 1996 the iha provides 67 statistical parameters related to river ecosystems including several parameters related to hydrological extremes i e annual 1 3 7 30 90 day max or min flows frequency and duration flood or extreme low flows that can be selected by users these parameters could be measured using swat simulated historical and future streamflow projections followed by a comparison between the two periods with statistical analysis stewart et al 2015 compared historical monthly low and peak flows from 1961 to 1990 with a future period 2071 2099 using swat to understand their impact on the sierra nevada and upper colorado river basin ucrb eco hydrological system in the u s their findings showed a significant increase in the number of high flows in the winter and spring seasons particularly in the ucrb by contrast the extreme low flows of both basins are projected to increase in spring and summer this information is important to ecological scientists studying fish habitat and potential fish movement in the future 3 5 swat model coupling with other models in some cases a modeller might want to know the impact of hydro climatic extremes on swat outputs that are not based on flow characteristics e g flood extent aquatic life agricultural yield economic losses and hydro electricity capacity coupling of swat with other models helps to expand the assessment to other parameters in general hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras usace 2016 mike flood dhi 2017 and sobek deltares 2019 are some of the most widely used flood models to study potential future flood patterns via couplings with swat arunyanart et al 2017 song et al 2014 kuntiyawichai et al 2011 for example robi et al 2019 coupled swat with mike flood to identify the flood inundation extent and flooding depth under cmip5 climate projections for the ribb river basin which is located in northwest ethiopia they found that the future flood extent area could cover up to 61 01 km2 similarly chinnasamy et al 2018 coupled swat mod flow waterloo 2011 and hec ras to test the potential of the underground of taming of floods for irrigation utfi system in reducing groundwater depletion and flood extent in the ramganga river basin in india the simulation results showed that the implementation of utfi can reduce the flood inundation areas by 10 and increase the groundwater level by 7 m an insurance fund simulator called hydrologic risk transfer model mtrh shs righetto and mendiondo 2007 has been developed by coupling swat with various vulnerability and financial modules to explore drought and flood risks from an economic perspective mohor and mendiondo 2017 a case study of the piracicaba river basin in southeast brazil showed that premiums up to 1 of the local gross domestic product gdp are required when water demand increases to 20 gies et al 2014 evaluated the impacts of three different drought adaptation policies in for juba river in east africa using swat and a system dynamics model they concluded a combination of hydraulic infrastructure and new agricultural practices are the most effective policy to reduce drought impact based on guidance provided by the coupled modelling system in southeast asia arias et al 2014 coupled swat the integrated quantity and quality model iqqm simons et al 1996 the hydrologic engineering center s reservoir system simulation hec ressim usace 2013 and the two dimensional environmental impact assessment model 2d eia to quantify how hydropower development could change the hydrological regime in the sesan srepok and sekong 3s river system they found that full damming will cause significant hydrological alternations and that the local authorities should practice sustainable hydropower practices in the future 3 6 swat improvement efforts to improve swat to support more accurate hydro climatic extreme simulations have focused on development of a new drought or flood index calibration method improvement uncertainty analysis and or swat modification a specific crop based drought index calculated from precipitation temperature soil moisture depletion transpiration and biomass production with the latter three variables simulated by swat was developed to quantify agricultural drought in the united states mcdaniel et al 2017a mcdaniel et al 2017b mcdaniel et al 2017c esfahanian et al 2017 developed a new drought index called meteorological agricultural stream health and hydrological mash that merges 13 drought indices these newly developed indices could effectively identify the risk of flood or drought reliable model calibration is essential for providing a strong foundation to support scientific analysis and decision making chilkoti et al 2018 proposed a multi objective auto calibration method for improving swat low flow simulations the results showed that the volume efficiency and time series of low flow simulations in the saugeen river canada were improved by 135 and 65 respectively trudel et al 2017 evaluated low flow uncertainties based on the swat structure and approach that was simulated for the yamaska river basin in canada they found that the calibration objective function is one of the main uncertainty sources for swat low flow simulations another swat extreme flow uncertainty study was conducted by zhang et al 2014 in the qiantang river basin china the authors considered three major uncertainties that normally arise in swat for the assessment of hydro climatic extremes namely climate emission scenarios a1b a2 and b2 extreme values model generalized pareto distribution generalized extreme value distribution and pearson type 3 distribution and swat parameters sequential uncertainty method in their extreme uncertainty analysis interestingly the swat model parameters showed a larger uncertainty than the emission scenario and extreme value models for small return periods simulations meanwhile the uncertainties of the three sources for large return period simulations are likely to be similar duan et al 2018 modified the snow melting and flood process modules to improve peak flow simulation in swat by incorporating the accumulated temperature and maximum temperature elements in a snow melt processes module within swat they tested the modified swat for the tizinafu river basin in china and found a 43 improvement in the representation of the observed peak flows cohen liechti et al 2014 developed a swat reservoir model to better model flood plain behaviour in the zambezi basin in the southern african continent for instance they modified the outflow of the reservoir sub model of the swat2009 model by separating overflow from base flow the findings indicated that the modified swat model resulted in superior replication of low and high flows versus the original swat model other efforts have focused on modifying the rcn method or other hydrological functions in swat resulting in improved representation of peak flows and overall replication of measured streamflows and other hydrological indicators xie et al 2020 d white et al 2009 kim and lee 2008 4 future research directions 4 1 swat low and high flows assessment framework general procedures for building a swat model include 1 creating the model with a gis interface e g arcgis swat arcswat olivera et al 2006 swat 2019a or the qswat interface dile et al 2016 swat 2019b 2 parameter sensitivity analysis 3 calibration and uncertainty analyses 4 validation of the calibrated model and 5 performing an impact assessment typically observed streamflow data is divided into two time periods with one time period used for sensitivity analysis and calibration while the other one is used for validation this split time calibration and validation framework has been applied in the most of the swat hydro climatic extreme studies reviewed here general guidelines main issues and solutions for swat sensitivity analysis calibration and validation are available in many previous studies arnold et al 2012a abbaspour et al 2018 moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 here we only discuss the main issues and possible solutions for simulating extreme events fig 3 shows the percentage of the finest time scale streamflow observations that were used in the selected publications daily streamflow was used for calibration validation in nearly half of the studies versus monthly streamflow in the calibration process for about 25 of the studies only about 5 of the studies calibrated their model with streamflow data at a sub daily scale in general monthly scale calibration and validation was used to support drought studies this is because most of the drought index calculations only need monthly data e g standardized streamflow index ssi meanwhile swat based flood studies were mainly calibrated using daily data maghsood et al 2019 xu et al 2017 although some required hourly scale time steps to capture specific flood events widespread availability of hourly streamflow observations and hourly climate data to drive the model are still lacking particularly in developing and less developed countries however daily streamflow data are sufficient for most long term flood and drought analyses but a more comprehensive calibration and validation framework is needed for these type of applications generally studies that relied on a time continuous framework considered only a single objective function particularly the nse or r2 the squared error statistics used for the nse have been shown to be biased toward high flows chilkoti et al 2018 in addition strong r2 values can still occur even when systematic over or under prediction occurs krause et al 2005 beyond that validation of swat was only performed in a few studies as discussed in section 3 1 the current testing approaches that have been used for swat extreme assessments seem to be inconsistent for instance yaduvanshi et al 2018 and bacopoulos et al 2017 validated swat s capability to replicate specific flood events while spellman et al 2018 and dakhlalla and parajuli 2016 focused on the comparisons between simulated and measured peak flows a new unified swat based extreme assessment framework should be developed to produce more reliable outputs that could also facilitate better comparison among studies another future need is the incorporation of further calibration and validation for drought or flood index calculations for example if the study objectives are related to drought assessment using ssi then calibration and validation should be done by comparing the swat derived ssi values with corresponding observations hence the framework should consider both the general assessment and extreme flows 4 2 swat low and high flows improvement tan et al 2018 clearly showed that swat underestimated the volume of peak flow in the kelantan river basin during the big yellow flood event by 25 2 to 33 9 similarly bacopoulos et al 2017 found that swat poorly simulated the timing of peak flows in the lower st johns river basin in northeast florida piniewski et al 2017 reported swat underestimated low flows in small sub basins of the vistula and odra basins in poland these inaccurate representations of extreme flows along with similar results found in other studies zhang et al 2015 shrestha et al 2019 indicate that modification of swat s internal algorithms are essential to enable the model to more accurately and realistically simulate low and high flows the need for improving flood plain deposition algorithms within swat has been noted in previous research krysanova and arnold 2008 yu et al 2018a as noted in section 3 1 yu et al 2018a modified swat to more accurately simulate flood events using a sub daily time step similar modifications are needed to strengthen swat flood event predictions for daily time step simulations these issues have been considered during the development of swat bieger et al 2017 however swat has not yet been widely applied in different regions across the world future research is needed to compare the capability of swat versus previous swat versions regarding replicating low and peak flows for river basins representing different topographic geographical and climatic conditions another area of future research need is the development of an extreme flows module that would be directly linked with the swat model such a module would feature functions capable of providing extreme analyses that would be available in swat for users who want to study the impacts of extreme flows some common extreme indices such as flow duration curve 7q10 ssi 1 day maximum or minimum flow and 7 day maximum or minimum flows could be considered as components of an extreme flows module and should also be incorporated as part of the standard swat outputs hydrological extremes classification can unfortunately be unclear for example stewart et al 2015 defined extreme flows using a pre defined threshold method where high flows are the months with streamflow that are 100 125 and 150 greater than historical flows whereas low flows are 25 50 and 75 lower than historical flows by contrast tzoraki et al 2013 applied the pot method to classify floods into usual ecological and hazardous therefore future research is needed to identify a simple and well accepted extreme flows classification approach which can be plugged into a swat extreme flows module a standardized extreme flows classification method would facilitate comparison of flood or drought events in different regions 4 3 swat with gridded precipitation data availability of satellite climate data offers another source of input data to swat modelling particularly for regions with limited ground based climate observations modellers should test as many available climate and other input data to choose the best data for a swat application abbaspour et al 2018 reliable precipitation data is especially crucial as one of the main inputs to the swat model observed precipitation data is almost always regarded as the most reliable precipitation input but there are many limitations in reality such as missing values inhomogeneous measurements uneven station distribution and limited station coverage tan and santo 2018 for instance tan and yang 2020 reported that missing values of more than 20 in precipitation data would significantly impact on the tropical streamflow simulation especially in low flow simulations all of these issues might affect the simulation of peak and low flows to date there are more than 30 global precipitation datasets available that can serve as alternative precipitation data sources including gauge based reanalysis and satellite data sun et al 2018 these data sets are available for either long term hydro climatic extreme analysis at least 30 years or short term events up to 30 min temporal scale although the long term national centers for environmental ncep cfsr data are available at the swat website swat 2019a it seems to be less reliable in replicating rainfall for some regions and corresponding streamflow simulation by swat for example the ncep cfsr data did not perform well in swat applications for river basins in china yang et al 2014 brazil bressiani et al 2015 monteiro et al 2016 ethiopia roth and lemann 2016 and kenya and tanzania alemayehu et al 2017 in contrast tan et al 2017 found that the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water aphrodite dataset yatagai et al 2012 ncar 2019 performed better than the ncep cfsr for two river basins simulated in swat in malaysia yang et al 2014 also report that aphrodite precipitation data resulted in improved streamflow predictions relative to cfsr data for a swat application in central china therefore more effort is required to test the reliability of freely available precipitation products for swat extreme simulations moreover integration of global satellite and observed precipitation data might produce better precipitation inputs for swat modelling 4 4 swat climate projections the cmip3 cmip5 and cmip6 gcm climate projections provide a general view on how the earth climate system may change in the future ipcc 2013 these projections have been widely applied in swat for long term hydro climatic extreme assessments incorporation of the new cmip6 gcm projections llnl 2019 into swat applications will likely increase significantly in the near future as climate change analysis is one of the major applications of swat modelling tan et al 2019a gassman et al 2014 card 2019 providing the cmip6 climate projections in a swat user friendly format would facilitate increased usage of swat a tool called climate model data for hydrologic modelling cmhyd is designed to extract and bias correct climate projection data rathjens et al 2016 and is freely available at the swat website https swat tamu edu software cmhyd the climate change toolkit cct has been developed for similar objectives ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 and is comprised of five modules 1 data download 2 data extraction 3 global climate data management 4 bias correction using statistical downscaling 5 spatial interpolation of climate data and 6 critical consecutive day analyser ccda however these toolkits mainly focused on the manipulation of cmip5 gcms hence future research needs to be concentrated on the extraction and bias correction of data from cmip6 gcms moreover studies on the regional climate downscaling of cmip6 gcms projections within swat are necessary to provide more accurate details for representing localised extreme conditions climate projections are commonly known as one of the major uncertainties in any hydro climatic modelling focused on future conditions tan et al 2014 kundzewicz et al 2018 these uncertainties include the selection of future socio economic scenarios potential greenhouse gases and aerosol emissions gcms climate sensitivity regional climate models rcms downscaling and bias correction approaches climate projection uncertainty reduction or minimization is among the most urgent future research needs kundzewicz et al 2018 but obviously depends on the future decisions on the degree of anthropogenic mitigation and adaptation therefore a range of potential scenarios is required to fully capture the possible future changes however the problem of mismatch of scales between global scale climate models and basin scale hydrological models needs to studied and solved with the advent of greater computing power higher resolution modelling studies are becoming available and will reduce this problem but the computational intensity tends to mean that there are fewer ensemble members of climate scenarios haarsma et al 2016 additionally the use of rcms can overcome mismatch problems but the usefulness of rcms is generally limited to large scale basins for small basins only a limited subset of the rcms grid points will overlay the entire basin which will not accurately represent the climate system for the entire basin thus basin scale climate models could be among future climate change modeling development trends rapid development of knowledge computer and internet technologies could result in basin scale climate models becoming easily available in the future also users are expecting large amounts of data to be freely available and immediately and easily accessible brodaric and piasecki 2016 availability of bias corrected multiple rcms or basin scale climate data in swat format that can be freely downloaded from the swat website would undoubtedly boost swat hydro climatic extremes applications in the near future 4 5 swat comparison with other models selection of the most accurate hydrological model could reduce the uncertainty for hydro climatic extreme simulations however the uncertainty of different hydrological models in regards to estimating extreme streamflows is still poorly understood singh et al 2005 compared the performance of swat with the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model in the iroquois river watershed in illinois and indiana they found that swat performed slightly better than hspf particularly in low flows simulation on the other hand chen et al 2019b concluded that both swat and hspf were unable to reproduce the extreme flows i e annual maximum discharge and annual 7 day minimum discharge accurately in the xitiaoxi river basin that is located in eastern china moreover swat and hspf resulted in different extreme trend directions showing that a careful consideration is needed when choosing hydrological models misuse of hydrological models when simulating extreme streamflows might lead to erroneous decision making therefore comparisons of swat with other hydrological models for extreme flow simulations including between swat2012 and swat should be conducted to identify the best model for further analysis for a respective application the application of artificial intelligence sometime also known as machine learning or deep learning is increasing in many research fields to date a small set of studies have been conducted to compare swat versus artificial intelligence ai models which include comparisons for general flow singh 2016 and sediment yield singh et al 2012 outputs for extreme flow comparisons jimeno sáez et al 2018 compared the capability of the artificial neural network ann and swat models in spain they found that the ann model performed better for high flow simulations whereas swat was superior at simulating low flows a similar finding was reported by kim et al 2015 for the taehwa river watershed in the southern south korea where high flows were simulated more accurately by both an ann ai model and a self organizing map som ai model while swat was better at capturing low flows however such comparisons are still relatively limited in the literature and therefore require more investigation integration of ai within swat modelling is a research direction that merits further exploration towards the goals of improving high flow simulations 5 summary swat is now one of the top hydrological models that has been applied widely in ecological hydrological and environmental studies application of swat in hydro climatic extreme studies has increased rapidly in the past few years particularly since 2017 as evidenced by the factor of three increases in the number of publications compared to previous years nearly half of the reviewed studies were conducted in the united states and china 52 of the studies were conducted for river basins that drain more than 10 000 km2 showing the need to understand the effects of potential extreme changes on the hydrology of medium to large scale basins similar to other applications calibration and validation of swat for extreme applications were conducted mainly using the time continuous approach by daily or monthly streamflow data only a few studies further validated the model for specific flood events peak flow low flow flow duration curves and different precipitation intensity comparisons hydrological drought indices such as ssi ssmi pdsi and 7q10 are among the popular indices used in swat based drought studies swat was used to study how land use changes such as water retention sites hydropower development and wetlands could reduce flood risk besides that swat was also coupled with flood economic and habitat suitability models to further study the impacts of extreme events improvement of swat for hydro climatic extremes studies will require development of new drought or flood indices calibration method improvement uncertainty analysis and swat modifications the lack of an extreme based calibration and validation assessment is among the main problems revealed in this study a new unified swat based extreme assessment framework that combines both traditional extreme flows and indices calculation should be developed for more reliable analysis and comparison as described by bieger et al 2017 several of these limitations have been considered in the development of swat resulting in an improved flood plain module and streamflow aquifer interaction however testing of swat has so far been limited to basins in the united states bieger et al 2017 bieger et al 2019 wu et al 2020 further research is necessary to compare the newly released swat to previous swat versions for extreme flow simulations in multiple basins in various regions that are characterized by different topographic geographical and climatic conditions another key problem is that swat often does not accurately match peak and low flows so future research needs to focus on improving the replication of these extreme flows besides that development of an extreme flow module within an overall swat modelling system is another area of future need this would help address the need for reliable impact assessments in relatively short time frames that are required by policy makers also a swat extreme module could help support more consistent and improved comparisons between studies which is important for understanding current trends as stated in ipcc reports ipcc 2013 ipcc 2012 some common extreme indices such as ssi and 7q10 and a standardised extreme classification should also be incorporated in the swat output availability of observations as inputs for swat modelling remains a big challenge in many regions tan et al 2019a bressiani et al 2015 van griensven et al 2012 application of global and satellite precipitation data is becoming a new trend in swat modelling therefore development of a swat based input data selection framework is essential to choose the most reliable data for extreme simulations moreover integration of global data satellite products and ground based observation is an additional future need another future research direction is incorporation of cmip6 gcms in swat hydro climatic extreme studies this would involve extraction

429,turbulence generated by aquatic vegetation in lakes estuaries and rivers can significantly alter the flow structure throughout the entire water column affecting gas transfer mechanisms at the air water interface thus modifying indicators of water quality a series of laboratory experiments with rigid acrylic cylinder arrays to mimic vegetation was conducted in a recirculating odell kovasznay type race track flume particle image velocimetry was used to characterize mean and turbulent flow statistics to investigate the effect of emergent and submerged vegetation on gas transfer rate in terms of turbulent kinetic energy tke reynolds stresses and tke production surface gas transfer rates were determined by measuring dissolved oxygen concentration during re aeration using an optical sensor the results provided new insights on how stem and canopy scale turbulence affect the surface gas transfer rate at different submergence ratios and array densities the relation between mean flow velocity and tke production in each scenario is discussed and a modified surface renewal model using tke production as an indicator of gas transfer efficiency is developed to more accurately predict surface gas transfer rates in vegetated streams keywords vegetated flows turbulence production gas transfer surface renewal 1 introduction in natural water environments such as rivers lakes and estuaries aquatic vegetation can significantly alter the mean and turbulent flow structure nepf 2012a by changing water flow and generating turbulence the presence of vegetation can also affect processes at the air water interface and thus modify surface gas transfer mechanism poindexter and variano 2013 foster martinez and variano 2016 ho et al 2018 fig 1 which in turn affects practical management of water quality in aquatic environments for example installing aeration systems to enhance oxygen transfer to lakes and rivers with high biological oxygen demand bod is one of the common ways that environmental engineers apply to keep an aquatic system well aerated and prevent unpleasant algal blooms hence maintaining adequate water quality to support other forms of aquatic life global warming depends on the transfer of greenhouse gasses e g co2 ch4 at the air water surface the conceptual model presented by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc prentice et al 2001 considered only land and oceans as active boxes connected by rivers acting as passive pipes however studies on stream metabolism and gas exchange raymond et al 2013 hotchkiss et al 2015 have shown the active role of rivers in the exchange of carbon and oxygen through gas transfer at the air water interface raymond and cole 2001 further pointed out a general lack of studies physically based predictive models and direct measurement of gas transfer velocity in estuaries and rivers compared to the oceans a better understanding of the magnitude and causes of variation in gas transfer velocity in rivers and estuaries is needed for estimating global mass balance of gases more accurately it is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in global warming models and a hot area of environmental fluid mechanics research in order to address the needs and significances mentioned above this study focuses on examining gas transfer rates in streams where aquatic vegetation exists from submerged to fully emergent in recent decades there have been numerous models developed to study the gas transfer mechanism at the air water interface liao and wang 2013 diffusive boundary layer dbl theory is the basis of most of the models suggesting that the gas concentration gradient extends from the bulk concentration in water to the saturation concentration at the surface within a thin dbl in the dbl diffusive flux from air to water f follows fick s law 1 f d c w z z 0 where d is the molecular diffusivity of water cw is the local concentration of dissolved oxygen do in water and z 0 denotes the location at the air water interface then f can be expressed as a function of the bulk concentration of do cdo in the water body using a gas transfer rate kl 2 f k l c s a t c d o where csat is the saturation concentration of do in water the gas transfer rate serves as the fundamental parameter for measuring the transfer velocity at which oxygen is entrained in water assuming that there are no losses of do in water and f is the only source transporting do into the water column until do reaches saturation c d o c s a t f can thus be rewritten as a time derivative form of the bulk concentration in water the above equation can be further expressed as 3 f h c d o t k l c s a t c d o where h is the averaged water depth solving the above first order ordinary differential equation with assumption of c d o t 0 0 we obtain the solution of the bulk concentration of do in water 4 c d o c s a t 1 exp 1 h k l t the dbl can be determined by the turbulence strength near the air water interface danckwerts 1951 first proposed a surface renewal sr model to estimate the interface gas transfer rate based on dbl theory and higbie 1935 s penetration model the model assumes that turbulent eddies can stochastically break through the liquid surface carrying fresh parcels of fluid to the interface by molecular diffusion the gas transfer rate kl can be modeled by poisson arrival times 5 k l 1 t s 0 t s exp t t s d π t d t d t s where ts is the sr time scale which represents how long until the water parcel is replaced by a new fresh one given the difficulty to measure ts directly many studies have proposed different methods to estimate it fortescue and pearson 1967 came up with a large eddy surface renewal lesr model arguing that the large eddies dominate the process of sr events and the renewal time scale can be estimated by the bulk length scale l and the turbulence intensity expressed as the root mean square of the velocity fluctuations in the bulk fluid u rms 6 t s l u r m s the angular brackets represent a time average and u represents velocity fluctuations using a typical reynolds decomposition from the instantaneous velocity u and the time averaged mean flow velocity u as 7 u u u banerjee et al 1968 developed a small eddy surface renewal sesr model which suggests that the renewal time scale is related to the turbulence intensity of small scale eddies based on kolmogorov time scale 8 t s ν ϵ 1 2 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and ϵ is the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate later on theofanous et al 1976 integrated both lesr and sesr models and proposed a two regime surface renewal trsr model based on turbulent reynolds number defined as 9 r e t u r m s l ν they argued that for ret 500 large scale eddies are dominant while small scale eddies are more representative of turbulent conditions for ret 500 this yields a two regime prediction of the gas transfer rate 10 k l α s c 1 2 u r m s r e t 1 2 r e t 500 11 k l α s c 1 2 u r m s r e t 1 4 r e t 500 where sc is the schmidt number s c ν d and α is the experimentally determined coefficient that depends on the flow condition however the aforementioned models rely on estimating the sr time scale ts instead of measuring it directly there is a gap in the development of models that incorporate corrections for more complex conditions such as vegetated flows mccready et al 1986 presented a relation between the divergence of the free surface velocity and the gas transfer process through the air water interface banerjee 1990 proposed a surface divergence sd model that directly relates the surface divergence velocity to the surface gas transfer rate 12 k l c d β r m s where c is a coefficient that accounts for different flow conditions and β rms is the bulk root mean square of the divergence of surface fluctuations 13 β r m s u x v y the expression of eq 12 is basically the same as danckwerts 1951 model for locally isotropic turbulence as discussed in katul et al 2018 however compared to sr model sd model eliminates the need to estimate ts by introducing a new physical quantity β rms which can be directly measured in the field hence sd model has been widely applied to different kinds of flows such as grid stirred tank mckenna and mcgillis 2004 herlina and jirka 2008 and open channel flows tamburrino and gulliver 2002 however the functional form of the sd model still needs experiments to empirically define the coefficient c turney and banerjee 2013 reviewed experimental results from previous studies and proposed a new version of the sd model that combines elements from both sr and sd theories to adaptively estimate the gas transfer rate more specifically for rivers sanjou et al 2017 conducted a series of laboratory experiments to account for flow depth into the new modified sd model to take the bed generated turbulence into consideration however the presence of vegetation in rivers makes the flows more complicated than non vegetated open channel flows where turbulence is mainly generated at the bed the aforementioned past studies on prior development of gas transfer models in vegetation free flow systems are summarized in table 1 aquatic plants are able to convert mean flow energy into turbulent kinetic energy tke at the scales of stems leafs branches and canopies based on flow and vegetation parameters such as volumetric frontal area a d δ s 2 where d is the element diameter and δs is the average spacing between elements submergence ratio h h where h is the height of the plant and h is the water depth and mean flow velocity u array density and submergence ratio are two critical factors to characterize vegetative patches nepf 2012b from 1980 to 2000 many studies focused on unconfined canopy flow deeply submerged vegetated flow by investigating the shear layer turbulence and mixing in terrestrial boundary layer flow shaw et al 1983 raupach et al 1991 1996 finnigan 2000 these studies showed that the turbulent stress at the top of the canopy is the dominant driving force of the flow compared to a negligible streamwise pressure gradient within the canopy raupach and shaw 1982 studied the tke production within the canopy finding that if the turbulence generated by stem wakes is 100 converted from the mean flow then stem scale wake tke production pw can be expressed in terms of canopy drag as 14 p w 1 2 c d a u 3 where a is the volumetric frontal area of the canopy and cd is a drag coefficient in natural aquatic systems however shallow submergence h h 0 2 and emergent conditions h h 1 are more common due to the limitation of light penetration nepf 2012a which drove more studies focusing on these types of vegetated flows nepf 1999 proposed a reynolds number argument based on stem element diameter d to predict the dominance between turbulent diffusion and mechanical diffusion within the emergent canopy elements in depth limited vegetated flows two distinct exchange regions can be identified by the flow structure and the shear layer formed on top of the canopy nepf and vivoni 2000 the vertical exchange zone where mean and turbulent flow structures are influenced by the shear layer and the longitudinal exchange zone where similarly to emergent conditions flow is highly dependent on stem vegetative drag ghisalberti and nepf 2004 studied the growth of the submerged canopy shear layer finding that the shear layer becomes fully developed once the shear layer scale tke is balanced by the tke dissipation rate within the canopy lopez and garcia 2001 applied a k ϵ turbulence numerical model to predict mean and turbulent flow quantities in depth limited submerged vegetated flows by investigating the energy budget terms such as tke production tke dissipation rate and tke transport with an additional dispersive production term to account for the spatial correlation effect however most of studies ignored the dispersive term king et al 2012 whose contribution is generally less than 10 to the total production when array roughness density ah is not extremely sparse ah 0 1 up to date few studies have focused on vegetation effects on the air water interface which is important for estimating the gas transfer rate in streams with aquatic plants compared to open channel flows both sr and sd models need further studies to develop a new model for vegetated flows to account for turbulence caused by the aquatic plant canopies as mentioned sd model can be used to estimate the gas transfer rate directly from free surface turbulence characteristics sr model however is more intuitive since the sd formulation can actually be recovered back to the most basic sr form danckwerts 1951 with a clean relation between two experimental coefficients α and c katul et al 2018 however accurate prediction of hydrodynamics throughout the water column based on the free surface velocity statistics is still an open field of research e g mandel et al 2019 to understand the role of aquatic vegetation on such transfer mechanisms we propose developing an adaptive sr model for vegetated flows as a relatively direct way to link flow vegetation interactions to surface gas transfer processes the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of turbulence generated by aquatic vegetation on surface gas transfer and to propose a model to predict the transfer rate kl by linking bulk flow turbulence to surface motions in section 2 we described our methodology experimental setup and measurement techniques in section 3 we present the experimental results of mean and turbulent velocity statistics showing their effect on surface gas transfer rate at different submergence ratios and array densities in section 4 we show the relations between mean flow velocity and tke production and develop a new modified sr model using tke production as an indicator of gas transfer efficiency 2 methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in an odell kovasznay type flume odell and kovasznay 1971 fig 2 at the ecohydraulics and ecomorphodynamics laboratory eel in rantoul il the straight test section of the flume is 2 m long 0 15 m wide and 0 6 m deep the flow is driven by a rotating disk pump that generates shear under different rotational frequencies to accurately control flow speeds to mimic a uni directional river flow by uniformly distributing the disks through the whole depth of the flume the disk pump is able to produce a uniform velocity profile with minimal disturbance to the flow as water continues to recirculate in an essentially infinite loop this design ensures the full development of the boundary layer and turbulence features in the odell kovasznay flume the flume is further designed to minimize the secondary flows generated in the bending section which allows us to ideally investigate the vertical flow structures and turbulence characteristics through a 2d approach simply following the center line of the flume in the present experiments the disk rotational frequency ω is controlled by an inverter whose frequency f is in a range between 10 hz to 40 hz allowing for mean flow velocities up to 25 cm s the relation between ω and f is 15 ω r p m 6 6 f h z an array of rigid acrylic cylinders with diameter d 0 64 cm and height h 10 cm is used to simulate high stiffness aquatic vegetation canopy such as sagittaria sagittifolia and sparganium erectum which are often found in vegetated streams the vegetation array is 156 2 cm 246 d long and the leading edge is 20 3 cm 32 d downstream from the beginning of the straight test section fig 3 a 7 6 cm 12 d gap was created within the array from 135 3 cm to 142 9 cm 213 d to 225 d from the beginning of the array for piv an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vectrino nortek was put 8 cm upstream from the leading edge of the cylinder array with 10 vertical locations for calibration the dissolved oxygen sensor do sensor pasport optical dissolved oxygen sensor pasco was put at the end of the straight test section of the flume near the water surface to monitor the do concentration for estimating the gas transfer rate kl staggered configuration was chosen for the arrays two densities were selected to cover from sparse to dense conditions a h 0 1 0 5 coceal and belcher 2004 fig 4 sx and sy represent the distance between elements in x direction and y direction respectively where s x s y 5 1 cm 8d in the dense case s x s y 10 2 cm 16d in the sparse case to investigate the effects of flow strength ranging from transition to fully turbulent and submergence conditions ranging from deeply submerged to fully emergent four mean flow velocities and three submergence ratios h h were investigated for each canopy configuration the 28 runs including a base case without an array are shown in table 2 2 2 mean velocity calibration an adv was used to measure the mean velocity profile on the upstream side of the cylinder array 10 vertical locations were chosen evenly distributed in a range of 0 5 cm above the bed to 5 cm below the water surface each measurement was recorded for 1 minute at 100 hz the time and depth averaged velocity was used as the mean flow velocity corresponding to different inverter frequencies the calibration is discussed in section 3 1 2 3 flow vegetation hydrodynamics a 5 megapixel ccd camera jai go 5000m usb3 with a navitar 25 mm focal length was used to capture images for piv a 5 w continuous wave laser system was used to generate a planar light sheet with a thickness of 1 mm at the centerline of the flume the light sheet covers the whole observation gap 12 d for piv measurement the inset in fig 3 8 b i t grayscale images were captured at 60 hz for 1 min 3600 images for each run images were processed in pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 with a series of preprocessing methods high pass filter intensity capping and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization three consecutive 50 size passes with 50 overlapped interrogation areas were used to obtain higher resolution results during cross correlation calculation while the subwindow size of the first pass followed the one quarter rule keane and adrian 1990 table 2 2 4 interface gas transfer rate measurement surface gas transfer rates were determined by measuring do concentration in water according to the methodology proposed by the american society of civil engineers stenstrom 2007 cobalt chloride hexahydrate cocl2 6h2o was put into water as a catalyst to mix with sodium sulfite na2so3 which was used as an oxygen depletion agent more details of the do depletion chemical process can be found in appendix a once do concentration went down to its minimum level near zero the re aeration process started to take place the whole re aeration process was monitored with a do sensor pasco at sampling intervals from 5 to 30 s depending on the total re aeration time to monitor do temperature and pressure the recovery curve of do concentration under various vegetated flow conditions can thus be fitted based on eq 4 to obtain the corresponding surface gas transfer rate results are described in section 3 3 3 experiment result 3 1 flow velocity calibration fig 5 shows a linear increment between the inverter frequency f and mean flow velocity u when ah or h h increases a larger drag exerted by the vegetation reduces u as captured by milder slopes of the fitting lines the calibration provides a rough estimate of the mean velocities through the vegetated patch based on the inverter frequency and shows the repeatability and precise control of flow conditions on the odell kovasznay flume 3 2 hydrodynamics fig 6 shows the time averaged normalized velocity field mean streamwise averaged velocity profile and the streamwise evolution of velocity profiles for each case under f 30 hz time averaged bulk velocity ub is used for normalization the flatbed case shows a typical turbulent open channel flow with homogeneous velocity profiles in the streamwise direction fig 6 a in the emergent case h h 1 plants exert additional drag over the whole water column which yields lower velocity at the beginning of the gap due to proximity to the stem and allows for flow recovery far from the vegetation the streamwise velocity profiles are found generally constant over the entire water depth however an increment occurs near the bed due to the prevailing secondary flow vortex structure horseshoe or junction vortex that entrains fast moving fluid with high momentum from the surrounding region into the wake right behind the vegetation element causing a velocity spike near the bed liu et al 2008 stoesser et al 2010 fig 6 b and c in the submerged case due to discontinuity of the drag at the top of the canopy a strong shear layer is formed which divides the flow region into two zones above and below the penetration depth hp the definition of hp will be discussed in section 4 when z hp vertical exchange zone reynolds stress u w is balanced with the streamwise pressure gradient when z hp longitudinal exchange zone u w is negligible and the streamwise pressure gradient is balanced with the vegetative drag similar to the emergent case in this region canopy density affects the recovery of the velocity profile which can be seen through the comparison between fig 6 d and e f and g in addition canopy density also determines the ratio between bottom drag and canopy drag in the dense case the bottom drag is much smaller than the canopy drag due to discontinuity of the vegetative drag an obvious inflection point appears at the top of the canopy fig 6 d and f however in the sparse case bottom drag is comparatively important as seen in fig 6 e and g where the development of turbulent boundary layer can be seen close to the bed when submergence ratio h h 0 5 the canopy is under shallow submergence the flow is confined by the limited depth and the strong shear layer dominates the flow structure causing a sharper velocity gradient at the top of the canopy see fig 6 d and e when submergence ratio h h 0 25 the flow is not strictly confined by the water depth large scale turbulent eddies start to develop and interact with the canopy scale vortices which causes milder velocity gradient at the top of the canopy see fig 6 f and g tke is calculated from the piv data as 16 t k e 1 2 2 u 2 w 2 to reduce potential errors caused by 2d piv data on highly 3d flows two global filters for x and z components were applied to each case to remove unrealistic fluctuations thresholds were set as two times the largest standard deviation of instantaneous velocities u and w fig 7 shows the normalized reynolds stress field u w tke profiles and the profile of mean tke production 17 p u w u z the overline represents streamwise spatial average with different roughness density ah and submergence ratio h h under inverter frequency f 30 hz the vegetation height h and the characteristic shear velocity u c are used for normalization for the emergent case h h 1 the bulk shear velocity u b is used for u c which is defined as square root of the bulk reynolds stress while for the flatbed and the submerged cases h h 0 0 5 and 0 25 the maximum streamwise averaged shear velocity u max is chosen which is defined as the maximum square root of the streamwise averaged reynolds stress 18 u c u b u w b e m e r g e n t u c u max u w max f l a t b e d s u b m e r g e d the flatbed case shows the typical turbulence properties of turbulent open channel flows in which bottom shear produces most of the turbulence in the flow in the emergent case the stem scale turbulence generated by the stem elements is uniformly distributed along the z axis when canopy density is high turbulence is strong near the vegetation element but decays fast away from the vegetation fig 7 b the strong tke surrounding the vegetation makes the profile even larger than the other three local profiles x 3 d 5d and 7d however in the low density case spatial difference is not as prominent as the dense case within the gap fig 7 c for the submerged case a shear layer is formed at the top of the canopy which defines the vertical penetration depth hp as the z location where reynolds stress decays to 10 of its maximum value nepf and vivoni 2000 hp is defined by a similar way but using mean tke production as an indicator as shown by black dotted lines in fig 7 greater penetration can be observed when canopy array is sparser due to weaker shear produced at the top of canopies which is consistent with previous studies nepf and vivoni 2000 the significant peak value of tke production at the top of the canopy shown in the production profiles from each case suggests the dominance of canopy scale turbulence compared to stem scale turbulence in the submerged cases some spikes on the tke production within the canopy shown in fig 7 e and g are due to stronger stem scale turbulence red 200 indicating the dominance of turbulent diffusion in the longitudinal exchange zone compared with different submergence ratios fig 7 d and e show that under shallow submergence condition h h 0 5 the limited water depth confines the development of the shear layer scale turbulence that makes the peak of tke profile relatively non prominent at the top of the canopy when the submergence ratio becomes deeper h h 0 25 the shear layer scale vortices are fully developed which shows prominent tke peak at the top of the canopy fig 7 f and g by clearly presenting the distribution of the stem scale turbulence in emergent cases and the peak of the canopy scale turbulence in submerged cases mean tke production profiles in fig 7 shows that tke production can be a good indicator for developing a modified surface gas transfer model to predict kl in vegetated flows however an additional dispersive production pdis is formed when doing spatial average across the canopy lopez and garcia 2001 poggi et al 2004b the mean tke production profile p thus the total tke production is given by 19 p t o t p p d i s u w u z u w u z where u w is the dispersive flux resulting from the spatial correlations in the time averaged velocity field poggi et al 2004b in the cases when canopy density is not extremely sparse ah 0 1 the dispersive flux can usually be neglected king et al 2012 to test this argument the ratio of dispersive stress to streamwise averaged reynolds stress ξ u w u w under inverter frequency f 30 hz for each submergence condition and canopy density is plotted in fig 8 the dispersive fluxes only exist within the canopy due to vegetative drag exerted by the canopy elements while the fluxes are nearly zero above the canopy in the submerged case among all three submergence conditions the ratio ξ is generally within 0 1 in the dense canopy a h 0 5 while ξ is higher but still within 0 3 in the sparse cases a h 0 1 the result is generally consistent with poggi et al 2004b who showed that dispersive fluxes can be ignored in dense canopies however the dispersive fluxes become increasingly significant when the canopy density becomes smaller as shown in fig 8 the contribution of dispersive flux does not exceed 0 3 even in the sparse cases hence the mean tke production is taken as a rough approximation of the total tke production 20 p t o t p u w u z fig 9 further shows the normalized mean tke production profiles under different inverter frequencies in each submergence condition and array density the normalized values collapse into a single curve in each array roughness density ah and submergence ratio h h which provides clear turbulence characteristics for each case in the next section tke production will be used to develop a modified sr model for predicting surface gas transfer rate in vegetated streams 3 3 gas transfer rate fitting do data by eq 4 the gas transfer rate kl can be determined as shown in fig 10 which shows the fitting results of the cases under 30 hz inverter frequency the fitted gas transfer rates of each case are listed in table 2 and will be discussed in section 4 1 4 discussion 4 1 surface gas transfer rate in vegetated flows combining hydrodynamics results from piv data and gas transfer rate estimations from the do test fig 11 shows how surface gas transfer rate kl changes with the time averaged bulk flow velocity ub kl increases faster as ub increases in the emergent cases compared to the submerged cases this suggests that under emergent conditions uniformly distributed stem scale turbulence through the entire water column enhances gas transfer more efficiently compared to the canopy scale turbulence generated at the top of the submerged canopy that is deeply beneath the water surface also the results show that in both emergent and submerged cases kl rises faster with increasing ub for a higher array density this outcome can be explained by turbulence strength in different submergence conditions under emergent conditions the same flow velocity in the dense canopy a h 0 5 can generate stronger turbulence compared to the sparse canopy a h 0 1 eq 14 which enhances surface gas transfer this happens when array density has not reached the level where the array is so dense that kills turbulence due to limited space for wake development nepf 1999 2012b under submerged conditions in dense canopies a h 0 5 the canopy drag is much larger than the bottom drag generating strong canopy scale turbulence at the top of the canopy however in sparse canopies a h 0 1 the ratio of canopy drag to bottom drag is lower which generates weaker canopy scale turbulence with less velocity damping than the denser canopy fig 7 in the sparse a h 0 1 deeply submerged h h 0 25 case the ratio of canopy drag to bottom drag is relatively low and the gas transfer mechanism can be viewed as similar to the flatbed case in which turbulence is mainly generated from near the bed hence we ended up with similar gas transfer rates with sparse deeply submerged vegetation as with no vegetation for the same flow rates as shown by the black dashed line and the green line in fig 11 to compare the experimental results of vegetated streams to previous field studies wanninkhof 1992 marino and howarth 1993 clark et al 1994 zappa et al 2007 all measurements of kl were normalized from s c 589 o 2 to s c 660 co2 wanninkhof et al 2009 table 1 and plotted versus bulk flow velocity ub and surface wind speed uw in fig 12 the results show two distinct regimes associated with different types of gas transfer mechanisms one represents large scale open water environment such as oceans lakes and coastal regions previous field data where wind forcing has long been recognized as a major factor on gas transfer in this regime gas transfer rate is mainly controlled by the air side flow turbulence another represents small scale shallow water systems such as streams and rivers current experiment where underwater turbulence is the dominant forcing that can be transported to the surface and significantly affects gas transfer plate and friedrich 1984 raymond and cole 2001 zappa et al 2007 sanjou et al 2017 in this regime gas transfer rate is mainly controlled by the water side flow turbulence fig 12 further shows that water side control mechanism current experiment can generally induce higher kl with lower fluid flow velocity compared to air side control mechanism previous field data furthermore based on different submergence ratios and canopy array densities the response of gas transfer rate in vegetated streams as shown by the experiment data points blue markers can behave differently due to turbulence generated by bottom stress and vegetation as discussed previously fig 11 4 2 tke production as a key factor on surface gas transfer process our data suggests that turbulence generated by the canopy can be the main driver of the surface gas transfer process in vegetated streams relevant turbulence statistics e g tke and reynolds stress and tke budget terms tke production and dissipation are commonly used to represent the strength of turbulence according to our experimental results tke production is selected as the main turbulence indicator to modify the original sr model the tke production profiles presented in fig 9 capture both stem and canopy scale turbulence characteristics in each experiment in the emergent case there is an uniform distribution of the vegetative drag through the entire water column causing evenly distributed stem scale turbulence which suggests that bulk tke production pb can be used as the turbulence factor under emergent conditions for the submerged case canopy scale eddies are generated by the strong shear at the top of canopy which confines the development of stem scale eddies within the canopy region without interacting with the free surface the effect is similar to the blocking effect of stem scale vortices that prevent canopy vortices interacting with the bed nepf and vivoni 2000 this suggests that the canopy scale turbulence indicated by the prominent peak of the tke production profile dominates vertical transport above the canopy the maximum value of the streamwise averaged tke production p max is then used in the modified sr model for submerged cases to estimate pb and p max for the emergent and submerged cases respectively we used time averaged mean flow velocity u in the emergent case if the conversion rate of the mean flow to the stem scale wake generated turbulence is nearly 100 bulk tke production can be expressed as eq 14 that is proportional to u 3 raupach and shaw 1982 in the submerged case canopy scale turbulence is similar to the bed shear turbulence in open channel flows based on the definition of tke production 21 p u w u z a similar power law relation between p max and u is also expected hence pb and p max can be expressed as 22 p b c e m e u 3 p max c s u b u 3 where ceme and csub are the experimental coefficients for the emergent and the submerged cases respectively which can be functions of array roughness density ah and submergence ratio h h here the time averaged bulk velocity ub obtained from piv data is used as the mean flow velocity u in eq 22 as shown in figs 13 and 14 the experimental coefficient ceme is sensitive to array density in the emergent case while submergence ratio determines the coefficient csub in the submerged case higher coefficient ceme in the emergent case with higher array roughness density infers higher energy conversion rate from the mean flow to stem scale turbulence through the plant stems due to denser distribution of the vegetative drag causing stronger shear for the submerged case ah is not as sensitive to the experimental coefficient as the emergent case however the coefficient csub can change under different submergence ratio h h the results suggest that higher submergence ratio has higher energy conversion rate when the vegetation canopy is under shallow submergence conditions the limited depth confines the development of the large scale turbulence which makes the canopy scale vortices dominate the turbulence field causing a sharper velocity gradient at the top of the canopy compared to the deeper submergence case therefore the sharper velocity gradient can lead to a higher energy conversion rate and a larger value of the coefficient csub 4 3 modified sr model in vegetated flows 4 3 1 model derivation to derive a new modified sr model for vegetated flows we follow a similar normalization method for the general sd model in open channel flows proposed by sanjou et al 2017 the normalized sr equation can be obtained by using the characteristic shear velocity u c molecular diffusivity d kinematic viscosity of water ν tke dissipation rate ϵ and a characteristic time scale tc which can be expressed as a length scale lc divided by a velocity scale uc the expressions for the non dimensionalized parameters are shown as follows 23 k l k l u c 24 d d ν 25 t s t s t c ν ϵ 1 2 l c u c where the sr time scale ts is estimated by ν ϵ 1 2 assuming that turbulence generated by vegetation canopies can generally be described by small scale eddy motions d and ν are set as 1 8 10 5 cm2 s and 10 2 cm2 s for water temperature 20 c respectively after non dimensionalization the original sr equation eq 5 becomes 26 k l α d t s k l u c α d ν ϵ 1 2 l c ν 1 2 u c where α is the experimental coefficient that depends on the flow conditions however the equation retains two characteristic scales lc and uc which were determined by different scales of eddies in the past fortescue and pearson 1967 banerjee et al 1968 theofanous et al 1976 to develop a general form that includes the information from both large scale and small scale eddies the cross scale argument of the tke dissipation rate ϵ is then introduced in the model sanjou et al 2017 from the definition of the small eddies dissipation rate the scaling relation is given by 27 ϵ ν u c 2 l c 2 by tennekes and lumley 1972 the dissipation rate associated with large scale motions can be scaled as 28 ϵ u l e 3 l l e where ule and lle are the large scale characteristic velocity and length in the turbulence energy cascade process the dissipation rate should be constant from large eddies to small eddies 29 ν u c 2 l c 2 u l e 3 l l e u c l c u l e 3 ν l l e hence eq 26 can be rewritten as 30 k l u c α ν l l e u l e 3 1 2 ϵ 1 2 d ν 3 2 k l α u l e 1 2 l l e 1 2 ν 1 2 u c 2 u l e 2 ϵ 1 2 d ν 1 2 α l ϵ 1 2 d ν 1 2 where l is the non dimensional length scale parameter 31 l u l e 1 2 l l e 1 2 ν 1 2 u c 2 u l e 2 r e l e 1 2 u c 2 u l e 2 4 3 2 from surface to bulk flow variables based on the assumption made by sr model only molecular diffusion allows oxygen to enter the air water interface even though turbulence indirectly acts to enhance gas transfer hence traditionally the tke dissipation rate ϵ in eq 30 needs to be determined near the water surface which is difficult to measure directly in fact measuring ϵ requires high resolution piv images to solve the derivative of turbulence fluctuations which is another challenge for experiments especially when flow speed is high an alternative way to obtain ϵ is from a steady state tke budget poggi et al 2004a 32 ϵ p d d z w q where w is the vertical velocity fluctuations and q is the tke fluctuations the second term on the right hand side represents the turbulence transport flux derived from the triple correlation in the tke budget which usually can be treated as a tke diffusion term or td 33 d d z w q t d k t d 2 q d z 2 td is used to estimate the effect of reynolds stress in the mean momentum equation kt is the eddy diffusivity and can be estimated by various turbulence closure models the classical prandtl mixing length model is adopted to calculate kt 34 k t l m 2 d u d z where lm is the mixing length scale katul et al 2004 35 l m κ h 3 z h 1 κ z 2 h 3 z h 1 where κ 0 4 is the von karman constant as shown in fig 15 the maximum values occur at the top of the canopy in submerged cases while the distribution is relatively uniform throughout the whole water column in emergent cases two different canopy densities show similar td curves in all cases however since td is obtained from the second derivative of tke which is sensitive to any fluctuation of the profile it also requires high resolution of the piv images to accurately estimate its value fig 15 shows the characteristic curve of the td profile under different submergence conditions but it also shows some fluctuation errors due to sensitivity issues as a result the profile is not informative enough to solve ϵ near the surface by td with eq 32 when we treat the problem in a bulk sense td plays as the inertial forces to diffuse and transport the tke from the region where turbulence is generated toward the low turbulence locations that is to transport energy from large eddies to small eddies however the process has no effect on generating or dissipating turbulence hence in a bulk sense the problem can be narrowed down to the balance between ϵ and p which are the main dominant terms in these scenarios following the argument made by plate and friedrich 1984 that turbulence as the main factor to enhance gas transfer in open channel flow is generated through either a the work of shearing stresses on the surface due to the action of wind or b at the bed due to bottom friction and assuming that wind induced shear on the surface can be ignored the re aeration tke dissipation rate plate and friedrich 1984 can be expressed as 36 ϵ a v 1 l l e u c 2 u l e u l e 3 l l e u c 2 u l e 2 where ule 3 lle can be rewritten as the large scale characteristic tke dissipation rate ϵ cle 37 u l e 3 l l e ϵ c l e based on the argument of the bulk balance between the dissipation rate and the production ϵ c l e p c 38 ϵ a v p c u c 2 u l e 2 where pc is the bulk scale characteristic tke production in the vegetated flow depending on the canopy submergence condition replacing ϵ by pc in the previously derived non dimensionalized sr model and combining eqs 30 and 31 the final model form can be updated as 39 k l α r e l e 1 2 u c 2 u l e 2 p c 1 2 d ν 1 2 α l p c 1 2 d ν 1 2 in summary the whole non dimensional derivation in section 4 3 1 started from the traditional small eddy sr model and then linked small eddy dissipation to large eddy dissipation by scaling with large scale bulk variables ule lle thus local value of surface dissipation ϵ can be replaced by the large scale characteristic tke production the bracket terms l in eq 39 determines the constant ratio of surface small scale dissipation to the bulk scale dissipation this is based on the concept that large eddies are generated by the turbulence shear p in vegetated flows and energy is transported to small eddies near the water surface ϵ by tke diffusion td the energy ratio between surface local scale and bulk scale is determined by the non dimensional length scale l which is formed by the large scale flow reynolds number rele and the squared ratio of characteristic shear velocity u c to the large scale velocity ule 4 3 3 effects of submergence ratio eq 39 has provided a base of the modified sr model for vegetated flows the remaining challenge is to properly select each bulk variable including the bulk scale characteristic tke production pc the characteristic shear velocity u c and the large scale characteristic velocity ule and length lle as discussed in section 4 2 dominant tke production values are chosen based on different submergence conditions as well as the characteristic shear velocity see section 3 2 in the emergent case bulk tke production pb and bulk shear velocity u b eq 18 are selected for pc and u c while the time averaged bulk velocity ub and the water depth h are chosen for the large scale characteristic velocity ule and length lle respectively then the modified sr equation for the emergent case becomes 40 k l α u b 1 2 h 1 2 ν 1 2 u b 2 u b 2 p b 1 2 d ν 1 2 α l e m e p b 1 2 d ν 1 2 where 41 l e m e u b 1 2 d 1 2 ν 1 2 h 1 2 d 1 2 u b 2 u b 2 r e d 1 2 h 1 2 d 1 2 u b 2 u b 2 the above equation shows that l e m e depends on the stem scale reynolds number red the ratio of water depth to stem diameter h d and the ratio of time averaged bulk velocity to bulk shear velocity u b u b which determines the constant ratio for taking bulk scale characteristic turbulence as the indicator to predict the surface local behavior the model equation also suggests that stem scale turbulence generated by the emergent vegetation canopy does enhance the surface gas transfer rate while red h d and u b u b are three factors that determines how stem scale turbulence affects surface gas transfer rates in the submerged case the maximum value of the streamwise averaged tke production p max and the maximum streamwise averaged shear velocity u max eq 18 are chosen for pc and u c while the time averaged bulk velocity ub and the upper canopy length lup are selected for the large scale characteristic velocity ule and length lle respectively the upper canopy length lup is defined as the canopy surface gap that is directly proportional to the canopy scale vortex size mandel et al 2019 hence the modified sr equation for the submerged case is 42 k l α u b 1 2 l u p 1 2 ν 1 2 u max 2 u b 2 p max 1 2 d ν 1 2 α l s u b p max 1 2 d ν 1 2 where 43 l s u b u b 1 2 h 1 2 ν 1 2 l u p 1 2 h 1 2 u max 2 u b 2 r e h 1 2 l u p 1 2 h 1 2 u max 2 u b 2 like the emergent case eq 43 also shows that l s u b depends on the mean flow reynolds number reh the ratio of upper canopy length scale to water depth lup h and the ratio of maximum streamwise averaged shear velocity to time averaged bulk velocity u max u b it indicates that the canopy scale turbulence generated by the submerged canopy is the main factor that enhances the surface gas transfer rate kl reh u max u b and the submergence ratio that determines lup h all play a role in determining kl based on the above modified sr model fig 16 presents the fitting results of the emergent canopy case by the model which shows that turning points star signs in fig 16 occur once the stem scale reynolds number red reaches 200 since tke production is mainly generated by the wake turbulence within the emergent canopy when red 200 the wake production is relatively weak causing turbulent component of diffusion to be negligible nepf 1999 hence the coefficient α is smaller α 0 39 when red 200 the wake production is dominant within the canopy and the strong turbulent diffusion greatly enhances surface gas transfer which leads to a higher α coefficient α 1 69 the array roughness density ah is the main factor that influences the location of the turning point based on the balance between the exerted drag and the flow momentum within the canopy as ah goes higher the fitting line for red 200 is shifted toward the right due to the higher vegetative drag that reduces the flow velocity and red although with higher tke production on the other hand in the submerged case fig 17 shows that the turning points star signs in fig 17 can be found when the mean flow reynolds number reh is around 7000 compared to the critical reynolds number for transition from laminar to turbulent flow in open channel flows reh 103 trinh 2010 the critical values are in the same order this suggests that the coefficient α is related to the intermittent ejection of the shear layer eddies at the top of the canopy into the outer stream which can be analogous to turbulence boundary layer development of open channel flows trinh 2010 where the submerged canopy acts as bottom bed roughness for example fig 6 d and e show a clear difference in the velocity profile s shape between the dense case r e h 5596 7000 and the sparse case r e h 7075 7000 of submerged canopy flow by focusing on the region above the canopy the upper canopy flow is analogous to an open channel flow with a rough bottom caused by vegetation elements the profile in the dense case shows characteristics of the velocity profile in laminar open channel flows while in the sparse case the profile is close to the shape of the velocity profile in turbulent open channel flows kirkgoz and ardiclioglu 1997 which also suggests that turbulence generation mechanism changes around r e h 7000 in submerged cases when reh 7000 canopy scale tke production is not dominant in the flow and diffusion mainly comes from mechanical diffusion causing lower α coefficient α 0 13 when reh 7000 the turbulent canopy shear layer is fully developed and the canopy scale turbulence now dominates the whole diffusion process above the canopy which makes a higher α coefficient α 0 71 under submerged condition the density of the canopy is not the only factor that is sensitive to the location of the turning point instead submergence ratio h h also plays as an effective factor because it determines both the development of the canopy shear layer based on the above canopy length lup and the ratio of the canopy region drag region where plants pose drag to the flow to the free flow region when h h is higher sharper velocity gradient generated at the top of the canopy gives higher canopy scale tke production and higher ratio of the drag free flow region reduces the flow velocity even more which shifts the fitting line for reh 7000 toward the right to reach the critical value the r squared values of the fitting curves are all over 0 9 which shows that the modified sr model is in a good level of effectiveness for predicting surface gas transfer rates in vegetated flows under different array densities and submergence conditions 5 conclusions our study showed that tke production can be used as an indicator to more accurately predict surface gas transfer rates in vegetated streams by measuring the basic vegetation and flow parameters such as ah h h and u we developed a new sr model that provides superior estimates of surface gas transfer rates which are necessary for water quality management furthermore the study provides better understanding of the magnitude and causes of variation in gas transfer velocity in vegetated rivers our approach can improve the accuracy of models estimating global mass balance of gases in rivers with the presence of vegetation the model combines the information from both large scale and small scale eddies it further includes essential parameters information of the plant canopy flow to link bulk turbulence quantities to surface motions based on the experimental results we identified two critical reynolds numbers for the emergent and submerged canopy cases respectively with different slopes of the linear relation between the turbulence strength and the surface gas transfer rate which are concluded as follows if the vegetation is emergent stem scale turbulence generated by the wake vortices is the main driver to enhance the surface gas transfer process when stem scale reynolds number red 200 the stem scale turbulent diffusion is relatively weak compared to mechanical diffusion in the flow causing low enhancement of surface gas transfer however when stem scale reynolds number red 200 the wake production is dominant within the canopy and the strong turbulent diffusion greatly enhances surface gas transfer rates the array density can influence the corresponding tke production to the value of critical reynolds number based on the balance between the exerted drag and the flow momentum within the canopy higher array density results in stronger tke production to reach the critical value redc due to the higher vegetative drag that reduces the flow power if the vegetation is submerged canopy scale turbulence generated by the sharp velocity gradient on top of the canopy becomes the dominant factor that intensifies the surface gas transfer process compared to stem scale turbulence that is confined within the vegetation array the critical mean flow reynolds number rehc occurs around 7000 when reh 7000 canopy scale tke production is relatively weak and diffusion mainly comes from mechanical diffusion leading to a relatively insensitive linear relation between p max and kl when reh 7000 the fully developed turbulent canopy shear layer causes canopy scale tke production to dominate the whole diffusion process above the canopy resulting in a stronger coupling between p max and kl in addition to the array density submergence ratio h h also becomes important as it determines the development of the canopy shear layer based on the above canopy length lup and the ratio of the free flow region to the canopy region where plants pose drag to the flow higher submergence ratio h h leads to a sharper velocity gradient generated at the top of the canopy due to limited above canopy region it reduces flow power more efficiently by having a relatively larger portion of the flow experiencing vegetated drag which makes higher tke production corresponding to the critical mean flow reynolds number rehc our study provides fundamental insight on how turbulence generated by aquatic vegetation affects the surface gas transfer mechanism in stream systems with changing plant densities and submergence ratios however the gas transfer process and the flow structure become more complex in the field where organic sediments are present in natural systems such complexities include sediment transport mechanisms and biochemical effects from organic sediments interacting with vegetation and do hence more experimental studies are required to quantify such effects in the future which is the next step of this research credit authorship contribution statement

429,turbulence generated by aquatic vegetation in lakes estuaries and rivers can significantly alter the flow structure throughout the entire water column affecting gas transfer mechanisms at the air water interface thus modifying indicators of water quality a series of laboratory experiments with rigid acrylic cylinder arrays to mimic vegetation was conducted in a recirculating odell kovasznay type race track flume particle image velocimetry was used to characterize mean and turbulent flow statistics to investigate the effect of emergent and submerged vegetation on gas transfer rate in terms of turbulent kinetic energy tke reynolds stresses and tke production surface gas transfer rates were determined by measuring dissolved oxygen concentration during re aeration using an optical sensor the results provided new insights on how stem and canopy scale turbulence affect the surface gas transfer rate at different submergence ratios and array densities the relation between mean flow velocity and tke production in each scenario is discussed and a modified surface renewal model using tke production as an indicator of gas transfer efficiency is developed to more accurately predict surface gas transfer rates in vegetated streams keywords vegetated flows turbulence production gas transfer surface renewal 1 introduction in natural water environments such as rivers lakes and estuaries aquatic vegetation can significantly alter the mean and turbulent flow structure nepf 2012a by changing water flow and generating turbulence the presence of vegetation can also affect processes at the air water interface and thus modify surface gas transfer mechanism poindexter and variano 2013 foster martinez and variano 2016 ho et al 2018 fig 1 which in turn affects practical management of water quality in aquatic environments for example installing aeration systems to enhance oxygen transfer to lakes and rivers with high biological oxygen demand bod is one of the common ways that environmental engineers apply to keep an aquatic system well aerated and prevent unpleasant algal blooms hence maintaining adequate water quality to support other forms of aquatic life global warming depends on the transfer of greenhouse gasses e g co2 ch4 at the air water surface the conceptual model presented by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc prentice et al 2001 considered only land and oceans as active boxes connected by rivers acting as passive pipes however studies on stream metabolism and gas exchange raymond et al 2013 hotchkiss et al 2015 have shown the active role of rivers in the exchange of carbon and oxygen through gas transfer at the air water interface raymond and cole 2001 further pointed out a general lack of studies physically based predictive models and direct measurement of gas transfer velocity in estuaries and rivers compared to the oceans a better understanding of the magnitude and causes of variation in gas transfer velocity in rivers and estuaries is needed for estimating global mass balance of gases more accurately it is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in global warming models and a hot area of environmental fluid mechanics research in order to address the needs and significances mentioned above this study focuses on examining gas transfer rates in streams where aquatic vegetation exists from submerged to fully emergent in recent decades there have been numerous models developed to study the gas transfer mechanism at the air water interface liao and wang 2013 diffusive boundary layer dbl theory is the basis of most of the models suggesting that the gas concentration gradient extends from the bulk concentration in water to the saturation concentration at the surface within a thin dbl in the dbl diffusive flux from air to water f follows fick s law 1 f d c w z z 0 where d is the molecular diffusivity of water cw is the local concentration of dissolved oxygen do in water and z 0 denotes the location at the air water interface then f can be expressed as a function of the bulk concentration of do cdo in the water body using a gas transfer rate kl 2 f k l c s a t c d o where csat is the saturation concentration of do in water the gas transfer rate serves as the fundamental parameter for measuring the transfer velocity at which oxygen is entrained in water assuming that there are no losses of do in water and f is the only source transporting do into the water column until do reaches saturation c d o c s a t f can thus be rewritten as a time derivative form of the bulk concentration in water the above equation can be further expressed as 3 f h c d o t k l c s a t c d o where h is the averaged water depth solving the above first order ordinary differential equation with assumption of c d o t 0 0 we obtain the solution of the bulk concentration of do in water 4 c d o c s a t 1 exp 1 h k l t the dbl can be determined by the turbulence strength near the air water interface danckwerts 1951 first proposed a surface renewal sr model to estimate the interface gas transfer rate based on dbl theory and higbie 1935 s penetration model the model assumes that turbulent eddies can stochastically break through the liquid surface carrying fresh parcels of fluid to the interface by molecular diffusion the gas transfer rate kl can be modeled by poisson arrival times 5 k l 1 t s 0 t s exp t t s d π t d t d t s where ts is the sr time scale which represents how long until the water parcel is replaced by a new fresh one given the difficulty to measure ts directly many studies have proposed different methods to estimate it fortescue and pearson 1967 came up with a large eddy surface renewal lesr model arguing that the large eddies dominate the process of sr events and the renewal time scale can be estimated by the bulk length scale l and the turbulence intensity expressed as the root mean square of the velocity fluctuations in the bulk fluid u rms 6 t s l u r m s the angular brackets represent a time average and u represents velocity fluctuations using a typical reynolds decomposition from the instantaneous velocity u and the time averaged mean flow velocity u as 7 u u u banerjee et al 1968 developed a small eddy surface renewal sesr model which suggests that the renewal time scale is related to the turbulence intensity of small scale eddies based on kolmogorov time scale 8 t s ν ϵ 1 2 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and ϵ is the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate later on theofanous et al 1976 integrated both lesr and sesr models and proposed a two regime surface renewal trsr model based on turbulent reynolds number defined as 9 r e t u r m s l ν they argued that for ret 500 large scale eddies are dominant while small scale eddies are more representative of turbulent conditions for ret 500 this yields a two regime prediction of the gas transfer rate 10 k l α s c 1 2 u r m s r e t 1 2 r e t 500 11 k l α s c 1 2 u r m s r e t 1 4 r e t 500 where sc is the schmidt number s c ν d and α is the experimentally determined coefficient that depends on the flow condition however the aforementioned models rely on estimating the sr time scale ts instead of measuring it directly there is a gap in the development of models that incorporate corrections for more complex conditions such as vegetated flows mccready et al 1986 presented a relation between the divergence of the free surface velocity and the gas transfer process through the air water interface banerjee 1990 proposed a surface divergence sd model that directly relates the surface divergence velocity to the surface gas transfer rate 12 k l c d β r m s where c is a coefficient that accounts for different flow conditions and β rms is the bulk root mean square of the divergence of surface fluctuations 13 β r m s u x v y the expression of eq 12 is basically the same as danckwerts 1951 model for locally isotropic turbulence as discussed in katul et al 2018 however compared to sr model sd model eliminates the need to estimate ts by introducing a new physical quantity β rms which can be directly measured in the field hence sd model has been widely applied to different kinds of flows such as grid stirred tank mckenna and mcgillis 2004 herlina and jirka 2008 and open channel flows tamburrino and gulliver 2002 however the functional form of the sd model still needs experiments to empirically define the coefficient c turney and banerjee 2013 reviewed experimental results from previous studies and proposed a new version of the sd model that combines elements from both sr and sd theories to adaptively estimate the gas transfer rate more specifically for rivers sanjou et al 2017 conducted a series of laboratory experiments to account for flow depth into the new modified sd model to take the bed generated turbulence into consideration however the presence of vegetation in rivers makes the flows more complicated than non vegetated open channel flows where turbulence is mainly generated at the bed the aforementioned past studies on prior development of gas transfer models in vegetation free flow systems are summarized in table 1 aquatic plants are able to convert mean flow energy into turbulent kinetic energy tke at the scales of stems leafs branches and canopies based on flow and vegetation parameters such as volumetric frontal area a d δ s 2 where d is the element diameter and δs is the average spacing between elements submergence ratio h h where h is the height of the plant and h is the water depth and mean flow velocity u array density and submergence ratio are two critical factors to characterize vegetative patches nepf 2012b from 1980 to 2000 many studies focused on unconfined canopy flow deeply submerged vegetated flow by investigating the shear layer turbulence and mixing in terrestrial boundary layer flow shaw et al 1983 raupach et al 1991 1996 finnigan 2000 these studies showed that the turbulent stress at the top of the canopy is the dominant driving force of the flow compared to a negligible streamwise pressure gradient within the canopy raupach and shaw 1982 studied the tke production within the canopy finding that if the turbulence generated by stem wakes is 100 converted from the mean flow then stem scale wake tke production pw can be expressed in terms of canopy drag as 14 p w 1 2 c d a u 3 where a is the volumetric frontal area of the canopy and cd is a drag coefficient in natural aquatic systems however shallow submergence h h 0 2 and emergent conditions h h 1 are more common due to the limitation of light penetration nepf 2012a which drove more studies focusing on these types of vegetated flows nepf 1999 proposed a reynolds number argument based on stem element diameter d to predict the dominance between turbulent diffusion and mechanical diffusion within the emergent canopy elements in depth limited vegetated flows two distinct exchange regions can be identified by the flow structure and the shear layer formed on top of the canopy nepf and vivoni 2000 the vertical exchange zone where mean and turbulent flow structures are influenced by the shear layer and the longitudinal exchange zone where similarly to emergent conditions flow is highly dependent on stem vegetative drag ghisalberti and nepf 2004 studied the growth of the submerged canopy shear layer finding that the shear layer becomes fully developed once the shear layer scale tke is balanced by the tke dissipation rate within the canopy lopez and garcia 2001 applied a k ϵ turbulence numerical model to predict mean and turbulent flow quantities in depth limited submerged vegetated flows by investigating the energy budget terms such as tke production tke dissipation rate and tke transport with an additional dispersive production term to account for the spatial correlation effect however most of studies ignored the dispersive term king et al 2012 whose contribution is generally less than 10 to the total production when array roughness density ah is not extremely sparse ah 0 1 up to date few studies have focused on vegetation effects on the air water interface which is important for estimating the gas transfer rate in streams with aquatic plants compared to open channel flows both sr and sd models need further studies to develop a new model for vegetated flows to account for turbulence caused by the aquatic plant canopies as mentioned sd model can be used to estimate the gas transfer rate directly from free surface turbulence characteristics sr model however is more intuitive since the sd formulation can actually be recovered back to the most basic sr form danckwerts 1951 with a clean relation between two experimental coefficients α and c katul et al 2018 however accurate prediction of hydrodynamics throughout the water column based on the free surface velocity statistics is still an open field of research e g mandel et al 2019 to understand the role of aquatic vegetation on such transfer mechanisms we propose developing an adaptive sr model for vegetated flows as a relatively direct way to link flow vegetation interactions to surface gas transfer processes the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of turbulence generated by aquatic vegetation on surface gas transfer and to propose a model to predict the transfer rate kl by linking bulk flow turbulence to surface motions in section 2 we described our methodology experimental setup and measurement techniques in section 3 we present the experimental results of mean and turbulent velocity statistics showing their effect on surface gas transfer rate at different submergence ratios and array densities in section 4 we show the relations between mean flow velocity and tke production and develop a new modified sr model using tke production as an indicator of gas transfer efficiency 2 methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in an odell kovasznay type flume odell and kovasznay 1971 fig 2 at the ecohydraulics and ecomorphodynamics laboratory eel in rantoul il the straight test section of the flume is 2 m long 0 15 m wide and 0 6 m deep the flow is driven by a rotating disk pump that generates shear under different rotational frequencies to accurately control flow speeds to mimic a uni directional river flow by uniformly distributing the disks through the whole depth of the flume the disk pump is able to produce a uniform velocity profile with minimal disturbance to the flow as water continues to recirculate in an essentially infinite loop this design ensures the full development of the boundary layer and turbulence features in the odell kovasznay flume the flume is further designed to minimize the secondary flows generated in the bending section which allows us to ideally investigate the vertical flow structures and turbulence characteristics through a 2d approach simply following the center line of the flume in the present experiments the disk rotational frequency ω is controlled by an inverter whose frequency f is in a range between 10 hz to 40 hz allowing for mean flow velocities up to 25 cm s the relation between ω and f is 15 ω r p m 6 6 f h z an array of rigid acrylic cylinders with diameter d 0 64 cm and height h 10 cm is used to simulate high stiffness aquatic vegetation canopy such as sagittaria sagittifolia and sparganium erectum which are often found in vegetated streams the vegetation array is 156 2 cm 246 d long and the leading edge is 20 3 cm 32 d downstream from the beginning of the straight test section fig 3 a 7 6 cm 12 d gap was created within the array from 135 3 cm to 142 9 cm 213 d to 225 d from the beginning of the array for piv an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vectrino nortek was put 8 cm upstream from the leading edge of the cylinder array with 10 vertical locations for calibration the dissolved oxygen sensor do sensor pasport optical dissolved oxygen sensor pasco was put at the end of the straight test section of the flume near the water surface to monitor the do concentration for estimating the gas transfer rate kl staggered configuration was chosen for the arrays two densities were selected to cover from sparse to dense conditions a h 0 1 0 5 coceal and belcher 2004 fig 4 sx and sy represent the distance between elements in x direction and y direction respectively where s x s y 5 1 cm 8d in the dense case s x s y 10 2 cm 16d in the sparse case to investigate the effects of flow strength ranging from transition to fully turbulent and submergence conditions ranging from deeply submerged to fully emergent four mean flow velocities and three submergence ratios h h were investigated for each canopy configuration the 28 runs including a base case without an array are shown in table 2 2 2 mean velocity calibration an adv was used to measure the mean velocity profile on the upstream side of the cylinder array 10 vertical locations were chosen evenly distributed in a range of 0 5 cm above the bed to 5 cm below the water surface each measurement was recorded for 1 minute at 100 hz the time and depth averaged velocity was used as the mean flow velocity corresponding to different inverter frequencies the calibration is discussed in section 3 1 2 3 flow vegetation hydrodynamics a 5 megapixel ccd camera jai go 5000m usb3 with a navitar 25 mm focal length was used to capture images for piv a 5 w continuous wave laser system was used to generate a planar light sheet with a thickness of 1 mm at the centerline of the flume the light sheet covers the whole observation gap 12 d for piv measurement the inset in fig 3 8 b i t grayscale images were captured at 60 hz for 1 min 3600 images for each run images were processed in pivlab thielicke and stamhuis 2014 with a series of preprocessing methods high pass filter intensity capping and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization three consecutive 50 size passes with 50 overlapped interrogation areas were used to obtain higher resolution results during cross correlation calculation while the subwindow size of the first pass followed the one quarter rule keane and adrian 1990 table 2 2 4 interface gas transfer rate measurement surface gas transfer rates were determined by measuring do concentration in water according to the methodology proposed by the american society of civil engineers stenstrom 2007 cobalt chloride hexahydrate cocl2 6h2o was put into water as a catalyst to mix with sodium sulfite na2so3 which was used as an oxygen depletion agent more details of the do depletion chemical process can be found in appendix a once do concentration went down to its minimum level near zero the re aeration process started to take place the whole re aeration process was monitored with a do sensor pasco at sampling intervals from 5 to 30 s depending on the total re aeration time to monitor do temperature and pressure the recovery curve of do concentration under various vegetated flow conditions can thus be fitted based on eq 4 to obtain the corresponding surface gas transfer rate results are described in section 3 3 3 experiment result 3 1 flow velocity calibration fig 5 shows a linear increment between the inverter frequency f and mean flow velocity u when ah or h h increases a larger drag exerted by the vegetation reduces u as captured by milder slopes of the fitting lines the calibration provides a rough estimate of the mean velocities through the vegetated patch based on the inverter frequency and shows the repeatability and precise control of flow conditions on the odell kovasznay flume 3 2 hydrodynamics fig 6 shows the time averaged normalized velocity field mean streamwise averaged velocity profile and the streamwise evolution of velocity profiles for each case under f 30 hz time averaged bulk velocity ub is used for normalization the flatbed case shows a typical turbulent open channel flow with homogeneous velocity profiles in the streamwise direction fig 6 a in the emergent case h h 1 plants exert additional drag over the whole water column which yields lower velocity at the beginning of the gap due to proximity to the stem and allows for flow recovery far from the vegetation the streamwise velocity profiles are found generally constant over the entire water depth however an increment occurs near the bed due to the prevailing secondary flow vortex structure horseshoe or junction vortex that entrains fast moving fluid with high momentum from the surrounding region into the wake right behind the vegetation element causing a velocity spike near the bed liu et al 2008 stoesser et al 2010 fig 6 b and c in the submerged case due to discontinuity of the drag at the top of the canopy a strong shear layer is formed which divides the flow region into two zones above and below the penetration depth hp the definition of hp will be discussed in section 4 when z hp vertical exchange zone reynolds stress u w is balanced with the streamwise pressure gradient when z hp longitudinal exchange zone u w is negligible and the streamwise pressure gradient is balanced with the vegetative drag similar to the emergent case in this region canopy density affects the recovery of the velocity profile which can be seen through the comparison between fig 6 d and e f and g in addition canopy density also determines the ratio between bottom drag and canopy drag in the dense case the bottom drag is much smaller than the canopy drag due to discontinuity of the vegetative drag an obvious inflection point appears at the top of the canopy fig 6 d and f however in the sparse case bottom drag is comparatively important as seen in fig 6 e and g where the development of turbulent boundary layer can be seen close to the bed when submergence ratio h h 0 5 the canopy is under shallow submergence the flow is confined by the limited depth and the strong shear layer dominates the flow structure causing a sharper velocity gradient at the top of the canopy see fig 6 d and e when submergence ratio h h 0 25 the flow is not strictly confined by the water depth large scale turbulent eddies start to develop and interact with the canopy scale vortices which causes milder velocity gradient at the top of the canopy see fig 6 f and g tke is calculated from the piv data as 16 t k e 1 2 2 u 2 w 2 to reduce potential errors caused by 2d piv data on highly 3d flows two global filters for x and z components were applied to each case to remove unrealistic fluctuations thresholds were set as two times the largest standard deviation of instantaneous velocities u and w fig 7 shows the normalized reynolds stress field u w tke profiles and the profile of mean tke production 17 p u w u z the overline represents streamwise spatial average with different roughness density ah and submergence ratio h h under inverter frequency f 30 hz the vegetation height h and the characteristic shear velocity u c are used for normalization for the emergent case h h 1 the bulk shear velocity u b is used for u c which is defined as square root of the bulk reynolds stress while for the flatbed and the submerged cases h h 0 0 5 and 0 25 the maximum streamwise averaged shear velocity u max is chosen which is defined as the maximum square root of the streamwise averaged reynolds stress 18 u c u b u w b e m e r g e n t u c u max u w max f l a t b e d s u b m e r g e d the flatbed case shows the typical turbulence properties of turbulent open channel flows in which bottom shear produces most of the turbulence in the flow in the emergent case the stem scale turbulence generated by the stem elements is uniformly distributed along the z axis when canopy density is high turbulence is strong near the vegetation element but decays fast away from the vegetation fig 7 b the strong tke surrounding the vegetation makes the profile even larger than the other three local profiles x 3 d 5d and 7d however in the low density case spatial difference is not as prominent as the dense case within the gap fig 7 c for the submerged case a shear layer is formed at the top of the canopy which defines the vertical penetration depth hp as the z location where reynolds stress decays to 10 of its maximum value nepf and vivoni 2000 hp is defined by a similar way but using mean tke production as an indicator as shown by black dotted lines in fig 7 greater penetration can be observed when canopy array is sparser due to weaker shear produced at the top of canopies which is consistent with previous studies nepf and vivoni 2000 the significant peak value of tke production at the top of the canopy shown in the production profiles from each case suggests the dominance of canopy scale turbulence compared to stem scale turbulence in the submerged cases some spikes on the tke production within the canopy shown in fig 7 e and g are due to stronger stem scale turbulence red 200 indicating the dominance of turbulent diffusion in the longitudinal exchange zone compared with different submergence ratios fig 7 d and e show that under shallow submergence condition h h 0 5 the limited water depth confines the development of the shear layer scale turbulence that makes the peak of tke profile relatively non prominent at the top of the canopy when the submergence ratio becomes deeper h h 0 25 the shear layer scale vortices are fully developed which shows prominent tke peak at the top of the canopy fig 7 f and g by clearly presenting the distribution of the stem scale turbulence in emergent cases and the peak of the canopy scale turbulence in submerged cases mean tke production profiles in fig 7 shows that tke production can be a good indicator for developing a modified surface gas transfer model to predict kl in vegetated flows however an additional dispersive production pdis is formed when doing spatial average across the canopy lopez and garcia 2001 poggi et al 2004b the mean tke production profile p thus the total tke production is given by 19 p t o t p p d i s u w u z u w u z where u w is the dispersive flux resulting from the spatial correlations in the time averaged velocity field poggi et al 2004b in the cases when canopy density is not extremely sparse ah 0 1 the dispersive flux can usually be neglected king et al 2012 to test this argument the ratio of dispersive stress to streamwise averaged reynolds stress ξ u w u w under inverter frequency f 30 hz for each submergence condition and canopy density is plotted in fig 8 the dispersive fluxes only exist within the canopy due to vegetative drag exerted by the canopy elements while the fluxes are nearly zero above the canopy in the submerged case among all three submergence conditions the ratio ξ is generally within 0 1 in the dense canopy a h 0 5 while ξ is higher but still within 0 3 in the sparse cases a h 0 1 the result is generally consistent with poggi et al 2004b who showed that dispersive fluxes can be ignored in dense canopies however the dispersive fluxes become increasingly significant when the canopy density becomes smaller as shown in fig 8 the contribution of dispersive flux does not exceed 0 3 even in the sparse cases hence the mean tke production is taken as a rough approximation of the total tke production 20 p t o t p u w u z fig 9 further shows the normalized mean tke production profiles under different inverter frequencies in each submergence condition and array density the normalized values collapse into a single curve in each array roughness density ah and submergence ratio h h which provides clear turbulence characteristics for each case in the next section tke production will be used to develop a modified sr model for predicting surface gas transfer rate in vegetated streams 3 3 gas transfer rate fitting do data by eq 4 the gas transfer rate kl can be determined as shown in fig 10 which shows the fitting results of the cases under 30 hz inverter frequency the fitted gas transfer rates of each case are listed in table 2 and will be discussed in section 4 1 4 discussion 4 1 surface gas transfer rate in vegetated flows combining hydrodynamics results from piv data and gas transfer rate estimations from the do test fig 11 shows how surface gas transfer rate kl changes with the time averaged bulk flow velocity ub kl increases faster as ub increases in the emergent cases compared to the submerged cases this suggests that under emergent conditions uniformly distributed stem scale turbulence through the entire water column enhances gas transfer more efficiently compared to the canopy scale turbulence generated at the top of the submerged canopy that is deeply beneath the water surface also the results show that in both emergent and submerged cases kl rises faster with increasing ub for a higher array density this outcome can be explained by turbulence strength in different submergence conditions under emergent conditions the same flow velocity in the dense canopy a h 0 5 can generate stronger turbulence compared to the sparse canopy a h 0 1 eq 14 which enhances surface gas transfer this happens when array density has not reached the level where the array is so dense that kills turbulence due to limited space for wake development nepf 1999 2012b under submerged conditions in dense canopies a h 0 5 the canopy drag is much larger than the bottom drag generating strong canopy scale turbulence at the top of the canopy however in sparse canopies a h 0 1 the ratio of canopy drag to bottom drag is lower which generates weaker canopy scale turbulence with less velocity damping than the denser canopy fig 7 in the sparse a h 0 1 deeply submerged h h 0 25 case the ratio of canopy drag to bottom drag is relatively low and the gas transfer mechanism can be viewed as similar to the flatbed case in which turbulence is mainly generated from near the bed hence we ended up with similar gas transfer rates with sparse deeply submerged vegetation as with no vegetation for the same flow rates as shown by the black dashed line and the green line in fig 11 to compare the experimental results of vegetated streams to previous field studies wanninkhof 1992 marino and howarth 1993 clark et al 1994 zappa et al 2007 all measurements of kl were normalized from s c 589 o 2 to s c 660 co2 wanninkhof et al 2009 table 1 and plotted versus bulk flow velocity ub and surface wind speed uw in fig 12 the results show two distinct regimes associated with different types of gas transfer mechanisms one represents large scale open water environment such as oceans lakes and coastal regions previous field data where wind forcing has long been recognized as a major factor on gas transfer in this regime gas transfer rate is mainly controlled by the air side flow turbulence another represents small scale shallow water systems such as streams and rivers current experiment where underwater turbulence is the dominant forcing that can be transported to the surface and significantly affects gas transfer plate and friedrich 1984 raymond and cole 2001 zappa et al 2007 sanjou et al 2017 in this regime gas transfer rate is mainly controlled by the water side flow turbulence fig 12 further shows that water side control mechanism current experiment can generally induce higher kl with lower fluid flow velocity compared to air side control mechanism previous field data furthermore based on different submergence ratios and canopy array densities the response of gas transfer rate in vegetated streams as shown by the experiment data points blue markers can behave differently due to turbulence generated by bottom stress and vegetation as discussed previously fig 11 4 2 tke production as a key factor on surface gas transfer process our data suggests that turbulence generated by the canopy can be the main driver of the surface gas transfer process in vegetated streams relevant turbulence statistics e g tke and reynolds stress and tke budget terms tke production and dissipation are commonly used to represent the strength of turbulence according to our experimental results tke production is selected as the main turbulence indicator to modify the original sr model the tke production profiles presented in fig 9 capture both stem and canopy scale turbulence characteristics in each experiment in the emergent case there is an uniform distribution of the vegetative drag through the entire water column causing evenly distributed stem scale turbulence which suggests that bulk tke production pb can be used as the turbulence factor under emergent conditions for the submerged case canopy scale eddies are generated by the strong shear at the top of canopy which confines the development of stem scale eddies within the canopy region without interacting with the free surface the effect is similar to the blocking effect of stem scale vortices that prevent canopy vortices interacting with the bed nepf and vivoni 2000 this suggests that the canopy scale turbulence indicated by the prominent peak of the tke production profile dominates vertical transport above the canopy the maximum value of the streamwise averaged tke production p max is then used in the modified sr model for submerged cases to estimate pb and p max for the emergent and submerged cases respectively we used time averaged mean flow velocity u in the emergent case if the conversion rate of the mean flow to the stem scale wake generated turbulence is nearly 100 bulk tke production can be expressed as eq 14 that is proportional to u 3 raupach and shaw 1982 in the submerged case canopy scale turbulence is similar to the bed shear turbulence in open channel flows based on the definition of tke production 21 p u w u z a similar power law relation between p max and u is also expected hence pb and p max can be expressed as 22 p b c e m e u 3 p max c s u b u 3 where ceme and csub are the experimental coefficients for the emergent and the submerged cases respectively which can be functions of array roughness density ah and submergence ratio h h here the time averaged bulk velocity ub obtained from piv data is used as the mean flow velocity u in eq 22 as shown in figs 13 and 14 the experimental coefficient ceme is sensitive to array density in the emergent case while submergence ratio determines the coefficient csub in the submerged case higher coefficient ceme in the emergent case with higher array roughness density infers higher energy conversion rate from the mean flow to stem scale turbulence through the plant stems due to denser distribution of the vegetative drag causing stronger shear for the submerged case ah is not as sensitive to the experimental coefficient as the emergent case however the coefficient csub can change under different submergence ratio h h the results suggest that higher submergence ratio has higher energy conversion rate when the vegetation canopy is under shallow submergence conditions the limited depth confines the development of the large scale turbulence which makes the canopy scale vortices dominate the turbulence field causing a sharper velocity gradient at the top of the canopy compared to the deeper submergence case therefore the sharper velocity gradient can lead to a higher energy conversion rate and a larger value of the coefficient csub 4 3 modified sr model in vegetated flows 4 3 1 model derivation to derive a new modified sr model for vegetated flows we follow a similar normalization method for the general sd model in open channel flows proposed by sanjou et al 2017 the normalized sr equation can be obtained by using the characteristic shear velocity u c molecular diffusivity d kinematic viscosity of water ν tke dissipation rate ϵ and a characteristic time scale tc which can be expressed as a length scale lc divided by a velocity scale uc the expressions for the non dimensionalized parameters are shown as follows 23 k l k l u c 24 d d ν 25 t s t s t c ν ϵ 1 2 l c u c where the sr time scale ts is estimated by ν ϵ 1 2 assuming that turbulence generated by vegetation canopies can generally be described by small scale eddy motions d and ν are set as 1 8 10 5 cm2 s and 10 2 cm2 s for water temperature 20 c respectively after non dimensionalization the original sr equation eq 5 becomes 26 k l α d t s k l u c α d ν ϵ 1 2 l c ν 1 2 u c where α is the experimental coefficient that depends on the flow conditions however the equation retains two characteristic scales lc and uc which were determined by different scales of eddies in the past fortescue and pearson 1967 banerjee et al 1968 theofanous et al 1976 to develop a general form that includes the information from both large scale and small scale eddies the cross scale argument of the tke dissipation rate ϵ is then introduced in the model sanjou et al 2017 from the definition of the small eddies dissipation rate the scaling relation is given by 27 ϵ ν u c 2 l c 2 by tennekes and lumley 1972 the dissipation rate associated with large scale motions can be scaled as 28 ϵ u l e 3 l l e where ule and lle are the large scale characteristic velocity and length in the turbulence energy cascade process the dissipation rate should be constant from large eddies to small eddies 29 ν u c 2 l c 2 u l e 3 l l e u c l c u l e 3 ν l l e hence eq 26 can be rewritten as 30 k l u c α ν l l e u l e 3 1 2 ϵ 1 2 d ν 3 2 k l α u l e 1 2 l l e 1 2 ν 1 2 u c 2 u l e 2 ϵ 1 2 d ν 1 2 α l ϵ 1 2 d ν 1 2 where l is the non dimensional length scale parameter 31 l u l e 1 2 l l e 1 2 ν 1 2 u c 2 u l e 2 r e l e 1 2 u c 2 u l e 2 4 3 2 from surface to bulk flow variables based on the assumption made by sr model only molecular diffusion allows oxygen to enter the air water interface even though turbulence indirectly acts to enhance gas transfer hence traditionally the tke dissipation rate ϵ in eq 30 needs to be determined near the water surface which is difficult to measure directly in fact measuring ϵ requires high resolution piv images to solve the derivative of turbulence fluctuations which is another challenge for experiments especially when flow speed is high an alternative way to obtain ϵ is from a steady state tke budget poggi et al 2004a 32 ϵ p d d z w q where w is the vertical velocity fluctuations and q is the tke fluctuations the second term on the right hand side represents the turbulence transport flux derived from the triple correlation in the tke budget which usually can be treated as a tke diffusion term or td 33 d d z w q t d k t d 2 q d z 2 td is used to estimate the effect of reynolds stress in the mean momentum equation kt is the eddy diffusivity and can be estimated by various turbulence closure models the classical prandtl mixing length model is adopted to calculate kt 34 k t l m 2 d u d z where lm is the mixing length scale katul et al 2004 35 l m κ h 3 z h 1 κ z 2 h 3 z h 1 where κ 0 4 is the von karman constant as shown in fig 15 the maximum values occur at the top of the canopy in submerged cases while the distribution is relatively uniform throughout the whole water column in emergent cases two different canopy densities show similar td curves in all cases however since td is obtained from the second derivative of tke which is sensitive to any fluctuation of the profile it also requires high resolution of the piv images to accurately estimate its value fig 15 shows the characteristic curve of the td profile under different submergence conditions but it also shows some fluctuation errors due to sensitivity issues as a result the profile is not informative enough to solve ϵ near the surface by td with eq 32 when we treat the problem in a bulk sense td plays as the inertial forces to diffuse and transport the tke from the region where turbulence is generated toward the low turbulence locations that is to transport energy from large eddies to small eddies however the process has no effect on generating or dissipating turbulence hence in a bulk sense the problem can be narrowed down to the balance between ϵ and p which are the main dominant terms in these scenarios following the argument made by plate and friedrich 1984 that turbulence as the main factor to enhance gas transfer in open channel flow is generated through either a the work of shearing stresses on the surface due to the action of wind or b at the bed due to bottom friction and assuming that wind induced shear on the surface can be ignored the re aeration tke dissipation rate plate and friedrich 1984 can be expressed as 36 ϵ a v 1 l l e u c 2 u l e u l e 3 l l e u c 2 u l e 2 where ule 3 lle can be rewritten as the large scale characteristic tke dissipation rate ϵ cle 37 u l e 3 l l e ϵ c l e based on the argument of the bulk balance between the dissipation rate and the production ϵ c l e p c 38 ϵ a v p c u c 2 u l e 2 where pc is the bulk scale characteristic tke production in the vegetated flow depending on the canopy submergence condition replacing ϵ by pc in the previously derived non dimensionalized sr model and combining eqs 30 and 31 the final model form can be updated as 39 k l α r e l e 1 2 u c 2 u l e 2 p c 1 2 d ν 1 2 α l p c 1 2 d ν 1 2 in summary the whole non dimensional derivation in section 4 3 1 started from the traditional small eddy sr model and then linked small eddy dissipation to large eddy dissipation by scaling with large scale bulk variables ule lle thus local value of surface dissipation ϵ can be replaced by the large scale characteristic tke production the bracket terms l in eq 39 determines the constant ratio of surface small scale dissipation to the bulk scale dissipation this is based on the concept that large eddies are generated by the turbulence shear p in vegetated flows and energy is transported to small eddies near the water surface ϵ by tke diffusion td the energy ratio between surface local scale and bulk scale is determined by the non dimensional length scale l which is formed by the large scale flow reynolds number rele and the squared ratio of characteristic shear velocity u c to the large scale velocity ule 4 3 3 effects of submergence ratio eq 39 has provided a base of the modified sr model for vegetated flows the remaining challenge is to properly select each bulk variable including the bulk scale characteristic tke production pc the characteristic shear velocity u c and the large scale characteristic velocity ule and length lle as discussed in section 4 2 dominant tke production values are chosen based on different submergence conditions as well as the characteristic shear velocity see section 3 2 in the emergent case bulk tke production pb and bulk shear velocity u b eq 18 are selected for pc and u c while the time averaged bulk velocity ub and the water depth h are chosen for the large scale characteristic velocity ule and length lle respectively then the modified sr equation for the emergent case becomes 40 k l α u b 1 2 h 1 2 ν 1 2 u b 2 u b 2 p b 1 2 d ν 1 2 α l e m e p b 1 2 d ν 1 2 where 41 l e m e u b 1 2 d 1 2 ν 1 2 h 1 2 d 1 2 u b 2 u b 2 r e d 1 2 h 1 2 d 1 2 u b 2 u b 2 the above equation shows that l e m e depends on the stem scale reynolds number red the ratio of water depth to stem diameter h d and the ratio of time averaged bulk velocity to bulk shear velocity u b u b which determines the constant ratio for taking bulk scale characteristic turbulence as the indicator to predict the surface local behavior the model equation also suggests that stem scale turbulence generated by the emergent vegetation canopy does enhance the surface gas transfer rate while red h d and u b u b are three factors that determines how stem scale turbulence affects surface gas transfer rates in the submerged case the maximum value of the streamwise averaged tke production p max and the maximum streamwise averaged shear velocity u max eq 18 are chosen for pc and u c while the time averaged bulk velocity ub and the upper canopy length lup are selected for the large scale characteristic velocity ule and length lle respectively the upper canopy length lup is defined as the canopy surface gap that is directly proportional to the canopy scale vortex size mandel et al 2019 hence the modified sr equation for the submerged case is 42 k l α u b 1 2 l u p 1 2 ν 1 2 u max 2 u b 2 p max 1 2 d ν 1 2 α l s u b p max 1 2 d ν 1 2 where 43 l s u b u b 1 2 h 1 2 ν 1 2 l u p 1 2 h 1 2 u max 2 u b 2 r e h 1 2 l u p 1 2 h 1 2 u max 2 u b 2 like the emergent case eq 43 also shows that l s u b depends on the mean flow reynolds number reh the ratio of upper canopy length scale to water depth lup h and the ratio of maximum streamwise averaged shear velocity to time averaged bulk velocity u max u b it indicates that the canopy scale turbulence generated by the submerged canopy is the main factor that enhances the surface gas transfer rate kl reh u max u b and the submergence ratio that determines lup h all play a role in determining kl based on the above modified sr model fig 16 presents the fitting results of the emergent canopy case by the model which shows that turning points star signs in fig 16 occur once the stem scale reynolds number red reaches 200 since tke production is mainly generated by the wake turbulence within the emergent canopy when red 200 the wake production is relatively weak causing turbulent component of diffusion to be negligible nepf 1999 hence the coefficient α is smaller α 0 39 when red 200 the wake production is dominant within the canopy and the strong turbulent diffusion greatly enhances surface gas transfer which leads to a higher α coefficient α 1 69 the array roughness density ah is the main factor that influences the location of the turning point based on the balance between the exerted drag and the flow momentum within the canopy as ah goes higher the fitting line for red 200 is shifted toward the right due to the higher vegetative drag that reduces the flow velocity and red although with higher tke production on the other hand in the submerged case fig 17 shows that the turning points star signs in fig 17 can be found when the mean flow reynolds number reh is around 7000 compared to the critical reynolds number for transition from laminar to turbulent flow in open channel flows reh 103 trinh 2010 the critical values are in the same order this suggests that the coefficient α is related to the intermittent ejection of the shear layer eddies at the top of the canopy into the outer stream which can be analogous to turbulence boundary layer development of open channel flows trinh 2010 where the submerged canopy acts as bottom bed roughness for example fig 6 d and e show a clear difference in the velocity profile s shape between the dense case r e h 5596 7000 and the sparse case r e h 7075 7000 of submerged canopy flow by focusing on the region above the canopy the upper canopy flow is analogous to an open channel flow with a rough bottom caused by vegetation elements the profile in the dense case shows characteristics of the velocity profile in laminar open channel flows while in the sparse case the profile is close to the shape of the velocity profile in turbulent open channel flows kirkgoz and ardiclioglu 1997 which also suggests that turbulence generation mechanism changes around r e h 7000 in submerged cases when reh 7000 canopy scale tke production is not dominant in the flow and diffusion mainly comes from mechanical diffusion causing lower α coefficient α 0 13 when reh 7000 the turbulent canopy shear layer is fully developed and the canopy scale turbulence now dominates the whole diffusion process above the canopy which makes a higher α coefficient α 0 71 under submerged condition the density of the canopy is not the only factor that is sensitive to the location of the turning point instead submergence ratio h h also plays as an effective factor because it determines both the development of the canopy shear layer based on the above canopy length lup and the ratio of the canopy region drag region where plants pose drag to the flow to the free flow region when h h is higher sharper velocity gradient generated at the top of the canopy gives higher canopy scale tke production and higher ratio of the drag free flow region reduces the flow velocity even more which shifts the fitting line for reh 7000 toward the right to reach the critical value the r squared values of the fitting curves are all over 0 9 which shows that the modified sr model is in a good level of effectiveness for predicting surface gas transfer rates in vegetated flows under different array densities and submergence conditions 5 conclusions our study showed that tke production can be used as an indicator to more accurately predict surface gas transfer rates in vegetated streams by measuring the basic vegetation and flow parameters such as ah h h and u we developed a new sr model that provides superior estimates of surface gas transfer rates which are necessary for water quality management furthermore the study provides better understanding of the magnitude and causes of variation in gas transfer velocity in vegetated rivers our approach can improve the accuracy of models estimating global mass balance of gases in rivers with the presence of vegetation the model combines the information from both large scale and small scale eddies it further includes essential parameters information of the plant canopy flow to link bulk turbulence quantities to surface motions based on the experimental results we identified two critical reynolds numbers for the emergent and submerged canopy cases respectively with different slopes of the linear relation between the turbulence strength and the surface gas transfer rate which are concluded as follows if the vegetation is emergent stem scale turbulence generated by the wake vortices is the main driver to enhance the surface gas transfer process when stem scale reynolds number red 200 the stem scale turbulent diffusion is relatively weak compared to mechanical diffusion in the flow causing low enhancement of surface gas transfer however when stem scale reynolds number red 200 the wake production is dominant within the canopy and the strong turbulent diffusion greatly enhances surface gas transfer rates the array density can influence the corresponding tke production to the value of critical reynolds number based on the balance between the exerted drag and the flow momentum within the canopy higher array density results in stronger tke production to reach the critical value redc due to the higher vegetative drag that reduces the flow power if the vegetation is submerged canopy scale turbulence generated by the sharp velocity gradient on top of the canopy becomes the dominant factor that intensifies the surface gas transfer process compared to stem scale turbulence that is confined within the vegetation array the critical mean flow reynolds number rehc occurs around 7000 when reh 7000 canopy scale tke production is relatively weak and diffusion mainly comes from mechanical diffusion leading to a relatively insensitive linear relation between p max and kl when reh 7000 the fully developed turbulent canopy shear layer causes canopy scale tke production to dominate the whole diffusion process above the canopy resulting in a stronger coupling between p max and kl in addition to the array density submergence ratio h h also becomes important as it determines the development of the canopy shear layer based on the above canopy length lup and the ratio of the free flow region to the canopy region where plants pose drag to the flow higher submergence ratio h h leads to a sharper velocity gradient generated at the top of the canopy due to limited above canopy region it reduces flow power more efficiently by having a relatively larger portion of the flow experiencing vegetated drag which makes higher tke production corresponding to the critical mean flow reynolds number rehc our study provides fundamental insight on how turbulence generated by aquatic vegetation affects the surface gas transfer mechanism in stream systems with changing plant densities and submergence ratios however the gas transfer process and the flow structure become more complex in the field where organic sediments are present in natural systems such complexities include sediment transport mechanisms and biochemical effects from organic sediments interacting with vegetation and do hence more experimental studies are required to quantify such effects in the future which is the next step of this research credit authorship contribution statement
