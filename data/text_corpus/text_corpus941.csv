4705,radar estimate of precipitation is an important observation which can be used to initialize the high resolution numerical weather prediction models for improved forecast of high impact weather impact of indian doppler weather radar dwr derived precipitation rates on short range weather forecasts is studied here the present work is one of the first of its kind studies to assimilate the dwr derived rain rate into a high resolution model over indian region chennai dwr derived surface precipitation rates are included in the high resolution regional version of ncmrwf unified model ncum r through latent heat nudging to study its impact on the simulations of two convective rainfall events that occurred over east peninsular india the high resolution initial condition for ncum r is prepared using 4d var data assimilation system in which various conventional and satellite observations are used in this study two sets of numerical experiments are carried out one experiment named as control experiment cntl uses only the analysis created by 4d var and in the second lhn latent heat nudging is also performed with dwr derived precipitation rates in addition to the use of the 4d var analysis the results of the study show that the assimilation of dwr derived precipitation rates has a positive impact on the simulation of convective rainfall events the root mean square errors rmse of the analysed meteorological fields mainly the mass fields are improved in the lhn compared to cntl in both cases the error of convective available potential energy cape in the lhn analyses is considerably reduced compared to the cntl analyses for both cases the stability indices also suggested that the condition for convection is properly reproduced in the lhn analysis in both cases when evaluated against rainfall observations the amount and orientation of the main rainfall pattern showed noteworthy improvements in the lhn relative to cntl the rainfall forecasts are further verified based on the object oriented contiguous rain area cra technique the vector displacement errors and total mean square error are reduced considerably in lhn simulations compared to cntl the vertical structure and time evolution of moisture flux and moisture convergence are also well simulated in the lhn this preliminary study revealed encouraging results which shows that the assimilation of indian dwr derived rain rates in the high resolution regional nwp system can improve the forecast of convective rainfall events over indian region keywords latent heat nudging doppler weather radar precipitation estimates 4d var assimilation system ncum convective rainfall 1 introduction the indian sub continent frequently experiences heavy rainfall events due to the influence of the organized mesoscale convective systems mcss embedded in large scale synoptic systems dudhia 1989 srinivas et al 2018 mohan et al 2018 several previous studies suggested that there is an increasing trend in the frequency of occurrence as well as the intensity of high impact rainfall events over the indian region goswami et al 2006 rajeevan et al 2008 vittal et al 2013 etc the heavy rainfall events create wide spread destruction due to flash floods landslides damage to crops economy and environment accurate prediction both on spatial and temporal scale of such weather events is very essential for preparedness and disaster management recently several publications suggested that the numerical weather prediction nwp models mainly the high resolution non hydrostatic regional mesoscale models are becoming more capable to predict organized mcss embedded in large scale synoptic systems which cause heavy rainfall events in the indian region bhaskar rao and hari prasad 2005 routray et al 2005 2010a dodla and ratna 2010 etc in context of short range forecasting the high resolution mesoscale models are reasonably able to provide quantitative prediction of precipitation but struggle to maintain accurate forecasts of mcss this is mainly due to the large uncertainties from different sources like inaccurate of initial or boundary conditions not enough understanding of underlying model dynamics physics as well as non uniqueness of model variables moradkhani et al 2018 abbaszadeh et al 2019 over last two decades assimilation of observations from various platforms through advance data assimilation techniques has acquired more attention among researchers and practitioners into the nwp models to further improve the forecast skills by considering all sources of uncertainties abbaszadeh et al 2019 2020 gavahi et al 2020 the increasing accessibility of spatially and temporally dense high quality remote sensing data e g products from weather radar networks and improved data assimilation capabilities allow efficient use of these data in high resolution regional models hence it improves the model prediction of evolution location and timing of extreme events along with quantitative precipitation forecasting qpf gao et al 2004 xue et al 2003 xiao et al 2005 2007 zhao and xue 2009 routray et al 2010b govindankutty et al 2010 prasad et al 2014 osuri et al 2015 etc however there is a need to improve the model forecast skill further mainly for qpf to improve the forecast skill of the precipitation a common approach is to assimilate the variables which are directly related to the development of the precipitation therefore the assimilation of dwr derived rain rate is one of the important approaches marecal and mahfouf 2003 which can improve the vertical distribution of heating and moistening as the precipitation is not a prognostic variable various approaches have been developed to incorporate the information derived from rainfall observations into the nwp models through the modification of prognostic variables such as moisture and temperature fields over the years krishnamurti et al 1991 1993 haase et al 2000 milan et al 2008 the satellite derived precipitation is one of the primary sources of rainfall observations due to the sparse distribution of rain gauges and ground based weather radars several previous studies on assimilating satellite derived rain rate into weather models through nudging and other techniques found a positive impact on forecasting of both rainfall and dynamical fields which also reduced the model spin up problem e g falkovich et al 2000 treadon et al 2002 hou et al 2004 davolio and buzzi 2004 harrison et al 2008 bauer et al 2011 lopez 2011 etc zupanski and mesinger 1995 demonstrated the assimilation of precipitation data in regional eta forecasting model through 4d variational 4dvar data assimilation technique by simulating an extreme synoptic weather event kumar et al 2014 evaluated the impact of assimilation of precipitation retrieved rain rate from satellite on wrf model forecasts during indian summer monsoon of 2011 through 4dvar and the results are appreciably improved after the assimilation of rain rate the assimilation of precipitation estimates from weather radar data into the nwp model through nudging technique evolved over the years wang and warner 1988 wang et al 2010 continuously assimilated the precipitation rate derived from the composite reflectivity of weather radar through 1d var scheme for the simulation of a flood event occurred during 17 18 july 1996 over chicago their results clearly suggested that the assimilation of radar derived rain rate significantly improve the simulated mesoscale features of the convection system and reduce the spin up time significantly jones and macpherson 1997 assimilated the rain rate observations derived from the uk weather radars based on latent heat nudging technique manobianco et al 1994 and operationally used at uk met office regional nwp system macpherson 2001 in recent years various techniques algorithm like diabatic digital filter initialization complex cloud analysis variational data assimilation grid point statistical interpolation etc developed to assimilate the estimated quantities of rain rate into the nwp models other than latent heating nudging treadon et al 2002 xue et al 2003 hou et al 2004 hu et al 2006 weygandt et al 2008 liu et al 2008 schenkman et al 2011 wang et al 2013 sun et al 2014 li et al 2020 etc however the assimilation algorithm based on diabatic initialization is computationally efficient and practical ways to incorporate information from rain rate during pre forecast period and improve the short range forecast of precipitation sun et al 2014 the national centre for medium range weather and forecasting ncmrwf is operationally using global and regional nwp systems named as ncum based on met office unified model um systems since 2012 kumar et al 2018 the recent study by dutta et al 2019 examined the impact of assimilation of radial velocity from various indian dwrs for the simulation of three convective rainfall events over indian monsoon region using the high resolution regional ncum ncum r with a 3dvar data assimilation system this study showed the improved forecast skill of the model with the use of dwr radial winds however there is no study reported on the assimilation of the dwr derived rain rates in the ncum r system as well as other models over indian region the present research work is a first of its kind study over the indian region to assimilate the rain rates derived from dwr data into a high resolution 4 km regional model and analyzed its impact on simulation prediction of the convective rainfall events india installed several dwrs along its coast and other parts of the country currently ncmrwf has developed capability to assimilate the dwr radial velocity observations into the operational high resolution ncum r 4dvar data assimilation system despite progress in data assimilation methods for better analysis however assimilation of atmospheric hydrometeor content or precipitation rate from dwr reflectivity still remains a challenge the current study is an important component of the feasibility analysis that is undertaken to provide the required demonstration of the value of assimilating of estimated rain rate from dwr reflectivity for improving the forecast skill of ncum r model on simulation of convective heavy rainfall events this preliminary study gives way forward to assimilate the rain rate into the operational suite to further improve the short range forecast of convective weather systems the synoptic conditions prevailed during the rainfall events are provided in section 2 while a brief description of the radar rain rate data is provided in section 3 the latent heat nudging scheme used in the ncum r is concisely described in section 4 the modeling system and numerical experiment are presented in section 5 the various statistical skill scores used in the study to evaluate the model simulated results are presented in the methodology section section 6 whereas the results and discussion are provided in section 7 finally the conclusions drawn from the present study is given in section 8 2 synoptic conditions associated with rainfall events 2 1 case 1 26 28 september 2017 the withdrawal of south west monsoon during 2017 was delayed by nearly three weeks and the withdrawal started from northwest india during end of september there was a western disturbance wd presented over north pakistan and surroundings between 3 1 and 5 8 km above mean sea level msl on 26th september during 26th 27th september an upper cyclonic circulation was formed over andhra pradesh coast and adjoining south odisha which was extending from 4 5 to7 6 km above msl and tilting southwestwards with height during the same period a cyclonic circulation was noticed over andaman sea and adjoining areas this weather condition was attributed to the presence of east west wind shear zone from west central bay to southwest arabian sea across north tamil nadu and south interior karnataka during the period 26th 27th september the nungambakkam 13 06 n 80 24 e rain gauge station observed light to heavy rainfall 3 4 to 10 8 cm over chennai region the convective cloud bands along the tamil nadu coast and also over chennai region is clearly noticed in insat 3d cloud imagery fig 1 a the radar reflectivity dbz from chennai dwr station is depicted in fig 1b which shows strong reflectivity around 15 30 dbz along the tamil nadu coast and more than 40 dbz over oceanic region the values of convective available potential energy cape 1360 jkg 1 convective inhibition cin 24 5jkg 1 and lifted index li 2 86 observed at 00 utc 26th september http weather uwyo edu upperair sounding html station no 43279 clearly suggests high possibility of convective activity over the chennai region the atmospheric stability indices are more favorable for rainfall over chennai region during 27th and 28th september 2 2 case 2 04 06 november 2017 a low pressure area formed over south west bay of bengal and adjoining sri lanka as well as tamil nadu coast with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to 3 1 km above msl on 03rd november the low pressure became a trough of low at lower level over tamil nadu and adjoining south andhra pradesh coast from 04th to 06th november it embedded with a cyclonic circulation over gulf of mannar and neighbourhood extending up to 0 9 to 1 5 km above sea level the rainfall occurred due to thunderstorm activities over most places of tamil nadu and chennai regions as well as puducherry during 05th and 06th november heavy rainfall was occurred at isolated places over kerala coastal andhra pradesh and rayalaseema during this period over chennai the observed values of cape 1716 jkg 1 cin 0 08 jkg 1 and li 4 57 at 12 utc of 05th november is higher than the value of the same indices 851 jkg 1 27 jkg 1 and 2 41 respectively at 00 utc of 05th november is noticed similarly the value of cape 1494 jkg 1 cin 2 45 jkg 1 and li 3 18 is more in the 12 utc than the 00 utc of 06th november 492 jkg 1 36 jkg 1 and 2 35 respectively it is clearly presumed that the rainfall activities occurred due to the convective processes over the chennai region during this period the insat 3d cloud imagery fig 1c shows the convective cloud bands over chennai and adjoining regions figure 1b depicted also wide spread strong reflectivity echoes about 35 45 dbz over chennai and surrounding regions 3 radar derived rain rate data the use of radar data in both meteorological and hydrological applications has been limited by errors and uncertainties in its surface precipitation estimates such large errors are due to both meteorological variations in the reflectivity rainfall relationship beam attenuation and presence of bright band and non meteorological factors beam blockage range limitations poor calibration beam widening and beam filling therefore estimating surface precipitation rates from dwr observations is a complex and challenging task in this study we used chennai dwr fig 1 lat 13 08 n and lon 80 27 e data to derive the rain rate for lhn the dwr observations are received at 500 500 m spatial and 15 min temporal resolution the brief specification of the dwr chennai is provided here viz s band wavelength 10 cm station altitude 35 m horizontal beam width 0 99 deg pulse width 0 5 μs pulse repetition frequency 450 600 low high and range 250 km the first level of quality control qc is performed on the raw dwr observations at radar site including the removal of ground clutter by applying discrete filtering techniques sachidananda and zrnic 2000 bhowmik et al 2011 after removal of clutters the second level of qc is done at ncmrwf on the basis of static and dynamic quality index qi maps developed by amarjyothi et al 2017 the dwr reflectivity qi is calculated by considering the factors such as beam broadening beam shielding attenuation and bright band the cited study amarjyothi et al 2017 used good quality reflectivity data i e without the regions of blockage more attenuation caused by rain and beam broadening the details of the qc check and pre processing of the dwr observations is available at amarjyothi et al 2017 and dutta et al 2019 the qi scheme is employed further in the calculation of precipitation rate the region for generation of rain rate is not considered when the threshold of qi is less than 0 3 good quality reflectivity data is only used to calculate the precipitation rate by using the z r relationship z 267r1 345 proposed by suresh et al 2005 for chennai dwr station amudha et al 2014 compared the rain rate data with rain gauge observations from 16 stations located within 100 km range of the radar during the period 2006 2010 and found that the z r relationship by suresh et al 2005 has produced the best match with the observations 4 latent heat nudging scheme a complicated life cycle is evolved with each precipitation constituent from the creation of cloud droplets up to the reach at the ground many of which related with latent heating a variety of process occurs such as condensation and freezing release latent heat and evaporation and melting absorb energy from the surrounding environment the amount of energy release or draw during the phase change is known as specific enthalpy therefore the vertically integrated of latent heating rate in an atmospheric column is directly proportional to the net precipitation rate the latent heat nudging scheme is based on the above mentioned basic assumption which make things easier by converting the four dimensional complexity to a one dimensional problem hence the scheme efficient enough for operational use by reducing computing requirement jones and macpherson 1997 stephan et al 2008 dixon et al 2009 the main aspect of the latent heat nudging scheme is to correct the model s vertical latent heating profile at every time step and grid point through a factor derived from the ratio of observed rain rate and model estimated precipitation rate at the surface the addition of diagnosed latent heating is suitably enhanced or suppressed the diabatic heating term in the thermodynamic equation of the nwp model in turns it will bring an adjustment in the model s vertical velocity field and divergent circulation which lead to the model rain rate closer to the observed rate it is expected that this realistic rain rate is obtained through the proper establishment of a dynamical storm structure that is closer to reality subsequently this structure will improve the forecast skill of the model the spatial distribution of surface observed rain rate provides information regarding the locations and estimated amount of the absorbed or released of latent heating but the primary issue in the latent heat nudging scheme is the vertical distribution of the heating that is not known in this study we used model profile instead of idealized heating profiles jones and macpherson 1997 stephan et al 2008 dixon et al 2009 assuming that the model has correct vertical structure as well as vertical partitioning which is scaled by a factor of observed and model precipitation rate the major advantage is that it ensures consistency with parameterization scheme of the model and permits evolution of the profile with time during the model integration the basic principle of the latent heat nudging scheme is to calculate the latent heating profile from the model physics step and derive increments to the potential temperature the model profiles are computed by considering the condensational heating within the physics step this condensational heating comes from the large scale condensation and the convection scheme the moisture variable i e total water in the ncum r model is partitioned into specific humidity cloud ice and cloud liquid water through the cloud scheme the latent heating is calculated through phase changes of these parameters due to large scale and convection processes the total model latent heating rate δθlhm is the sum of the heating rates from the large scale condensation and the convection process the decision tree or schematic diagram illustrates the steps followed by the latent heat nudging scheme at each grid point in fig 2 4 1 calculation of potential temperature increments the latent heat nudging scheme is based on a newtonian relaxation nudging technique which forces the nwp model towards the observed rain rates the scheme uses latent heating profiles from the model physics step and provide potential temperature as well as moisture increments the potential temperature increments are calculated based on the scaling of the model latent heating profiles by the ratio of the analysed rain rate and model rain rate the prana is the analysed precipitation rate i e a weighted combination of the observed rain rate and the model generated rain rate background or first guess value 1 p r ana α p r dwr 1 α p r mod e l where prdwr is the radar derived rain rate and prmodel model derived precipitation rate α is the weighting function depending on spatial distance to the radar the observations are weighted via α based on their distance from the radar site with closer range observations bearing larger weight and vice versa the latent heat nudging s potential temperature increments i e δ θ lh which added to the model prognostic potential temperature field at the end of the time step it can be determined from the model latent heating tendencies δθlhm radar derived precipitation rate prdwr and model estimated surface rain rate prmodel the equation eq 2 looks like as given below 2 δ θ lh f 1 δ θ lhm f pr ana pr model the f i e scaling factor is restricted when a large inconsistencies between radar derived surface precipitation rate and model derived rain rate so that there is no excessive heat added or remove from the model at a grid point where the model has rain prmodel 0 but the observation has none prdwr 0 it suggested that model has convective heating increments in the grid point due to the presence of bogus convective precipitations in this case we set a factor 0 5 dixon et al 2009 jacques et al 2018 which ensures that not too much latent heating is removed from the model but scaling down the model profiles to the given factor hence it prevents the model to develop spurious grid point storms the latent heat nudging scheme reduced the heating profile of the model fig 2 furthermore the observation has rain prdwr 0 but the model has no rain prmodel 0 or very less amount of rain the scheme does not immediately reject or scale the profile at this particular grid point in this scenario the latent heat nudging scheme applies a search algorithm based on manobianco et al 1994 stephan et al 2008 and dixon et al 2009 the search performs at the adjacent grid points 18 nearby grid points considered for search and uses a profile from the one which has enough precipitation the profile from that point is used to scale according to the observed rain rate at the model grid point the calculated increment of potential temperature is incorporated at the desired grid point if the search is unsuccessful i e not enough precipitation nearby grid points then a reduced scaling is applied on that grid point when the search algorithm finds no rain nearby grid points the observation is ignored if the observed and model rain rates are available at the grid point the model latent heat rate is scaled with upper and lower limits of the scaling factor i e 2 and 0 5 the details of the possible ranges of the ratio of observed and modeled precipitation rates scaling factor and profiles to scale are given in table 1 the major advantage of this approach is that the dwr derived rain rate can be used to force the model at the particular grid points where the model is not able to perfectly simulate precipitation rate finally a recursive filter purser and mcquigg 1982 is applied to smooth the increments before adding them to the model temperature field the filter is essential to control the numerical noise of the model the more details about the latent heat nudging scheme can be found in manobianco et al 1994 jones and macpherson 1997 haase et al 2000 leuenberger and rossa 2003 stephan et al 2008 dixon et al 2009 etc the rain rate analyses are performed on a 2 km grid resolution using spatial averaging and conversion from polar to cartesian co ordinates archibald and smith 1997 many previous studies jones and macpherson 1997 macpherson 2001 dixon et al 2009 stephan et al 2008 suggest that a better approximation of the rain rate can be found within the range of 100 km from the dwr location hence the importance of the radar data similarly the detection and accuracy of the precipitation reduces with increase in range and hence the weight α provided to radar data is gradually decreased kitchen and jackson 1993 jones and macpherson 1997 macpherson 2001 etc the small weight to the observations is provided at longer range for smooth transition to the region outside dwr range it is especially performed to avoid unwanted temperature gradients around dwr range after the addition of latent heat increment it is worth to mention that the errors associated with the estimated rain rate are also significant which can influence the forecast skill of the model chang and holt 1994 conducted several sensitivity experiments by considering the different types of vertical heating profiles more frequent data assimilation cut off windows data time lags and prescribed systematic errors the study was found that the positive impact of the rain rate in the model forecast is quite sensitive to the spatial distribution locations than the magnitude of the estimated rain rate turpeinen et al 1990 manobianco et al 1994 the sensitive work in which deliberately introduced errors into the rain rate is beyond the scope of the present study 5 modeling system and numerical experiment the state of the art high resolution ncum r modeling system is used for operational nwp at ncmrwf the prognostic model variables are wind components u v and w potential temperature exner pressure density and three components of moisture such as cloud ice cloud water and water vapour theexnerfunction is a non dimensionalizedpressure where p0 is a standard reference surfacepressure usually considered as 1000 hpa davies et al 2005 the ncum r modeling system is a seamless prediction system which can be used across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales with same dynamical core and physical parameterization schemes the ncum r has a rotated grid structure with arakawa c horizontal grid staggering to solve the compressible non hydrostatic equations of motion vertical staggering charney and phillips 1953 and terrain following hybrid height vertical coordinate the semi implicit semi lagrangian and predictor corrector time integration numerical scheme which solve the deep atmosphere dynamics are used in the ncum r forecasting system cullen et al 1997 davies et al 2005 the details of the ncum r forecast model can be found from routray et al 2017 jayakumar et al 2017 and dutta et al 2019 the high resolution 3 hourly cycling 4d var analysis system of ncum r is based on the incremental approach courtier et al 1994 the 4d var scheme runs with one outer loop of a non linear model which gives linearization states and first guess fields for the computation of the increments of the model variables the forecast from the previous cyclic is considered as background state to add the increments the 4d var analysis system used a linear perturbation forecast pf model with a lower grid spacing 8 km usually the pf model has a lower grid spacing than the forecast model to generate time varying increments over the assimilation window ballard et al 2016 the perturbation forecast model includes a generalized conjugate residual gcr eisenstat et al 1983 solver with limited physics for computational affordability the details of the incremental 4d var analysis system can be found from rawlins et al 2007 ballard et al 2016 and li et al 2018 the ncum r um version 10 8 with 4d var data assimilation da system is used in the current study the regional ncum model configured over the indian domain 5 s 40 n and 65 102 e with horizontal resolution of 4 km 1000 1000 pts and 80 vertical sigma levels up to a height of 38 5 km the model domain is depicted in fig 1e two sets of numerical experiments are carried out to test the sensitivity of latent heat nudging scheme the first experiment cntl assimilates only conventional and satellite observations using incremental 4d var da system the second experiment lhn assimilates the dwr derived rain rates using latent heat nudging after the 4d var assimilation scheme both numerical experiments uses 3 hourly update cycles in this process the 03 h forecast from the previous cycle served as the first guess for the next cycle hence a total of eight assimilation cycles are performed per day which produces analysis at every 3 h interval additionally latent heat nudging is performed at every assimilation cycle in the lhn fig 3 illustrates a schematic diagram of three hourly 4d var da cycle along with lhn used in this particular study the global ncum 17 km resolution forecast fields are used as boundary conditions for ncum r after interpolated onto the regional model grid the num r model is integrated up to 76 h in both experiments from the initial time 00 utc of 26 september 2017 case 1 and 04 november 2017 case 2 the dwr derived rain rate observations used in 3 hrly assimilation cyclic total 8 are depicted in fig 4 the details of the model configuration along with physical parameterization schemes selected for this particular study are provided in table 2 6 methodology we evaluated the model simulated precipitation using various statistical skill scores such as equitable threat score ets prefigurance score and false alarm ratio far the skill scores are calculated against three hourly accumulated dwr derived rainfall over the region 11 15 n and 78 83 e these skill scores are generally used for diagnostic and scientific verification of weather forecasts the forecast verification is a method to assess the quality of a forecast for this purpose define a 2 2 contingency table mason 2003 as given below ab cd hitsfalsealarms missescorrectnegatives a total number of correct forecasts occurred i e forecast and observed occurrence b number of incorrect forecasts occurrence i e forecast occurrence but observed non occurrence c number of incorrect forecasts of non occurrence i e forecast non occurrence but observed occurrence d number of

a a r a c b a r where hits random ar a b a c n the ets value equal to unity indicates ideal forecast and 0 means forecast has no skill the ets value higher or lower than 1 suggest that the model over or under predicted the rainfall the mathematical expression of the prefigurance score and false alarms far is given below prefigurance score a a c and far b a b the prefigurance score is sensitive to missed events and hits but not to false alarms correspondingly the far is a function of false alarms and hits only not sensitive to missed events the skill scores range from 0 to 1 with 1 representing a perfect forecast for prefigurance score and 0 is the perfect score for far the details about the scores can be found in world meteorological organization wmo report 2014 the object oriented contiguous rain area cra method i e also called entity based or feature based methods ebert and mcbride 2000 ebert and gallus 2009 dutta et al 2019 is considered for further verification of rainfall forecasts to evaluate the impact of the assimilation of the rain rate in the model forecasts the cra method is to objectively compare the properties of matched forecast and observed rainfall patterns the cra method evolves with two steps in first step the cra method is defined as two contiguous areas entities i e observed and simulated precipitation enclosed within a user specified isohyets rain rate contour the next step is to determine a best match between the observed and forecast entities in this step the model simulated rainfall pattern horizontally translated over the observed field and rotated around the centroid of the observed entity until the best match is obtained the best match of the two entities is obtained from various ways such as minimizing the total squared error maximizing the overlap of the two entities maximizing the correlation coefficient and overlaying the centres of gravity of the two entities these statistics are calculated over a domain by considering all grid points available in the forecast and observed entities before and after translation the location errors are quite similar from all the best match methods when the forecast pattern well matches with the observations ebert and gallus 2009 nevertheless the forecasts do not behaved well all times means forecast do not matched properly with the observations it is required to experiment with the different best matching methods to find out which one of the methods provides the most intuitively results for the particular forecast application being evaluates in this study the location error is determined through pattern matching of the two rain entity this cra method verifies the displacement intensity volume spatial pattern size shape and other attributes of the feature here

msevolume 7 results and discussion 7 1 improvement in model initial condition we first examine how the initial conditions provided to the ncum r model vary among experiments with inclusion of dwr derived rain rate observations through latent heat nudging therefore in this section we present the comparison of the cntl analysis and the lhn analysis after inclusion of rain rate observations through latent heat nudging i e lhn experiment the spatial distribution of analysis increment lhn minus cntl analyses for the meteorological variables such as zonal wind u m s meridional wind v m s potential temperature θ k and water vapor mixing ratio q g kg at different pressure levels 850 500 and 300 hpa for case 1 valid at 00 utc 26th september 2017 is depicted in fig 5 a c d f g i and j l respectively from the figure the positive increments are prominently seen at and around the chennai dwr station for all the variables at different pressure levels after assimilation nudging of the precipitation rate the u component fig 5a c and v component fig 5d f of wind increments are higher in the lower troposphere and there is an increased area at higher atmosphere fig 5c similarly the increments in potential temperature fig 5g i are higher in the lower atmosphere and decrease progressively with height it is a well known fact that the potential temperature decreases with height when the atmosphere is unstable i e convective atmosphere hence the convection is properly represented in the lhn analyses after inclusion of rain rate the maximum increment of water vapour mixing ratio fig 5j l is noticed in the mid troposphere and low values in the upper atmosphere also we observed from fig 5 that there is a dipole structure in the analysis increments which can be attributed to balance due to conservation of mass and energy the root mean square error rmse of the meteorological variables and gain in skill of the lhn analysis and cntl analysis against chennai radiosonde is depicted in fig 6 a and b for case 1 and case 2 respectively for calculation of rmse all the levels are used together and for the skill is the improvement of lhn over cntl i e cntl lhn cntl 100 from the figure we deduce that in both cases the rmse of all variables are reduced after assimilation of precipitation rate compared to the cntl analysis the gain in skill of the lhn analysis compared to cntl ranging from 35 to 51 in case 1and 18 to 32 in case 2 it is evident from the figure that the maximum improvements are found in the mass variables after assimilation of the rain rate less gain visible in the zonal and meridonial wind fields in both cases the skew t log p diagram at the location chennai from observation cntl and lhn analyses at model initial time of case 1 and case 2 valid at 00 utc 26 september and 05 november 2017 is depicted in fig 7 a c and d f respectively in case 1 the observed skew t fig 7a indicates that the level of free convection lfc starts at around 850 hpa and extended up to 150 hpa equilibrium level el the maximum positive cape is noticed within 600 to 350 hpa pressure levels the observed cape and cin are 1360 jkg 1 and 24 5 jkg 1 respectively the fig 7c lhn shows that the atmosphere is more unstable as the positive cape starts from 870 hpa lfc extended up to 196 hpa el while the cntl analysis fig 6b shows the lfc at 828 hpa and el at 203 hpa the cape cin values are higher lower in lhn analysis 1002 jkg 1 31 jkg 1 as compared to the cntl analysis 826 jkg 1 26 jkg 1 respectively similarly the value of cape 261jkg 1 is higher in the lhn analysis fig 7f than the cntl analysis 149 jkg 1 fig 7e in case 2 however the value of cin 6 33 jkg 1 remains the same in both the analyses the observed cape cin are about 851 jkg 1 27jkg 1 for case 2 in both cases the cape values are reasonably well reproduced in the lhn analyses compared to the observations the error of cape from lhn analysis is reduced by 74 case 1 and 31 case 2 compared to the cntl analysis 61 and 18 respectively in both cases the figures clearly indicate that the reduced errors due to latent heat nudging scheme favorable conditions for the convection are better reproduced in the lhn analyses after assimilation of dwr derived precipitation rates compared to cntl analysis the latitudinal averaged 11 to 150n pressure longitude cross section of moisture transport scalar product of specific humidity and wind magnitude at model initial time from cntl and lhn analyses of both cases is depicted in fig 8 the model analyses are compared with the high resolution european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era5 data sets hersbach et al 2020 in case 1 strong magnitude of moisture flux around 80 120 gkg 1 ms 1 spread over the continental area 78 800e at lower level of the atmosphere is noticed in the era5 reanalysis fig 8a similar distribution of moisture flux is also noticed in both analyses however the magnitude of the moisture is higher about flux 10 20 gkg 1 ms 1 in the lhn analysis fig 8c than the cntl analysis fig 8b over the region the feature is missing in the cntl analysis over the region both the analyses are showing high values of moisture flux over the oceanic region than the era5 while the magnitude of the moisture flux is reduced in the lhn analysis after the assimilation of the rain rate similarly for case 2 the spatial orientation of the moisture transport and magnitude is better represented in the lhn analysis fig 8f especially over 79 800e than the cntl analysis fig 8e the features are also well matched with the era5 reanalysis fig 8d it is clear that assimilation of the dwr derived rain rate via latent heat nudging scheme has improved the moisture transport low level wind and specific humidity in the analyses 7 2 impact in model forecasts the 24 h accumulated rainfall obtained from the cntl and lhn simulations of case 1 valid at 03 utc 27 september 2017 day 1 and the corresponding imd ncmrwf merged satellite rain gauge nmsg data mitra et al 2003 2009 as well as dwr derived rainfall are depicted in fig 9 a d the observations from the nmsg fig 9a and dwr derived rainfall fig 9b clearly indicate wide spread convective rainfall bands over chennai and surrounding oceanic regions it is noticed that the spatial distribution of rainfall over the land from the cntl fig 9c is totally shifted north eastward as compared to the observations moreover the cntl run could not reproduce the extensive rainfall over the oceanic regions and coastal regions of tamil nadu it is necessary to mention that the lhn fig 9d is considerably improved and better reproduce the orientation of rainfall pattern and amount after the assimilation of the derived rain rate in order to examine the impact of the assimilation of rain rate on the simulation of precipitation associated with the convective system ets at different forecast hours with various rainfall thresholds 2 mm and 10 mm from cntl and lhn experiments are calculated the ets along with gain skill score of lhn with respect to cntl at different forecast hours with 2 mm and 10 mm rainfall thresholds from both the experiments for case 1 and case 2 are depicted in fig 10 a b and c d respectively it is clearly seen from the figure that the assimilation of the dwr derived precipitation rate has positive impact on the simulation of the rainfall all throughout the forecast hours at various thresholds the ets values gradually decrease with the increase of the forecast lengths in both cases and for both thresholds the ets values are higher in the lhn than the cntl over the whole forecast however ets values from both simulations in all cases are close to each other after 15 h forecast the ets values are higher for the lower rainfall threshold 2 mm as compared to the ets values obtained from the higher rainfall threshold 10 mm in both experiments for both the cases the percentage improvement of lhn simulation with respect to the cntl simulation is better in all cases for both the thresholds the forecast skill is slowly decreased with the increase of the forecast lead time in both cases the averaged percentage of error from the 2 mm 10 mm rainfall thresholds is considerably reduced in the lhn simulation over cntl simulation by 29 5 34 and 12 19 for case 1 and case 2 respectively the gain in skill of lhn over cntl is higher in higher threshold 10 mm of rainfall than the lower rainfall threshold 2 mm in both cases it is inferred that high amount of rainfall is better simulated by the model after the assimilation nudging of the dwr derived precipitation rate than the cntl simulation the results clearly show beneficial impact of the assimilation of the rain rate up to the forecast lead time of 15 h and reduced afterward many previous studies such as lin et al 1996 jones and macpherson 1997 macpherson 2001 etc showed that the benefit of the assimilation of derived rain rate in the model for precipitation forecast sustained only for the first few hours mainly up to 12 15 h of the forecast the findings of the study in the precipitation simulation support the other previous studies as the maximum skill is observed up to 15 h forecast we also computed the prefigurance score and false alarm ratio far at various thresholds of rainfall mm for both cases the prefigurance score and far along with percentage of improvement line of day 1 for both cases are depicted in fig 11 a b and fig 12 a b respectively from both cases it is noticed that the prefigurance score fig 11a b is improved at all thresholds after assimilation of rainfall through latent heat nudging however the score progressively gets smaller with higher thresholds of rainfall in all cases the lhn simulations show more skill of improvement at higher rainfall thresholds compared to cntl simulations in both cases it inferred that the high amount of rainfall is better simulated in the lhn than cntl in both cases the mean skill of lhn is high about 36 and 26 over cntl in both cases respectively similarly far score fig 12a b is better simulated in lhn at all rainfall thresholds compared to cntl the far scores gradually increase with increase of rainfall thresholds in all simulations for both cases however in comparison to cntl simulations the far scores are lower in the lhn simulations at all rainfall thresholds in both cases indeed the rainfall skill is appreciably improved after assimilation of precipitation rates from the figure of improvement is clearly seen in lhn simulations at different thresholds with respect to cntl simulations the averaged skill of lhn is about 40 and 31 with respect to cntl simulation in case 1 and case 2 respectively overall the statistical skill scores ets prefigurance score and far demonstrate better skills in both cases on prediction of amount and location of rainfall after nudging the dwr derived precipitation rates into the high resolution regional model the mse along with vector displacement error line as well as of errors contribution from different components of mse at 10 mm rainfall threshold for day 1 simulation of case 1 and case 2 are illustrated in fig 13 a b and c d respectively from the figure fig 13a c it can be noticed that the mse is lower than the lhn simulations in both cases as compared to the cntl it can be inferred that the location intensity and pattern of the simulated precipitation entities are better matched with the observation after the assimilation of rain rate in the model compared to cntl the mse is reduced by about 12 10 in the lhn simulations for case 1 case 2 with respect to cntl simulation the vector displacement error is derived through pattern matching the simulated field is horizontally transformed over the observation until the best match is achieved the vector displacement basically became the location error of the forecast the figure fig 13a c line clearly shows that the vector displacement errors are reduced in the lhn simulations compared to the cntl simulations in both cases the rainfall distribution is more realistic in the lhn than the cntl the vector displacement errors are reduced by 39 and 21 in the lhn simulation over cntl simulations in case 1 and case 2 respectively the percentage error from the individual components i e location volume and pattern of mse for both cases is depicted in fig 13c and d respectively it is observed that the volume error of the precipitation is higher in the lhn simulations for both cases than the cntl on the other hand the percentage of contribution due to the displacement and pattern error is relatively less than the volume error in both cases this suggests that the intensity of the rainfall is more in the lhn simulations than cntl and more closer when compared with the observations the other errors such as those from the displacement and pattern components are considerably reduced in the lhn simulations in both cases however the overall mse in case 1 and case 2 is less in the lhn experiment compared to the cntl fig 13a and c furthermore the performance of the lhn simulation is evaluated by analyzing the mesoscale characteristics embedded with the convective system the time pressure vertical cross section of moisture transport from era5 reanalyses cntl and lhn simulations at chennai location for case 1 and case 2 is presented in fig 14 a c and d f respectively in era5 fig 14a three patches of high magnitude of low level moisture fluxes 100 g kg 1 m s 1 are observed at lower levels during 00 06 utc of 26th 18 utc of 26th to 00 utc 27th and 18 utc of 27th to 00 utc 28th september 2017 these features are reasonably well characterized in both the simulations fig 14b and c however era5 shows the presence of the low level moisture fluxes between 18 utc of 26th to 00 utc 27th which is well simulated by the cntl fig 14b at 6 h earlier i e 12 18 utc of 26th this feature is well brought out mainly corrected the time lag in the lhn simulation fig 14c after the assimilation of rain rate also the vertical extend of the moisture fluxes in the lhn simulation matches well with the era5 reanalyses fig 14a most of the forecast hours similarly in case 2 the era5 fig 14d shows high magnitude of low level moisture fluxes up to 850 hpa the long duration up to 12 utc of 5th and also at 00 utc of 6th high magnitude of low level moisture fluxes are simulated by the lhn fig 14f while in the cntl fig 13e the pattern is well simulated only up to 06 utc of 6th november 2017 the pattern of the low level moisture fluxes is well characterized in the lhn simulation than the cntl the vertical extend of the moisture transport is also reasonably well characterized in the lhn simulation and is comparable with the pattern from the era5 reanalysis the time pressure vertical cross section of horizontal advection of vorticity mohanty et al 2013 from era5 reanalyses cntl and lhn simulations at chennai location for case 1 during the period 00 utc of 26 to 28 september 2017 is illustrated in fig 15 a c respectively particularly the vorticity advection is an indicative of rising motion at the surface during the convective activities in era5 fig 15a two patches of positive advection of vorticity 20 10 5s 1 at lower levels are presented which is extended up to the upper atmosphere during the period 18 utc of 26th to 03 utc of 27th and 13 utc of 27th to 00 utc of 28th september 2017 the presence of the low level positive advection of vorticity during 18 utc of 26th to 03 utc 27th in era5 is simulated by the cntl experiment fig 15b with 6 h of time lag i e 12 18 utc 26th it is also found that the high magnitude of positive vorticity advection is simulated by the cntl fig 15b at 00 utc as well as in the period between 06 utc and 12 utc of 26th and 27th of september 2017 which are not replicated in the era5 reanalyses fig 15a the time evolution of advection of vorticity is considerably well represented in the lhn experiment fig 15c after the assimilation of the dwr rain rate in comparison to cntl the cntl simulation is showing strong convective updraft from lower levels throughout the forecast hours which is not reproduced in the era5 reanalyses the vorticity advection is slightly better characterized in the lhn simulation as compared to the cntl the regions of high moisture flux fig 14a c are often co located with regions of positive advection of vorticity fig 15a c the time pressure vertical cross section of moisture convergence 10 4 g kg 1s 1 from era5 reanalyses cntl and lhn simulations at chennai location for case 2 during the period 00 utc of 05 to 07 november 2017 is depicted in fig 15d f respectively era5 has a clear signal of continuous low level moisture convergence throughout the period of study fig 15d the simulated moisture convergence from cntl fig 15e at lower level is not continuous like the pattern seen in the era5 however the simulated pattern of low level moisture convergence quite improves in the lhn fig 15f we further analysed the performance of the assimilation of the rain rate through latent heat nudging by calculating the cape and cin for both cases and is provided in table 3 from table 3 it can be seen that the observed cape cin values are increased decreased during 00 to 12 utc of 27th september case 1 and 06th november 2017 case 2 it is deduced that the convective activities are stronger during the periods of simulations in both cases it is noticed that the observed values of cape cin are lower higher during 28th september case 1 and 07th november 2017 case 2 compared to values observed in the earlier hours it can be inferred that cape has been used in the evolution of the convective system this pattern is well simulated by both experiments in all the cases however the indices are considerably improved in the lhn simulation it is evident that the convective activity is better represented in the lhn simulation than the cntl simulation 8 summary and conclusions the present study evaluates the impact of the assimilation nudging of rain rate derived from dwr chennai through latent heat nudging method we use the ncum r forecast system to simulate two precipitation events over tamil nadu region two sets of numerical experiments are carried out cntl assimilating all observations using 4d var and lhn assimilating all observations using 4d var systems and radar rain rate nudging to ncum r the major conclusions drawn from the study are given below the spatial distribution of analysis increments of meteorological variables wind and mass fields at different pressure levels clearly deduced that the assimilation of rain rate along with other observations has improved the model initial conditions the convection is properly represented in the lhn initial conditions after the latent heat nudging of rain rate the rmse of wind and mass fields at model initial time are considerably improved in the lhn experiment compared to cntl in both cases it is also manifested from the rmse that the maximum improvements are noticed in the mass variables after assimilation of the precipitation rate we notice less improvement in the wind fields for both cases the skew t plot shows that the atmosphere is more unstable in the lhn experiment as the depth of the convective instability is higher compared to cntl in both cases we show that the cape cin values are higher lower in the lhn simulation compared to the cntl one and are closer to the observed values of cape cin in all cases the error of cape from lhn analysis is considerably reduced compared to the cntl analysis in both cases the stability indices show that the convection is properly reproduced in the lhn and is reasonably better matched with the observed indices the magnitude and spatial distribution pattern of the moisture flux from lhn analysis are reasonably well matched with the era5 the strength of the moisture flux over land is less in the cntl in both cases the high values of moisture flux over the oceanic region are noticed both in the analyses from cntl as well as in the one from lhn however the magnitude of moisture flux is reduced after latent heat nudging is performed i e lhn analysis and comparable with the era5 reanalyses it is clear that use of the dwr derived rain rate has improved the model initial conditions cntl simulation could not reproduce the extensive rainfall over the land costal and oceanic regions however lhn experiment is considerably improved the forecast and is able to reproduce the orientation of rainfall pattern and amount the features in lhn simulations are reasonably well correlated with both the observations nmsg and dwr derived rainfall the ets at different forecast hours with two rainfall thresholds 2 mm and 10 mm for both cases is improved in the lhn compared to cntl however ets values are slowly decreased along with the increase of forecast lengths in both cases and both thresholds the mean of error is reduced in lhn compared to cntl with different rainfall thresholds in both cases it is also noticed that the more positive impact of the assimilation of rain rate sustained up to the forecast range of 15 h and reduced afterward the result of the study is well matched with the findings of other previous studies lin et al 1996 jones and macpherson 1997 macpherson 2001 etc the prefigurance score and far at various rainfall thresholds are also improved in the lhn simulations compared to cntl simulations in both cases overall the statistical skill scores ets prefigurance score and far exhibit enhanced skills in both cases on prediction of amount and location of rainfall after nudging the dwr derived precipitation rates into the high resolution regional model we showed that the total mse obtained through object oriented cra method is lower in lhn than in cntl we deduced that the location intensity and pattern of the simulated precipitation entities are reasonably matches with the observation after assimilation of rain rate the vector displacement errors total mse are reduced by 39 12 and 21 10 in the lhn over cntl for case 1 and case 2 respectively we showed that the intensity of the rainfall is higher in the lhn simulations compared to the observations even though the errors from the displacement and pattern components are considerably reduced in the lhn over cntl simulations in both cases the time evolution of the moisture fluxes are well simulated by the lhn experiment as compared to the cntl experiment throughout the forecast period the vertical extend of the moisture transport is also reasonably well characterized in the lhn simulation the features are also well matched with the era5 reanalyses in both cases similarly the time evolution and vertical extent of horizontal advection of vorticity and moisture convergence are better represented in the lhn experiment the present work is an initial assessment for utilizing indian dwr derived precipitation rate for improving the high resolution ncum r forecasts results of this study strongly indicate that the assimilation of indian dwr derived rain estimates in the high resolution regional modeling frame work will help to improve the simulation of convective rainfall events over indian region however to further support this conclusion additional studies are required by using more quality controlled remove biological targets viz birds swarms of insects wind borne particles refractive index gradients and improve further anomalous propagation qc

4705,radar estimate of precipitation is an important observation which can be used to initialize the high resolution numerical weather prediction models for improved forecast of high impact weather impact of indian doppler weather radar dwr derived precipitation rates on short range weather forecasts is studied here the present work is one of the first of its kind studies to assimilate the dwr derived rain rate into a high resolution model over indian region chennai dwr derived surface precipitation rates are included in the high resolution regional version of ncmrwf unified model ncum r through latent heat nudging to study its impact on the simulations of two convective rainfall events that occurred over east peninsular india the high resolution initial condition for ncum r is prepared using 4d var data assimilation system in which various conventional and satellite observations are used in this study two sets of numerical experiments are carried out one experiment named as control experiment cntl uses only the analysis created by 4d var and in the second lhn latent heat nudging is also performed with dwr derived precipitation rates in addition to the use of the 4d var analysis the results of the study show that the assimilation of dwr derived precipitation rates has a positive impact on the simulation of convective rainfall events the root mean square errors rmse of the analysed meteorological fields mainly the mass fields are improved in the lhn compared to cntl in both cases the error of convective available potential energy cape in the lhn analyses is considerably reduced compared to the cntl analyses for both cases the stability indices also suggested that the condition for convection is properly reproduced in the lhn analysis in both cases when evaluated against rainfall observations the amount and orientation of the main rainfall pattern showed noteworthy improvements in the lhn relative to cntl the rainfall forecasts are further verified based on the object oriented contiguous rain area cra technique the vector displacement errors and total mean square error are reduced considerably in lhn simulations compared to cntl the vertical structure and time evolution of moisture flux and moisture convergence are also well simulated in the lhn this preliminary study revealed encouraging results which shows that the assimilation of indian dwr derived rain rates in the high resolution regional nwp system can improve the forecast of convective rainfall events over indian region keywords latent heat nudging doppler weather radar precipitation estimates 4d var assimilation system ncum convective rainfall 1 introduction the indian sub continent frequently experiences heavy rainfall events due to the influence of the organized mesoscale convective systems mcss embedded in large scale synoptic systems dudhia 1989 srinivas et al 2018 mohan et al 2018 several previous studies suggested that there is an increasing trend in the frequency of occurrence as well as the intensity of high impact rainfall events over the indian region goswami et al 2006 rajeevan et al 2008 vittal et al 2013 etc the heavy rainfall events create wide spread destruction due to flash floods landslides damage to crops economy and environment accurate prediction both on spatial and temporal scale of such weather events is very essential for preparedness and disaster management recently several publications suggested that the numerical weather prediction nwp models mainly the high resolution non hydrostatic regional mesoscale models are becoming more capable to predict organized mcss embedded in large scale synoptic systems which cause heavy rainfall events in the indian region bhaskar rao and hari prasad 2005 routray et al 2005 2010a dodla and ratna 2010 etc in context of short range forecasting the high resolution mesoscale models are reasonably able to provide quantitative prediction of precipitation but struggle to maintain accurate forecasts of mcss this is mainly due to the large uncertainties from different sources like inaccurate of initial or boundary conditions not enough understanding of underlying model dynamics physics as well as non uniqueness of model variables moradkhani et al 2018 abbaszadeh et al 2019 over last two decades assimilation of observations from various platforms through advance data assimilation techniques has acquired more attention among researchers and practitioners into the nwp models to further improve the forecast skills by considering all sources of uncertainties abbaszadeh et al 2019 2020 gavahi et al 2020 the increasing accessibility of spatially and temporally dense high quality remote sensing data e g products from weather radar networks and improved data assimilation capabilities allow efficient use of these data in high resolution regional models hence it improves the model prediction of evolution location and timing of extreme events along with quantitative precipitation forecasting qpf gao et al 2004 xue et al 2003 xiao et al 2005 2007 zhao and xue 2009 routray et al 2010b govindankutty et al 2010 prasad et al 2014 osuri et al 2015 etc however there is a need to improve the model forecast skill further mainly for qpf to improve the forecast skill of the precipitation a common approach is to assimilate the variables which are directly related to the development of the precipitation therefore the assimilation of dwr derived rain rate is one of the important approaches marecal and mahfouf 2003 which can improve the vertical distribution of heating and moistening as the precipitation is not a prognostic variable various approaches have been developed to incorporate the information derived from rainfall observations into the nwp models through the modification of prognostic variables such as moisture and temperature fields over the years krishnamurti et al 1991 1993 haase et al 2000 milan et al 2008 the satellite derived precipitation is one of the primary sources of rainfall observations due to the sparse distribution of rain gauges and ground based weather radars several previous studies on assimilating satellite derived rain rate into weather models through nudging and other techniques found a positive impact on forecasting of both rainfall and dynamical fields which also reduced the model spin up problem e g falkovich et al 2000 treadon et al 2002 hou et al 2004 davolio and buzzi 2004 harrison et al 2008 bauer et al 2011 lopez 2011 etc zupanski and mesinger 1995 demonstrated the assimilation of precipitation data in regional eta forecasting model through 4d variational 4dvar data assimilation technique by simulating an extreme synoptic weather event kumar et al 2014 evaluated the impact of assimilation of precipitation retrieved rain rate from satellite on wrf model forecasts during indian summer monsoon of 2011 through 4dvar and the results are appreciably improved after the assimilation of rain rate the assimilation of precipitation estimates from weather radar data into the nwp model through nudging technique evolved over the years wang and warner 1988 wang et al 2010 continuously assimilated the precipitation rate derived from the composite reflectivity of weather radar through 1d var scheme for the simulation of a flood event occurred during 17 18 july 1996 over chicago their results clearly suggested that the assimilation of radar derived rain rate significantly improve the simulated mesoscale features of the convection system and reduce the spin up time significantly jones and macpherson 1997 assimilated the rain rate observations derived from the uk weather radars based on latent heat nudging technique manobianco et al 1994 and operationally used at uk met office regional nwp system macpherson 2001 in recent years various techniques algorithm like diabatic digital filter initialization complex cloud analysis variational data assimilation grid point statistical interpolation etc developed to assimilate the estimated quantities of rain rate into the nwp models other than latent heating nudging treadon et al 2002 xue et al 2003 hou et al 2004 hu et al 2006 weygandt et al 2008 liu et al 2008 schenkman et al 2011 wang et al 2013 sun et al 2014 li et al 2020 etc however the assimilation algorithm based on diabatic initialization is computationally efficient and practical ways to incorporate information from rain rate during pre forecast period and improve the short range forecast of precipitation sun et al 2014 the national centre for medium range weather and forecasting ncmrwf is operationally using global and regional nwp systems named as ncum based on met office unified model um systems since 2012 kumar et al 2018 the recent study by dutta et al 2019 examined the impact of assimilation of radial velocity from various indian dwrs for the simulation of three convective rainfall events over indian monsoon region using the high resolution regional ncum ncum r with a 3dvar data assimilation system this study showed the improved forecast skill of the model with the use of dwr radial winds however there is no study reported on the assimilation of the dwr derived rain rates in the ncum r system as well as other models over indian region the present research work is a first of its kind study over the indian region to assimilate the rain rates derived from dwr data into a high resolution 4 km regional model and analyzed its impact on simulation prediction of the convective rainfall events india installed several dwrs along its coast and other parts of the country currently ncmrwf has developed capability to assimilate the dwr radial velocity observations into the operational high resolution ncum r 4dvar data assimilation system despite progress in data assimilation methods for better analysis however assimilation of atmospheric hydrometeor content or precipitation rate from dwr reflectivity still remains a challenge the current study is an important component of the feasibility analysis that is undertaken to provide the required demonstration of the value of assimilating of estimated rain rate from dwr reflectivity for improving the forecast skill of ncum r model on simulation of convective heavy rainfall events this preliminary study gives way forward to assimilate the rain rate into the operational suite to further improve the short range forecast of convective weather systems the synoptic conditions prevailed during the rainfall events are provided in section 2 while a brief description of the radar rain rate data is provided in section 3 the latent heat nudging scheme used in the ncum r is concisely described in section 4 the modeling system and numerical experiment are presented in section 5 the various statistical skill scores used in the study to evaluate the model simulated results are presented in the methodology section section 6 whereas the results and discussion are provided in section 7 finally the conclusions drawn from the present study is given in section 8 2 synoptic conditions associated with rainfall events 2 1 case 1 26 28 september 2017 the withdrawal of south west monsoon during 2017 was delayed by nearly three weeks and the withdrawal started from northwest india during end of september there was a western disturbance wd presented over north pakistan and surroundings between 3 1 and 5 8 km above mean sea level msl on 26th september during 26th 27th september an upper cyclonic circulation was formed over andhra pradesh coast and adjoining south odisha which was extending from 4 5 to7 6 km above msl and tilting southwestwards with height during the same period a cyclonic circulation was noticed over andaman sea and adjoining areas this weather condition was attributed to the presence of east west wind shear zone from west central bay to southwest arabian sea across north tamil nadu and south interior karnataka during the period 26th 27th september the nungambakkam 13 06 n 80 24 e rain gauge station observed light to heavy rainfall 3 4 to 10 8 cm over chennai region the convective cloud bands along the tamil nadu coast and also over chennai region is clearly noticed in insat 3d cloud imagery fig 1 a the radar reflectivity dbz from chennai dwr station is depicted in fig 1b which shows strong reflectivity around 15 30 dbz along the tamil nadu coast and more than 40 dbz over oceanic region the values of convective available potential energy cape 1360 jkg 1 convective inhibition cin 24 5jkg 1 and lifted index li 2 86 observed at 00 utc 26th september http weather uwyo edu upperair sounding html station no 43279 clearly suggests high possibility of convective activity over the chennai region the atmospheric stability indices are more favorable for rainfall over chennai region during 27th and 28th september 2 2 case 2 04 06 november 2017 a low pressure area formed over south west bay of bengal and adjoining sri lanka as well as tamil nadu coast with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to 3 1 km above msl on 03rd november the low pressure became a trough of low at lower level over tamil nadu and adjoining south andhra pradesh coast from 04th to 06th november it embedded with a cyclonic circulation over gulf of mannar and neighbourhood extending up to 0 9 to 1 5 km above sea level the rainfall occurred due to thunderstorm activities over most places of tamil nadu and chennai regions as well as puducherry during 05th and 06th november heavy rainfall was occurred at isolated places over kerala coastal andhra pradesh and rayalaseema during this period over chennai the observed values of cape 1716 jkg 1 cin 0 08 jkg 1 and li 4 57 at 12 utc of 05th november is higher than the value of the same indices 851 jkg 1 27 jkg 1 and 2 41 respectively at 00 utc of 05th november is noticed similarly the value of cape 1494 jkg 1 cin 2 45 jkg 1 and li 3 18 is more in the 12 utc than the 00 utc of 06th november 492 jkg 1 36 jkg 1 and 2 35 respectively it is clearly presumed that the rainfall activities occurred due to the convective processes over the chennai region during this period the insat 3d cloud imagery fig 1c shows the convective cloud bands over chennai and adjoining regions figure 1b depicted also wide spread strong reflectivity echoes about 35 45 dbz over chennai and surrounding regions 3 radar derived rain rate data the use of radar data in both meteorological and hydrological applications has been limited by errors and uncertainties in its surface precipitation estimates such large errors are due to both meteorological variations in the reflectivity rainfall relationship beam attenuation and presence of bright band and non meteorological factors beam blockage range limitations poor calibration beam widening and beam filling therefore estimating surface precipitation rates from dwr observations is a complex and challenging task in this study we used chennai dwr fig 1 lat 13 08 n and lon 80 27 e data to derive the rain rate for lhn the dwr observations are received at 500 500 m spatial and 15 min temporal resolution the brief specification of the dwr chennai is provided here viz s band wavelength 10 cm station altitude 35 m horizontal beam width 0 99 deg pulse width 0 5 μs pulse repetition frequency 450 600 low high and range 250 km the first level of quality control qc is performed on the raw dwr observations at radar site including the removal of ground clutter by applying discrete filtering techniques sachidananda and zrnic 2000 bhowmik et al 2011 after removal of clutters the second level of qc is done at ncmrwf on the basis of static and dynamic quality index qi maps developed by amarjyothi et al 2017 the dwr reflectivity qi is calculated by considering the factors such as beam broadening beam shielding attenuation and bright band the cited study amarjyothi et al 2017 used good quality reflectivity data i e without the regions of blockage more attenuation caused by rain and beam broadening the details of the qc check and pre processing of the dwr observations is available at amarjyothi et al 2017 and dutta et al 2019 the qi scheme is employed further in the calculation of precipitation rate the region for generation of rain rate is not considered when the threshold of qi is less than 0 3 good quality reflectivity data is only used to calculate the precipitation rate by using the z r relationship z 267r1 345 proposed by suresh et al 2005 for chennai dwr station amudha et al 2014 compared the rain rate data with rain gauge observations from 16 stations located within 100 km range of the radar during the period 2006 2010 and found that the z r relationship by suresh et al 2005 has produced the best match with the observations 4 latent heat nudging scheme a complicated life cycle is evolved with each precipitation constituent from the creation of cloud droplets up to the reach at the ground many of which related with latent heating a variety of process occurs such as condensation and freezing release latent heat and evaporation and melting absorb energy from the surrounding environment the amount of energy release or draw during the phase change is known as specific enthalpy therefore the vertically integrated of latent heating rate in an atmospheric column is directly proportional to the net precipitation rate the latent heat nudging scheme is based on the above mentioned basic assumption which make things easier by converting the four dimensional complexity to a one dimensional problem hence the scheme efficient enough for operational use by reducing computing requirement jones and macpherson 1997 stephan et al 2008 dixon et al 2009 the main aspect of the latent heat nudging scheme is to correct the model s vertical latent heating profile at every time step and grid point through a factor derived from the ratio of observed rain rate and model estimated precipitation rate at the surface the addition of diagnosed latent heating is suitably enhanced or suppressed the diabatic heating term in the thermodynamic equation of the nwp model in turns it will bring an adjustment in the model s vertical velocity field and divergent circulation which lead to the model rain rate closer to the observed rate it is expected that this realistic rain rate is obtained through the proper establishment of a dynamical storm structure that is closer to reality subsequently this structure will improve the forecast skill of the model the spatial distribution of surface observed rain rate provides information regarding the locations and estimated amount of the absorbed or released of latent heating but the primary issue in the latent heat nudging scheme is the vertical distribution of the heating that is not known in this study we used model profile instead of idealized heating profiles jones and macpherson 1997 stephan et al 2008 dixon et al 2009 assuming that the model has correct vertical structure as well as vertical partitioning which is scaled by a factor of observed and model precipitation rate the major advantage is that it ensures consistency with parameterization scheme of the model and permits evolution of the profile with time during the model integration the basic principle of the latent heat nudging scheme is to calculate the latent heating profile from the model physics step and derive increments to the potential temperature the model profiles are computed by considering the condensational heating within the physics step this condensational heating comes from the large scale condensation and the convection scheme the moisture variable i e total water in the ncum r model is partitioned into specific humidity cloud ice and cloud liquid water through the cloud scheme the latent heating is calculated through phase changes of these parameters due to large scale and convection processes the total model latent heating rate δθlhm is the sum of the heating rates from the large scale condensation and the convection process the decision tree or schematic diagram illustrates the steps followed by the latent heat nudging scheme at each grid point in fig 2 4 1 calculation of potential temperature increments the latent heat nudging scheme is based on a newtonian relaxation nudging technique which forces the nwp model towards the observed rain rates the scheme uses latent heating profiles from the model physics step and provide potential temperature as well as moisture increments the potential temperature increments are calculated based on the scaling of the model latent heating profiles by the ratio of the analysed rain rate and model rain rate the prana is the analysed precipitation rate i e a weighted combination of the observed rain rate and the model generated rain rate background or first guess value 1 p r ana α p r dwr 1 α p r mod e l where prdwr is the radar derived rain rate and prmodel model derived precipitation rate α is the weighting function depending on spatial distance to the radar the observations are weighted via α based on their distance from the radar site with closer range observations bearing larger weight and vice versa the latent heat nudging s potential temperature increments i e δ θ lh which added to the model prognostic potential temperature field at the end of the time step it can be determined from the model latent heating tendencies δθlhm radar derived precipitation rate prdwr and model estimated surface rain rate prmodel the equation eq 2 looks like as given below 2 δ θ lh f 1 δ θ lhm f pr ana pr model the f i e scaling factor is restricted when a large inconsistencies between radar derived surface precipitation rate and model derived rain rate so that there is no excessive heat added or remove from the model at a grid point where the model has rain prmodel 0 but the observation has none prdwr 0 it suggested that model has convective heating increments in the grid point due to the presence of bogus convective precipitations in this case we set a factor 0 5 dixon et al 2009 jacques et al 2018 which ensures that not too much latent heating is removed from the model but scaling down the model profiles to the given factor hence it prevents the model to develop spurious grid point storms the latent heat nudging scheme reduced the heating profile of the model fig 2 furthermore the observation has rain prdwr 0 but the model has no rain prmodel 0 or very less amount of rain the scheme does not immediately reject or scale the profile at this particular grid point in this scenario the latent heat nudging scheme applies a search algorithm based on manobianco et al 1994 stephan et al 2008 and dixon et al 2009 the search performs at the adjacent grid points 18 nearby grid points considered for search and uses a profile from the one which has enough precipitation the profile from that point is used to scale according to the observed rain rate at the model grid point the calculated increment of potential temperature is incorporated at the desired grid point if the search is unsuccessful i e not enough precipitation nearby grid points then a reduced scaling is applied on that grid point when the search algorithm finds no rain nearby grid points the observation is ignored if the observed and model rain rates are available at the grid point the model latent heat rate is scaled with upper and lower limits of the scaling factor i e 2 and 0 5 the details of the possible ranges of the ratio of observed and modeled precipitation rates scaling factor and profiles to scale are given in table 1 the major advantage of this approach is that the dwr derived rain rate can be used to force the model at the particular grid points where the model is not able to perfectly simulate precipitation rate finally a recursive filter purser and mcquigg 1982 is applied to smooth the increments before adding them to the model temperature field the filter is essential to control the numerical noise of the model the more details about the latent heat nudging scheme can be found in manobianco et al 1994 jones and macpherson 1997 haase et al 2000 leuenberger and rossa 2003 stephan et al 2008 dixon et al 2009 etc the rain rate analyses are performed on a 2 km grid resolution using spatial averaging and conversion from polar to cartesian co ordinates archibald and smith 1997 many previous studies jones and macpherson 1997 macpherson 2001 dixon et al 2009 stephan et al 2008 suggest that a better approximation of the rain rate can be found within the range of 100 km from the dwr location hence the importance of the radar data similarly the detection and accuracy of the precipitation reduces with increase in range and hence the weight α provided to radar data is gradually decreased kitchen and jackson 1993 jones and macpherson 1997 macpherson 2001 etc the small weight to the observations is provided at longer range for smooth transition to the region outside dwr range it is especially performed to avoid unwanted temperature gradients around dwr range after the addition of latent heat increment it is worth to mention that the errors associated with the estimated rain rate are also significant which can influence the forecast skill of the model chang and holt 1994 conducted several sensitivity experiments by considering the different types of vertical heating profiles more frequent data assimilation cut off windows data time lags and prescribed systematic errors the study was found that the positive impact of the rain rate in the model forecast is quite sensitive to the spatial distribution locations than the magnitude of the estimated rain rate turpeinen et al 1990 manobianco et al 1994 the sensitive work in which deliberately introduced errors into the rain rate is beyond the scope of the present study 5 modeling system

surfacepressure usually considered as 1000 hpa davies et al 2005 the ncum r modeling system is a seamless prediction system which can be used across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales with same dynamical core and physical parameterization schemes the ncum r has a rotated grid structure with arakawa c horizontal grid staggering to solve the compressible non hydrostatic equations of motion vertical staggering charney and phillips 1953 and terrain following hybrid height vertical coordinate the semi implicit semi lagrangian and predictor corrector time integration numerical scheme which solve the deep atmosphere dynamics are used in the ncum r forecasting system cullen et al 1997 davies et al 2005 the details of the ncum r forecast model can be found from routray et al 2017 jayakumar et al 2017 and dutta et al 2019 the high resolution 3 hourly cycling 4d var analysis system of ncum r is based on the incremental approach courtier et al 1994 the 4d var scheme runs with one outer loop of a non linear model which gives linearization states and first guess fields for the computation of the increments of the model variables the forecast from the previous cyclic is considered as background state to add the increments the 4d var analysis system used a linear perturbation forecast pf model with a lower grid spacing 8 km usually the pf model has a lower grid spacing than the forecast model to generate time varying increments over the assimilation window ballard et al 2016 the perturbation forecast model includes a generalized conjugate residual gcr eisenstat et al 1983 solver with limited physics for computational affordability the details of the incremental 4d var analysis system can be found from rawlins et al 2007 ballard et al 2016 and li et al 2018 the ncum r um version 10 8 with 4d var data assimilation da system is used in the current study the regional ncum model configured over the indian domain 5 s 40 n and 65 102 e with horizontal resolution of 4 km 1000 1000 pts and 80 vertical sigma levels up to a height of 38 5 km the model domain is depicted in fig 1e two sets of numerical experiments are carried out to test the sensitivity of latent heat nudging scheme the first experiment cntl assimilates only conventional and satellite observations using incremental 4d var da system the second experiment lhn assimilates the dwr derived rain rates using latent heat nudging after the 4d var assimilation scheme both numerical experiments uses 3 hourly update cycles in this process the 03 h forecast from the previous cycle served as the first guess for the next cycle hence a total of eight assimilation cycles are performed per day which produces analysis at every 3 h interval additionally latent heat nudging is performed at every assimilation cycle in the lhn fig 3 illustrates a schematic diagram of three hourly 4d var da cycle along with lhn used in this particular study the global ncum 17 km resolution forecast fields are used as boundary conditions for ncum r after interpolated onto the regional model grid the num r model is integrated up to 76 h in both experiments from the initial time 00 utc of 26 september 2017 case 1 and 04 november 2017 case 2 the dwr derived rain rate observations used in 3 hrly assimilation cyclic total 8 are depicted in fig 4 the details of the model configuration along with physical parameterization schemes selected for this particular study are provided in table 2 6 methodology we evaluated the model simulated precipitation using various statistical skill scores such as equitable threat score ets prefigurance score and false alarm ratio far the skill scores are calculated against three hourly accumulated dwr derived rainfall over the region 11 15 n and 78 83 e these skill scores are generally used for diagnostic and scientific verification of weather forecasts the forecast verification is a method to assess the quality of a forecast for this purpose define a 2 2 contingency table mason 2003 as given below ab cd hitsfalsealarms missescorrectnegatives a total number of correct forecasts occurred i e forecast and observed occurrence b number of incorrect forecasts occurrence i e forecast occurrence but observed non occurrence c number of incorrect forecasts of non occurrence i e forecast non occurrence but observed occurrence d number of

a a r a c b a r where hits random ar a b a c n the ets value equal to unity indicates ideal forecast and 0 means forecast has no skill the ets value higher or lower than 1 suggest that the model over or under predicted the rainfall the mathematical expression of the prefigurance score and false alarms far is given below prefigurance score a a c and far b a b the prefigurance score is sensitive to missed events and hits but not to false alarms correspondingly the far is a function of false alarms and hits only not sensitive to missed events the skill scores range from 0 to 1 with 1 representing a perfect forecast for prefigurance score and 0 is the perfect score for far the details about the scores can be found in world meteorological organization wmo report 2014 the object oriented contiguous rain area cra method i e also called entity based or feature based methods ebert and mcbride 2000 ebert and gallus 2009 dutta et al 2019 is considered for further verification of rainfall forecasts to evaluate the impact of the assimilation of the rain rate in the model forecasts the cra method is to objectively compare the properties of matched forecast and observed rainfall patterns the cra method evolves with two steps in first step the cra method is defined as two contiguous areas entities i e observed and simulated precipitation enclosed within a user specified isohyets rain rate contour the next step is to determine a best match between the observed and forecast entities in this step the model simulated rainfall pattern horizontally translated over the observed field and rotated around the centroid of the observed entity until the best match is obtained the best match of the two entities is obtained from various ways such as minimizing the total squared error maximizing the overlap of the two entities maximizing the correlation coefficient and overlaying the centres of gravity of the two entities these statistics are calculated over a domain by considering all grid points available in the forecast and observed entities before and after translation the location errors are quite similar from all the best match methods when the forecast pattern well matches with the observations ebert and gallus 2009 nevertheless the forecasts do not behaved well all times means forecast do not matched properly with the observations it is required to experiment with the different best matching methods to find out which one of the methods provides the most intuitively results for the particular forecast application being evaluates in this study the location error is determined through pattern matching of the two rain entity this cra method verifies the displacement intensity volume spatial pattern size shape and other attributes of the feature here

msevolume 7 results and discussion 7 1 improvement in model initial condition we first examine how the initial conditions provided to the ncum r model vary among experiments with inclusion of dwr derived rain rate observations through latent heat nudging therefore in this section we present the comparison of the cntl analysis and the lhn analysis after inclusion of rain rate observations through latent heat nudging i e lhn experiment the spatial distribution of analysis increment lhn minus cntl analyses for the meteorological variables such as zonal wind u m s meridional wind v m s potential temperature θ k and water vapor mixing ratio q g kg at different pressure levels 850 500 and 300 hpa for case 1 valid at 00 utc 26th september 2017 is depicted in fig 5 a c d f g i and j l respectively from the figure the positive increments are prominently seen at and around the chennai dwr station for all the variables at different pressure levels after assimilation nudging of the precipitation rate the u component fig 5a c and v component fig 5d f of wind increments are higher in the lower troposphere and there is an increased area at higher atmosphere fig 5c similarly the increments in potential temperature fig 5g i are higher in the lower atmosphere and decrease progressively with height it is a well known fact that the potential temperature decreases with height when the atmosphere is unstable i e convective atmosphere hence the convection is properly represented in the lhn analyses after inclusion of rain rate the maximum increment of water vapour mixing ratio fig 5j l is noticed in the mid troposphere and low values in the upper atmosphere also we observed from fig 5 that there is a dipole structure in the analysis increments which can be attributed to balance due to conservation of mass and energy the root mean square error rmse of the meteorological variables and gain in skill of the lhn analysis and cntl analysis against chennai radiosonde is depicted in fig 6 a and b for case 1 and case 2 respectively for calculation of rmse all the levels are used together and for the skill is the improvement of lhn over cntl i e cntl lhn cntl 100 from the figure we deduce that in both cases the rmse of all variables are reduced after assimilation of precipitation rate compared to the cntl analysis the gain in skill of the lhn analysis compared to cntl ranging from 35 to 51 in case 1and 18 to 32 in case 2 it is evident from the figure that the maximum improvements are found in the mass variables after assimilation of the rain rate less gain visible in the zonal and meridonial wind fields in both cases the skew t log p diagram at the location chennai from observation cntl and lhn analyses at model initial time of case 1 and case 2 valid at 00 utc 26 september and 05 november 2017 is depicted in fig 7 a c and d f respectively in case 1 the observed skew t fig 7a indicates that the level of free convection lfc starts at around 850 hpa and extended up to 150 hpa equilibrium level el the maximum positive cape is noticed within 600 to 350 hpa pressure levels the observed cape and cin are 1360 jkg 1 and 24 5 jkg 1 respectively the fig 7c lhn shows that the atmosphere is more unstable as the positive cape starts from 870 hpa lfc extended up to 196 hpa el while the cntl analysis fig 6b shows the lfc at 828 hpa and el at 203 hpa the cape cin values are higher lower in lhn analysis 1002 jkg 1 31 jkg 1 as compared to the cntl analysis 826 jkg 1 26 jkg 1 respectively similarly the value of cape 261jkg 1 is higher in the lhn analysis fig 7f than the cntl analysis 149 jkg 1 fig 7e in case 2 however the value of cin 6 33 jkg 1 remains the same in both the analyses the observed cape cin are about 851 jkg 1 27jkg 1 for case 2 in both cases the cape values are reasonably well reproduced in the lhn analyses compared to the observations the error of cape from lhn analysis is reduced by 74 case 1 and 31 case 2 compared to the cntl analysis 61 and 18 respectively in both cases the figures clearly indicate that the reduced errors due to latent heat nudging scheme favorable conditions for the convection are better reproduced in the lhn analyses after assimilation of dwr derived precipitation rates compared to cntl analysis the latitudinal averaged 11 to 150n pressure longitude cross section of moisture transport scalar product of specific humidity and wind magnitude at model initial time from cntl and lhn analyses of both cases is depicted in fig 8 the model analyses are compared with the high resolution european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era5 data sets hersbach et al 2020 in case 1 strong magnitude of moisture flux around 80 120 gkg 1 ms 1 spread over the continental area 78 800e at lower level of the atmosphere is noticed in the era5 reanalysis fig 8a similar distribution of moisture flux is also noticed in both analyses however the magnitude of the moisture is higher about flux 10 20 gkg 1 ms 1 in the lhn analysis fig 8c than the cntl analysis fig 8b over the region the feature is missing in the cntl analysis over the region both the analyses are showing high values of moisture flux over the oceanic region than the era5 while the magnitude of the moisture flux is reduced in the lhn analysis after the assimilation of the rain rate similarly for case 2 the spatial orientation of the moisture transport and magnitude is better represented in the lhn analysis fig 8f especially over 79 800e than the cntl analysis fig 8e the features are also well matched with the era5 reanalysis fig 8d it is clear that assimilation of the dwr derived rain rate via latent heat nudging scheme has improved the moisture transport low level wind and specific humidity in the analyses 7 2 impact in model forecasts the 24 h accumulated rainfall obtained from the cntl and lhn simulations of case 1 valid at 03 utc 27 september 2017 day 1 and the corresponding imd ncmrwf merged satellite rain gauge nmsg data mitra et al 2003 2009 as well as dwr derived rainfall are depicted in fig 9 a d the observations from the nmsg fig 9a and dwr derived rainfall fig 9b clearly indicate wide spread convective rainfall bands over chennai and surrounding oceanic regions it is noticed that the spatial distribution of rainfall over the land from the cntl fig 9c is totally shifted north eastward as compared to the observations moreover the cntl run could not reproduce the extensive rainfall over the oceanic regions and coastal regions of tamil nadu it is necessary to mention that the lhn fig 9d is considerably improved and better reproduce the orientation of rainfall pattern and amount after the assimilation of the derived rain rate in order to examine the impact of the assimilation of rain rate on the simulation of precipitation associated with the convective system ets at different forecast hours with various rainfall thresholds 2 mm and 10 mm from cntl and lhn experiments are calculated the ets along with gain skill score of lhn with respect to cntl at different forecast hours with 2 mm and 10 mm rainfall thresholds from both the experiments for case 1 and case 2 are depicted in fig 10 a b and c d respectively it is clearly seen from the figure that the assimilation of the dwr derived precipitation rate has positive impact on the simulation of the rainfall all throughout the forecast hours at various thresholds the ets values gradually decrease with the increase of the forecast lengths in both cases and for both thresholds the ets values are higher in the lhn than the cntl over the whole forecast however ets values from both simulations in all cases are close to each other after 15 h forecast the ets values are higher for the lower rainfall threshold 2 mm as compared to the ets values obtained from the higher rainfall threshold 10 mm in both experiments for both the cases the percentage improvement of lhn simulation with respect to the cntl simulation is better in all cases for both the thresholds the forecast skill is slowly decreased with the increase of the forecast lead time in both cases the averaged percentage of error from the 2 mm 10 mm rainfall thresholds is considerably reduced in the lhn simulation over cntl simulation by 29 5 34 and 12 19 for case 1 and case 2 respectively the gain in skill of lhn over cntl is higher in higher threshold 10 mm of rainfall than the lower rainfall threshold 2 mm in both cases it is inferred that high amount of rainfall is better simulated by the model after the assimilation nudging of the dwr derived precipitation rate than the cntl simulation the results clearly show beneficial impact of the assimilation of the rain rate up to the forecast lead time of 15 h and reduced afterward many previous studies such as lin et al 1996 jones and macpherson 1997 macpherson 2001 etc showed that the benefit of the assimilation of derived rain rate in the model for precipitation forecast sustained only for the first few hours mainly up to 12 15 h of the forecast the findings of the study in the precipitation simulation support the other previous studies as the maximum skill is observed up to 15 h forecast we also computed the prefigurance score and false alarm ratio far at various thresholds of rainfall mm for both cases the prefigurance score and far along with percentage of improvement line of day 1 for both cases are depicted in fig 11 a b and fig 12 a b respectively from both cases it is noticed that the prefigurance score fig 11a b is improved at all thresholds after assimilation of rainfall through latent heat nudging however the score progressively gets smaller with higher thresholds of rainfall in all cases the lhn simulations show more skill of improvement at higher rainfall thresholds compared to cntl simulations in both cases it inferred that the high amount of rainfall is better simulated in the lhn than cntl in both cases the mean skill of lhn is high about 36 and 26 over cntl in both cases respectively similarly far score fig 12a b is better simulated in lhn at all rainfall thresholds compared to cntl the far scores gradually increase with increase of rainfall thresholds in all simulations for both cases however in comparison to cntl simulations the far scores are lower in the lhn simulations at all rainfall thresholds in both cases indeed the rainfall skill is appreciably improved after assimilation of precipitation rates from the figure of improvement is clearly seen in lhn simulations at different thresholds with respect to cntl simulations the averaged skill of lhn is about 40 and 31 with respect to cntl simulation in case 1 and case 2 respectively overall the statistical skill scores ets prefigurance score and far demonstrate better skills in both cases on prediction of amount and location of rainfall after nudging the dwr derived precipitation rates into the high resolution regional model the mse along with vector displacement error line as well as of errors contribution from different components of mse at 10 mm rainfall threshold for day 1 simulation of case 1 and case 2 are illustrated in fig 13 a b and c d respectively from the figure fig 13a c it can be noticed that the mse is lower than the lhn simulations in both cases as compared to the cntl it can be inferred that the location intensity and pattern of the simulated precipitation entities are better matched with the observation after the assimilation of rain rate in the model compared to cntl the mse is reduced by about 12 10 in the lhn simulations for case 1 case 2 with respect to cntl simulation the vector displacement error is derived through pattern matching the simulated field is horizontally transformed over the observation until the best match is achieved the vector displacement basically became the location error of the forecast the figure fig 13a c line clearly shows that the vector displacement errors are reduced in the lhn simulations compared to the cntl simulations in both cases the rainfall distribution is more realistic in the lhn than the cntl the vector displacement errors are reduced by 39 and 21 in the lhn simulation over cntl simulations in case 1 and case 2 respectively the percentage error from the individual components i e location volume and pattern of mse for both cases is depicted in fig 13c and d respectively it is observed that the volume error of the precipitation is higher in the lhn simulations for both cases than the cntl on the other hand the percentage of contribution due to the displacement and pattern error is relatively less than the volume error in both cases this suggests that the intensity of the rainfall is more in the lhn simulations than cntl and more closer when compared with the observations the other errors such as those from the displacement and pattern components are considerably reduced in the lhn simulations in both cases however the overall mse in case 1 and case 2 is less in the lhn experiment compared to the cntl fig 13a and c furthermore the performance of the lhn simulation is evaluated by analyzing the mesoscale characteristics embedded with the convective system the time pressure vertical cross section of moisture transport from era5 reanalyses cntl and lhn simulations at chennai location for case 1 and case 2 is presented in fig 14 a c and d f respectively in era5 fig 14a three patches of high magnitude of low level moisture fluxes 100 g kg 1 m s 1 are observed at lower levels during 00 06 utc of 26th 18 utc of 26th to 00 utc 27th and 18 utc of 27th to 00 utc 28th september 2017 these features are reasonably well characterized in both the simulations fig 14b and c however era5 shows the presence of the low level moisture fluxes between 18 utc of 26th to 00 utc 27th which is well simulated by the cntl fig 14b at 6 h earlier i e 12 18 utc of 26th this feature is well brought out mainly corrected the time lag in the lhn simulation fig 14c after the assimilation of rain rate also the vertical extend of the moisture fluxes in the lhn simulation matches well with the era5 reanalyses fig 14a most of the forecast hours similarly in case 2 the era5 fig 14d shows high magnitude of low level moisture fluxes up to 850 hpa the long duration up to 12 utc of 5th and also at 00 utc of 6th high magnitude of low level moisture fluxes are simulated by the lhn fig 14f while in the cntl fig 13e the pattern is well simulated only up to 06 utc of 6th november 2017 the pattern of the low level moisture fluxes is well characterized in the lhn simulation than the cntl the vertical extend of the moisture transport is also reasonably well characterized in the lhn simulation and is comparable with the pattern from the era5 reanalysis the time pressure vertical cross section of horizontal advection of vorticity mohanty et al 2013 from era5 reanalyses cntl and lhn simulations at chennai location for case 1 during the period 00 utc of 26 to 28 september 2017 is illustrated in fig 15 a c respectively particularly the vorticity advection is an indicative of rising motion at the surface during the convective activities in era5 fig 15a two patches of positive advection of vorticity 20 10 5s 1 at lower levels are presented which is extended up to the upper atmosphere during the period 18 utc of 26th to 03 utc of 27th and 13 utc of 27th to 00 utc of 28th september 2017 the presence of the low level positive advection of vorticity during 18 utc of 26th to 03 utc 27th in era5 is simulated by the cntl experiment fig 15b with 6 h of time lag i e 12 18 utc 26th it is also found that the high magnitude of positive vorticity advection is simulated by the cntl fig 15b at 00 utc as well as in the period between 06 utc and 12 utc of 26th and 27th of september 2017 which are not replicated in the era5 reanalyses fig 15a the time evolution of advection of vorticity is considerably well represented in the lhn experiment fig 15c after the assimilation of the dwr rain rate in comparison to cntl the cntl simulation is showing strong convective updraft from lower levels throughout the forecast hours which is not reproduced in the era5 reanalyses the vorticity advection is slightly better characterized in the lhn simulation as compared to the cntl the regions of high moisture flux fig 14a c are often co located with regions of positive advection of vorticity fig 15a c the time pressure vertical cross section of moisture convergence 10 4 g kg 1s 1 from era5 reanalyses cntl and lhn simulations at chennai location for case 2 during the period 00 utc of 05 to 07 november 2017 is depicted in fig 15d f respectively era5 has a clear signal of continuous low level moisture convergence throughout the period of study fig 15d the simulated moisture convergence from cntl fig 15e at lower level is not continuous like the pattern seen in the era5 however the simulated pattern of low level moisture convergence quite improves in the lhn fig 15f we further analysed the performance of the assimilation of the rain rate through latent heat nudging by calculating the cape and cin for both cases and is provided in table 3 from table 3 it can be seen that the observed cape cin values are increased decreased during 00 to 12 utc of 27th september case 1 and 06th november 2017 case 2 it is deduced that the convective activities are stronger during the periods of simulations in both cases it is noticed that the observed values of cape cin are lower higher during 28th september case 1 and 07th november 2017 case 2 compared to values observed in the earlier hours it can be inferred that cape has been used in the evolution of the convective system this pattern is well simulated by both experiments in all the cases however the indices are considerably improved in the lhn simulation it is evident that the convective activity is better represented in the lhn simulation than the cntl simulation 8 summary and conclusions the present study evaluates the impact of the assimilation nudging of rain rate derived from dwr chennai through latent heat nudging method we use the ncum r forecast system to simulate two precipitation events over tamil nadu region two sets of numerical experiments are carried out cntl assimilating all observations using 4d var and lhn assimilating all observations using 4d var systems and radar rain rate nudging to ncum r the major conclusions drawn from the study are given below the spatial distribution of analysis increments of meteorological variables wind and mass fields at different pressure levels clearly deduced that the assimilation of rain rate along with other observations has improved the model initial conditions the convection is properly represented in the lhn initial conditions after the latent heat nudging of rain rate the rmse of wind and mass fields at model initial time are considerably improved in the lhn experiment compared to cntl in both cases it is also manifested from the rmse that the maximum improvements are noticed in the mass variables after assimilation of the precipitation rate we notice less improvement in the wind fields for both cases the skew t plot shows that the atmosphere is more unstable in the lhn experiment as the depth of the convective instability is higher compared to cntl in both cases we show that the cape cin values are higher lower in the lhn simulation compared to the cntl one and are closer to the observed values of cape cin in all cases the error of cape from lhn analysis is considerably reduced compared to the cntl analysis in both cases the stability indices show that the convection is properly reproduced in the lhn and is reasonably better matched with the observed indices the magnitude and spatial distribution pattern of the moisture flux from lhn analysis are reasonably well matched with the era5 the strength of the moisture flux over land is less in the cntl in both cases the high values of moisture flux over the oceanic region are noticed both in the analyses from cntl as well as in the one from lhn however the magnitude of moisture flux is reduced after latent heat nudging is performed i e lhn analysis and comparable with the era5 reanalyses it is clear that use of the dwr derived rain rate has improved the model initial conditions cntl simulation could not reproduce the extensive rainfall over the land costal and oceanic regions however lhn experiment is considerably improved the forecast and is able to reproduce the orientation of rainfall pattern and amount the features in lhn simulations are reasonably well correlated with both the observations nmsg and dwr derived rainfall the ets at different forecast hours with two rainfall thresholds 2 mm and 10 mm for both cases is improved in the lhn compared to cntl however ets values are slowly decreased along with the increase of forecast lengths in both cases and both thresholds the mean of error is reduced in lhn compared to cntl with different rainfall thresholds in both cases it is also noticed that the more positive impact of the assimilation of rain rate sustained up to the forecast range of 15 h and reduced afterward the result of the study is well matched with the findings of other previous studies lin et al 1996 jones and macpherson 1997 macpherson 2001 etc the prefigurance score and far at various rainfall thresholds are also improved in the lhn simulations compared to cntl simulations in both cases overall the statistical skill scores ets prefigurance score and far exhibit enhanced skills in both cases on prediction of amount and location of rainfall after nudging the dwr derived precipitation rates into the high resolution regional model we showed that the total mse obtained through object oriented cra method is lower in lhn than in cntl we deduced that the location intensity and pattern of the simulated precipitation entities are reasonably matches with the observation after assimilation of rain rate the vector displacement errors total mse are reduced by 39 12 and 21 10 in the lhn over cntl for case 1 and case 2 respectively we showed that the intensity of the rainfall is higher in the lhn simulations compared to the observations even though the errors from the displacement and pattern components are considerably reduced in the lhn over cntl simulations in both cases the time evolution of the moisture fluxes are well simulated by the lhn experiment as compared to the cntl experiment throughout the forecast period the vertical extend of the moisture transport is also reasonably well characterized in the lhn simulation the features are also well matched with the era5 reanalyses in both cases similarly the time evolution and vertical extent of horizontal advection of vorticity and moisture convergence are better represented in the lhn experiment the present work is an initial assessment for utilizing indian dwr derived precipitation rate for improving the high resolution ncum r forecasts results of this study strongly indicate that the assimilation of indian dwr derived rain estimates in the high resolution regional modeling frame work will help to improve the simulation of convective rainfall events over indian region however to further support this conclusion additional studies are required by using more quality controlled remove biological targets viz birds swarms of insects wind borne particles refractive index gradients and improve further anomalous propagation qc

4706,groundwater sampling in boreholes has been carried out for decades according to well established protocols and regulations an important requirement in this context is the need to purge the borehole prior to any sampling action the volume of the purge being adapted to the water flow and the regulatory context contaminated site investigations have introduced the concept of water column heterogeneity in the screened section of boreholes which also occurs in some uncontaminated boreholes or in long screened boreholes specific guidelines and practices were thus introduced in particular the concept of discrete sampling this type of sampling can be advantageously used in deep boreholes provided that there is some renewal of water at the screens or the perforated intervals the present study aims to take a step forward in the characterization of deep boreholes set up in the aquitaine basin in france by defining a protocol for relatively short boreholes depth 170 m and applying it to much deeper boreholes formerly drilled for oil and gas exploration sampling up to 1035 m deep acquisitions were performed to better characterize water chemistry including some isotope considerations they were based on physico chemical logging and endoscopic inspections where technically possible after a review of the information provided by the investigations on the characterization of the paleocene eocene aquifer in southwestern france a methodology is proposed to make sampling in deep boreholes with low yield more reliable by combining the abstraction of a reduced water volume and the use of a downhole sampling system keywords deep borehole downhole sampling water sample representativeness 1 introduction water sampling and especially groundwater sampling in boreholes which is the focus of this study has been performed for decades either for regulatory purposes water drinking regulations or for a better knowledge of aquifers best practice guidelines were defined early e g rainwater and thatcher 1960 and have evolved regularly since then based on feedbacks from field operators and regulators e g brown et al 1970 wood 1976 gibb et al 1981 lallemand barrès 1993 in europe the focus was placed on best practices thanks to the first regulatory framework for groundwater in the end of the 1970s directive 80 68 ec subsequent directives namely the water framework directive wfd in 2000 directive 2000 60 ec and its daughter directive on groundwater in 2006 directive 2006 118 ec have completed the corpus these directives aimed to achieve good quantitative and chemical status for water bodies supposedly by 2015 as a result a large literature is available worldwide to help in better sampling and thus characterizing groundwaters e g ofev 2003 usgs 2006 duncan et al 2007 ministère du développement durable de l environnement et des parcs du québec 2011 ghestem et al 2017 moreover most of the guidelines are in accordance with those from the iso standards and more specifically the 5667 standard and its parts iso 5667 11 2009 one of the main principle exposed in these guidelines is the need of purging a borehole prior to any sampling barcelona and helfrich 1986 this is because the water in the screened section is renewed due to flow patterns but the water above the screened section is not and is therefore not representative of the groundwater us epa 1999 in most cases the flow pattern in the screened section is lateral and directly related to that of the aquifer as a function of its transmissivity but well bore flow vertical mixing may occur especially in open holes and boreholes with long or multiple screened sections usgs 2006 additionally water sampling from boreholes that cannot produce a continuously pumped sample or boreholes in which water level recovery takes longer than 24 h after being pumped is not recommended usgs 2006 apart from these cases the general rule is to evacuate at least one volume of water in the well casing and preferably three to five volumes to get a representative sample us epa 1999 depending on the flowrate of the pump the pump intake will be located either above the screened section high flow rate pump or in the screened section low flow rate pump in order to avoid damaging screens and displacing the gravel pack besides these guidelines several exceptions to the rule exist for example on contaminated sites where volatile organic compounds may be monitored barcelona et al 1994 or in open holes in fractured bedrock shapiro 2002 in such cases other pumping strategies may be required because sampling results have been demonstrated to be sensitive to well purging rate the volume of abstracted water and the disturbance created by downhole pumping gibb et al 1981 from an assumption of homogeneity of the water column in the screened section the view progressively shifted to the highlight of the role of heterogeneity in the water column as in geological logs puls and barcelona 1996 this led to the development of low flow purging techniques puls and powell 1992 which have demonstrated their usefulness in small diameter boreholes equipped with short screened intervals barcelona et al 1994 2005 and to the use of inflatable packers where screened intervals are long or in open holes smellie and wikberg 1991 shapiro 2002 later on other systems for discrete sampling at low flow have been designed the model 401 waterloo multilevel system solinst cherry and johnson 1982 the continuous multichannel technology system solinst einarson and cherry 2002 the water flute flexible liner underground technologies ltd co cherry et al 2007 or the westbay mp system westbay instruments inc black et al 1986 such sampling systems are mostly used in shallow boreholes 100 m and benefit from a large number of sampling points allowing discrete and precise characterization of the water column chapman et al 2015 nevertheless some of these systems have a far larger investigation depth up to 1200 m for the westbay system einarson 2005 these systems appear to be relevant for site specific borehole monitoring but they require dedicated borehole completions in the case of pre existing boreholes implementing such systems may turn out to be costly i e if there is no need of permanent or regular monitoring of the aquifer provided the borehole diameter is adapted einarson 2005 when the depth of investigation has to be further extended the use of multi ports systems is less common with the exception of the u tube sampling system a positive fluid displacement pump using a high pressure gas drive and valves designed for carbon capture and storage applications and operated through a dedicated completion freifeld et al 2005 the u tube system was deployed down to 2870 m conaway et al 2016 and nested deployments allowing multi level sampling are also reported boreham et al 2011 if the sampling system has to be retrievable sampling may rely on downhole in situ sampling systems the use of electric submersible pumps and sampling systems used in the oil industry is not considered for cost reasons crombie et al 1998 wolff boenisch and evans 2014 downhole sampling systems are namely positive displacement samplers vacuum samplers and flow through samplers wolff boenisch and evans 2014 these samplers need to be driven down to the desired sampling depth with a wireline and valve mechanisms allow fluid sampling by means of pressure differential positive displacement and vacuum samplers or not flow through sampler we present here the results of investigations performed on some deep boreholes of the aquitaine basin in southwest france between 2014 and 2018 the acquisitions were not all done under the same project so that focus and outcomes may differ from one well to the other deep sampling was always performed to characterize the water chemistry characterization of the gas contents is not presented here in some cases physico chemical logging was performed prior the investigations to assess the evolution of parameters along the water column in boreholes that are not used for water supply some pumping phases were also done in selected boreholes to evaluate if relevant deep sampling can be performed without any well bore purging or not though the data were acquired to improve the knowledge on deep aquifers in this large sedimentary basin they are mainly used to define an approach to get reliable estimates of the chemistry of deep aquifers and therefore to set a methodological approach for further investigations in similar boreholes 2 hydrogeological settings and boreholes description the surveyed boreholes are located in the southern part of the aquitaine basin two boreholes labruguière lbg and valdurenque vld are located close to the eastern border of the basin and were drilled in 1990 for water monitoring down to respectively 177 and 129 m depth fig 1 they are equipped with stainless steel screened sections so the water flow is supposed to be better constrained the three other boreholes are old and deep wells initially drilled for oil exploration in the second half of the xxth century andré et al 2005 these wells were generally drilled to some kilometers depth they were converted later into groundwater monitoring boreholes by sealing their lower parts and by perforating the casing at a selected depth interval roche 1977 for example polastron po 101 well was drilled in 1957 down to 2751 m depth and is now perforated at only 818 5 828 5 m depth fig 1 i e there is no more water flow from horizons deeper than 828 5 m obstruction at 951 4 m depth muret 104 mu 104 well is perforated at 1031 6 1040 m depth and lacquy lc 101 well is perforated at 435 445 m depth in the former oil exploration wells po 101 mu 104 and lc 101 water flows locally through perforations in the steel casing but the water flow is less constrained than in screened intervals because perforations were made using isolated explosive charges and the connectivity to the aquifer can be variable from one borehole to the other nevertheless their long term water table monitoring suggests that some hydraulic connectivity to the aquifer remains last as the casing material is steel sampling depths have to be considered with care regarding the potential influence of corrosion on water quality if water is not renewed pohlmann and alduino 1992 the studied boreholes tap one of the major aquifer system of the aquitaine basin the fg082 aquifer ades 2020 formed by sands limestones and dolomites of paleocene to eocene age this aquifer is one of the main water resources in the basin and is used for several applications over its wide extent drinking water irrigation thermal and hydrothermal resources and gas storage in aquifer andré et al 2002 2005 brenot et al 2015 most of this fg082 aquifer 99 3 of its surface is confined this aquifer has highly variable chemical characteristics in relation with a variety of lithologies and a large range of depth from tens of meters to several hundreds this paleocene to eocene aquifer encloses indeed aquifer formations from danian limestone and selandian sandstone and gravel sands ages which are tapped below 1500 m depth in the center of the basin and aquifer formations from the ypresian to lutetian age which are tapped by lc 101 po 101 mu 104 and lbg at lower depths fig 1 the ypresian to lutetian aquifer is also called the infra molassic sand aquifer and is formed by sands and gravels with possible minor intercalations of sandy clays last the vld borehole taps slightly younger formations from the lutetian age so called gravel clays little information is known on the hydraulic properties of the deep boreholes tapping the paleocene eocene aquifer with the exception of water table monitoring data that are not discussed here siges aqi 2020 on the three deep boreholes information is available for mu 104 bss eau 2020a and to a lesser extent for po 101 berard and sourisseau 1998 the storage coefficient of mu 104 at c a 1000 m in the infra molassic sands is only 1 5 10 4 thus confirming the confined character of the aquifer the transmissivity 1 8 10 5 m2 s 1 and the estimated permeability 1 0 10 6 m s 1 are low too for mu 104 borehole the yield rate of po 101 was not evaluated by pumping during its conversion into a piezometer but by the means of swabbing that again suggested a low productivity afbag 1974 the two shallower boreholes lbg and vld have storage coefficients of 1 0 10 2 suggesting that the confined character exists even close to the recharge area the productivity is also low transmissivities of 6 5 10 5 m2 s 1 for lbg and 5 0 10 5 m2 s 1 for vld as for hydraulic properties only little information is available on water quality at depth and most of the available data are for equipped boreholes deep sampling in such boreholes is publicly reported only once together with physico chemical characterization of the water column but far above the perforations négrel et al 2008 3 methods 3 1 borehole characterization because the integrity of old boreholes is poorly constrained endoscopic camera inspections were completed in some boreholes lc 101 and po 101 prior to any other investigation in order to check borehole integrity this diagnostic has not been done in the shallower boreholes lbg and vld because they benefit from better knowledge physico chemical logging has been done in lbg and vld by brgm and in lc 101 and po 101 by a subcontractor hydro assistance physico chemical logging has been done first under natural flow conditions and if possible during and or after pumping in order to help in locating the water inflows in the boreholes probes used were idronaut 303 or 316 models equipped with pressure temperature electrical conductivity ph redox and dissolved oxygen sensors no endoscopic or physico chemical logging were done in mu 104 3 2 pumping the strategy of pumping also differed from boreholes to others there was no pumping in mu 104 sequential pumping was performed in the shallow boreholes lbg and vld using a 2 in pump max flow rate 2 m3 h 1 a larger pump 4 in was used by the subcontractor to produce water from po 101 flow rate 4 3 m3 h 1 and lc 101 flow rate 4 m3 h 1 3 3 deep sampling deep sampling was performed using the brgm gog for gaz o gaz proprietary system gal et al 2014 2017 like the u tube system freifeld et al 2005 the gog sampling system is based on the use of ball check valve operated by pressure of a neutral gas nitrogen the gas pressure is applied to the drive leg and the sample is collected from a second leg the sample leg fig 2 unlike the u tube system the gog system is a mobile and retrievable system made of flexible tubing polyamide which can be lowered to any depth in a borehole if the system is operated several times in a borehole logging like information can be obtained this allows e g performing several sampling in a perforated horizon in order to optimize the efficiency of valve functioning and to operate with reasonable gas pressure the ball check valve is deployed under 250 m of water column at maximum the nitrogen pressure to apply to get water flowing at the surface is thus 25 bars plus some additional bars linked to pressure losses in the range of admissible pressure of the flexible pipe working pressure 25 bars burst pressure 50 bars below the ball check valve a unique leg with a ballast is deployed down to the desired sampling depth it acts as a straw when deployed it fills with water from the entire water column a purging phase is thus needed to get water from the horizon to be sampled in case of little depth changes from one location in the borehole to the other the geometry of the gog system is fixed and defined prior the investigations fig 2 in case of large interval between the sampling depths mu 104 the system is retrieved at the surface and its geometry adapted between each use of the system by geometry the gog system has an internal capacity of 1 25 l per 100 m of leg deployed under the water level the total volume of water is thus 2 5 l per 100 m between the valve and the water level the duration of a cycle i e the time between the end of one water flow and the following one is 15 min fig 2 describes the working principle of the gog system 3 4 laboratory analyses major elements were analysed for lbg vld lc 101 mu 104 and po 101 trace elements were analysed for lbg vld lc 101 and po 101 samples were filtrated 0 45 µm on site and acidified when required isotopes of the water molecule δ18o and δd and isotope of the sulfates δ18oso4 and δ34sso4 were determined for mu 104 and po 101 the characterization of lc 101 samples is not discussed here other isotope characterizations were done for lc 101 and po 101 and are discussed by barrière et al 2019 4 results 4 1 endoscopic inspection prior characterizing groundwater using depth specific sampling it is important to get as many information as possible about the well completion in that perspective endoscopic inspections were performed in lc 101 and po 101 camera investigations were stopped prematurely in lc 101 because an oil supernatant was observed above the water table a skimming pumping of 4 m3 had therefore to be done the po 101 borehole has been investigated down to the perforated horizon the video record showed a casing in relatively good conditions with minor oxidation above the water level some scalings are visible above the perforated section and over the perforations 818 829 m the borehole is obstructed at 951 m possibly by sediments from the above perforations 4 2 pumping and physico chemical logging because it is important to assess if deep boreholes can be used for deep sampling and subsequent chemical characterization whatever their use some of them were investigated more in details in order to better understand their own dynamics these investigations were done in two steps step 1 characterizations enclose well logging at equilibrium conditions and deep sampling then followed by pumping and a second deep sampling session at the levels previously monitored this approach was used first in the shallow boreholes lbg and vld in order to define the best approach and then at po 101 for step 2 characterizations deep sampling is only performed after pumping lc 101 this approach was not used at mu 104 where deep sampling was performed without any preliminary characterization 4 2 1 boreholes characterized before and after pumping shallow wells the results of physico chemical logging of the shallow lbg and vld boreholes are given in fig 3 only one logging operation was previously reported in lbg borehole négrel et al 2006 but only down to 100 m bgl i e in the cased section so that no information exist on the physico chemical evolution in the screened section albeit the lbg and vld boreholes are shallow they have a specific response to pumping directly linked to their transmissivities the lbg borehole cannot be pumped at high flow rate during the investigations the maximum flow rate was 1 1 m3 h 1 and it induced a drawdown of 19 m in 3 h the pumping had then to be stopped to prevent dewatering of the submersible pump the water level recovery after pumping is slow with 9 m in 3 h the vld borehole was pumped at a slightly higher flow rate 2 m3 h 1 and the maximum drawdown was 8 m in 4 h the rise in water level after pumping is faster with 6 m in 15 min as earlier mentioned the lbg and vld boreholes were logged several times prior during and after pumping for each borehole the pumping was operated over 3 days with periods of rest in lbg 7 3 m3 were abstracted in 8 5 h representing 1 6 times the volume of the water column in vld 14 6 m3 were abstracted in 9 h representing 3 5 times the volume of the water column these values are in line with those recommended for getting a representative sample e g us epa 1999 but they were reached over a 3 days period which underlines the very low productivity of vld and especially lbg boreholes as these boreholes are punctually surveyed for water quality purposes a better understanding on the way they behave is thus important under natural flow conditions fig 3 lbg had a linear temperature profile with an increase of 2 97 c 100 m very close to the mean geothermal gradient no thermal gradient could be seen from 10 to 30 m below ground level in vld and the measured gradient under 30 m was lower than at lbg with a mean value of 2 44 c 100 m this may be related to different ground conditions the existence of shallower aquifers which modifies the local gradient at vld the ph and redox evolution of lbg and vld were similar with ph values higher and redox values lower in the cased section probably because of interaction with steel the shape of electrical conductivity curves was different there was no change between the cased section and the screened section in vld whereas the electrical conductivity was higher in the cased section of lbg again for lbg this argues for interaction with the casing for vld it may suggest the existence of well bore flow as may be postulated with the temperature log both dissolved oxygen values were close to zero in the cased section and this remained only valid in the screened section for lbg for vld there was some remaining dissolved oxygen in the aquifer the fact that oxygen did not exist in the cased section of vld does not argue for well bore flow the shape of the profiles evolved when the boreholes were pumped sequentially fig 3 the progressive renewal of water in the cased section was particularly well illustrated for lbg the electrical conductivity ph and redox profiles became vertical from bottom to top further suggesting that the water inflow was mostly originated from the bottom part of the screened section the last 20 m from the electrical conductivity profile it may be inferred that the renewal of 1 6 times the volume of the water column 7 3 m3 is the lowest admissible limit for column renewal because the conductivity at 45 m depth is still 5 higher than the conductivity at 150 170 m depth any lower abstracted volume may lead to erroneous characterization of the aquifer water as shown by the conductivity profile obtained after the purge of 1 6 m3 i e after 1 5 h of pumping this is a demonstration of the need to purge boreholes even if they have low water production when sampling is done by pumping this pumping phase is less critical for vld borehole indeed the electrical conductivity profile was already vertical prior to pumping and the situation remains the same when pumping the ph redox and dissolved oxygen profiles did also verticalize albeit there was a rise of the oxygen data in the upper section of the casing probably related to air intrusion in the borehole the location of the water inflow was again in the lower part of the cased section a closer look to the conductivity profile and especially the temperature profile infers that the thermal profile was a step profile horizons of stable temperature alternating with horizons of steep gradient as indicated by the arrows on fig 3 horizons characterized by temperature steep gradient are logically productive levels suggesting that water inflow in vld is the result of the mixing of several productive levels at least 3 4 2 2 boreholes characterized before and after pumping deep wells the results of physico chemical logging of the deep po 101 borehole are given in fig 4 under natural conditions po 101 showed a nearly vertical profile of the electrical conductivity down to 780 m depth with values slightly increasing from 1020 to 1170 µs cm 1 at 25 c correlatively the ph increased from 8 6 to 9 4 the redox potential was reducing in accordance with the absence of dissolved oxygen such profiles characterize the interaction of a stagnant water with the steel casing these profiles argue for the absence of casing failure as already suggested by the video inspection additionally there is no developed upward migration of water from the bottom to the surface the thermal gradient is linear demonstrating that there is no influence of water migration outside the casing this gradient is consistent with the mean geothermal gradient 3 2 c 100 m the physico chemical logging demonstrates that the water inflow is originated from horizons below 780 m depth likely from the perforated interval this water inflow is particularly noticeable on the electrical conductivity data fig 4 within a few meters from 815 to 828 m the value of the electrical conductivity doubles to reach 2300 to 2400 µs cm 1 in the meantime the value of the ph decreases to 8 2 the temperature gradient is also locally perturbed in the 780 840 m depth interval suggesting that some water circulates outside the casing between the ypresian formation the base of which is tapped by the perforations and the underlying paleocene aquifer and or the overlying lutetian formations based on this log it may be inferred that deep sampling performed without any borehole stimulation can bring water representative of the formation water in po 101 the log performed after pumping corroborates this observation a volume 17 2 m3 slightly greater than that of the water column between the pump set at 150 m depth and the perforations 16 5 m3 was abstracted in 4 h figs 1 and 4 after pumping the water column is entirely renewed as indicated by vertical electrical conductivity ph and redox logs the temperature log is modified by the action of pumping as warmer water is progressively drained from depth to the pump intake all these data point to the absence of water inflows above the perforated interval below this interval the physico chemical parameters are not modified indicating that the bottom hole is not productive the perforated interval is thus the only water provider in po 101 borehole 4 2 3 boreholes characterized only after pumping the lc 101 borehole was purged to skim the oil supernatant and no physico chemical logging could be done before this action the water column was logged with a rugged device equipped with only temperature and conductivity sensors two months after the skimming purge fig 4 shows the result of this logging the temperature profile is similar to a natural profile without pumping because the temperature gradient between the static level and 600 m depth is linear 3 2 c 100 m between 600 and 900 m depth the gradient is lower 1 9 c 100 m and it goes back to geothermal gradient below 3 1 c 100 m from 900 to 1200 m depth this suggests that some water movement exists outside casing between 600 and 900 m but the perforated interval is supposed to be well above 430 440 m fig 1 at this perforated level the electrical conductivity profile reached its lowest value close to 1100 µs cm 1 fig 4 this was likely a consequence of a water inflow which penetrates the borehole at the perforations level the conductivity profile above 430 m was smoothed compared to profiles obtained shortly after borehole purging fig 4 because of diffusive processes inducing the occurrence of a chemical gradient between low mineralized waters from the perforations and more mineralized waters in the cased section below 440 m the conductivity progressively increased up to 1600 µs cm 1 around 900 m depth depth from where the conductivity value varies little such a profile does not argue for the existence of other inflows at depth 4 3 water chemistry major elements and trace elements analyses are given in supplementary information for depth discrete samples and for samples obtained by pumping lbg and vld boreholes chemical balance of the analyses is between 3 and 1 4 3 1 quality of the depth specific samples an assessment of the representativeness of the samples acquired during the deep sampling operations and therefore a way to get a quality control on these depth specific samples is given in fig 6 this figure compares for the lbg borehole and for some parameters and dissolved elements concentrations the results obtained using the gog system and the results obtained using the classical pumping approach pump set at 45 m depth fig 1 the first two discrete samples at 130 and 163 m depth were taken without any wellbore purging with a circulation of respectively 10 l and 30 l of water in the system prior to sampling the electrical conductivity therefore represents the conductivity existing at 130 and 160 m depth under natural flow conditions fig 3 when some wellbore purging is done the water column homogenizes in the screened section and subsequent depth specific samples have minor variability in conductivity and dissolved elements fig 5 depth specific samples are thus representative of the chemistry of their respective depths at the time they were taken in the present case this may suggest that the 130 m depth horizon has a higher conductivity and is slightly more enriched in k than the 160 m depth horizon these differences disappear after the first purge of 1 6 m3 confirming that the 130 m depth horizon is not representative of most of the water from the aquifer secondly there is minor variability of the depth discrete samples taken when some water is abstracted from the borehole indicating that there is no contamination by the sampling system this is illustrated by the major and trace concentrations measured at 160 m depth which are invariant for all the samples whatever their time of collection before or after purging as expected the representativeness of samples obtained by pumping is much longer to obtain the abstraction of large volumes of water is required first to purge the volume of water between the pump and the top of the screens in the cased section this purge operates like the movement of a piston with renewed water gradually moving upward from the screened section to the cased section consequently the purge of more than 4 m3 is required to get water samples that have a similar composition than that obtained by discrete sampling at depth fig 5 for some trace elements even the purge of more than one water column volume is not sufficient to achieve representativeness as illustrated by sr and especially mn concentrations for these two elements depth discrete sampling gives more precise information perhaps indicating the existence of some heterogeneities in the aquifer to which pumping actions are blind 4 3 2 water chemistry there is a clear connection between the depth of the screened section or the perforated interval and the mineralization of the fluid supplementary information the shallowest borehole vld has the lowest mineralization total dissolved solids equivalent to 280 mg l 1 and the deepest one mu 104 the highest tds of 2920 mg l 1 two groups can be identified low concentrated waters tds 420 mg l 1 with dominant ca mg and hco3 and more mineralized waters tds 630 mg l 1 with dominant ca and cl so4 only the vld samples have measurable but low no3 amounts indicating that nitrate has not been completely reduced this is in agreement with the slightly oxidant character of the water the overall trend is an increase in mineralization with depth which is a classical trend in groundwaters in large sedimentary basins mineralization being generally associated to longer residence time and more interaction with the aquifer matrix also a connection can be seen between the depth of the water inflow and the content in trace elements and especially elements sensitive to water rock interaction processes the content in sr increases from 770 µg l 1 at vld to 3700 mg l 1 at mu 104 salinity indicators such as b or br when measured follow the same trend conversely higher concentrations in li can be seen in lbg greater than in mu 104 306 and 234 µg l 1 respectively suggesting an interaction with li rich rock matrix in relatively shallow environment 4 4 isotopes some isotope measurements were done on the samples collected in the deep boreholes supplementary information sulfur and oxygen isotopes of the dissolved sulfates and hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the water molecule were analyzed for mu 104 and po 101 sampling was performed before and after pumping in po 101 in order to determine if some variations occur when the borehole is partially purged the values are the same before and after pumping suggesting that direct deep sampling at the perforated depths can provide representative information at least for these isotopes the samples performed at several depths in mu 104 provide further information about representativeness along the water column especially at depths far from the perforated interval there is almost no change along the water column for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of the water molecule considering the uncertainty on the measurement at the opposite there is significant variation for the sulfates especially for the sulfur isotopes and to a lesser extent for the oxygen isotopes when the sampling is performed at the level of the perforations 1035 m the volume of water purged during deep sampling seems to have no influence on the result and this result probably reflects the real value of sulfur isotopes in the aquifer 5 discussion 5 1 certainties and uncertainties in the characterization of the paleocene eocene aquifer the goal is not to get an in depth description of the water rock interactions processes but rather to determine to what extent the new acquired data can be included in existing databases and if they put light on new findings data from vld borehole match the ideal expectations for the functioning of a borehole fig 6 supplementary information there is minor difference from one sample to the other whatever the monitoring approach and the depth of sampling the data are in good agreement with those reported just after the borehole was completed bss eau 2020b provided the sampling material is in good condition and some water renewal is allowed prior to sampling investigations in such a borehole are likely to bring representative samples when using a pump a similar observation can be made if the water is sampled using a deep sampling system provided it is deployed in the screened interval the best fit between deep sampling and pumping is obtained after one purging session one water column volume suggesting that some enhanced water production may be needed to renew the water column at depth albeit being located close to vld the lbg borehole has a more complex functioning as illustrated by figs 5 and 6 and supplementary information contrary to what is observed for vld all the new data differ from the data reported shortly after borehole completion in 1990 bss eau 2020c and from the data reported by brenot et al 2015 the data acquired after completion may be unrepresentative of the chemistry of the aquifer if the borehole development has not been fully achieved in relation with the low water production the water analysis reported in 2015 is surprisingly enriched in cl and so4 and depleted in mg and no obvious explanation can be suggested this sample was taken in 2006 négrel et al 2006 and at this time borehole logging was done only down to 100 m below ground level so the complete renewal of the water column could not be checked if the pumping was too short to renew the whole water column then part of the discrepancy may be related to changes in water chemistry resulting from interactions with the casing indeed a similar enrichment in k or cl was measured in the first sample taken while in the lbg borehole fig 5 but no mg depletion or so4 enrichments can be seen while purging the water chemistry progressively shifts to more and more reproducible values the comparison with deep sampling is informative as such some differences can be seen between the first two downhole samples at 130 and 163 m depth and only the last one appears to be representative of the chemistry obtained at the end of well pumping fig 5 this confirms that the water inflow in lbg borehole occurs mostly from the bottom of the screened interval as earlier demonstrated by physico chemical logging as the purge increases the water at 130 m depth is progressively renewed by the upward flow leading to a convergence of chemical data at the end of the sampling session at that time all the water in the screened interval has been completely renewed and even higher up to the pump intake as a consequence downhole sampling if performed in the screened interval and where water flows in can bring interpretable data even if performed without preliminary water abstraction nevertheless some pumping actions may be operated as a quality insurance approach in order to ensure that some water production has occurred at depth a good representativeness of water samples can thus be obtained when the deep sampling system is driven in the appropriate sections of boreholes conversely sampling in inappropriate depth leads to erroneous characterizations as demonstrated in fig 7 with mu 104 samples the first sampling done at 250 m depth has a chemical composition similar to that of the analysis reported by brenot et al 2015 at a similar depth if this demonstrates some reproducibility in the sampling actions over years this does not mean that this 250 m depth sample is representative of the chemistry of the eocene aquifer this is clearly illustrated by the chemical composition of deeper samples 500 750 and 1035 m there is a progressive enrichment along the casing in mg and ca and to a lesser extent in so4 path a in fig 7 and conversely a progressive depletion in alkalinity and a ph decrease supplementary material the same pattern can be observed in time while increasing the volume of water abstracted using the gog system at the perforations depth path b in fig 7 without reaching the 1965 data obtained when the borehole was converted into a piezometer this 1965 sample reveals a high mineralization of the water about 3 6 g l clearly higher than the water sampled in the same geologic formation in neighbor wells about 0 5 g l vandenberghe 1966 according to the author the sample is not representative of the formation water because of the many cleaning operations after perforating high amounts of hydrochloric acid hcl and ammonium hydrogen fluoride f2h nh4 acid were injected in 1965 and only half of these amounts were pumped back the consequence was the measurement of high concentrations of chloride 572 mg l and fluoride 17 mg l which are still observable today at the bottom of the well assuming that the 1965 data were not representative of the aquifer chemistry at the time of collection then the new data confirm that the contamination by chloride and fluoride is still present 50 years later this reveals an insufficient water renewal at depth through the perforations and a too low purged volume about 60 l from the 1035 m depth nevertheless even if the representativeness of the 1035 m depth samples may be questioned the behavior of dissolved species at 1035 m and in the water column can be discussed first the ca content at 1035 m depth is consistent with a water in equilibrium at 45 c with calcite and a pco2 close to 10 3 5 atm according to calculations with phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 2013 then the alkalinity increase in the cased section path c in fig 7 is probably due to two chemical processes occurring in the water column i corrosion of the casing involving a ph increase and a decrease of mg ca and mn concentrations nilsson and sandberg 2017 and ii sulfate reduction by micro organisms as revealed by sulfate isotopes see following paragraph the sulfate reduction involves the production of sulfides about 1 mmol l under hs form because of ph conditions increasing the alkalinity of waters and the decrease of their redox potential the sulfate reduction seems to be the main process impacting sulfate since the precipitation of so4 rich phases anhydrite gypsum is not supported by calculation of saturation indexes which are always negative and thus not indicating developed precipitation another process can decrease the concentration in sulfate fig 8 reports the evolution of s and o isotopes of the so4 for mu 104 and po 101 there is no change of isotope signature for po 101 when comparing samples acquired before and after water abstraction by pumping this suggests that water flow through perforations at depth is sufficiently developed in po 101 and that representative samples can be obtained after a minor purge the two samples obtained at 1035 m in mu 104 also have very comparable isotope values albeit their concentrations in so4 are slightly different when including the samples obtained in the cased section the s isotope ratios still point to an origin of the sulfates related to interactions with evaporitic formations as earlier reported by andré 2002 andré et al 2002 and brenot et al 2015 but their plot with the o isotope values of the so4 black arrow in the right inset of fig 8 leans from high ratios to lower ones as a function of depth the information obtained at the level of the perforations is very close to the endmember representing the interaction with local evaporites in their 2015 paper brenot et al reported a value obtained with a sampling at 250 m and they suggested that such a sampling may not be representative this non representativeness is clearly established here with the new results there is no need to refer to mixing between endmembers to attribute the origin of sulfates in mu 104 this origin is the same as for many other boreholes tapping the eocene aquifer but depending on the sampling depth sulfate reduction processes occur in the casing and strongly alter the isotope signature of the sulfates it is interesting to mention that not all the isotope ratios are modified by a long contact period with steel casing an example can be found in supplementary information with the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of the water molecule all the samples collected in the water column of mu 104 point to the same isotope value minor variation being linked to the uncertainty on the measurement the data obtained at 250 m depth give thus reliable indication on the recharge processes experienced by the mu 104 waters the samples from po 101 follow the same rule with minor variations when sampled before or after borehole pumping 5 2 learnings from borehole characterization and deep sampling the first outcome is for relatively shallow boreholes lbg and vld tapped sections located from around 100 to 160 m bgl in such boreholes downhole sampling can be performed with a high level of confidence provided the completion of the borehole is known and the levels of water flow in the screened interval are located in the absence of good knowledge of waters flows and the evolution of the borehole equipment some water abstraction may be required to ensure water renewal in the screened section the second outcome is for deep boreholes and it splits into several subgroups when the water flow is supposed to be not too low as in po 101 deep sampling can be operated without water abstraction the situation becomes then similar to that of shallow boreholes because knowing if water flows are not too low if the screens are not scaled or if the completion is not damaged is often tricky complementary actions may be required before sampling downhole to ensure of representativeness of the sampling action the first is to perform water abstraction to ensure some water renewal this may provide information on continued existence of connectivity with the aquifer by following the water level over time but this does not provide information on the levels from which water is produced this information can be obtained by flow logging in a borehole but also from deep sampling operations deep sampling performed in the perforations screens prior to pumping and repeated when the pumping is active with potentially displacement of the sample intake of the system helps to locate where there is some water renewal at depth and therefore where there is connectivity to the aquifer because these operations may be time consuming the use of alternative information sources such as water logging and or video inspection may be preferred but in turn such investigations may become costly as a result there is often a lack of knowledge of the functioning of deep boreholes which is regrettable from a representativeness point of view this may result in biased understanding of the aquifer chemical properties and reporting of non representative data in spite of this lack of characterization of the water flows in deep boreholes the present study has demonstrated that the combined used of deep sampling techniques and preliminary abstraction of a water volume equivalent to that of the screened section perforated interval may be sufficient to get realistic description of the water mass 6 conclusions deep sampling techniques were used to characterize the eocene aquifer in the aquitaine basin the observed boreholes ranged from 130 to more than 1000 m in depth thus excluding or making the use of a pump complex and costly a monitoring strategy has been defined by performing sequential pumping and frequent water logging in the shallower boreholes this suggested that deep sampling can be done with virtually no purge provided the borehole geometry is known and the productive levels are located because this may not be the case a better approach is to perform some water abstraction to renew the water at the productive level s before doing deep sampling complementary investigations such as video inspection and water logging give a better constraining of the sampling actions this strategy has been applied to selected deep boreholes albeit they were not all characterized in the same way investigations have demonstrated that good reproducibility can be obtained by deep sampling when water flow is not too low even without a purging step in low yield boreholes some preliminary water abstraction may be required in view of getting samples that are more representative an alternative approach is to have a purge like phase with several uses of the deep sampling system prior getting samples for subsequent laboratory analyses if the water is sampled from the cased section or correlatively if the purging phase not associated with deep sampling is not sufficiently developed to produce renewed water at the surface then the characterization of the aquifer chemistry can be biased loss or gain of elements or shift in isotope signatures the recommended approach to use for deep borehole characterization is to abstract a volume of water equivalent to that of the screened interval or if unrealistic to activate enhance water circulation in the screened interval by abstracting several hundreds of liters of water some water will be produced by the productive levels even the low yield ones and appropriate deepening of the sampling system in these levels will allow getting representative samples credit authorship contribution statement f gal conceptualization methodology investigation data curation writing original draft visualization

4706,groundwater sampling in boreholes has been carried out for decades according to well established protocols and regulations an important requirement in this context is the need to purge the borehole prior to any sampling action the volume of the purge being adapted to the water flow and the regulatory context contaminated site investigations have introduced the concept of water column heterogeneity in the screened section of boreholes which also occurs in some uncontaminated boreholes or in long screened boreholes specific guidelines and practices were thus introduced in particular the concept of discrete sampling this type of sampling can be advantageously used in deep boreholes provided that there is some renewal of water at the screens or the perforated intervals the present study aims to take a step forward in the characterization of deep boreholes set up in the aquitaine basin in france by defining a protocol for relatively short boreholes depth 170 m and applying it to much deeper boreholes formerly drilled for oil and gas exploration sampling up to 1035 m deep acquisitions were performed to better characterize water chemistry including some isotope considerations they were based on physico chemical logging and endoscopic inspections where technically possible after a review of the information provided by the investigations on the characterization of the paleocene eocene aquifer in southwestern france a methodology is proposed to make sampling in deep boreholes with low yield more reliable by combining the abstraction of a reduced water volume and the use of a downhole sampling system keywords deep borehole downhole sampling water sample representativeness 1 introduction water sampling and especially groundwater sampling in boreholes which is the focus of this study has been performed for decades either for regulatory purposes water drinking regulations or for a better knowledge of aquifers best practice guidelines were defined early e g rainwater and thatcher 1960 and have evolved regularly since then based on feedbacks from field operators and regulators e g brown et al 1970 wood 1976 gibb et al 1981 lallemand barrès 1993 in europe the focus was placed on best practices thanks to the first regulatory framework for groundwater in the end of the 1970s directive 80 68 ec subsequent directives namely the water framework directive wfd in 2000 directive 2000 60 ec and its daughter directive on groundwater in 2006 directive 2006 118 ec have completed the corpus these directives aimed to achieve good quantitative and chemical status for water bodies supposedly by 2015 as a result a large literature is available worldwide to help in better sampling and thus characterizing groundwaters e g ofev 2003 usgs 2006 duncan et al 2007 ministère du développement durable de l environnement et des parcs du québec 2011 ghestem et al 2017 moreover most of the guidelines are in accordance with those from the iso standards and more specifically the 5667 standard and its parts iso 5667 11 2009 one of the main principle exposed in these guidelines is the need of purging a borehole prior to any sampling barcelona and helfrich 1986 this is because the water in the screened section is renewed due to flow patterns but the water above the screened section is not and is therefore not representative of the groundwater us epa 1999 in most cases the flow pattern in the screened section is lateral and directly related to that of the aquifer as a function of its transmissivity but well bore flow vertical mixing may occur especially in open holes and boreholes with long or multiple screened sections usgs 2006 additionally water sampling from boreholes that cannot produce a continuously pumped sample or boreholes in which water level recovery takes longer than 24 h after being pumped is not recommended usgs 2006 apart from these cases the general rule is to evacuate at least one volume of water in the well casing and preferably three to five volumes to get a representative sample us epa 1999 depending on the flowrate of the pump the pump intake will be located either above the screened section high flow rate pump or in the screened section low flow rate pump in order to avoid damaging screens and displacing the gravel pack besides these guidelines several exceptions to the rule exist for example on contaminated sites where volatile organic compounds may be monitored barcelona et al 1994 or in open holes in fractured bedrock shapiro 2002 in such cases other pumping strategies may be required because sampling results have been demonstrated to be sensitive to well purging rate the volume of abstracted water and the disturbance created by downhole pumping gibb et al 1981 from an assumption of homogeneity of the water column in the screened section the view progressively shifted to the highlight of the role of heterogeneity in the water column as in geological logs puls and barcelona 1996 this led to the development of low flow purging techniques puls and powell 1992 which have demonstrated their usefulness in small diameter boreholes equipped with short screened intervals barcelona et al 1994 2005 and to the use of inflatable packers where screened intervals are long or in open holes smellie and wikberg 1991 shapiro 2002 later on other systems for discrete sampling at low flow have been designed the model 401 waterloo multilevel system solinst cherry and johnson 1982 the continuous multichannel technology system solinst einarson and cherry 2002 the water flute flexible liner underground technologies ltd co cherry et al 2007 or the westbay mp system westbay instruments inc black et al 1986 such sampling systems are mostly used in shallow boreholes 100 m and benefit from a large number of sampling points allowing discrete and precise characterization of the water column chapman et al 2015 nevertheless some of these systems have a far larger investigation depth up to 1200 m for the westbay system einarson 2005 these systems appear to be relevant for site specific borehole monitoring but they require dedicated borehole completions in the case of pre existing boreholes implementing such systems may turn out to be costly i e if there is no need of permanent or regular monitoring of the aquifer provided the borehole diameter is adapted einarson 2005 when the depth of investigation has to be further extended the use of multi ports systems is less common with the exception of the u tube sampling system a positive fluid displacement pump using a high pressure gas drive and valves designed for carbon capture and storage applications and operated through a dedicated completion freifeld et al 2005 the u tube system was deployed down to 2870 m conaway et al 2016 and nested deployments allowing multi level sampling are also reported boreham et al 2011 if the sampling system has to be retrievable sampling may rely on downhole in situ sampling systems the use of electric submersible pumps and sampling systems used in the oil industry is not considered for cost reasons crombie et al 1998 wolff boenisch and evans 2014 downhole sampling systems are namely positive displacement samplers vacuum samplers and flow through samplers wolff boenisch and evans 2014 these samplers need to be driven down to the desired sampling depth with a wireline and valve mechanisms allow fluid sampling by means of pressure differential positive displacement and vacuum samplers or not flow through sampler we present here the results of investigations performed on some deep boreholes of the aquitaine basin in southwest france between 2014 and 2018 the acquisitions were not all done under the same project so that focus and outcomes may differ from one well to the other deep sampling was always performed to characterize the water chemistry characterization of the gas contents is not presented here in some cases physico chemical logging was performed prior the investigations to assess the evolution of parameters along the water column in boreholes that are not used for water supply some pumping phases were also done in selected boreholes to evaluate if relevant deep sampling can be performed without any well bore purging or not though the data were acquired to improve the knowledge on deep aquifers in this large sedimentary basin they are mainly used to define an approach to get reliable estimates of the chemistry of deep aquifers and therefore to set a methodological approach for further investigations in similar boreholes 2 hydrogeological settings and boreholes description the surveyed boreholes are located in the southern part of the aquitaine basin two boreholes labruguière lbg and valdurenque vld are located close to the eastern border of the basin and were drilled in 1990 for water monitoring down to respectively 177 and 129 m depth fig 1 they are equipped with stainless steel screened sections so the water flow is supposed to be better constrained the three other boreholes are old and deep wells initially drilled for oil exploration in the second half of the xxth century andré et al 2005 these wells were generally drilled to some kilometers depth they were converted later into groundwater monitoring boreholes by sealing their lower parts and by perforating the casing at a selected depth interval roche 1977 for example polastron po 101 well was drilled in 1957 down to 2751 m depth and is now perforated at only 818 5 828 5 m depth fig 1 i e there is no more water flow from horizons deeper than 828 5 m obstruction at 951 4 m depth muret 104 mu 104 well is perforated at 1031 6 1040 m depth and lacquy lc 101 well is perforated at 435 445 m depth in the former oil exploration wells po 101 mu 104 and lc 101 water flows locally through perforations in the steel casing but the water flow is less constrained than in screened intervals because perforations were made using isolated explosive charges and the connectivity to the aquifer can be variable from one borehole to the other nevertheless their long term water table monitoring suggests that some hydraulic connectivity to the aquifer remains last as the casing material is steel sampling depths have to be considered with care regarding the potential influence of corrosion on water quality if water is not renewed pohlmann and alduino 1992 the studied boreholes tap one of the major aquifer system of the aquitaine basin the fg082 aquifer ades 2020 formed by sands limestones and dolomites of paleocene to eocene age this aquifer is one of the main water resources in the basin and is used for several applications over its wide extent drinking water irrigation thermal and hydrothermal resources and gas storage in aquifer andré et al 2002 2005 brenot et al 2015 most of this fg082 aquifer 99 3 of its surface is confined this aquifer has highly variable chemical characteristics in relation with a variety of lithologies and a large range of depth from tens of meters to several hundreds this paleocene to eocene aquifer encloses indeed aquifer formations from danian limestone and selandian sandstone and gravel sands ages which are tapped below 1500 m depth in the center of the basin and aquifer formations from the ypresian to lutetian age which are tapped by lc 101 po 101 mu 104 and lbg at lower depths fig 1 the ypresian to lutetian aquifer is also called the infra molassic sand aquifer and is formed by sands and gravels with possible minor intercalations of sandy clays last the vld borehole taps slightly younger formations from the lutetian age so called gravel clays little information is known on the hydraulic properties of the deep boreholes tapping the paleocene eocene aquifer with the exception of water table monitoring data that are not discussed here siges aqi 2020 on the three deep boreholes information is available for mu 104 bss eau 2020a and to a lesser extent for po 101 berard and sourisseau 1998 the storage coefficient of mu 104 at c a 1000 m in the infra molassic sands is only 1 5 10 4 thus confirming the confined character of the aquifer the transmissivity 1 8 10 5 m2 s 1 and the estimated permeability 1 0 10 6 m s 1 are low too for mu 104 borehole the yield rate of po 101 was not evaluated by pumping during its conversion into a piezometer but by the means of swabbing that again suggested a low productivity afbag 1974 the two shallower boreholes lbg and vld have storage coefficients of 1 0 10 2 suggesting that the confined character exists even close to the recharge area the productivity is also low transmissivities of 6 5 10 5 m2 s 1 for lbg and 5 0 10 5 m2 s 1 for vld as for hydraulic properties only little information is available on water quality at depth and most of the available data are for equipped boreholes deep sampling in such boreholes is publicly reported only once together with physico chemical characterization of the water column but far above the perforations négrel et al 2008 3 methods 3 1 borehole characterization because the integrity of old boreholes is poorly constrained endoscopic camera inspections were completed in some boreholes lc 101 and po 101 prior to any other investigation in order to check borehole integrity this diagnostic has not been done in the shallower boreholes lbg and vld because they benefit from better knowledge physico chemical logging has been done in lbg and vld by brgm and in lc 101 and po 101 by a subcontractor hydro assistance physico chemical logging has been done first under natural flow conditions and if possible during and or after pumping in order to help in locating the water inflows in the boreholes probes used were idronaut 303 or 316 models equipped with pressure temperature electrical conductivity ph redox and dissolved oxygen sensors no endoscopic or physico chemical logging were done in mu 104 3 2 pumping the strategy of pumping also differed from boreholes to others there was no pumping in mu 104 sequential pumping was performed in the shallow boreholes lbg and vld using a 2 in pump max flow rate 2 m3 h 1 a larger pump 4 in was used by the subcontractor to produce water from po 101 flow rate 4 3 m3 h 1 and lc 101 flow rate 4 m3 h 1 3 3 deep sampling deep sampling was performed using the brgm gog for gaz o gaz proprietary system gal et al 2014 2017 like the u tube system freifeld et al 2005 the gog sampling system is based on the use of ball check valve operated by pressure of a neutral gas nitrogen the gas pressure is applied to the drive leg and the sample is collected from a second leg the sample leg fig 2 unlike the u tube system the gog system is a mobile and retrievable system made of flexible tubing polyamide which can be lowered to any depth in a borehole if the system is operated several times in a borehole logging like information can be obtained this allows e g performing several sampling in a perforated horizon in order to optimize the efficiency of valve functioning and to operate with reasonable gas pressure the ball check valve is deployed under 250 m of water column at maximum the nitrogen pressure to apply to get water flowing at the surface is thus 25 bars plus some additional bars linked to pressure losses in the range of admissible pressure of the flexible pipe working pressure 25 bars burst pressure 50 bars below the ball check valve a unique leg with a ballast is deployed down to the desired sampling depth it acts as a straw when deployed it fills with water from the entire water column a purging phase is thus needed to get water from the horizon to be sampled in case of little depth changes from one location in the borehole to the other the geometry of the gog system is fixed and defined prior the investigations fig 2 in case of large interval between the sampling depths mu 104 the system is retrieved at the surface and its geometry adapted between each use of the system by geometry the gog system has an internal capacity of 1 25 l per 100 m of leg deployed under the water level the total volume of water is thus 2 5 l per 100 m between the valve and the water level the duration of a cycle i e the time between the end of one water flow and the following one is 15 min fig 2 describes the working principle of the gog system 3 4 laboratory analyses major elements were analysed for lbg vld lc 101 mu 104 and po 101 trace elements were analysed for lbg vld lc 101 and po 101 samples were filtrated 0 45 µm on site and acidified when required isotopes of the water molecule δ18o and δd and isotope of the sulfates δ18oso4 and δ34sso4 were determined for mu 104 and po 101 the characterization of lc 101 samples is not discussed here other isotope characterizations were done for lc 101 and po 101 and are discussed by barrière et al 2019 4 results 4 1 endoscopic inspection prior characterizing groundwater using depth specific sampling it is important to get as many information as possible about the well completion in that perspective endoscopic inspections were performed in lc 101 and po 101 camera investigations were stopped prematurely in lc 101 because an oil supernatant was observed above the water table a skimming pumping of 4 m3 had therefore to be done the po 101 borehole has been investigated down to the perforated horizon the video record showed a casing in relatively good conditions with minor oxidation above the water level some scalings are visible above the perforated section and over the perforations 818 829 m the borehole is obstructed at 951 m possibly by sediments from the above perforations 4 2 pumping and physico chemical logging because it is important to assess if deep boreholes can be used for deep sampling and subsequent chemical characterization whatever their use some of them were investigated more in details in order to better understand their own dynamics these investigations were done in two steps step 1 characterizations enclose well logging at equilibrium conditions and deep sampling then followed by pumping and a second deep sampling session at the levels previously monitored this approach was used first in the shallow boreholes lbg and vld in order to define the best approach and then at po 101 for step 2 characterizations deep sampling is only performed after pumping lc 101 this approach was not used at mu 104 where deep sampling was performed without any preliminary characterization 4 2 1 boreholes characterized before and after pumping shallow wells the results of physico chemical logging of the shallow lbg and vld boreholes are given in fig 3 only one logging operation was previously reported in lbg borehole négrel et al 2006 but only down to 100 m bgl i e in the cased section so that no information exist on the physico chemical evolution in the screened section albeit the lbg and vld boreholes are shallow they have a specific response to pumping directly linked to their transmissivities the lbg borehole cannot be pumped at high flow rate during the investigations the maximum flow rate was 1 1 m3 h 1 and it induced a drawdown of 19 m in 3 h the pumping had then to be stopped to prevent dewatering of the submersible pump the water level recovery after pumping is slow with 9 m in 3 h the vld borehole was pumped at a slightly higher flow rate 2 m3 h 1 and the maximum drawdown was 8 m in 4 h the rise in water level after pumping is faster with 6 m in 15 min as earlier mentioned the lbg and vld boreholes were logged several times prior during and after pumping for each borehole the pumping was operated over 3 days with periods of rest in lbg 7 3 m3 were abstracted in 8 5 h representing 1 6 times the volume of the water column in vld 14 6 m3 were abstracted in 9 h representing 3 5 times the volume of the water column these values are in line with those recommended for getting a representative sample e g us epa 1999 but they were reached over a 3 days period which underlines the very low productivity of vld and especially lbg boreholes as these boreholes are punctually surveyed for water quality purposes a better understanding on the way they behave is thus important under natural flow conditions fig 3 lbg had a linear temperature profile with an increase of 2 97 c 100 m very close to the mean geothermal gradient no thermal gradient could be seen from 10 to 30 m below ground level in vld and the measured gradient under 30 m was lower than at lbg with a mean value of 2 44 c 100 m this may be related to different ground conditions the existence of shallower aquifers which modifies the local gradient at vld the ph and redox evolution of lbg and vld were similar with ph values higher and redox values lower in the cased section probably because of interaction with steel the shape of electrical conductivity curves was different there was no change between the cased section and the screened section in vld whereas the electrical conductivity was higher in the cased section of lbg again for lbg this argues for interaction with the casing for vld it may suggest the existence of well bore flow as may be postulated with the temperature log both dissolved oxygen values were close to zero in the cased section and this remained only valid in the screened section for lbg for vld there was some remaining dissolved oxygen in the aquifer the fact that oxygen did not exist in the cased section of vld does not argue for well bore flow the shape of the profiles evolved when the boreholes were pumped sequentially fig 3 the progressive renewal of water in the cased section was particularly well illustrated for lbg the electrical conductivity ph and redox profiles became vertical from bottom to top further suggesting that the water inflow was mostly originated from the bottom part of the screened section the last 20 m from the electrical conductivity profile it may be inferred that the renewal of 1 6 times the volume of the water column 7 3 m3 is the lowest admissible limit for column renewal because the conductivity at 45 m depth is still 5 higher than the conductivity at 150 170 m depth any lower abstracted volume may lead to erroneous characterization of the aquifer water as shown by the conductivity profile obtained after the purge of 1 6 m3 i e after 1 5 h of pumping this is a demonstration of the need to purge boreholes even if they have low water production when sampling is done by pumping this pumping phase is less critical for vld borehole indeed the electrical conductivity profile was already vertical prior to pumping and the situation remains the same when pumping the ph redox and dissolved oxygen profiles did also verticalize albeit there was a rise of the oxygen data in the upper section of the casing probably related to air intrusion in the borehole the location of the water inflow was again in the lower part of the cased section a closer look to the conductivity profile and especially the temperature profile infers that the thermal profile was a step profile horizons of stable temperature alternating with horizons of steep gradient as indicated by the arrows on fig 3 horizons characterized by temperature steep gradient are logically productive levels suggesting that water inflow in vld is the result of the mixing of several productive levels at least 3 4 2 2 boreholes characterized before and after pumping deep wells the results of physico chemical logging of the deep po 101 borehole are given in fig 4 under natural conditions po 101 showed a nearly vertical profile of the electrical conductivity down to 780 m depth with values slightly increasing from 1020 to 1170 µs cm 1 at 25 c correlatively the ph increased from 8 6 to 9 4 the redox potential was reducing in accordance with the absence of dissolved oxygen such profiles characterize the interaction of a stagnant water with the steel casing these profiles argue for the absence of casing failure as already suggested by the video inspection additionally there is no developed upward migration of water from the bottom to the surface the thermal gradient is linear demonstrating that there is no influence of water migration outside the casing this gradient is consistent with the mean geothermal gradient 3 2 c 100 m the physico chemical logging demonstrates that the water inflow is originated from horizons below 780 m depth likely from the perforated interval this water inflow is particularly noticeable on the electrical conductivity data fig 4 within a few meters from 815 to 828 m the value of the electrical conductivity doubles to reach 2300 to 2400 µs cm 1 in the meantime the value of the ph decreases to 8 2 the temperature gradient is also locally perturbed in the 780 840 m depth interval suggesting that some water circulates outside the casing between the ypresian formation the base of which is tapped by the perforations and the underlying paleocene aquifer and or the overlying lutetian formations based on this log it may be inferred that deep sampling performed without any borehole stimulation can bring water representative of the formation water in po 101 the log performed after pumping corroborates this observation a volume 17 2 m3 slightly greater than that of the water column between the pump set at 150 m depth and the perforations 16 5 m3 was abstracted in 4 h figs 1 and 4 after pumping the water column is entirely renewed as indicated by vertical electrical conductivity ph and redox logs the temperature log is modified by the action of pumping as warmer water is progressively drained from depth to the pump intake all these data point to the absence of water inflows above the perforated interval below this interval the physico chemical parameters are not modified indicating that the bottom hole is not productive the perforated interval is thus the only water provider in po 101 borehole 4 2 3 boreholes characterized only after pumping the lc 101 borehole was purged to skim the oil supernatant and no physico chemical logging could be done before this action the water column was logged with a rugged device equipped with only temperature and conductivity sensors two months after the skimming purge fig 4 shows the result of this logging the temperature profile is similar to a natural profile without pumping because the temperature gradient between the static level and 600 m depth is linear 3 2 c 100 m between 600 and 900 m depth the gradient is lower 1 9 c 100 m and it goes back to geothermal gradient below 3 1 c 100 m from 900 to 1200 m depth this suggests that some water movement exists outside casing between 600 and 900 m but the perforated interval is supposed to be well above 430 440 m fig 1 at this perforated level the electrical conductivity profile reached its lowest value close to 1100 µs cm 1 fig 4 this was likely a consequence of a water inflow which penetrates the borehole at the perforations level the conductivity profile above 430 m was smoothed compared to profiles obtained shortly after borehole purging fig 4 because of diffusive processes inducing the occurrence of a chemical gradient between low mineralized waters from the perforations and more mineralized waters in the cased section below 440 m the conductivity progressively increased up to 1600 µs cm 1 around 900 m depth depth from where the conductivity value varies little such a profile does not argue for the existence of other inflows at depth 4 3 water chemistry major elements and trace elements analyses are given in supplementary information for depth discrete samples and for samples obtained by pumping lbg and vld boreholes chemical balance of the analyses is between 3 and 1 4 3 1 quality of the depth specific samples an assessment of the representativeness of the samples acquired during the deep sampling operations and therefore a way to get a quality control on these depth specific samples is given in fig 6 this figure compares for the lbg borehole and for some parameters and dissolved elements concentrations the results obtained using the gog system and the results obtained using the classical pumping approach pump set at 45 m depth fig 1 the first two discrete samples at 130 and 163 m depth were taken without any wellbore purging with a circulation of respectively 10 l and 30 l of water in the system prior to sampling the electrical conductivity therefore represents the conductivity existing at 130 and 160 m depth under natural flow conditions fig 3 when some wellbore purging is done the water column homogenizes in the screened section and subsequent depth specific samples have minor variability in conductivity and dissolved elements fig 5 depth specific samples are thus representative of the chemistry of their respective depths at the time they were taken in the present case this may suggest that the 130 m depth horizon has a higher conductivity and is slightly more enriched in k than the 160 m depth horizon these differences disappear after the first purge of 1 6 m3 confirming that the 130 m depth horizon is not representative of most of the water from the aquifer secondly there is minor variability of the depth discrete samples taken when some water is abstracted from the borehole indicating that there is no contamination by the sampling system this is illustrated by the major and trace concentrations measured at 160 m depth which are invariant for all the samples whatever their time of collection before or after purging as expected the representativeness of samples obtained by pumping is much longer to obtain the abstraction of large volumes of water is required first to purge the volume of water between the pump and the top of the screens in the cased section this purge operates like the movement of a piston with renewed water gradually moving upward from the screened section to the cased section consequently the purge of more than 4 m3 is required to get water samples that have a similar composition than that obtained by discrete sampling at depth fig 5 for some trace elements even the purge of more than one water column volume is not sufficient to achieve representativeness as illustrated by sr and especially mn concentrations for these two elements depth discrete sampling gives more precise information perhaps indicating the existence of some heterogeneities in the aquifer to which pumping actions are blind 4 3 2 water chemistry there is a clear connection between the depth of the screened section or the perforated interval and the mineralization of the fluid supplementary information the shallowest borehole vld has the lowest mineralization total dissolved solids equivalent to 280 mg l 1 and the deepest one mu 104 the highest tds of 2920 mg l 1 two groups can be identified low concentrated waters tds 420 mg l 1 with dominant ca mg and hco3 and more mineralized waters tds 630 mg l 1 with dominant ca and cl so4 only the vld samples have measurable but low no3 amounts indicating that nitrate has not been completely reduced this is in agreement with the slightly oxidant character of the water the overall trend is an increase in mineralization with depth which is a classical trend in groundwaters in large sedimentary basins mineralization being generally associated to longer residence time and more interaction with the aquifer matrix also a connection can be seen between the depth of the water inflow and the content in trace elements and especially elements sensitive to water rock interaction processes the content in sr increases from 770 µg l 1 at vld to 3700 mg l 1 at mu 104 salinity indicators such as b or br when measured follow the same trend conversely higher concentrations in li can be seen in lbg greater than in mu 104 306 and 234 µg l 1 respectively suggesting an interaction with li rich rock matrix in relatively shallow environment 4 4 isotopes some isotope measurements were done on the samples collected in the deep boreholes supplementary information sulfur and oxygen isotopes of the dissolved sulfates and hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the water molecule were analyzed for mu 104 and po 101 sampling was performed before and after pumping in po 101 in order to determine if some variations occur when the borehole is partially purged the values are the same before and after pumping suggesting that direct deep sampling at the perforated depths can provide representative information at least for these isotopes the samples performed at several depths in mu 104 provide further information about representativeness along the water column especially at depths far from the perforated interval there is almost no change along the water column for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of the water molecule considering the uncertainty on the measurement at the opposite there is significant variation for the sulfates especially for the sulfur isotopes and to a lesser extent for the oxygen isotopes when the sampling is performed at the level of the perforations 1035 m the volume of water purged during deep sampling seems to have no influence on the result and this result probably reflects the real value of sulfur isotopes in the aquifer 5 discussion 5 1 certainties and uncertainties in the characterization of the paleocene eocene aquifer the goal is not to get an in depth description of the water rock interactions processes but rather to determine to what extent the new acquired data can be included in existing databases and if they put light on new findings data from vld borehole match the ideal expectations for the functioning of a borehole fig 6 supplementary information there is minor difference from one sample to the other whatever the monitoring approach and the depth of sampling the data are in good agreement with those reported just after the borehole was completed bss eau 2020b provided the sampling material is in good condition and some water renewal is allowed prior to sampling investigations in such a borehole are likely to bring representative samples when using a pump a similar observation can be made if the water is sampled using a deep sampling system provided it is deployed in the screened interval the best fit between deep sampling and pumping is obtained after one purging session one water column volume suggesting that some enhanced water production may be needed to renew the water column at depth albeit being located close to vld the lbg borehole has a more complex functioning as illustrated by figs 5 and 6 and supplementary information contrary to what is observed for vld all the new data differ from the data reported shortly after borehole completion in 1990 bss eau 2020c and from the data reported by brenot et al 2015 the data acquired after completion may be unrepresentative of the chemistry of the aquifer if the borehole development has not been fully achieved in relation with the low water production the water analysis reported in 2015 is surprisingly enriched in cl and so4 and depleted in mg and no obvious explanation can be suggested this sample was taken in 2006 négrel et al 2006 and at this time borehole logging was done only down to 100 m below ground level so the complete renewal of the water column could not be checked if the pumping was too short to renew the whole water column then part of the discrepancy may be related to changes in water chemistry resulting from interactions with the casing indeed a similar enrichment in k or cl was measured in the first sample taken while in the lbg borehole fig 5 but no mg depletion or so4 enrichments can be seen while purging the water chemistry progressively shifts to more and more reproducible values the comparison with deep sampling is informative as such some differences can be seen between the first two downhole samples at 130 and 163 m depth and only the last one appears to be representative of the chemistry obtained at the end of well pumping fig 5 this confirms that the water inflow in lbg borehole occurs mostly from the bottom of the screened interval as earlier demonstrated by physico chemical logging as the purge increases the water at 130 m depth is progressively renewed by the upward flow leading to a convergence of chemical data at the end of the sampling session at that time all the water in the screened interval has been completely renewed and even higher up to the pump intake as a consequence downhole sampling if performed in the screened interval and where water flows in can bring interpretable data even if performed without preliminary water abstraction nevertheless some pumping actions may be operated as a quality insurance approach in order to ensure that some water production has occurred at depth a good representativeness of water samples can thus be obtained when the deep sampling system is driven in the appropriate sections of boreholes conversely sampling in inappropriate depth leads to erroneous characterizations as demonstrated in fig 7 with mu 104 samples the first sampling done at 250 m depth has a chemical composition similar to that of the analysis reported by brenot et al 2015 at a similar depth if this demonstrates some reproducibility in the sampling actions over years this does not mean that this 250 m depth sample is representative of the chemistry of the eocene aquifer this is clearly illustrated by the chemical composition of deeper samples 500 750 and 1035 m there is a progressive enrichment along the casing in mg and ca and to a lesser extent in so4 path a in fig 7 and conversely a progressive depletion in alkalinity and a ph decrease supplementary material the same pattern can be observed in time while increasing the volume of water abstracted using the gog system at the perforations depth path b in fig 7 without reaching the 1965 data obtained when the borehole was converted into a piezometer this 1965 sample reveals a high mineralization of the water about 3 6 g l clearly higher than the water sampled in the same geologic formation in neighbor wells about 0 5 g l vandenberghe 1966 according to the author the sample is not representative of the formation water because of the many cleaning operations after perforating high amounts of hydrochloric acid hcl and ammonium hydrogen fluoride f2h nh4 acid were injected in 1965 and only half of these amounts were pumped back the consequence was the measurement of high concentrations of chloride 572 mg l and fluoride 17 mg l which are still observable today at the bottom of the well assuming that the 1965 data were not representative of the aquifer chemistry at the time of collection then the new data confirm that the contamination by chloride and fluoride is still present 50 years later this reveals an insufficient water renewal at depth through the perforations and a too low purged volume about 60 l from the 1035 m depth nevertheless even if the representativeness of the 1035 m depth samples may be questioned the behavior of dissolved species at 1035 m and in the water column can be discussed first the ca content at 1035 m depth is consistent with a water in equilibrium at 45 c with calcite and a pco2 close to 10 3 5 atm according to calculations with phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 2013 then the alkalinity increase in the cased section path c in fig 7 is probably due to two chemical processes occurring in the water column i corrosion of the casing involving a ph increase and a decrease of mg ca and mn concentrations nilsson and sandberg 2017 and ii sulfate reduction by micro organisms as revealed by sulfate isotopes see following paragraph the sulfate reduction involves the production of sulfides about 1 mmol l under hs form because of ph conditions increasing the alkalinity of waters and the decrease of their redox potential the sulfate reduction seems to be the main process impacting sulfate since the precipitation of so4 rich phases anhydrite gypsum is not supported by calculation of saturation indexes which are always negative and thus not indicating developed precipitation another process can decrease the concentration in sulfate fig 8 reports the evolution of s and o isotopes of the so4 for mu 104 and po 101 there is no change of isotope signature for po 101 when comparing samples acquired before and after water abstraction by pumping this suggests that water flow through perforations at depth is sufficiently developed in po 101 and that representative samples can be obtained after a minor purge the two samples obtained at 1035 m in mu 104 also have very comparable isotope values albeit their concentrations in so4 are slightly different when including the samples obtained in the cased section the s isotope ratios still point to an origin of the sulfates related to interactions with evaporitic formations as earlier reported by andré 2002 andré et al 2002 and brenot et al 2015 but their plot with the o isotope values of the so4 black arrow in the right inset of fig 8 leans from high ratios to lower ones as a function of depth the information obtained at the level of the perforations is very close to the endmember representing the interaction with local evaporites in their 2015 paper brenot et al reported a value obtained with a sampling at 250 m and they suggested that such a sampling may not be representative this non representativeness is clearly established here with the new results there is no need to refer to mixing between endmembers to attribute the origin of sulfates in mu 104 this origin is the same as for many other boreholes tapping the eocene aquifer but depending on the sampling depth sulfate reduction processes occur in the casing and strongly alter the isotope signature of the sulfates it is interesting to mention that not all the isotope ratios are modified by a long contact period with steel casing an example can be found in supplementary information with the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of the water molecule all the samples collected in the water column of mu 104 point to the same isotope value minor variation being linked to the uncertainty on the measurement the data obtained at 250 m depth give thus reliable indication on the recharge processes experienced by the mu 104 waters the samples from po 101 follow the same rule with minor variations when sampled before or after borehole pumping 5 2 learnings from borehole characterization and deep sampling the first outcome is for relatively shallow boreholes lbg and vld tapped sections located from around 100 to 160 m bgl in such boreholes downhole sampling can be performed with a high level of confidence provided the completion of the borehole is known and the levels of water flow in the screened interval are located in the absence of good knowledge of waters flows and the evolution of the borehole equipment some water abstraction may be required to ensure water renewal in the screened section the second outcome is for deep boreholes and it splits into several subgroups when the water flow is supposed to be not too low as in po 101 deep sampling can be operated without water abstraction the situation becomes then similar to that of shallow boreholes because knowing if water flows are not too low if the screens are not scaled or if the completion is not damaged is often tricky complementary actions may be required before sampling downhole to ensure of representativeness of the sampling action the first is to perform water abstraction to ensure some water renewal this may provide information on continued existence of connectivity with the aquifer by following the water level over time but this does not provide information on the levels from which water is produced this information can be obtained by flow logging in a borehole but also from deep sampling operations deep sampling performed in the perforations screens prior to pumping and repeated when the pumping is active with potentially displacement of the sample intake of the system helps to locate where there is some water renewal at depth and therefore where there is connectivity to the aquifer because these operations may be time consuming the use of alternative information sources such as water logging and or video inspection may be preferred but in turn such investigations may become costly as a result there is often a lack of knowledge of the functioning of deep boreholes which is regrettable from a representativeness point of view this may result in biased understanding of the aquifer chemical properties and reporting of non representative data in spite of this lack of characterization of the water flows in deep boreholes the present study has demonstrated that the combined used of deep sampling techniques and preliminary abstraction of a water volume equivalent to that of the screened section perforated interval may be sufficient to get realistic description of the water mass 6 conclusions deep sampling techniques were used to characterize the eocene aquifer in the aquitaine basin the observed boreholes ranged from 130 to more than 1000 m in depth thus excluding or making the use of a pump complex and costly a monitoring strategy has been defined by performing sequential pumping and frequent water logging in the shallower boreholes this suggested that deep sampling can be done with virtually no purge provided the borehole geometry is known and the productive levels are located because this may not be the case a better approach is to perform some water abstraction to renew the water at the productive level s before doing deep sampling complementary investigations such as video inspection and water logging give a better constraining of the sampling actions this strategy has been applied to selected deep boreholes albeit they were not all characterized in the same way investigations have demonstrated that good reproducibility can be obtained by deep sampling when water flow is not too low even without a purging step in low yield boreholes some preliminary water abstraction may be required in view of getting samples that are more representative an alternative approach is to have a purge like phase with several uses of the deep sampling system prior getting samples for subsequent laboratory analyses if the water is sampled from the cased section or correlatively if the purging phase not associated with deep sampling is not sufficiently developed to produce renewed water at the surface then the characterization of the aquifer chemistry can be biased loss or gain of elements or shift in isotope signatures the recommended approach to use for deep borehole characterization is to abstract a volume of water equivalent to that of the screened interval or if unrealistic to activate enhance water circulation in the screened interval by abstracting several hundreds of liters of water some water will be produced by the productive levels even the low yield ones and appropriate deepening of the sampling system in these levels will allow getting representative samples credit authorship contribution statement f gal conceptualization methodology investigation data curation writing original draft visualization

4707,river floodplains and reservoirs interact throughout a basin drainage network defining a coupled human water system with multiple feedbacks recent modeling developments have aimed to improve the representation of such processes at regional to continental scales however most large scale hydrological models adopt simplified lumped reservoir schemes where an offline routine is run with inflows estimated by the model with limited consideration of the complementarity between floodplains and reservoirs on altering the hydrological regime at regional scale this paper presents a novel approach that fully couples river floodplain reservoir hydrodynamic and hydrological models significantly improving the representation of reservoir dynamics and operation in the river floodplain reservoir continuum at large scale and across multiple dam cascades the model is applied to the paraná river basin with explicit simulation of 31 large dams and river hydraulic variables at basin scale three types of reservoir bathymetry representation are compared from lumped to distributed methods combined with three reservoir operation schemes and varying degrees of input data requirement within two parameterization scenarios global and regional setups the operation schemes were more relevant than the reservoir bathymetry representation to estimate downstream flows and water levels while the data driven operation scheme based on linear regressions between observed water levels and dam outflows provided the best estimates of both active storage and discharges the more generic operation reasonably estimated discharges and peak attenuation albeit not as accurately for active storage the global parameterization of reservoir operation resulted in poorer performance compared to the regional based one but it satisfactorily modeled discharge and peak attenuation regarding the reservoir bathymetry representation a basin scale comparison of the lumped and distributed schemes indicated the inability of the former to represent backwater effects this was further corroborated by validating the longitudinal water level profile of itaipu dam with icesat satellite altimetry data finally the model was used to show the complementarity between floodplains and reservoirs on attenuating floods at regional scale large scale models should move beyond offline coupling strategies and include regional based data driven reservoir operation schemes together with a distributed representation of reservoir bathymetry into river floodplain hydraulic schemes this will largely improve the estimation of river discharges water levels and flood storage and thus the model ability to represent the regional scale river floodplain reservoir continuum keywords hydrological modeling large scale

societies and ecosystems interact with dynamic two way feedbacks di baldassarre et al 2013 pande and sivapalan 2017 viglione et al 2014 at regional to continental scales this river floodplain reservoir continuum is associated to a complex relationship among surface water processes for example in the la plata river basin in south america dozens of large reservoirs have been built since the 1950 s interacting with complex wetland systems as the pantanal esteros del iberá and paraná floodplains minotti 2018 in the basin human society has settled around floodplains for centuries leading to a fully coupled human water system doyle and barros 2011 lee et al 2018 as the use and development of the floodplain by society evolve there is an increasing need to better understand the hydrodynamic interactions in this river floodplain reservoir continuum so that we can better design and operate water systems to cope with human and ecosystem demands considering hydrological uncertainty and current and future environmental changes regional to continental scale hydrological hydrodynamic models provide a unique opportunity to address these needs while recent advances in large scale modeling have improved our capability to simulate river floods at both 1d and 2d dimensions bates et al 2018 fleischmann et al 2020 neal et al 2012 paiva et al 2013 schumann et al 2013 trigg et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2011 most studies on reservoir simulation have focused on representing dam storage and operation i e a water management model within simpler hydrological models with less physically based flow routing methods droppers et al 2020 hanasaki et al 2018 yassin et al 2019 in the studies by mateo et al 2014 and pokhrel et al 2018 for instance a hydrodynamic model was run offline with observed or simulated dam outflows at the grid cell related to the dam in order to estimate alterations in downstream flooding difficulties for detailed reservoir simulation included the unknown bathymetry and specific dam operation at very large scales and are also a challenge only recently the hydrodynamics of dam cascades were explicitly included into regional hydrodynamic models shin et al 2019 fleischmann et al 2019a aiming at representing the river floodplain reservoir system with a fully coupled approach that allowed a distributed representation of variables as discharges water levels and flood extent and storage in human altered systems as the representation of these processes improves a better and integrated assessment of basin water resources and floods becomes possible examples include the understanding of the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation fleischmann et al 2019a more detailed simulation of evaporation shin et al 2019 and understanding of the reservoir influence on local climate degu et al 2011 hossain et al 2012 the representation of the reservoir dynamics itself and associated backwater effects and flooding in upstream areas and simulation of carbon cycle and phytoplankton dynamics e g lake emissions and degassing or downstream emissions bierkens et al 2015 can also benefit from such modeling systems ultimately these tools will provide an important basis towards a fully coupled and distributed human water modeling system within hyperresolution earth system models nazemi wheater 2015 pokhrel et al 2016 wood et al 2011 adopting detailed grids and daily temporal resolution gutenson et al 2020 zajac et al 2017 regarding the representation of dam operation in regional to global models there have been major improvements since the pioneering studies by hanasaki et al 2006 and haddeland et al 2006 which have been used and adapted for many studies adam et al 2007 van beek et al 2011 biemans et al 2011 pokhrel et al 2012 shin et al 2019 wisser et al 2010 since these first generic algorithms data driven reservoir operation schemes are now feasible while optimization methods have also been developed involving storage outflow and inflow observations solander et al 2016 wu and chen 2012 yassin et al 2019 and downstream water or energy demands haddeland et al 2006 all these developments highlight the ongoing necessity to better estimate actual reservoir operation in order to achieve hyperresolution models that are locally relevant cross scale comparisons among different approaches from simpler globally based to more complex regionally derived setups can yield meaningful insights on the ways forward especially using regionally set up models fleischmann et al 2019c nazemi and wheater 2015 trigg et al 2016 the need for a fully coupled approach was explicitly highlighted by some authors fleischmann et al 2019a shin et al 2019 however the benefits of representing the reservoir dynamics fully coupled within the river floodplain reservoir continuum processes with a distributed approach over the traditional lumped and offline representation remains a knowledge gap in the field of large scale modeling the extent to which simple level pool reservoir simulations i e lumped may lead to similar results as distributed i e dynamic more complex ones is not yet understood finally a correct reservoir operation also needs to be incorporated to improve our understanding of the human feedback in the river floodplain reservoir continuum this study brings a novel contribution to these gaps with an improved representation of the river floodplain reservoir interactions within hydrologic hydrodynamic models followed by a broad analysis of the continuum of hydraulic variables basin wide considering the reservoir operation effects the contributions of this study address three main research questions i what are the differences between simulating lumped and distributed reservoir bathymetry in coarse scale online coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic models in terms of different variables as water levels discharge flood extent and storage and evapotranspiration ii how do generic and more data driven reservoir operation schemes differ in terms of hydrological variables estimation in regional scale models and iii what is the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation in large scale systems considering basin wide hydrological processes to answer these questions new modeling approaches to improve reservoir representation and operation are proposed and tested in a 950 000 km2 watershed upper paraná river basin brazil different simulation scenarios are performed to assess the dynamics of reservoirs in

ana those are desirable characteristics to address in large scale modeling of river floodplain reservoir systems the paraná river is formed by the confluence of grande and paranaíba rivers in brazil with major tributaries being the tietê paranapanema ivaí and iguaçu rivers all in its left margin the upper paraná river basin has a drainage area of 950 000 km2 and it is among those with the largest hydropower installed capacity in the world and almost 50 of the installed hydropower capacity of brazil including the itaipu dam id 18 in fig 1 which is one of the largest dams in the world itaipu 2016 large cities as são paulo and brasília brazil federal capital are located within the basin which holds a population of nearly 70 million people the wet period usually occurs from november january to may june agostinho et al 2000 with average annual rainfall of about 1400 mm boulanger et al 2005 there are contrasting hydroclimatic regions throughout the basin with the northern regions presenting a seasonal precipitation regime and the southern ones a non seasonal regime the basin has 86 large dams 30 mw in operation with an installed capacity of 48 083 mw aneel 2020 fig 1 regarding proposed planned or under construction dams there are 500 small dams totalling 5643 mw of installed capacity and 58 large dams associated to 3909 mw aneel 2020 sixty two large dams are currently connected to the brazilian national interconnected system sin with 32 run of river and 30 flow regulation dams ons 2020 which are coordinately operated with other power sources e g thermal and wind to generate and distribute energy to the whole system by minimizing costs marques tilmant 2013 most dams are also operated with multiple uses such as flood control water supply and navigation overall there is a large hydrological alteration at the basin scale due to reservoir operation santos 2015 the extensive floodplains throughout the basin as the 230 km reach in the paraná mainstem between porto primavera and itaipu dams provide important ecosystem services agostinho et al 2001 2008 baumgartner et al 2018 2 2 hydrological and hydrodynamic representation of the river floodplain reservoir continuum the mgb model modelo de grandes bacias in portuguese an acronym meaning large basins model collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 is used to implement and test the proposed representation of the river floodplain reservoir continuum and reservoir operation it is a semi distributed hydrological hydrodynamic model developed to simulate large scale basins this model is chosen given its proven capability proven of simulation in several other river basins at different scales from regional to continental domains siqueira et al 2018 first the original mgb modeling approach is presented followed by the proposed improved representation of the reservoirs and their hydraulic and hydrodynamic relationships with the basin scale continuum in mgb s representation the basin is divided into unit catchments of equal river lengths and within each the model simulates vertical hydrological processes as evapotranspiration soil water infiltration and runoff generation from surface subsurface and groundwater reservoirs fig 2 local runoff is added as a lateral boundary condition to the drainage network and a hydrodynamic routing is performed to simulate river floodplains and reservoirs surface water dynamics soil and vegetation model parameters are defined for each hydrologic response units hru s within a given sub basin and the hru s are derived from a combination of soil and vegetation maps evapotranspiration is computed with the penman monteith equation for soil vegetated areas and penman equation for flooded areas i e assumed as open water a dynamic two way feedback between the hydrologic and hydrodynamic modules is also considered by which floodplain water can infiltrate into the unsaturated soil and evapotranspiration open water evaporation and runoff generation are dynamically computed considering the surface flooded fraction at each time step more details on the hydrological model are presented in supplementary material s2 and in collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 and siqueira et al 2018 recent mgb applications in the paraná basin with the simpler muskingum cunge flood routing scheme were performed in fleischmann et al 2019b and quedi and fan 2020 2 3 mgb model river floodplain hydrodynamic routing the local inertia explicit method proposed by bates et al 2010 is adopted within mgb to simulate 1d flow propagation along the drainage network this method is a simplification of saint venant equations neglecting the convective acceleration term from the momentum equation which has been proven satisfactory to represent flood wave transport along rivers at both 1d and 2d dimensions getirana et al 2017 neal et al 2012 siqueira et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2013 within mgb floodplains are represented as storage units i e they are ineffective areas without active flow river floodplain water exchange is instantaneous and water surface elevation is assumed the same along the river floodplain system within a given unit catchment paiva et al 2011 channel cross sections are assumed rectangular as typically adopted in large scale hydraulic modeling paiva et al 2013 trigg et al 2009 the flux between two adjacent unit catchments is computed with the discretized momentum eq 1 1 q out i t δ t q i t g b i δ t h i s i 1 g δ t q i t n 2 b i h i 7 3 where q out i t δ t is the discharge at unit catchment i at time t δ t n is the manning s coefficient h i the flow depth between unit catchments i and i 1 s i the water surface level slope δ t the model time step b i the flow width and g the gravitational acceleration the continuity equation can be approximated for each unit catchment river reach as 2 v i t δ t v i t δ t q in i t δ t q out i t δ t q local p i e i where v is the stored volume in unit catchment i q in i

relationship hypsometric curve for stages below bank elevation this is derived from the channel cross section for stages above bank elevation it represents the floodplain topography and it is obtained with a gis pre processing step that computes flooded areas associated to increments in height above nearest drainage values hand rennó et al 2008 extracted from the srtm digital elevation model dem siqueira et al 2018 effective hydraulic parameters that are required for each river reach are channel bed elevation cross section bankfull width and depth and manning roughness coefficient bed elevation is derived for each unit catchment from the average dem river network pixels siqueira et al 2018 subtracted by bankfull depth the hydrodynamic routing time step is determined by the courant friedrichs levy condition with an additional multiplier parameter for ensuring model numerical stability bates et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011 2 4 reservoir routing two main aspects differ the proposed improved reservoir representation from the original mgb river floodplain routing scheme first at the unit catchment corresponding to the dam location the momentum eq 1 is replaced by the dam outflow equation i e it is set as an internal boundary condition which is based on simple spillway or outlet works equations or on more complex reservoir operation derived from actual dam operational data second the reservoir storage and bathymetry is represented in mgb by adjusting the level volume relationship in the unit catchments located within the reservoir lake originally extracted from a dem if the dam did not exist during the dem acquisition date the storage is already represented in the level volume relationships and thus no correction is necessary in such cases it is only required to define the dam outflow equation on the other hand if the reservoir already existed the dem will likely miss the storage representation depicting a flat lake area instead this demands additional bathymetry information e g reservoir level storage relationships to correct the model these two main aspects were added to the mgb framework by fleischmann et al 2019a open water evaporation and direct precipitation on lake are considered in the same way as for floodplain areas in the improved reservoir representation proposed in this paper this scheme is further developed by considering different types of reservoir bathymetry representation section 2 5 and operation section 2 6 which are detailed in the next sections 2 5 reservoir storage representation to investigate the reservoir storage representation three different types of reservoir storage bathymetry representation are compared i a lumped representation of the reservoir storage by which all storage is concentrated in one only unit catchment associated to the dam location and a distributed method in which the storage is ii equally and iii variably split among all unit catchments that compound the reservoir lake thus allowing the representation of reservoir dynamics fig 2 bottom panel presents the schemes for the three simulation methods the lumped method i lum consists of concentrating the reservoir stage volume curve in this study provided by the brazilian national electric system operator ons on the unit catchment holding the dam location this method is analogous to a level pool routing method used in simpler reservoir routing schemes and mainly assuming a horizontal water surface along the reservoir this approaches a dynamic method ii and iii if reservoir length is short depth is large inflow hydrograph volume is large and inflow hydrograph time of rise is long fread 1992 unit catchments along the reservoir lake are considered as a river with rectangular cross section and the downstream boundary condition at the dam location is considered as a simplified uniform flow a local average slope was adopted in this case the equal bathymetry method ii eq consists of equally distributing the volume through the unit catchments that compose the reservoir for each level the reservoir water surface area is equally distributed to the unit catchments on the reservoir domain through the stage area relationship thus all the unit catchments that compose a reservoir have the same storage capacity the variable bathymetry method iii var explicitly simulates the reservoir dynamics to improve accuracy in the distribution of reservoir volume across the unit catchments associated to the reservoir lake since the dem usually measures the surface water level there is no information on it about the reservoir bathymetry for reservoirs built before the dem survey thus the proposed method estimates the stage area curve below the reservoir water level rwl and combines it with the stage area curve above the rwl to construct the reservoir actual stage volume curve which can be later checked against existing data in this study provided by the brazilian national electric system operator ons this method has four steps 1 estimation of the stage area curve above the rwl in a given unit catchment this process is automatically obtained using the dem information within a unit catchment by counting the number of cells lower than a specific elevation 2 estimation of the original river bank elevation in every unit catchment within the reservoir lake the original riverbanks i e in pristine conditions were inundated by the dam thus the bank elevation of all unit catchments that compose the reservoir were defined through a linear interpolation between the bank elevation just downstream of the dam and the one immediately upstream of the reservoir lake eq 3 3 z i z down z up z down δ x down i δ x down u p where z represents the bank elevation and δ x the distance between the river sections the indices i d o w n and up represent the sections of the i th unit catchment within the reservoir and the sections immediately downstream to the dam and upstream to the reservoir lake respectively 3 estimation of the stage area curve for the levels below rwl it is assumed that the water surface area below the rwl linearly increases with level and that the water surface area at the river bank elevation is zero thus the stage area curve below rwl is a line going from an area equal to zero at the river bank elevation z i to the first point in the stage area curve above rwl 4 matching the estimated reservoir stage volume curve with the actual one the reservoir stage volume is a table relating reservoir volume v o with level z it can be directly compared to the reservoir stage area curve built with the combination of all the unit catchments within the reservoir hereafter res which is a table relating area a res to level z in every position j on the stage area table a level increment z j z j 1 is multiplied by its related reservoir surface water area a res j a res j 1 2 resulting in an incremental volume δ v res j then the incremental volume observed on the stage volume curve related to the level z j δ v o j v o j v o j 1 is divided by the calculated incremental volume calculated from the stage area curve δ v res j generating a volume ratio v r j δ v o j δ v res j the stage area curve of each unit catchment i within the reservoir is recalculated independently to keep the same incremental volume as the actual stage volume curve 4 a res i j a res i j 1 v r j a res i j a res i j 1 5 a res i j v r j a res i j a res i j 1 a res i j 1 where a res i j is the water surface area of the unit catchment i at the stage area table position j related to level z j the superscript indicates the recalculated a values equations 4 and 5 indicate an adjustment on the water surface area in level z j in order to preserve the incremental volume indicated by the actual stage volume curve this process is repeated through all levels z 1 t o z n of the stage volume curve modifying the stage area curve of each unit catchment within the reservoir 2 6 reservoir operation the dam release is set as an internal boundary condition of the hydrodynamic model mgb by replacing eq 1 by a dam outflow equation three types of operation schemes are compared here considering two different approaches each one based on regionally available data and another with global based parameterization the three operation types are representative of different approaches that have been implemented in state of the art modeling systems from generic to data driven ones described as follows 2 6 1 reservoir operation schemes h06 and h06glob this is a generic inflow based operation based on the equation proposed by hanasaki et al 2006 and adapted by shin et al 2019 this operation considers that the dam outflow is a simple function of the inflow modulated by the dam regulation capacity and the storage at the beginning of each hydrological year here it is used at a daily basis and for hydropower plants so that it does not take into account downstream water demands for irrigation or other uses dam outflow is defined by eq 6 6 q i t r i k i y i m 1 r i i t 1 7 r i m i n 1 α c i 8 k i y s first y α c i where q i t is the i th dam outflow at the time step t r i a regulation capacity constant that can be calibrated with observations or estimated with eq 7 shin et al 2019 i m and i t 1 the annual average and dam inflow respectively and k i y the storage fraction at the beginning of the hydrological year eq 8 the hydrological year of each dam is defined as the month where the naturalized flow becomes lower than the average i e the beginning of the drawdown season hanasaki et al 2006 the term c i is the ratio between the reservoir maximum storage c i and the annual average dam inflow ratio c i c i i m s first y is the storage at the beginning of each hydrological year y and α c i is the target storage where α is a constant set to 0 85 following hanasaki et al 2006 scenario h06 estimates r from a calibration procedure based on regionally available observations while scenario h06glob global adopts eq 6 for estimating r 2 6 2 reservoir operation schemes 3pt and 3ptglob three point rule curve this is a target storage and release based rule yassin et al 2019 consisting of a three point rule built upon simple dam characteristic parameters as minimum and maximum operational levels and maximum discharges fig 3 a similar approaches were adopted by zajac et al 2017 and yassin et al 2019 this operation emulates a reservoir rule curve that is constant throughout the year with outflow as a linear function of water level guided by three points the regional approach scenario 3pt adopts the following points based on actual dam information i e observations minimum operational level for which outflow is zero average operational level for which outflow is obtained from the average observed outflow and maximum design level associated to the dam design discharge supplementary material s1 presents the adopted parameters for all dams scenario 3ptglob global approach follows zajac et al 2017 and adopts the percentiles 0 1 0 3 and 0 97 for the minimum conservative normal and maximum flood storages which are associated to the 5th 30th and 97th percentiles of naturalized daily discharge respectively 2 6 3 reservoir operation schemes reg and regglob regression based rule this is also a target storage and release based rule based on a data intensive approach fig 3b and c linear regressions are computed between observations of monthly average water levels and dam outflows so that it emulates a rule curve for each month of the year following the actual operation oliveira and loucks 1997 a similar operation was investigated by solander et al 2016 for each month positive relationships are adopted as those with pearson correlation higher than 0 4 which is considered satisfactory based on a visual inspection fig 3b for non positive relationships fig 3c the monthly average discharge was used for all simulated days for a given month for water levels out of the observed range for a given month dam characteristics related to minimum operational level for which outflow is zero and maximum design level dam design discharge were adopted and linearly interpolated with the observed ranges the global approach scenario regglob adopts the same long term outflow average for all simulation days instead of monthly regressions making the operation similar to the standard operating policy sop draper and lund 2004 considering the long term streamflow as the demand 2 7 model application in the upper paraná river basin the model was applied to the upper paraná river basin with daily time step for the period 1st jan 1979 to 31st dec 2015 35 years 1 spin up year it was run with in situ daily precipitation from 2030 gauges from the following institutions brazilian national water agency ana water resources agency of argentina bdhi http bdhi hidricosargentina gov ar and national meteorological and hydrological service of paraguay dmh https www meteorologia gov py details on precipitation data interpolation to model units are provided in supplementary material s2 long term climate averages from 195 stations of the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet available at http www inmet gov br were used to dynamically compute evapotranspiration with the penman monteith equation within the model drainage network and unit catchments total of 9625 units with 10 km long river reaches were derived from the 90 m hydrosheds srtm dem lehner et al 2008 with the iph hydrotools gis toolkit siqueira et al 2016 hydrologic response units hru s were used to define homogeneous regions for the rainfall runoff parameters and were derived from the south america hru map developed by fan et al 2015 model parameters related to soil vegetation and river hydraulics bankfull width and depth from geomorphic relationships and manning s roughness coefficient are further discussed in supplementary material s2 the model was calibrated for the period 1990 2010 and validated for 1980 1990 with 143 in situ discharge gauges from ana considering the pristine scenario i e without reservoirs naturalized flows from ons were considered for gauges downstream of dams supplementary material s2 presents details on the model adjustment including performance metrics and simulated hydrographs overall the model satisfactorily represented natural discharges basin wide with 78 and 79 of the gauges with nse and nselog 0 6 respectively and 42 of the gauges with the absolute value of bias 10 the 30 regulation dams within sin were considered in addition to itaipu dam a run of river dam but very relevant in terms of size and energy production fig 1 for simplicity all other run of river reservoirs were not considered in the simulations since our focus was on dams with regulation capacity to properly address basin wide flow regulation the dams were only considered after their year of inauguration so that the model simulated the dam first filling the effects of reservoirs were not used for model calibration but only considered for the scenarios presented in the following section 3 3 experimental design a total of 12 simulation scenarios were run considering the different reservoir bathymetry representation and reservoir operation schemes table 1 the performance of a given reservoir simulation was first assessed in terms of discharge and active storage for all dams observed time series of active storage and dam outflows were obtained from ana https www ana gov br sar the hydrodynamics was assessed in terms of the water surface elevation longitudinal profile at itaipu dam by comparing simulations with satellite altimetry estimates from the icesat mission schutz et al 2005 icesat carries a lidar sensor and has a maximum inter track distance of 30 km and a repeat cycle of 91 days icesat vertical datum was converted to egm96 in order to be consistent with the srtm datum reference a basin scale assessment was also made by computing for each river reach the root mean squared deviation rmsd between simulated water levels under scenarios lum eq and var table 1 model performance for discharge was assessed with nash sutcliffe nse and log nash sutcliffe nselog i e nse considering the logarithm of discharges normalized root mean squared error nrmse of peak discharges and relative errors in high q10 i e discharge that is exceeded 10 of the time and low flows q90 i e discharge that is exceeded 90 of the time for reservoir active storage the nrmse and pearson correlation metrics were used finally the average peak attenuation for each dam was assessed by first computing the discharge reduction between dam inflow and outflow for each of the dam s maximum annual events followed by estimation of the average of the annual values the simulated peak attenuation was compared to the observed one with the nrmse metric the role of the online coupling between hydrology and hydrodynamic processes was tested by performing tests with and without coupling in section 4 1 the simulation without coupling was performed by considering that evapotranspiration only occurs from the non flooded soil vegetation system i e reservoir open water evaporation is not considered into the evapotranspiration computation since there is high uncertainty on the estimation of the active flow width b in eq 1 along the reservoir when it is simulated in a distributed way i e reservoir storage types eq and var section 2 5 hydrographs are presented in section 4 1 considering two types of computation i adopting the original channel width estimated from geomorphic relationships and ii considering the active width for unit catchments within reservoirs as the unit catchment flooded area divided by its length 10 km i e considering that there is active flow along the whole reservoir cross section area finally the developed regional scale hydrodynamic model was used to investigate the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation this was carried out following the approach by fleischmann et al 2019a where the model was run with three river floodplain scenarios i pristine flow scenario naturalized flow with floodplains but without reservoirs ii without both floodplains and reservoirs where cross sections were assumed always rectangular and thus disregarding floodplain topography and iii with both floodplains and reservoirs the role of reservoirs on flood attenuation was estimated by computing the peak attenuation between scenarios i and iii for the maximum flood event of each simulation year the role of floodplains was similarly computed but considering the difference between scenarios ii and i table 1 summarizes the model runs 4 results 4 1 effects of reservoir storage representation this section presents the results and differences in the reservoir dynamics according to the storage representation approaches lum eq var while all schemes yielded similar estimates of dam outflows as exemplified for a few dams in fig 4 a some key differences were identified in some cases the lumped method led to a discharge attenuation in relation to the other two methods smaller and delayed peaks this is due to the typical approach adopted on large scale hydrological modeling in the lumped offline simulation i e using as inflows the simulated discharges at the dam location instead of computing the inflows as the modeled flows at the river reaches close to the most upstream reservoir lake area this approach causes the flood wave to be routed along the reservoir as it was a river reach adding artificial routing along the drainage network hence for lumped model applications it is better to select all tributaries that drain into the reservoir along with direct lake inputs and consider it as the dam inflow this effect was clearer for itaipu dam which is located in the lower part of the basin integrating the effects of all upstream dams and having a long reservoir our results show that simpler lumped reservoir models can simulate downstream discharge similarly to dynamic and distributed ones fig 4a however the lumped method fails to represent backwater effects when compared to the distributed methods equal and variable bathymetry fig 5 a high deviation among lum and var scenarios rmsd 10 m for some reservoirs occurs for most reaches upstream from dams as a validation experiment icesat satellite altimetry data were used to assess the simulated profile of water surface elevation along itaipu reservoir under the three different storage schemes fig 5b the lumped method is unable to simulate it properly and the slope in the upstream part of the lake was better represented with the variable bathymetry method an intermediate behavior was obtained with the equal bathymetry one although this method considers the reservoir to behave as a large box with a horizontal water level the lake is assumed as connected to the rest of the drainage network and thus the method is capable to represent backwater on the other hand the actual level in the lake area closer to the dam is more dependent on the dam operation and its simplification led to higher errors in the estimated itaipu reservoir storage for instance the low water level in oct 2003 lake level closest to the dam at 216 6 m fig 5b is related to the low simulated active storage around 14 km3 see fig 6 d in next section while actual values were around 219 3 m for level and 18 1 km3 for storage itaipu is also a large dam 170 km long and its lake is composed of many mgb unit catchments which are 10 km long the hydrographs presented in fig 4a also compare different ways of representing flow width in the distributed reservoir simulation bold lines as well as scenarios with and without reservoir open water evaporation i e not considering an online hydrologic hydrodynamic coupling dashed lines downstream discharges had mostly similar values indicating a low sensitivity of discharges to both flow width conceptualization and the online coupling scheme regarding evapotranspiration estimates differences among lum eq and var scenarios would arise if reservoir flooded areas were largely divergent but this difference was relatively small in comparison to other model uncertainties our estimations of reservoir evaporation rates are in agreement with other studies in the paraná basin de bueno et al 2016 looking at the basin scale we estimated an increase of annual et rates by 15 mm year due to existence of reservoirs the net reservoir evaporation i e reservoir evaporation minus the evapotranspiration that would occur without the lake which is equal to the difference between blue and red lines in fig 4b for the assessed lakes varied between 21 12 mm month mean sd for itaipu and 70 41 mm month for itumbiara located in the north of the basin id 19 in fig 1 this loss can be relevant during dry periods and thus must be accounted for in large scale models for instance loss in energy production due to reservoir evaporation in the brazilian southeast region was estimated as 2 over 900 mw zambon et al 2018 and it is also an important measure to assess regional scale reservoirs water footprint semertzidis et al 2019 at itumbiara dam the modeled evapotranspiration was highly constrained by soil moisture during austral winter what explains the large net evaporation losses this difference led to a higher peak simulated under the scenario without open water evaporation fig 4a when looking at finer scales evapotranspiration rates will drastically differ since the lumped offline method is not able to represent the dynamic conversion between dry and flooded soil vegetation the representation of local scale coupled processes between surface and atmosphere will perform poorly as well as the local scale runoff estimation 4 2 effects of reservoir operation this section compares the different reservoir operation h06 3pt reg in order of increasing data requirement and storage bathymetry representation schemes lum eq var addressed in terms of dam outflow and reservoir hydrodynamics the differences among the simulated operation schemes are larger than among the reservoir bathymetry types for discharge and active storage estimation figs 6 and 7 results for the same four dams analyzed in the previous section show that the reg operation scheme led to far better outflow estimation for itumbiara and itaipu dams in these cases operations h06 and 3pt also outperformed the natural flows scenario i e without reservoir effects the overall model performance in representing basin wide hydrologic regime alteration as depicted by itaipu dam shows that the best performance was obtained for reg nse 0 69 followed by h06 0 47 and 3pt 0 19 and that all of them outperformed the scenario without dams 0 26 for itumbiara the better performance of reg for outflow compared to the other scenarios can be seen in the better depicted seasonality also reflected on the storage simulation for foz do areia dam located in a river with low precipitation seasonality all model versions led to similar estimates as the natural flow scenario i e the inclusion of reservoirs did not lead to improvements the simulation performance for active storage nrmse was similarly satisfactory for the four dams and all scenarios except for itaipu under operation reg which outperformed the others by significant margins 9 for reg against 23 and 27 for h06 and 3pt respectively a similar behavior was observed when looking at the ensemble of 31 dams figs 7 and 8 which was supported by a basin wide assessment for the whole drainage network supplementary material s3 the highest differences were obtained for discharge nse where reg had the best performance followed by h06 and 3pt and for active storage r for which reg was followed by 3pt and h06 indeed a more satisfactory performance was expected for reg given its more data intensive nature the three point rules 3ptlum 3pteq 3ptvar and 3ptglobvar had the lowest performance for discharge in terms of nse but this was not the case for high q10 and low flows q90 and peak discharges interestingly for low flows all operation types were outperformed by the natural flow scenario showing that the tested operations led to excessive discharge attenuation i e overestimated base flows during dry periods the operation scheme reg which relies on observed data provided the best discharge estimates with a median nse of 0 3 and a maximum of 0 75 for the 31 reservoirs although the basin wide hydrological alteration was relatively well captured e g at itaipu dam location fig 6 the non data intensive schemes h06 and 3pt need further improvements if aiming at locally relevant estimates of dam operation the analysis of regional h06 3pt reg versus global based parameterizations h06glob 3ptglob regglob showed that the global ones had a relatively poorer performance in relation to their regional counterparts for instance the regression with monthly values regglob considering long term averages as outflow presented the poorest performance for peak nrmse and high and low flows while 3ptglobvar scenario presented the poorest representation of active storage however for certain purposes these global approaches could already provide valuable discharge estimates e g for providing a general understanding of regional scale hydrological alteration for example median nse values were 0 1 0 1 for scenario h06 h06glob and 0 3 0 1 for reg regglob showing the just slightly better performance of the regional parameterization the global setups were also more accurate than naturalized flows for all metrics except for low flows there was an overall satisfactory model performance to estimate peak attenuation with pearson correlation between 0 72 and 0 91 and nrmse between 10 and 22 fig 8 the different types of storage representation led to very similar nrmse values between simulation and observation and the same occurred for the reservoir operation although h06 was slightly better than 3pt which in turn was marginally better than reg this is interesting given the low degree of data requirement in the h06 scheme the global based parameterization led to less accurate results for scenarios h06glob and regglob but not for 3ptglob in relation to their counterparts h06 reg and 3pt among all assessed metrics in fig 7 the only one for which a noticeable difference was obtained regarding storage representation was the correlation of peak attenuation for which the variably distributed storage var yielded better values than the other ones the capability of the dams regulation capacity total active storage divided by long term average discharge red to blue colors in fig 8 to predict peak attenuation was also investigated a positive trend between regulation capacity and peak attenuation was clearer for reg i e lower attenuation values with red color and higher ones with blue the lack of a clear relation resulted from the behavior of the three dams with largest regulation capacity serra do facão nova ponte and emborcação dams id s 30 24 and 14 in fig 1 respectively which were associated to a relatively small peak attenuation around 10 finally the dry years of 2000 2001 provide a stress test for our modeling system during this period a major drought affected the brazilian hydropower system which was associated to delays in generation investment leading to a large energy crisis in the country jardini et al 2002 in jan 2000 itaipu and barra bonita id 3 in fig 1 dams reached their lowest observed levels observations available since 1993 the same occurred for itumbiara in nov 2001 among the four analyzed reservoirs in fig 6 only foz do areia located in the brazilian southern region did not have an extreme year during this period the reg scenario was able to satisfactorily simulate some of dams drawdowns but there was no clear pattern among the representation of this extreme year this scheme estimated a too high drawdown for itaipu and a too low drawdown for itumbiara dam but yielded satisfactory estimates for foz do areia and barra bonita dams 4 3 the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation river floodplain reservoir hydrodynamic models have been used to understand the effects of reservoirs on downstream flooding fleischmann et al 2019a mateo et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2018 shin et al 2019 2020 here we follow the methodology proposed by fleischmann et al 2019a and use the developed mgb model structure with distributed representation of reservoir bathymetry and a fully coupled river floodplain reservoir scheme to investigate the relative role of natural floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation along the upper paraná basin generally natural floodplains and reservoirs have a complementary role on flood attenuation in the basin while floodplains are more important along tributaries headwaters e g iguaçu paranapanema grande and ivinhema rivers and in the lower reaches of the paraná mainstem reservoir effects are more relevant along medium to lower reaches of tributaries fig 9 part of the reservoirs storage is currently allocated for flood control during the wet season oct apr following the coordinated operation of the paraná dam cascades ons 2019 located along the paraná mainstem the 230 km floodplain between porto primavera and itaipu dams is known as the last natural large wetland in the upper paraná basin see fig 1 for location with important ecosystem processes relying on it agostinho et al 2001 the flood storage along this area leads to a major discharge attenuation which is propagated downstream and it is fundamental for flood control in benefit of both itaipu dam and riverine cities on the other hand if the reservoirs did not exist the reaches flooded by the reservoir lakes would provide additional storage along the floodplain the comparison between scenarios with and without floodplains shows that the magnitudes of maximum flows are likely to be largely overestimated if basin wide floodplain storage is not considered fig 9b for instance for the iguaçu river at fluviópolis ignoring this effect would lead a 10 yr flood to be estimated as 6000 m3 s green dots in fig 9b instead of 3000 m3 s blue and red dots the effect of upstream floodplains propagate downstream fig 9a although they affect the lower reaches of only a few tributaries e g iguaçu river with attenuation 20 for all reaches along the river mainstem simulated and observed hydrographs at água vermelha and itaipu dams also stress the role of floodplains and reservoirs on discharge alteration for both high and low flows the large effect of floodplains relates to the difference between green and black lines in fig 9b furthermore the major role of reservoirs on flood attenuation along main rivers makes their representation fundamental to correctly estimate flood frequencies in the downstream reaches finally performing an online fully coupled simulation of the river floodplain reservoir continuum allows a continuous representation at the regional scale of the spatial temporal variation of hydraulic variables as water levels it is exemplified for the iguaçu river mainstem a major southern tributary of the paraná fig 10 longitudinal maximum and minimum water surface elevation profiles as well as maximum flooded areas highlight the connected hydrological hydraulic processes that occur basin wide along the iguaçu major floodplains occur in the upper reaches from the most upstream parts close to curitiba city detail iii in fig 10b to união da vitória and fluviópolis locations see fig 9b and detail ii in fig 10b a geologic control creates valleys with rapids between floodplains setting up hydraulic controls and increasing upstream floodplain storage união da vitória is also affected by backwater effects from foz do areia dam located a few kilometers downstream in this study we only simulated regulation dams while run of river ones were not considered and thus are not represented in the simulated water surface elevation continuum downstream of the cascade the iguaçu has again an incised valley with small floodplains and the river width is controlled by the hydraulic control of the large iguaçu falls detail i in fig 10b this example reinforces the model capability to represent the coupled human water system at regional scale 5 discussion 5 1 improving the representation of reservoir operation in large scale models this study compared generic reservoir operation schemes h06 scenario based on hanasaki et al 2006 to data driven ones scenarios 3pt related to the three point rule curve and reg associated to linear regressions between monthly water levels and dam outflows as expected the data driven approach led to more accurate discharge and storage estimates for example while the operation h06 outperformed 3pt in the hydrology metrics approaching reg it provided the worst results in terms of tracking observed storage fig 7 in this case accumulated flow errors lead to poor storage estimates turner et al 2020 h06 has few parameters and it is apparently too simple for a complex interconnected system in turn the reg scheme is similar to the one by solander et al 2016 in the way that it fits a relation between storage and outflow it is also related to yassin et al 2019 since it estimates the actual operational levels from observed data at a monthly basis adopting dam characteristics for levels out of the observed ranges thus emulating the actual reservoir rule curve the satisfactory performance of this rule is also associated to relatively low bias in mgb estimates see supplementary material s1 since inflow bias can largely affect reservoir simulation schemes turner et al 2020 the global based parameterization i e the one that does not require regionally locally available data led to a slightly poorer performance in comparison to the regional based one for discharge and it was generally more accurate than naturalized flows providing a reasonable approach to represent hydrological alteration at regional scales in terms of streamflow finally the results from the adopted operations should be analyzed by considering the context in which the real system is operated in brazil the actual operation of all major dams is defined considering the large scale interconnected hydrothermal power system sin based on operational decisions reallocating storage inter temporally throughout the system to minimize spills and energy production costs the sin is divided into regional interconnected subsystems south south east central west northeast and north with significantly diverse hydrological characteristics as the operation of a given hydropower plant affects others units downstream a system wide operation strategy prevails over individual ones first an energy generation solution is determined for the whole system which is later disaggregated to individual power units given the high contribution of hydropower in the mix over 65 and stochasticity of inflows operating costs depend on present and future decisions ons defines the dispatch schedule for all generating units connected in the sin hydropower thermal wind and nuclear on a monthly basis based on a merit order from lower to higher cost and considering current reservoir storage and flow forecasts hence when a group of reservoirs is low in storage in a given region hydropower plants from another region can be dispatched and the energy transferred avoiding the use of local thermal plants the coordinated operation ranges from long term four years to dispatch scheduling every half hour the improvement of regional scale models may involve hedging operations reducing releases to minimize the probability of more severe cutbacks in the future you and cai 2008 and coordinated operations marques and tilmant 2013 marques et al 2006 rougé et al 2019 which are typically not considered in this study the reg scheme was designed to represent an average behavior rule curve of the coordinated system which trades off its capability to depict anomalous years especially dry ones approaches focusing on a single reservoir may disregard basin scale flood or drought control that exists within a coordinated operation rougé et al 2019 furthermore to improve estimates a detailed operation would require the representation of actual hydraulic structures spillways outlet works etc fleischmann et al 2019a which is not always available to dams worldwide as our purpose is to perform regional scale simulations simplified operations were chosen for a better model applicability potential future improvements should expand the reg operation to multiple regressions including other relevant explanatory variables beyond observed levels e g solander et al 2016 these relevant variables should be chosen based on homogeneous behavior in specific regions i e not all regions would have the same explanatory variables with the same coefficients on the other hand the proposed methodology could be easily expanded to continental scale domains e g siqueira et al 2018 provided information on dam characteristics as stage area curves and observed time series of storage and outflows is available finally the proposed operation approaches do not take into account water withdrawals and consumptive demands associated e g irrigation as those are small in the context of the studied paraná basin at least at the regional scale and their effect is localized so that we focused on hydropower generation dams instead in future works distributed modeling systems should explicitly simulate reservoir dynamics as more information becomes available in brazil recent national scale mapping of irrigation schemes ana 2017 could be coupled to the mgb framework combined with recent developments in large scale modeling of reservoir operation under timely varying water demands biemans et al 2011 haddeland et al 2014 hanasaki et al 2006 voisin et al 2017 5 2 on the importance of representing the river floodplain reservoir continuum in large scale models the presented model of the river floodplain reservoir continuum at regional scale provides a continuous depiction of the spatial temporal variation of hydraulic variables as water surface elevation and flood extent and storage the consideration of a distributed reservoir bathymetry was shown to be fundamental to estimate backwater effects as revealed by a basin scale comparison between lumped and distributed schemes equal and variable bathymetry and an icesat based validation of the itaipu reservoir longitudinal water level profile backwater effects are required for many applications e g to perform real time monitoring of the impact of a given reservoir on an upstream city see the iguaçu river case study in section 4 3 or to correctly estimate the dam inflow along lateral tributaries a correct representation of hydrodynamics at the basin scale was also shown to be fundamental for flood frequency analysis considering both reservoirs and floodplains effects fleischmann et al 2019a tanaka et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zajac et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 design flood discharges are usually estimated with simplified methods as unit hydrographs that do not consider river floodplain attenuation an interesting and open research question relates to how far upstream can these floodplain storage effects go what has major implications for water resources management floodplains alter the celerity of flood waves at the whole basin scale and are a major driver of hydrograph shape across scales collischonn et al 2017 fleischmann et al 2016 besides here we have assessed the role of flood attenuation in riverine wetlands while at the very upstream reaches upland rain fed wetlands may also change towards flood generating areas requiring further studies acreman and holden 2013 natural floodplains provide valuable ecosystem services in terms of flood attenuation and resilience and its quantification requires new tools ameli and creed 2019 wu et al 2020 building new dams especially if designed for purposes different than flood control as well as new developments in floodplain areas e g levees may remove the large floodplain storage effects that protect downstream reaches against floods this was shown for many rivers as the mississippi with hundreds of kilometers of levees deactivating the river natural flood storage hey and philippi 1995 and the danube river schober et al 2014 furthermore a benefit cost analysis of acquiring floodplain lands to avoid flood damage was performed for the whole usa recently johnson et al 2020 and suggested that the cumulative flood damages exceeds the costs of land acquisition for a 2070 scenario the synergic effects of reservoirs and floodplains on flood attenuation have been increasingly addressed in the literature with large scale models shin et al 2020 and are in accordance with our results the analysis and modeling improvements provided here indicate that the synergy between floodable areas and the operation of dam cascades at the whole basin scale is relevant and requires further understanding which is beyond simpler large scale models relying solely on hydrodynamic simulations along downstream floodable areas in the case of the paraná basin inserting the proposed methodology into a proper flood risk management framework will require real time flood monitoring and forecasting 5 3 perspectives on simulating the river floodplain reservoir continuum at large scales the development of coupled river floodplain reservoir modeling systems is associated to the hyper resolution global modeling agenda aiming for example to improve medium range flood forecasts zajac et al 2017 that are locally relevant bierkens et al 2015 fleischmann et al 2019c rajib et al 2020 wood et al 2011 within land surface earth system or global hydrological models and explicitly representing reservoir dynamics within detailed grids shin et al 2019 wada et al 2016 zajac et al 2017 from continental to global scales these models are powerful tools to assist national and world agencies on the coordinated planning of reservoir expansion as well as understanding the effects of current and future dams on water and biogeochemical cycles bierkens et al 2015 wada et al 2016 and their interaction with climate change contributing to improve global water security adam et al 2007 arias et al 2020 dang et al 2019 ehsani et al 2017 poff et al 2016 williamson et al 2009 on the other hand from local to regional scales they can be used for actual dam operation real time monitoring and forecasting systems and estimation of locally relevant discharges at high spatial temporal resolution the necessity of spatially and temporally continuous fields of state variables as river discharges and levels has prompted the combination of remote sensing datasets and hydraulic models brêda et al 2019 gleason and durand 2020 icesat altimetry data provide valuable information for lakes gao 2015 o loughlin et al 2016 and are very promising for validating large scale reservoir modeling systems while new missions as icesat 2 threefold increase in sampling density and swot will increase our capability to remotely monitor reservoirs and estimate reservoir parameters and even reservoir operation bonnema and hossain 2017 2019 busker et al 2019 getirana et al 2018 van den hoek et al 2019 yao et al 2019 yoon et al 2016 yoon and beighley 2015 new global datasets of reservoir characteristics are also promising including new methodologies to estimate reservoir area depth volume relationships based on remote sensing datasets crétaux et al 2016 fassoni andrade et al 2020 gao et al 2012 lehner et al 2011 li et al 2020 liebe et al 2005 mulligan et al 2020 yigzaw et al 2019 2018 these advances contributed to the development of reservoir representation in global hydrological models döll et al 2009 sutanudjaja et al 2018 voisin et al 2013 wada et al 2016 yassin et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 including the data driven operations schemes as presented here and in other recent studies turner et al 2020 and are shaping the new generation of large scale water resources models regarding large scale model improvement we have adopted a 10 km river reach discretization for the paraná basin in accordance with current practices adopted in regional to global hydrological models i e 5 10 km shin et al 2019 wada et al 2016 zajac et al 2017 however higher resolution i e 1 km or smaller are required to better represent relatively small dams our results indicate the need for better representation of reservoir bathymetry distribution in order to correctly address local scale hydraulic processes as backwater effects corroborating recent studies adam et al 2007 shin et al 2019 finally we have also discussed the role of fully coupling hydrological hydrodynamic processes in a two way scheme the mgb model considers a dynamic surface water cover and the associated changes in evapotranspiration runoff generation e g by alternating the soil vegetation penman monteith equation with the open water penman equation reservoir evaporation was also implemented by other modeling systems adam et al 2007 mamede et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 this consideration is particularly important during dry periods and even more important for reservoirs in semi arid regions bonnema et al 2016 celeste and billib 2010 döll et al 2009 mamede et al 2018 besides a dynamic flood fraction cover other reservoir processes at local scale should also be included as reservoir sedimentation zhao et al 2016 and ground seepage 6 conclusions in this study we presented the successful development and a thorough analysis of a regional scale model capable to simulate the daily river floodplain reservoir continuum that exists along large basins a case study was performed in the 950 000 km2 upper paraná river basin in south america considering 30 regulation reservoirs and the itaipu run of river dam which is the largest in world in terms of energy production twelve simulation scenarios considering different reservoir bathymetry representation and reservoir operation schemes were performed and assessed in terms of water levels discharges flood extent and reservoir storage a methodology to assess the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on basin wide flood attenuation was presented providing a powerful way to understand regional scale floods and the value of preserving natural floodplains services we conclude that a distributed representation of reservoir bathymetry in large scale hydrological models is required for accurate predictions of backwater effects upstream surface water elevation and flooding the longitudinal water level profile of the large itaipu dam was satisfactorily validated with icesat altimetry data which showed remote sensing data to be very promising especially considering future satellite missions as swot both lumped and distributed representations of reservoir bathymetry in large scale hydrological hydrodynamic models provide similar predictions of downstream river discharges and water levels a data driven operation scheme based on historical data of reservoir storage and outflows adds significant value to the accuracy of reservoir storage predictions if compared to more generic algorithms although the data driven approach outperforms more generic schemes namely the hanasaki et al 2006 based method h06 in terms of discharge estimation the simpler generic schemes provide reasonable estimates and thus can be useful to estimate regional scale hydrological regime alteration global based parameterizations of operation schemes lead to only slightly poorer performance in comparison to more regionally based ones providing reasonable estimates of regional scale hydrological regime alteration however to properly simulate the river floodplain reservoir continuum at regional scale a satisfactory simulation of water levels and reservoir storages are required and thus large scale models should include data driven reservoir operation approaches based on regional parameterization and distributed reservoir bathymetry if possible with a variable bathymetry scheme in the paraná river basin the floodplains are mainly located in upper parts of some tributaries and in the river mainstem while reservoir effects are more important for flood attenuation along medium and lower reaches of tributaries in this case floodplains and reservoirs provide complementary flood attenuation at regional scale the existence of river floodplains across the whole basin can lead to major flood attenuation at the regional scale and not only in downstream lowland reaches as usually assumed in large scale models major overestimation of flood design discharges can occur if the model does not consider upstream floodplain and reservoir storage effects especially in the context of flood frequency analysis finally our results stress the importance of simulating the river floodplain reservoir continuum at large scales increasing computational capacity with intense cloud computing and new remote sensing based datasets and techniques are quickly pushing the development of large to global scale models and thus improving to a great extent our understanding and prediction capability regarding reservoir floodplain interactions the integration of large scale hydrodynamic models with newly available remote sensing data will provide great

4707,river floodplains and reservoirs interact throughout a basin drainage network defining a coupled human water system with multiple feedbacks recent modeling developments have aimed to improve the representation of such processes at regional to continental scales however most large scale hydrological models adopt simplified lumped reservoir schemes where an offline routine is run with inflows estimated by the model with limited consideration of the complementarity between floodplains and reservoirs on altering the hydrological regime at regional scale this paper presents a novel approach that fully couples river floodplain reservoir hydrodynamic and hydrological models significantly improving the representation of reservoir dynamics and operation in the river floodplain reservoir continuum at large scale and across multiple dam cascades the model is applied to the paraná river basin with explicit simulation of 31 large dams and river hydraulic variables at basin scale three types of reservoir bathymetry representation are compared from lumped to distributed methods combined with three reservoir operation schemes and varying degrees of input data requirement within two parameterization scenarios global and regional setups the operation schemes were more relevant than the reservoir bathymetry representation to estimate downstream flows and water levels while the data driven operation scheme based on linear regressions between observed water levels and dam outflows provided the best estimates of both active storage and discharges the more generic operation reasonably estimated discharges and peak attenuation albeit not as accurately for active storage the global parameterization of reservoir operation resulted in poorer performance compared to the regional based one but it satisfactorily modeled discharge and peak attenuation regarding the reservoir bathymetry representation a basin scale comparison of the lumped and distributed schemes indicated the inability of the former to represent backwater effects this was further corroborated by validating the longitudinal water level profile of itaipu dam with icesat satellite altimetry data finally the model was used to show the complementarity between floodplains and reservoirs on attenuating floods at regional scale large scale models should move beyond offline coupling strategies and include regional based data driven reservoir operation schemes together with a distributed representation of reservoir bathymetry into river floodplain hydraulic schemes this will largely improve the estimation of river discharges water levels and flood storage and thus the model ability to represent the regional scale river floodplain reservoir continuum keywords hydrological modeling large scale modeling hydropower flood dynamics paraná river basin mgb 1 introduction reservoirs are important for energy production flood control flow regulation and water supply among other uses lehner et al 2011 their construction and operation have also led to major socio environmental concerns grill et al 2019 nilsson 2005 poff et al 2010 richter and thomas 2007 and efforts to improve storage allocation almeida et al 2019 ho et al 2017 schmitt et al 2019 reservoirs however operate in basins with a continuum in the river system connecting it to rivers and floodplains through which human societies and ecosystems interact with dynamic two way feedbacks di baldassarre et al 2013 pande and sivapalan 2017 viglione et al 2014 at regional to continental scales this river floodplain reservoir continuum is associated to a complex relationship among surface water processes for example in the la plata river basin in south america dozens of large reservoirs have been built since the 1950 s interacting with complex wetland systems as the pantanal esteros del iberá and paraná floodplains minotti 2018 in the basin human society has settled around floodplains for centuries leading to a fully coupled human water system doyle and barros 2011 lee et al 2018 as the use and development of the floodplain by society evolve there is an increasing need to better understand the hydrodynamic interactions in this river floodplain reservoir continuum so that we can better design and operate water systems to cope with human and ecosystem demands considering hydrological uncertainty and current and future environmental changes regional to continental scale hydrological hydrodynamic models provide a unique opportunity to address these needs while recent advances in large scale modeling have improved our capability to simulate river floods at both 1d and 2d dimensions bates et al 2018 fleischmann et al 2020 neal et al 2012 paiva et al 2013 schumann et al 2013 trigg et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2011 most studies on reservoir simulation have focused on representing dam storage and operation i e a water management model within simpler hydrological models with less physically based flow routing methods droppers et al 2020 hanasaki et al 2018 yassin et al 2019 in the studies by mateo et al 2014 and pokhrel et al 2018 for instance a hydrodynamic model was run offline with observed or simulated dam outflows at the grid cell related to the dam in order to estimate alterations in downstream flooding difficulties for detailed reservoir simulation included the unknown bathymetry and specific dam operation at very large scales and are also a challenge only recently the hydrodynamics of dam cascades were explicitly included into regional hydrodynamic models shin et al 2019 fleischmann et al 2019a aiming at representing the river floodplain reservoir system with a fully coupled approach that allowed a distributed representation of variables as discharges water levels and flood extent and storage in human altered systems as the representation of these processes improves a better and integrated assessment of basin water resources and floods becomes possible examples include the understanding of the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation fleischmann et al 2019a more detailed simulation of evaporation shin et al 2019 and understanding of the reservoir influence on local climate degu et al 2011 hossain et al 2012 the representation of the reservoir dynamics itself and associated backwater effects and flooding in upstream areas and simulation of carbon cycle and phytoplankton dynamics e g lake emissions and degassing or downstream emissions bierkens et al 2015 can also benefit from such modeling systems ultimately these tools will provide an important basis towards a fully coupled and distributed human water modeling system within hyperresolution earth system models nazemi wheater 2015 pokhrel et al 2016 wood et al 2011 adopting detailed grids and daily temporal resolution gutenson et al 2020 zajac et al 2017 regarding the representation of dam operation in regional to global models there have been major improvements since the pioneering studies by hanasaki et al 2006 and haddeland et al 2006 which have been used and adapted for many studies adam et al 2007 van beek et al 2011 biemans et al 2011 pokhrel et al 2012 shin et al 2019 wisser et al 2010 since these first generic algorithms data driven reservoir operation schemes are now feasible while optimization methods have also been developed involving storage outflow and inflow observations solander et al 2016 wu and chen 2012 yassin et al 2019 and downstream water or energy demands haddeland et al 2006 all these developments highlight the ongoing necessity to better estimate actual reservoir operation in order to achieve hyperresolution models that are locally relevant cross scale comparisons among different approaches from simpler globally based to more complex regionally derived setups can yield meaningful insights on the ways forward especially using regionally set up models fleischmann et al 2019c nazemi and wheater 2015 trigg et al 2016 the need for a fully coupled approach was explicitly highlighted by some authors fleischmann et al 2019a shin et al 2019 however the benefits of representing the reservoir dynamics fully coupled within the river floodplain reservoir continuum processes with a distributed approach over the traditional lumped and offline representation remains a knowledge gap in the field of large scale modeling the extent to which simple level pool reservoir simulations i e lumped may lead to similar results as distributed i e dynamic more complex ones is not yet understood finally a correct reservoir operation also needs to be incorporated to improve our understanding of the human feedback in the river floodplain reservoir continuum this study brings a novel contribution to these gaps with an improved representation of the river floodplain reservoir interactions within hydrologic hydrodynamic models followed by a broad analysis of the continuum of hydraulic variables basin wide considering the reservoir operation effects the contributions of this study address three main research questions i what are the differences between simulating lumped and distributed reservoir bathymetry in coarse scale online coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic models in terms of different variables as water levels discharge flood extent and storage and evapotranspiration ii how do generic and more data driven reservoir operation schemes differ in terms of hydrological variables estimation in regional scale models and iii what is the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation in large scale systems considering basin wide hydrological processes to answer these questions new modeling approaches to improve reservoir representation and operation are proposed and tested in a 950 000 km2 watershed upper paraná river basin brazil different simulation scenarios are performed to assess the dynamics of reservoirs in terms of complexity of bathymetry representation lumped to distributed and reservoir operation from generic to data driven approaches and from globally to regionally derived parameterizations 2 methods 2 1 study area the upper paraná river basin the upper paraná river basin fig 1 was selected as a study area given i its large number of dam cascades in parallel and in series ii the existence of large floodplains both upstream and downstream of dam cascades and iii the availability of observed daily time series of dam inflows outflows and storage from the brazilian national water agency ana those are desirable characteristics to address in large scale modeling of river floodplain reservoir systems the paraná river is formed by the confluence of grande and paranaíba rivers in brazil with major tributaries being the tietê paranapanema ivaí and iguaçu rivers all in its left margin the upper paraná river basin has a drainage area of 950 000 km2 and it is among those with the largest hydropower installed capacity in the world and almost 50 of the installed hydropower capacity of brazil including the itaipu dam id 18 in fig 1 which is one of the largest dams in the world itaipu 2016 large cities as são paulo and brasília brazil federal capital are located within the basin which holds a population of nearly 70 million people the wet period usually occurs from november january to may june agostinho et al 2000 with average annual rainfall of about 1400 mm boulanger et al 2005 there are contrasting hydroclimatic regions throughout the basin with the northern regions presenting a seasonal precipitation regime and the southern ones a non seasonal regime the basin has 86 large dams 30 mw in operation with an installed capacity of 48 083 mw aneel 2020 fig 1 regarding proposed planned or under construction dams there are 500 small dams totalling 5643 mw of installed capacity and 58 large dams associated to 3909 mw aneel 2020 sixty two large dams are currently connected to the brazilian national interconnected system sin with 32 run of river and 30 flow regulation dams ons 2020 which are coordinately operated with other power sources e g thermal and wind to generate and distribute energy to the whole system by minimizing costs marques tilmant 2013 most dams are also operated with multiple uses such as flood control water supply and navigation overall there is a large hydrological alteration at the basin scale due to reservoir operation santos 2015 the extensive floodplains throughout the basin as the 230 km reach in the paraná mainstem between porto primavera and itaipu dams provide important ecosystem services agostinho et al 2001 2008 baumgartner et al 2018 2 2 hydrological and hydrodynamic representation of the river floodplain reservoir continuum the mgb model modelo de grandes bacias in portuguese an acronym meaning large basins model collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 is used to implement and test the proposed representation of the river floodplain reservoir continuum and reservoir operation it is a semi distributed hydrological hydrodynamic model developed to simulate large scale basins this model is chosen given its proven capability proven of simulation in several other river basins at different scales from regional to continental domains siqueira et al 2018 first the original mgb modeling approach is presented followed by the proposed improved representation of the reservoirs and their hydraulic and hydrodynamic relationships with the basin scale continuum in mgb s representation the basin is divided into unit catchments of equal river lengths and within each the model simulates vertical hydrological processes as evapotranspiration soil water infiltration and runoff generation from surface subsurface and groundwater reservoirs fig 2 local runoff is added as a lateral boundary condition to the drainage network and a hydrodynamic routing is performed to simulate river floodplains and reservoirs surface water dynamics soil and vegetation model parameters are defined for each hydrologic response units hru s within a given sub basin and the hru s are derived from a combination of soil and vegetation maps evapotranspiration is computed with the penman monteith equation for soil vegetated areas and penman equation for flooded areas i e assumed as open water a dynamic two way feedback between the hydrologic and hydrodynamic modules is also considered by which floodplain water can infiltrate into the unsaturated soil and evapotranspiration open water evaporation and runoff generation are dynamically computed considering the surface flooded fraction at each time step more details on the hydrological model are presented in supplementary material s2 and in collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 and siqueira et al 2018 recent mgb applications in the paraná basin with the simpler muskingum cunge flood routing scheme were performed in fleischmann et al 2019b and quedi and fan 2020 2 3 mgb model river floodplain hydrodynamic routing the local inertia explicit method proposed by bates et al 2010 is adopted within mgb to simulate 1d flow propagation along the drainage network this method is a simplification of saint venant equations neglecting the convective acceleration term from the momentum equation which has been proven satisfactory to represent flood wave transport along rivers at both 1d and 2d dimensions getirana et al 2017 neal et al 2012 siqueira et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2013 within mgb floodplains are represented as storage units i e they are ineffective areas without active flow river floodplain water exchange is instantaneous and water surface elevation is assumed the same along the river floodplain system within a given unit catchment paiva et al 2011 channel cross sections are assumed rectangular as typically adopted in large scale hydraulic modeling paiva et al 2013 trigg et al 2009 the flux between two adjacent unit catchments is computed with the discretized momentum eq 1 1 q out i t δ t q i t g b i δ t h i s i 1 g δ t q i t n 2 b i h i 7 3 where q out i t δ t is the discharge at unit catchment i at time t δ t n is the manning s coefficient h i the flow depth between unit catchments i and i 1 s i the water surface level slope δ t the model time step b i the flow width and g the gravitational acceleration the continuity equation can be approximated for each unit catchment river reach as 2 v i t δ t v i t δ t q in i t δ t q out i t δ t q local p i e i where v is the stored volume in unit catchment i q in i t δ t the sum of inflows from upstream unit catchments q local the locally generated runoff p the precipitation over flooded areas i e river reach surface area plus flooded floodplain or reservoir area and e the flooded area open water evaporation computed with penman equation once the unit catchment volume is updated with 2 water level in the unit catchment is estimated from its level volume relationship hypsometric curve for stages below bank elevation this is derived from the channel cross section for stages above bank elevation it represents the floodplain topography and it is obtained with a gis pre processing step that computes flooded areas associated to increments in height above nearest drainage values hand rennó et al 2008 extracted from the srtm digital elevation model dem siqueira et al 2018 effective hydraulic parameters that are required for each river reach are channel bed elevation cross section bankfull width and depth and manning roughness coefficient bed elevation is derived for each unit catchment from the average dem river network pixels siqueira et al 2018 subtracted by bankfull depth the hydrodynamic routing time step is determined by the courant friedrichs levy condition with an additional multiplier parameter for ensuring model numerical stability bates et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2011 2 4 reservoir routing two main aspects differ the proposed improved reservoir representation from the original mgb river floodplain routing scheme first at the unit catchment corresponding to the dam location the momentum eq 1 is replaced by the dam outflow equation i e it is set as an internal boundary condition which is based on simple spillway or outlet works equations or on more complex reservoir operation derived from actual dam operational data second the reservoir storage and bathymetry is represented in mgb by adjusting the level volume relationship in the unit catchments located within the reservoir lake originally extracted from a dem if the dam did not exist during the dem acquisition date the storage is already represented in the level volume relationships and thus no correction is necessary in such cases it is only required to define the dam outflow equation on the other hand if the reservoir already existed the dem will likely miss the storage representation depicting a flat lake area instead this demands additional bathymetry information e g reservoir level storage relationships to correct the model these two main aspects were added to the mgb framework by fleischmann et al 2019a open water evaporation and direct precipitation on lake are considered in the same way as for floodplain areas in the improved reservoir representation proposed in this paper this scheme is further developed by considering different types of reservoir bathymetry representation section 2 5 and operation section 2 6 which are detailed in the next sections 2 5 reservoir storage representation to investigate the reservoir storage representation three different types of reservoir storage bathymetry representation are compared i a lumped representation of the reservoir storage by which all storage is concentrated in one only unit catchment associated to the dam location and a distributed method in which the storage is ii equally and iii variably split among all unit catchments that compound the reservoir lake thus allowing the representation of reservoir dynamics fig 2 bottom panel presents the schemes for the three simulation methods the lumped method i lum consists of concentrating the reservoir stage volume curve in this study provided by the brazilian national electric system operator ons on the unit catchment holding the dam location this method is analogous to a level pool routing method used in simpler reservoir routing schemes and mainly assuming a horizontal water surface along the reservoir this approaches a dynamic method ii and iii if reservoir length is short depth is large inflow hydrograph volume is large and inflow hydrograph time of rise is long fread 1992 unit catchments along the reservoir lake are considered as a river with rectangular cross section and the downstream boundary condition at the dam location is considered as a simplified uniform flow a local average slope was adopted in this case the equal bathymetry method ii eq consists of equally distributing the volume through the unit catchments that compose the reservoir for each level the reservoir water surface area is equally distributed to the unit catchments on the reservoir domain through the stage area relationship thus all the unit catchments that compose a reservoir have the same storage capacity the variable bathymetry method iii var explicitly simulates the reservoir dynamics to improve accuracy in the distribution of reservoir volume across the unit catchments associated to the reservoir lake since the dem usually measures the surface water level there is no information on it about the reservoir bathymetry for reservoirs built before the dem survey thus the proposed method estimates the stage area curve below the reservoir water level rwl and combines it with the stage area curve above the rwl to construct the reservoir actual stage volume curve which can be later checked against existing data in this study provided by the brazilian national electric system operator ons this method has four steps 1 estimation of the stage area curve above the rwl in a given unit catchment this process is automatically obtained using the dem information within a unit catchment by counting the number of cells lower than a specific elevation 2 estimation of the original river bank elevation in every unit catchment within the reservoir lake the original riverbanks i e in pristine conditions were inundated by the dam thus the bank elevation of all unit catchments that compose the reservoir were defined through a linear interpolation between the bank elevation just downstream of the dam and the one immediately upstream of the reservoir lake eq 3 3 z i z down z up z down δ x down i δ x down u p where z represents the bank elevation and δ x the distance between the river sections the indices i d o w n and up represent the sections of the i th unit catchment within the reservoir and the sections immediately downstream to the dam and upstream to the reservoir lake respectively 3 estimation of the stage area curve for the levels below rwl it is assumed that the water surface area below the rwl linearly increases with level and that the water surface area at the river bank elevation is zero thus the stage area curve below rwl is a line going from an area equal to zero at the river bank elevation z i to the first point in the stage area curve above rwl 4 matching the estimated reservoir stage volume curve with the actual one the reservoir stage volume is a table relating reservoir volume v o with level z it can be directly compared to the reservoir stage area curve built with the combination of all the unit catchments within the reservoir hereafter res which is a table relating area a res to level z in every position j on the stage area table a level increment z j z j 1 is multiplied by its related reservoir surface water area a res j a res j 1 2 resulting in an incremental volume δ v res j then the incremental volume observed on the stage volume curve related to the level z j δ v o j v o j v o j 1 is divided by the calculated incremental volume calculated from the stage area curve δ v res j generating a volume ratio v r j δ v o j δ v res j the stage area curve of each unit catchment i within the reservoir is recalculated independently to keep the same incremental volume as the actual stage volume curve 4 a res i j a res i j 1 v r j a res i j a res i j 1 5 a res i j v r j a res i j a res i j 1 a res i j 1 where a res i j is the water surface area of the unit catchment i at the stage area table position j related to level z j the superscript indicates the recalculated a values equations 4 and 5 indicate an adjustment on the water surface area in level z j in order to preserve the incremental volume indicated by the actual stage volume curve this process is repeated through all levels z 1 t o z n of the stage volume curve modifying the stage area curve of each unit catchment within the reservoir 2 6 reservoir operation the dam release is set as an internal boundary condition of the hydrodynamic model mgb by replacing eq 1 by a dam outflow equation three types of operation schemes are compared here considering two different approaches each one based on regionally available data and another with global based parameterization the three operation types are representative of different approaches that have been implemented in state of the art modeling systems from generic to data driven ones described as follows 2 6 1 reservoir operation schemes h06 and h06glob this is a generic inflow based operation based on the equation proposed by hanasaki et al 2006 and adapted by shin et al 2019 this operation considers that the dam outflow is a simple function of the inflow modulated by the dam regulation capacity and the storage at the beginning of each hydrological year here it is used at a daily basis and for hydropower plants so that it does not take into account downstream water demands for irrigation or other uses dam outflow is defined by eq 6 6 q i t r i k i y i m 1 r i i t 1 7 r i m i n 1 α c i 8 k i y s first y α c i where q i t is the i th dam outflow at the time step t r i a regulation capacity constant that can be calibrated with observations or estimated with eq 7 shin et al 2019 i m and i t 1 the annual average and dam inflow respectively and k i y the storage fraction at the beginning of the hydrological year eq 8 the hydrological year of each dam is defined as the month where the naturalized flow becomes lower than the average i e the beginning of the drawdown season hanasaki et al 2006 the term c i is the ratio between the reservoir maximum storage c i and the annual average dam inflow ratio c i c i i m s first y is the storage at the beginning of each hydrological year y and α c i is the target storage where α is a constant set to 0 85 following hanasaki et al 2006 scenario h06 estimates r from a calibration procedure based on regionally available observations while scenario h06glob global adopts eq 6 for estimating r 2 6 2 reservoir operation schemes 3pt and 3ptglob three point rule curve this is a target storage and release based rule yassin et al 2019 consisting of a three point rule built upon simple dam characteristic parameters as minimum and maximum operational levels and maximum discharges fig 3 a similar approaches were adopted by zajac et al 2017 and yassin et al 2019 this operation emulates a reservoir rule curve that is constant throughout the year with outflow as a linear function of water level guided by three points the regional approach scenario 3pt adopts the following points based on actual dam information i e observations minimum operational level for which outflow is zero average operational level for which outflow is obtained from the average observed outflow and maximum design level associated to the dam design discharge supplementary material s1 presents the adopted parameters for all dams scenario 3ptglob global approach follows zajac et al 2017 and adopts the percentiles 0 1 0 3 and 0 97 for the minimum conservative normal and maximum flood storages which are associated to the 5th 30th and 97th percentiles of naturalized daily discharge respectively 2 6 3 reservoir operation schemes reg and regglob regression based rule this is also a target storage and release based rule based on a data intensive approach fig 3b and c linear regressions are computed between observations of monthly average water levels and dam outflows so that it emulates a rule curve for each month of the year following the actual operation oliveira and loucks 1997 a similar operation was investigated by solander et al 2016 for each month positive relationships are adopted as those with pearson correlation higher than 0 4 which is considered satisfactory based on a visual inspection fig 3b for non positive relationships fig 3c the monthly average discharge was used for all simulated days for a given month for water levels out of the observed range for a given month dam characteristics related to minimum operational level for which outflow is zero and maximum design level dam design discharge were adopted and linearly interpolated with the observed ranges the global approach scenario regglob adopts the same long term outflow average for all simulation days instead of monthly regressions making the operation similar to the standard operating policy sop draper and lund 2004 considering the long term streamflow as the demand 2 7 model application in the upper paraná river basin the model was applied to the upper paraná river basin with daily time step for the period 1st jan 1979 to 31st dec 2015 35 years 1 spin up year it was run with in situ daily precipitation from 2030 gauges from the following institutions brazilian national water agency ana water resources agency of argentina bdhi http bdhi hidricosargentina gov ar and national meteorological and hydrological service of paraguay dmh https www meteorologia gov py details on precipitation data interpolation to model units are provided in supplementary material s2 long term climate averages from 195 stations of the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet available at http www inmet gov br were used to dynamically compute evapotranspiration with the penman monteith equation within the model drainage network and unit catchments total of 9625 units with 10 km long river reaches were derived from the 90 m hydrosheds srtm dem lehner et al 2008 with the iph hydrotools gis toolkit siqueira et al 2016 hydrologic response units hru s were used to define homogeneous regions for the rainfall runoff parameters and were derived from the south america hru map developed by fan et al 2015 model parameters related to soil vegetation and river hydraulics bankfull width and depth from geomorphic relationships and manning s roughness coefficient are further discussed in supplementary material s2 the model was calibrated for the period 1990 2010 and validated for 1980 1990 with 143 in situ discharge gauges from ana considering the pristine scenario i e without reservoirs naturalized flows from ons were considered for gauges downstream of dams supplementary material s2 presents details on the model adjustment including performance metrics and simulated hydrographs overall the model satisfactorily represented natural discharges basin wide with 78 and 79 of the gauges with nse and nselog 0 6 respectively and 42 of the gauges with the absolute value of bias 10 the 30 regulation dams within sin were considered in addition to itaipu dam a run of river dam but very relevant in terms of size and energy production fig 1 for simplicity all other run of river reservoirs were not considered in the simulations since our focus was on dams with regulation capacity to properly address basin wide flow regulation the dams were only considered after their year of inauguration so that the model simulated the dam first filling the effects of reservoirs were not used for model calibration but only considered for the scenarios presented in the following section 3 3 experimental design a total of 12 simulation scenarios were run considering the different reservoir bathymetry representation and reservoir operation schemes table 1 the performance of a given reservoir simulation was first assessed in terms of discharge and active storage for all dams observed time series of active storage and dam outflows were obtained from ana https www ana gov br sar the hydrodynamics was assessed in terms of the water surface elevation longitudinal profile at itaipu dam by comparing simulations with satellite altimetry estimates from the icesat mission schutz et al 2005 icesat carries a lidar sensor and has a maximum inter track distance of 30 km and a repeat cycle of 91 days icesat vertical datum was converted to egm96 in order to be consistent with the srtm datum reference a basin scale assessment was also made by computing for each river reach the root mean squared deviation rmsd between simulated water levels under scenarios lum eq and var table 1 model performance for discharge was assessed with nash sutcliffe nse and log nash sutcliffe nselog i e nse considering the logarithm of discharges normalized root mean squared error nrmse of peak discharges and relative errors in high q10 i e discharge that is exceeded 10 of the time and low flows q90 i e discharge that is exceeded 90 of the time for reservoir active storage the nrmse and pearson correlation metrics were used finally the average peak attenuation for each dam was assessed by first computing the discharge reduction between dam inflow and outflow for each of the dam s maximum annual events followed by estimation of the average of the annual values the simulated peak attenuation was compared to the observed one with the nrmse metric the role of the online coupling between hydrology and hydrodynamic processes was tested by performing tests with and without coupling in section 4 1 the simulation without coupling was performed by considering that evapotranspiration only occurs from the non flooded soil vegetation system i e reservoir open water evaporation is not considered into the evapotranspiration computation since there is high uncertainty on the estimation of the active flow width b in eq 1 along the reservoir when it is simulated in a distributed way i e reservoir storage types eq and var section 2 5 hydrographs are presented in section 4 1 considering two types of computation i adopting the original channel width estimated from geomorphic relationships and ii considering the active width for unit catchments within reservoirs as the unit catchment flooded area divided by its length 10 km i e considering that there is active flow along the whole reservoir cross section area finally the developed regional scale hydrodynamic model was used to investigate the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation this was carried out following the approach by fleischmann et al 2019a where the model was run with three river floodplain scenarios i pristine flow scenario naturalized flow with floodplains but without reservoirs ii without both floodplains and reservoirs where cross sections were assumed always rectangular and thus disregarding floodplain topography and iii with both floodplains and reservoirs the role of reservoirs on flood attenuation was estimated by computing the peak attenuation between scenarios i and iii for the maximum flood event of each simulation year the role of floodplains was similarly computed but considering the difference between scenarios ii and i table 1 summarizes the model runs 4 results 4 1 effects of reservoir storage representation this section presents the results and differences in the reservoir dynamics according to the storage representation approaches lum eq var while all schemes yielded similar estimates of dam outflows as exemplified for a few dams in fig 4 a some key differences were identified in some cases the lumped method led to a discharge attenuation in relation to the other two methods smaller and delayed peaks this is due to the typical approach adopted on large scale hydrological modeling in the lumped offline simulation i e using as inflows the simulated discharges at the dam location instead of computing the inflows as the modeled flows at the river reaches close to the most upstream reservoir lake area this approach causes the flood wave to be routed along the reservoir as it was a river reach adding artificial routing along the drainage network hence for lumped model applications it is better to select all tributaries that drain into the reservoir along with direct lake inputs and consider it as the dam inflow this effect was clearer for itaipu dam which is located in the lower part of the basin integrating the effects of all upstream dams and having a long reservoir our results show that simpler lumped reservoir models can simulate downstream discharge similarly to dynamic and distributed ones fig 4a however the lumped method fails to represent backwater effects when compared to the distributed methods equal and variable bathymetry fig 5 a high deviation among lum and var scenarios rmsd 10 m for some reservoirs occurs for most reaches upstream from dams as a validation experiment icesat satellite altimetry data were used to assess the simulated profile of water surface elevation along itaipu reservoir under the three different storage schemes fig 5b the lumped method is unable to simulate it properly and the slope in the upstream part of the lake was better represented with the variable bathymetry method an intermediate behavior was obtained with the equal bathymetry one although this method considers the reservoir to behave as a large box with a horizontal water level the lake is assumed as connected to the rest of the drainage network and thus the method is capable to represent backwater on the other hand the actual level in the lake area closer to the dam is more dependent on the dam operation and its simplification led to higher errors in the estimated itaipu reservoir storage for instance the low water level in oct 2003 lake level closest to the dam at 216 6 m fig 5b is related to the low simulated active storage around 14 km3 see fig 6 d in next section while actual values were around 219 3 m for level and 18 1 km3 for storage itaipu is also a large dam 170 km long and its lake is composed of many mgb unit catchments which are 10 km long the hydrographs presented in fig 4a also compare different ways of representing flow width in the distributed reservoir simulation bold lines as well as scenarios with and without reservoir open water evaporation i e not considering an online hydrologic hydrodynamic coupling dashed lines downstream discharges had mostly similar values indicating a low sensitivity of discharges to both flow width conceptualization and the online coupling scheme regarding evapotranspiration estimates differences among lum eq and var scenarios would arise if reservoir flooded areas were largely divergent but this difference was relatively small in comparison to other model uncertainties our estimations of reservoir evaporation rates are in agreement with other studies in the paraná basin de bueno et al 2016 looking at the basin scale we estimated an increase of annual et rates by 15 mm year due to existence of reservoirs the net reservoir evaporation i e reservoir evaporation minus the evapotranspiration that would occur without the lake which is equal to the difference between blue and red lines in fig 4b for the assessed lakes varied between 21 12 mm month mean sd for itaipu and 70 41 mm month for itumbiara located in the north of the basin id 19 in fig 1 this loss can be relevant during dry periods and thus must be accounted for in large scale models for instance loss in energy production due to reservoir evaporation in the brazilian southeast region was estimated as 2 over 900 mw zambon et al 2018 and it is also an important measure to assess regional scale reservoirs water footprint semertzidis et al 2019 at itumbiara dam the modeled evapotranspiration was highly constrained by soil moisture during austral winter what explains the large net evaporation losses this difference led to a higher peak simulated under the scenario without open water evaporation fig 4a when looking at finer scales evapotranspiration rates will drastically differ since the lumped offline method is not able to represent the dynamic conversion between dry and flooded soil vegetation the representation of local scale coupled processes between surface and atmosphere will perform poorly as well as the local scale runoff estimation 4 2 effects of reservoir operation this section compares the different reservoir operation h06 3pt reg in order of increasing data requirement and storage bathymetry representation schemes lum eq var addressed in terms of dam outflow and reservoir hydrodynamics the differences among the simulated operation schemes are larger than among the reservoir bathymetry types for discharge and active storage estimation figs 6 and 7 results for the same four dams analyzed in the previous section show that the reg operation scheme led to far better outflow estimation for itumbiara and itaipu dams in these cases operations h06 and 3pt also outperformed the natural flows scenario i e without reservoir effects the overall model performance in representing basin wide hydrologic regime alteration as depicted by itaipu dam shows that the best performance was obtained for reg nse 0 69 followed by h06 0 47 and 3pt 0 19 and that all of them outperformed the scenario without dams 0 26 for itumbiara the better performance of reg for outflow compared to the other scenarios can be seen in the better depicted seasonality also reflected on the storage simulation for foz do areia dam located in a river with low precipitation seasonality all model versions led to similar estimates as the natural flow scenario i e the inclusion of reservoirs did not lead to improvements the simulation performance for active storage nrmse was similarly satisfactory for the four dams and all scenarios except for itaipu under operation reg which outperformed the others by significant margins 9 for reg against 23 and 27 for h06 and 3pt respectively a similar behavior was observed when looking at the ensemble of 31 dams figs 7 and 8 which was supported by a basin wide assessment for the whole drainage network supplementary material s3 the highest differences were obtained for discharge nse where reg had the best performance followed by h06 and 3pt and for active storage r for which reg was followed by 3pt and h06 indeed a more satisfactory performance was expected for reg given its more data intensive nature the three point rules 3ptlum 3pteq 3ptvar and 3ptglobvar had the lowest performance for discharge in terms of nse but this was not the case for high q10 and low flows q90 and peak discharges interestingly for low flows all operation types were outperformed by the natural flow scenario showing that the tested operations led to excessive discharge attenuation i e overestimated base flows during dry periods the operation scheme reg which relies on observed data provided the best discharge estimates with a median nse of 0 3 and a maximum of 0 75 for the 31 reservoirs although the basin wide hydrological alteration was relatively well captured e g at itaipu dam location fig 6 the non data intensive schemes h06 and 3pt need further improvements if aiming at locally relevant estimates of dam operation the analysis of regional h06 3pt reg versus global based parameterizations h06glob 3ptglob regglob showed that the global ones had a relatively poorer performance in relation to their regional counterparts for instance the regression with monthly values regglob considering long term averages as outflow presented the poorest performance for peak nrmse and high and low flows while 3ptglobvar scenario presented the poorest representation of active storage however for certain purposes these global approaches could already provide valuable discharge estimates e g for providing a general understanding of regional scale hydrological alteration for example median nse values were 0 1 0 1 for scenario h06 h06glob and 0 3 0 1 for reg regglob showing the just slightly better performance of the regional parameterization the global setups were also more accurate than naturalized flows for all metrics except for low flows there was an overall satisfactory model performance to estimate peak attenuation with pearson correlation between 0 72 and 0 91 and nrmse between 10 and 22 fig 8 the different types of storage representation led to very similar nrmse values between simulation and observation and the same occurred for the reservoir operation although h06 was slightly better than 3pt which in turn was marginally better than reg this is interesting given the low degree of data requirement in the h06 scheme the global based parameterization led to less accurate results for scenarios h06glob and regglob but not for 3ptglob in relation to their counterparts h06 reg and 3pt among all assessed metrics in fig 7 the only one for which a noticeable difference was obtained regarding storage representation was the correlation of peak attenuation for which the variably distributed storage var yielded better values than the other ones the capability of the dams regulation capacity total active storage divided by long term average discharge red to blue colors in fig 8 to predict peak attenuation was also investigated a positive trend between regulation capacity and peak attenuation was clearer for reg i e lower attenuation values with red color and higher ones with blue the lack of a clear relation resulted from the behavior of the three dams with largest regulation capacity serra do facão nova ponte and emborcação dams id s 30 24 and 14 in fig 1 respectively which were associated to a relatively small peak attenuation around 10 finally the dry years of 2000 2001 provide a stress test for our modeling system during this period a major drought affected the brazilian hydropower system which was associated to delays in generation investment leading to a large energy crisis in the country jardini et al 2002 in jan 2000 itaipu and barra bonita id 3 in fig 1 dams reached their lowest observed levels observations available since 1993 the same occurred for itumbiara in nov 2001 among the four analyzed reservoirs in fig 6 only foz do areia located in the brazilian southern region did not have an extreme year during this period the reg scenario was able to satisfactorily simulate some of dams drawdowns but there was no clear pattern among the representation of this extreme year this scheme estimated a too high drawdown for itaipu and a too low drawdown for itumbiara dam but yielded satisfactory estimates for foz do areia and barra bonita dams 4 3 the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation river floodplain reservoir hydrodynamic models have been used to understand the effects of reservoirs on downstream flooding fleischmann et al 2019a mateo et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2018 shin et al 2019 2020 here we follow the methodology proposed by fleischmann et al 2019a and use the developed mgb model structure with distributed representation of reservoir bathymetry and a fully coupled river floodplain reservoir scheme to investigate the relative role of natural floodplains and reservoirs on flood attenuation along the upper paraná basin generally natural floodplains and reservoirs have a complementary role on flood attenuation in the basin while floodplains are more important along tributaries headwaters e g iguaçu paranapanema grande and ivinhema rivers and in the lower reaches of the paraná mainstem reservoir effects are more relevant along medium to lower reaches of tributaries fig 9 part of the reservoirs storage is currently allocated for flood control during the wet season oct apr following the coordinated operation of the paraná dam cascades ons 2019 located along the paraná mainstem the 230 km floodplain between porto primavera and itaipu dams is known as the last natural large wetland in the upper paraná basin see fig 1 for location with important ecosystem processes relying on it agostinho et al 2001 the flood storage along this area leads to a major discharge attenuation which is propagated downstream and it is fundamental for flood control in benefit of both itaipu dam and riverine cities on the other hand if the reservoirs did not exist the reaches flooded by the reservoir lakes would provide additional storage along the floodplain the comparison between scenarios with and without floodplains shows that the magnitudes of maximum flows are likely to be largely overestimated if basin wide floodplain storage is not considered fig 9b for instance for the iguaçu river at fluviópolis ignoring this effect would lead a 10 yr flood to be estimated as 6000 m3 s green dots in fig 9b instead of 3000 m3 s blue and red dots the effect of upstream floodplains propagate downstream fig 9a although they affect the lower reaches of only a few tributaries e g iguaçu river with attenuation 20 for all reaches along the river mainstem simulated and observed hydrographs at água vermelha and itaipu dams also stress the role of floodplains and reservoirs on discharge alteration for both high and low flows the large effect of floodplains relates to the difference between green and black lines in fig 9b furthermore the major role of reservoirs on flood attenuation along main rivers makes their representation fundamental to correctly estimate flood frequencies in the downstream reaches finally performing an online fully coupled simulation of the river floodplain reservoir continuum allows a continuous representation at the regional scale of the spatial temporal variation of hydraulic variables as water levels it is exemplified for the iguaçu river mainstem a major southern tributary of the paraná fig 10 longitudinal maximum and minimum water surface elevation profiles as well as maximum flooded areas highlight the connected hydrological hydraulic processes that occur basin wide along the iguaçu major floodplains occur in the upper reaches from the most upstream parts close to curitiba city detail iii in fig 10b to união da vitória and fluviópolis locations see fig 9b and detail ii in fig 10b a geologic control creates valleys with rapids between floodplains setting up hydraulic controls and increasing upstream floodplain storage união da vitória is also affected by backwater effects from foz do areia dam located a few kilometers downstream in this study we only simulated regulation dams while run of river ones were not considered and thus are not represented in the simulated water surface elevation continuum downstream of the cascade the iguaçu has again an incised valley with small floodplains and the river width is controlled by the hydraulic control of the large iguaçu falls detail i in fig 10b this example reinforces the model capability to represent the coupled human water system at regional scale 5 discussion 5 1 improving the representation of reservoir operation in large scale models this study compared generic reservoir operation schemes h06 scenario based on hanasaki et al 2006 to data driven ones scenarios 3pt related to the three point rule curve and reg associated to linear regressions between monthly water levels and dam outflows as expected the data driven approach led to more accurate discharge and storage estimates for example while the operation h06 outperformed 3pt in the hydrology metrics approaching reg it provided the worst results in terms of tracking observed storage fig 7 in this case accumulated flow errors lead to poor storage estimates turner et al 2020 h06 has few parameters and it is apparently too simple for a complex interconnected system in turn the reg scheme is similar to the one by solander et al 2016 in the way that it fits a relation between storage and outflow it is also related to yassin et al 2019 since it estimates the actual operational levels from observed data at a monthly basis adopting dam characteristics for levels out of the observed ranges thus emulating the actual reservoir rule curve the satisfactory performance of this rule is also associated to relatively low bias in mgb estimates see supplementary material s1 since inflow bias can largely affect reservoir simulation schemes turner et al 2020 the global based parameterization i e the one that does not require regionally locally available data led to a slightly poorer performance in comparison to the regional based one for discharge and it was generally more accurate than naturalized flows providing a reasonable approach to represent hydrological alteration at regional scales in terms of streamflow finally the results from the adopted operations should be analyzed by considering the context in which the real system is operated in brazil the actual operation of all major dams is defined considering the large scale interconnected hydrothermal power system sin based on operational decisions reallocating storage inter temporally throughout the system to minimize spills and energy production costs the sin is divided into regional interconnected subsystems south south east central west northeast and north with significantly diverse hydrological characteristics as the operation of a given hydropower plant affects others units downstream a system wide operation strategy prevails over individual ones first an energy generation solution is determined for the whole system which is later disaggregated to individual power units given the high contribution of hydropower in the mix over 65 and stochasticity of inflows operating costs depend on present and future decisions ons defines the dispatch schedule for all generating units connected in the sin hydropower thermal wind and nuclear on a monthly basis based on a merit order from lower to higher cost and considering current reservoir storage and flow forecasts hence when a group of reservoirs is low in storage in a given region hydropower plants from another region can be dispatched and the energy transferred avoiding the use of local thermal plants the coordinated operation ranges from long term four years to dispatch scheduling every half hour the improvement of regional scale models may involve hedging operations reducing releases to minimize the probability of more severe cutbacks in the future you and cai 2008 and coordinated operations marques and tilmant 2013 marques et al 2006 rougé et al 2019 which are typically not considered in this study the reg scheme was designed to represent an average behavior rule curve of the coordinated system which trades off its capability to depict anomalous years especially dry ones approaches focusing on a single reservoir may disregard basin scale flood or drought control that exists within a coordinated operation rougé et al 2019 furthermore to improve estimates a detailed operation would require the representation of actual hydraulic structures spillways outlet works etc fleischmann et al 2019a which is not always available to dams worldwide as our purpose is to perform regional scale simulations simplified operations were chosen for a better model applicability potential future improvements should expand the reg operation to multiple regressions including other relevant explanatory variables beyond observed levels e g solander et al 2016 these relevant variables should be chosen based on homogeneous behavior in specific regions i e not all regions would have the same explanatory variables with the same coefficients on the other hand the proposed methodology could be easily expanded to continental scale domains e g siqueira et al 2018 provided information on dam characteristics as stage area curves and observed time series of storage and outflows is available finally the proposed operation approaches do not take into account water withdrawals and consumptive demands associated e g irrigation as those are small in the context of the studied paraná basin at least at the regional scale and their effect is localized so that we focused on hydropower generation dams instead in future works distributed modeling systems should explicitly simulate reservoir dynamics as more information becomes available in brazil recent national scale mapping of irrigation schemes ana 2017 could be coupled to the mgb framework combined with recent developments in large scale modeling of reservoir operation under timely varying water demands biemans et al 2011 haddeland et al 2014 hanasaki et al 2006 voisin et al 2017 5 2 on the importance of representing the river floodplain reservoir continuum in large scale models the presented model of the river floodplain reservoir continuum at regional scale provides a continuous depiction of the spatial temporal variation of hydraulic variables as water surface elevation and flood extent and storage the consideration of a distributed reservoir bathymetry was shown to be fundamental to estimate backwater effects as revealed by a basin scale comparison between lumped and distributed schemes equal and variable bathymetry and an icesat based validation of the itaipu reservoir longitudinal water level profile backwater effects are required for many applications e g to perform real time monitoring of the impact of a given reservoir on an upstream city see the iguaçu river case study in section 4 3 or to correctly estimate the dam inflow along lateral tributaries a correct representation of hydrodynamics at the basin scale was also shown to be fundamental for flood frequency analysis considering both reservoirs and floodplains effects fleischmann et al 2019a tanaka et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zajac et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 design flood discharges are usually estimated with simplified methods as unit hydrographs that do not consider river floodplain attenuation an interesting and open research question relates to how far upstream can these floodplain storage effects go what has major implications for water resources management floodplains alter the celerity of flood waves at the whole basin scale and are a major driver of hydrograph shape across scales collischonn et al 2017 fleischmann et al 2016 besides here we have assessed the role of flood attenuation in riverine wetlands while at the very upstream reaches upland rain fed wetlands may also change towards flood generating areas requiring further studies acreman and holden 2013 natural floodplains provide valuable ecosystem services in terms of flood attenuation and resilience and its quantification requires new tools ameli and creed 2019 wu et al 2020 building new dams especially if designed for purposes different than flood control as well as new developments in floodplain areas e g levees may remove the large floodplain storage effects that protect downstream reaches against floods this was shown for many rivers as the mississippi with hundreds of kilometers of levees deactivating the river natural flood storage hey and philippi 1995 and the danube river schober et al 2014 furthermore a benefit cost analysis of acquiring floodplain lands to avoid flood damage was performed for the whole usa recently johnson et al 2020 and suggested that the cumulative flood damages exceeds the costs of land acquisition for a 2070 scenario the synergic effects of reservoirs and floodplains on flood attenuation have been increasingly addressed in the literature with large scale models shin et al 2020 and are in accordance with our results the analysis and modeling improvements provided here indicate that the synergy between floodable areas and the operation of dam cascades at the whole basin scale is relevant and requires further understanding which is beyond simpler large scale models relying solely on hydrodynamic simulations along downstream floodable areas in the case of the paraná basin inserting the proposed methodology into a proper flood risk management framework will require real time flood monitoring and forecasting 5 3 perspectives on simulating the river floodplain reservoir continuum at large scales the development of coupled river floodplain reservoir modeling systems is associated to the hyper resolution global modeling agenda aiming for example to improve medium range flood forecasts zajac et al

coordinated planning of reservoir expansion as well as understanding the effects of current and future dams on water and biogeochemical cycles bierkens et al 2015 wada et al 2016 and their interaction

to regional scales they can be used for actual dam operation real time monitoring and forecasting systems and estimation of locally relevant discharges at high spatial temporal resolution the necessity of spatially and temporally continuous fields of state variables as river discharges and levels has prompted the combination of remote sensing datasets and hydraulic models brêda et al 2019 gleason and durand 2020 icesat altimetry data provide valuable information for lakes gao 2015 o loughlin et al 2016 and are very promising for validating large scale reservoir modeling systems while new missions as icesat 2 threefold increase in sampling density and swot will increase our capability to remotely monitor reservoirs and estimate reservoir parameters and even reservoir operation bonnema and hossain 2017 2019 busker et al 2019 getirana et al 2018 van den hoek et al 2019 yao et al 2019 yoon et al 2016 yoon and beighley 2015 new global datasets of reservoir characteristics are also promising including new methodologies to estimate reservoir area depth volume relationships based on remote sensing datasets crétaux et al 2016 fassoni andrade et al 2020 gao et al 2012 lehner et al 2011 li et al 2020 liebe et al 2005 mulligan et al 2020 yigzaw et al 2019 2018 these advances contributed to the development of reservoir representation in global hydrological models döll et al 2009 sutanudjaja et al 2018 voisin et al 2013 wada et al 2016 yassin et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 including the data driven operations schemes as presented here and in other recent studies turner et al 2020 and are shaping the new generation of large scale water resources models regarding large scale model improvement we have adopted a 10 km river reach discretization for the paraná basin in accordance with current practices adopted in regional to global hydrological models i e 5 10 km shin et al 2019 wada et al 2016 zajac et al 2017 however higher resolution i e 1 km or smaller are required to better represent relatively small dams our results indicate the need for better representation of reservoir bathymetry distribution in order to correctly address local scale hydraulic processes as backwater effects corroborating recent studies adam et al 2007 shin et al 2019 finally we have also discussed the role of fully coupling hydrological hydrodynamic processes in a two way scheme the mgb model considers a dynamic surface water cover and the associated changes in evapotranspiration runoff generation e g by alternating the soil vegetation penman monteith equation with the open water penman equation reservoir evaporation was also implemented by other modeling systems adam et al 2007 mamede et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 this consideration is particularly important during dry periods and even more important for reservoirs in semi arid regions bonnema et al 2016 celeste and billib 2010 döll et al 2009 mamede et al 2018 besides a dynamic flood fraction cover other reservoir processes at local scale should also be included as reservoir sedimentation zhao et al 2016 and ground seepage 6 conclusions in this study we presented the successful development and a thorough analysis of a regional scale model capable to simulate the daily river floodplain reservoir continuum that exists along large basins a case study was performed in the 950 000 km2 upper paraná river basin in south america considering 30 regulation reservoirs and the itaipu run of river dam which is the largest in world in terms of energy production twelve simulation scenarios considering different reservoir bathymetry representation and reservoir operation schemes were performed and assessed in terms of water levels discharges flood extent and reservoir storage a methodology to assess the relative role of floodplains and reservoirs on basin wide flood attenuation was presented providing a powerful way to understand regional scale floods and the value of preserving natural floodplains services we conclude that a distributed representation of reservoir bathymetry in large scale hydrological models is required for accurate predictions of backwater effects upstream surface water elevation and flooding the longitudinal water level profile of the large itaipu dam was satisfactorily validated with icesat altimetry data which showed remote sensing data to be very promising especially considering future satellite missions as swot both lumped and distributed representations of reservoir bathymetry in large scale hydrological hydrodynamic models provide similar predictions of downstream river discharges and water levels a data driven operation scheme based on historical data of reservoir storage and outflows adds significant value to the accuracy of reservoir storage predictions if compared to more generic algorithms although the data driven approach outperforms more generic schemes namely the hanasaki et al 2006 based method h06 in terms of discharge estimation the simpler generic schemes provide reasonable estimates and thus can be useful to estimate regional scale hydrological regime alteration global based parameterizations of operation schemes lead to only slightly poorer performance in comparison to more regionally based ones providing reasonable estimates of regional scale hydrological regime alteration however to properly simulate the river floodplain reservoir continuum at regional scale a satisfactory simulation of water levels and reservoir storages are required and thus large scale models should include data driven reservoir operation approaches based on regional parameterization and distributed reservoir bathymetry if possible with a variable bathymetry scheme in the paraná river basin the floodplains are mainly located in upper parts of some tributaries and in the river mainstem while reservoir effects are more important for flood attenuation along medium and lower reaches of tributaries in this case floodplains and reservoirs provide complementary flood attenuation at regional scale the existence of river floodplains across the whole basin can lead to major flood attenuation at the regional scale and not only in downstream lowland reaches as usually assumed in large scale models major overestimation of flood design discharges can occur if the model does not consider upstream floodplain and reservoir storage effects especially in the context of flood frequency analysis finally our results stress the importance of simulating the river floodplain reservoir continuum at large scales increasing computational capacity with intense cloud computing and new remote sensing based datasets and techniques are quickly pushing the development of large to global scale models and thus improving to a great extent our understanding and prediction capability regarding reservoir floodplain interactions the integration of large scale hydrodynamic models with newly available remote sensing data will provide great research opportunities in the near future credit authorship contribution statement a s fleischmann conceptualization data curation investigation methodology writing original draft j p f brêda

4708,drought induced plant hydraulic failure is expected to increase under climate change and this negatively affects reforestation under the fragile karst environment in subtropical china compared with naturally regenerated forests planted forests can rapidly increase vegetation coverage and have considerable economic benefits however their degree of resistance to drought induced hydraulic failure is still unclear our study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by examining the differences in hydraulic characteristics between planted forests and naturally regenerated forests sample sites for both types of forest were selected in the humid subtropical karst region and the hydraulic safety margin stomatal conductance and species specific growing season length were measured for statistical analyses the planted forest had a narrower hydraulic safety margin and presented a greater vulnerability to hydraulic failure than the naturally regenerated forest however it can bud later and abscise leaves early to avoid hydraulic failure this study is the first to provide evidence of coordination between plant safety margin and species specific growing season length in fragile karst ecosystems

their current rainfall environment anderegg et al 2016 increased occurrences of drought induced mortality due to climate change have been widely reported cailleret et al 2017 an understanding of drought resistance strategies is critical for predicting the future performance such as hydraulic risk of plants under climate change zang et al 2014 in the humid subtropical regions of china karst plants are subject to a higher water deficit than non karst plants liu et al 2014 hou et al 2016 in addition owing to the fragile environment thin soil layer and slow soil formation rate and human overexploitation of natural resources karst vegetation has been degraded and bedrock outcrops have appeared over large areas tong et al 2017 this has limited regional economic development and resulted in considerable poverty to restore the ecosystem and alleviate poverty the grain for green project was initiated by the chinese government in this region in 1999 zhang et al 2016 two major types of restoration are usually undertaken through this project namely natural forest regeneration and planting forests on abandoned farmlands however it is unclear whether naturally regenerated forests nfs or planted forests pfs are more suitable for karst landscapes several researchers have focused on this aspect from various perspectives such as biodiversity conservation landscape dynamics ecosystem services soil quality and hydrological processes clements et al 2006 tong et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b however there is still a lack of knowledge on plant hydraulics which is essential for understanding plant vulnerability to drought under climate change therefore studies comparing the drought resistance strategies of pf and nf especially in terms of plant hydraulic traits are urgently needed cao and goodale 2018 in water deficit environments drought resistance requires critical plant hydraulic traits that can avoid gas emboli in the water transport system and maintain stable water transfer to the leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange several studies have evaluated drought resistance in terms of plant hydraulic traits for example gleason et al 2016 used the xylem water potential at pressure causing a 50 loss of hydraulic conductivity p50 to evaluate the cavitation vulnerability of xylem bucci et al 2005 used the minimum leaf water potential to show the degree of risk of leaf hydraulic failure whereas choat et al 2005 found that leaf abscission is a successful strategy to avoid the risk of leaf hydraulic failure moreover studies have used the hydraulic safety margin sm to show the degree of risk of plant hydraulic failure and predict plant mortality induced by drought plant hydraulic traits in karst regions have also been a research focus for example zhu et al 2017 found that tropical karst species are more resistant to cavitation than nearby tropical non karst species fu et al 2019 found that the leaves of tropical karst trees are better adapted to dry conditions than those of trees in a nearby tropical non karst forest however these studies have mainly focused on the vulnerability of natural forest to drought and neglected to examine the widespread pf created by national vegetation restoration and this is especially critical in karst regions which experience more frequent and extreme droughts guo et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 liu et al 2014 by investigating the different drought strategies of nfs and pfs predictions of mortality or vegetation degradation induced by drought events in humid karst regions can be improved most pfs grow quicker with a higher carbon gain rate for economic benefits than nfs zhang et al 2019a according to the trade off between growth and safety plants that grow quickly always have a lower safety and less adaptive ability to an environment with limited resources e g water deficit reich 2014 we hypothesize that pfs with a higher carbon gain rate would be more vulnerable to drought events under climate change than nfs and we aimed to test this hypothesis in this study the study results can help select optimal vegetation to maintain sustainable ecological restoration in fragile karst systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and plant materials this study was conducted in the chenqi watershed 1 3 km2 26 15 n 105 46 e guizhou province southwest china fig 1 the climate is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon with an annual mean precipitation of 1140 mm over 80 of precipitation occurs during the rainy season from may to october and a mean air temperature of 15 1 c puding climate station 19 km to chenqi watershed luo et al 2019 there are two broadleaved deciduous forests in the chenqi watershed nf and pf fig 1 a stand survey was conducted before the hydraulic trait experiments species were chosen according to their relative contribution to the stand basal area relative dominance in the two 10 m 10 m surveyed plots the five most dominant species were chosen from the nfs and the four most dominant species from the plantation the characteristics of the nine woody species are shown in table 1 the nf site is very close to the pf site and the minimum distance between them is approximately 20 m both sites have large sample areas approximately 10 000 m2 both sites consist of limestone and dolomite of the guanling formation of the middle triassic intercalated with gypsum strata both sites are located on north slopes and in the middle of hillsides see more site information in table 2 the nf is located at an elevation of 1320 1380 m and occurs naturally in restored areas the severity of disturbance during the 1980s was insufficient to remove all the existing vegetation and soil from the nf site therefore the remaining roots seeds or juniors can grow and form a forest the government selected this land for vegetation restoration in 2000 it changed to a closed secondary forest in 2017 with 90 tree layer coverage and 10 understory vegetation coverage shrub and grass the coverage was estimated as a projection of branches and foliage to the plot surface the pf is located at an elevation of 1320 1350 m the chinese government planted many trees with a high commercial value on abandoned sloping farmlands in 2000 to restore the vegetation pf was ploughed and fertilized in the planting year these tree species are typical of the non karst region but are found close to the reforestation region the tree layer reached up to 80 and the coverage of the understory vegetation shrub and grass reached 30 in 2017 2 2 hydraulic traits 2 2 1 xylem vulnerability curve a dehydration method was used to establish xylem vulnerability curves jarbeau et al 1995 sperry et al 2012 we collected 30 50 branches 1 year old branches of approximately 10 mm in diameter before sunrise 05 30 06 30 h during rainy days from 10 to 20 mature individuals of each species at the time of collection the cut end of each branch was immediately wrapped in parafilm and the entire branch was covered in black plastic bags to prevent excessive evaporation the bagged branches were brought to the laboratory immediately after collection in the laboratory the branches were exposed and dehydrated on tables to various states of dehydration the leaves from each branch were periodically sampled to determine water potential using a pressure chamber pms corvallis or usa when a targeted dehydration condition was reached the branches were wrapped in a black plastic bag so that the water content of the whole branch was stable and after 2 h a pressure chamber was used to measure the water potential of leaves from different positions along the branch the average water potential of the leaves was used to represent the xylem water potential the difference between the leaves was 0 3 mpa the branches were then cut underwater alternately at each end to obtain a stem segment of 30 cm length and 8 10 mm diameter the proximal end of each segment was connected to the hydraulic measurement system to measure the hydraulic conductivity sperry et al 1988 branch segments were flushed with 0 1 mol l kcl solution at a pressure of 0 1 mpa the distal end of the segment was connected to a pipette and then the initial conductance kh of the segment was determined using the following equation 1 k h f dx dp where f is the kcl solution flux rate dp mpa is the pressure drop along the length of the segment dx m and dp dx is the pressure gradient mpa m 1 santiago et al 2004 the maximum conductance kmax was determined again after flushing the segment with kcl solution at 100 kpa pressure for over 30 min the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity caused by stem embolization plc was measured by comparing hydraulic conductivity before kh and after kmax the removal of air emboli as shown in eq 1 sperry et al 1988 2 p l c 100 1 k h k max for each species the relationship between plc and xylem water pressure p was estimated using eq 3 3 plc 100 1 e a p b where plc is the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity p is the xylem water potential mpa and a and b are the estimated parameters of the plc curve b represents p50 which is negatively related to cavitation resistance and a is the slope of the vulnerability curve 2 2 2 species specific growing season length and leaf water potential species specific growing season length gl was calculated from the period between leaf emergence and leaf senescence the leaf emergence date is defined as the day when the first batch of leaves is fully spread on a few twigs of the observed trees the leaf senescence date is defined as the day when almost all leaves on the observed trees have fallen to the ground chmielewski and rotzer 2001 the time was determined by the start and end time of sap flow starting in 2017 after identifying the precise time of leaf emergence and the date of abscission we observed the number of spread leaves from 3 to 5 individuals in the week of sap flow starting in 2018 to check the exact budding time we also observed the number of residual leaves in the week when sap flow ended in 2018 to determine the exact senescence dates we used a pressure chamber pms corvallis to measure the water potential the predawn leaf water potential ψpredawn and midday leaf water potential ψmidday were measured in the late period of extreme drought events in august 2017 at 05 00 06 00 and 13 00 14 00 h respectively therefore ψmidday represents the minimum leaf water potential of the year ψmin the hydraulic sm is defined as the difference between ψmin and p50 sm ψmin p50 2 2 3 photosynthetic parameters we measured the net photosynthetic rate amax to assess the carbon sequestration capacity and used the stomatal conductance gs to evaluate the degree of risk in stomatal behavior we used a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor lincoln ne usa to measure the amax and gs both variables were measured between 09 00 and 11 00 h at an ambient co2 concentration of approximately 400 mmol m 2 s 1 six sunlit leaves from each of 3 5 individuals per species were chosen as different plant species have variable light saturation points the photosynthetic photon flux density was set as 1200 1500 mmol m 2 s 1 the leaf to air vapor pressure deficit was 1 6 kpa 2 3 leaf area index lai and diameter at breast height dbh we used the leaf area index to evaluate whether the forest declined between 2016 and 2020 the lai was measured on june 1 and june 15 of each year using lai 2200 cc li cor lincoln we measured trunk bole circumference at breast height 1 3 m for cb ts and eu 0 5 m for pp and then calculated the dbh for four species five trees for each species in pf annually from 2016 to 2020 we then calculated the annual average variation in dbh of four species to represent the dbh variation in pf 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 the homogeneity of variance and normal distribution of all datasets were checked before testing the assumptions of the statistical analysis we used the independent samples t test to assess whether there was a significant difference between the functional traits of pf and nf in addition pearson correlation was used to evaluate the correlation between the parameters 3 results 3 1 difference in drought resistance between pf and nf fig 2 shows wide variations in hydraulic traits both within and between the pf and nf individuals all hydraulic sms of the pf were negative and ranged from 0 48 to 0 68 mpa however nearly all nf species had a positive sm except populus adenopoda 0 07 mpa very close to 0 the independent samples t test results revealed that the pf had a lower sm than the nf fig 2b as the sm is determined by the p50 and ψmin the pf has not only a higher cavitation vulnerability p50 1 71 0 23 mpa but also a lower minimum leaf water potential ψmin 2 29 0 04 mpa than nf p50 2 440 0 179 mpa ψmin 1 89 0 06 mpa as shown in fig 2a and table 2 3 2 difference in the carbon gain rate and growth season length between the pf and nf as shown in fig 3 and table 2 the carbon gain rate and growth season length generally exhibited a broad variation the independent samples t test results revealed that the pf had a higher net photosynthetic rate amax 14 52 0 61 µmol m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance gs 0 26 0 06 mmol m 2 s 1 than the nf amax 11 03 0 58 µmol m 2 s 1 gs 0 18 0 07 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 table 2 however the nf had a longer growth season length gl 264 69 4 70 days than the pf 226 13 6 32 days table 2 and presented prolonged photosynthesis 3 3 correlation between carbon gain with growth season length and plant hydraulic traits as shown in fig 4 there was a significant relationship among carbon gain growth season length and plant hydraulic traits as determined by pearson correlation analysis more specifically as shown in fig 4a cavitation vulnerability significantly correlated with the net photosynthetic rate growth season length was negatively correlated with stomatal conductance fig 4b but positively correlated with hydraulic safety margin fig 4c 4 discussion both pf and nf show good adaptability to the current climate and geographical environment conditions tong et al 2018 chen et al 2019 but there is uncertainty about their sustainability under climate change with increasing frequency and duration of droughts therefore in this study we attempted to examine whether the pf has similar resistance to drought induced hydraulic failure as the nf and to provide suggestions for karst ecosystem restoration 4 1 reasons for the difference in drought resistance between the pf and nf the hydraulic sm is the best factor to evaluate drought induced vulnerability to hydraulic failure and tree mortality risk anderegg et al 2016 the nf had a higher hydraulic sm than the pf fig 2b this can be attributed to the fact that the trees in the nf have a lower leaf stomatal conductivity gs fig 3b than those in the pf fig 3 table 2 thereby reducing transpiration water loss and maintaining water potentials within tolerable limits higher ψmin table 2 franks et al 2007 in addition although the soil depth in the pf was slightly greater table 2 the nf species can grow deep roots into the cracks and fissures of karst layers during drought periods nie et al 2019 ding et al 2020 this adaptation resulted in the observed differences in minimum water potentials between nf and pf species therefore even during drought events the nf showed a positive sm fig 2a whereas the pf was under higher leaf water deficit lower ψmin to maintain a stable gas exchange pivovaroff et al 2018 therefore the sm also varied due to the trade off between safety and growth choat et al 2011 reich 2014 ocheltree et al 2016 plants with a higher carbon gain rate amax fig 3b always presented a lower wood density wd and a lower wd will increase cavitation vulnerability p50 enquist et al 2000 hacke et al 2001 2010 plavcova and hacke 2012 plavcova et al 2013 and the significant positive relationship between amax and p50 p 0 05 confirmed this aspect fig 4a except the differences in karst and non karst species such as root depth or growth rate zhu et al 2017 nie et al 2019 ding et al 2020 management such as fertilization can also result in a faster growth rate and high yielding for pf qiu 2010 tan et al 2011 yu et al 2019 consequently management activities potentially influence the drought resistance difference between pf and nf bucci et al 2006 goldstein et al 2013 gessler et al 2017 fang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 although more data and further study are needed these results clearly suggest that nf are more conservative and safer than pf in response to drought events thus indicating the importance of long term nf protection strategies and policies in china in terms of vegetation restoration a global meta analysis showed that most of the species have a positive hydraulic sm meinzer et al 2009 however our results showed that the sm of the pf was negative whereas nearly all nf species presented a positive sm except p adenopoda 0 07 mpa very close to 0 the sm of the pf species was negative because pf neither constrained leaf transpiration that induced xylem tension nor developed denser xylem structural features to avoid emboli the negative sm in the growing season implied that pfs are vulnerable to drought induced productivity decline however the pf did not show drought induced forest decline as both leaf area index and dbh kept increasing during the previous four years the longest dry spell was 12 days in the growing season and 19 days in a year table 2 therefore the pf may also adopt other strategies to compensate for the low sm such as embolism repair brodersen et al 2010 but further research is required to confirm this 4 2 coordination of drought resistance with growth season length the pf would bud later and abscise leaves earlier than the nf and then compensate for the vulnerability of the xylem to drought stress shorter gl table 2 with a significant positive relationship between species specific growing season length gl and the sm p 0 05 fig 4c in this study the positive relationship between leaf lifespan with carbon gain rate or hydraulic efficiency has been reported selaya and anten 2010 fu et al 2012 fu et al 2012 showed that deciduous species have a lower sm than evergreen species however in this study we found the coordination between plant sm and species specific growing season length fig 4c this result indicates that leaf abscission can largely reduce water loss due to transpiration by sacrificing low quality and vulnerable leaves consequently avoiding long term drought induced hydraulic failure of carbon costly stems maherali et al 2004 choat et al 2005 our results highlight the importance of considering the sensitivity of species specific growing season length to water stress in predicting forest mortality 4 3 implications and prospects of this study the results of this study showed that pf and nf can develop alternative functional strategies with differences in cavitation resistance and gl combinations leading to an approximately equal fitness within the subtropical karst environment however because of climate change extreme droughts have become more frequent a higher sm is of primary importance in resisting hydraulic failure and leaf abscission significantly reduces vegetation cover and increases the soil erosion risk especially during extreme precipitation after a long dry spell therefore it is recommended that restoration should be conducted with a combination of pf and nf and not just non karst pf alone a combination of pf and nf in the subtropical karst region will have both ecological fast growth and rapid restoration of vegetation that would not damage the environment and economic medicinal and edible value benefits the results of this study further confirm the importance of these four criteria of reforestation from plant hydraulic perspectives 1 matching species with the site 2 balance ecological and economic benefits 3 diversity principle and 4 native karst species preferred this study had some limitations we did not choose replication at the plot level however both sampling sites selected in this study were large enough 10 000 m2 and representative indeed several studies have used these sampling sites as study areas zhao et al 2010 yang et al 2012 wang et al 2014 chen et al 2018 in addition we focused only on drought resistance and carbon gain in this study but in future studies we will measure the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of the leaves d18o d13c to gain further insights into the water use strategies of the two forest restoration types moreno gutierrez et al 2012 yousfi et al 2012 ding et al 2020 overall our study stands as a pioneer in quantifying the difference in drought resistance with various types of restoration forest and identified a trade off between hydraulic risk and growing season length 5 conclusions knowledge of drought tolerance of various forest types is essential for ecological restoration pf in the karst region has a lower cavitation resistance lower minimum leaf water potential and lower sm but a higher carbon gain rate than nf although the plant hydraulic traits showed that pf has lower drought resistance the plants could avoid xylem hydraulic failure by sacrificing low quality leaves thus pf would not be under a higher hydraulic risk than nf and is promising for use in karst vegetation restoration however pf should be combined with nf to shorten the periods of low vegetation coverage and the associated high soil erosion credit authorship contribution statement ruzhou yi writing original draft

water potential at pressure causing a 50 loss of hydraulic conductivity p50 to evaluate the cavitation vulnerability of xylem bucci et al 2005 used the minimum leaf water potential to show the degree of risk of leaf hydraulic failure whereas choat et al 2005 found that leaf abscission is a successful strategy to avoid the risk of leaf hydraulic failure moreover studies have used the hydraulic safety margin sm to show the degree of risk of plant hydraulic failure and predict plant mortality induced by drought plant hydraulic traits in karst regions have also been a research focus for example zhu et al 2017 found that tropical karst species are more resistant to cavitation than nearby tropical non karst species fu et al 2019 found that the leaves of tropical karst trees are better adapted to dry conditions than those of trees in a nearby tropical non karst forest however these studies have mainly focused on the vulnerability of natural forest to drought and neglected to examine the widespread pf created by national vegetation restoration and this is especially critical in karst regions which experience more frequent and extreme droughts guo et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 liu et al 2014 by investigating the different drought strategies of nfs and pfs predictions of mortality or vegetation degradation induced by drought events in humid karst regions can be improved most pfs grow quicker with a higher carbon gain rate for economic benefits than nfs zhang et al 2019a according to the trade off between growth and safety plants that grow quickly always have a lower safety and less adaptive ability to an environment with limited resources e g water deficit reich 2014 we hypothesize that pfs with a higher carbon gain rate would be more vulnerable to drought events under climate change than nfs and we aimed to test this hypothesis in this study the study results can help select optimal vegetation to maintain sustainable ecological restoration in fragile karst systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and plant materials this study was conducted in the chenqi watershed 1 3 km2 26 15 n 105 46 e guizhou province southwest china fig 1 the climate is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon with an annual mean precipitation of 1140 mm over 80 of precipitation occurs during the rainy season from may to october and a mean air temperature of 15 1 c puding climate station 19 km to chenqi watershed luo et al 2019 there are two broadleaved deciduous forests in the chenqi watershed nf and pf fig 1 a stand survey was conducted before the hydraulic trait experiments species were chosen according to their relative contribution to the stand basal area relative dominance in the two 10 m 10 m surveyed plots the five most dominant species were chosen from the nfs and the four most dominant species from the plantation the characteristics of the nine woody species are shown in table 1 the nf site is very close to the pf site and the minimum distance between them is approximately 20 m both sites have large sample areas approximately 10 000 m2 both sites consist of limestone and dolomite of the guanling formation of the middle triassic intercalated with gypsum strata both sites are located on north slopes and in the middle of hillsides see more site information in table 2 the nf is located at an elevation of 1320 1380 m and occurs naturally in restored areas the severity of disturbance during the 1980s was insufficient to remove all the existing vegetation and soil from the nf site therefore the remaining roots seeds or juniors can grow and form a forest the government selected this land for vegetation restoration in 2000 it changed to a closed secondary forest in 2017 with 90 tree layer coverage and 10 understory vegetation coverage shrub and grass the coverage was estimated as a projection of branches and foliage to the plot surface the pf is located at an elevation of 1320 1350 m the chinese government planted many trees with a high commercial value on abandoned sloping farmlands in 2000 to restore the vegetation pf was ploughed and fertilized in the planting year these tree species are typical of the non karst region but are found close to the reforestation region the tree layer reached up to 80 and the coverage of the understory vegetation shrub and grass reached 30 in 2017 2 2 hydraulic traits 2 2 1 xylem vulnerability curve a dehydration method was used to establish xylem vulnerability curves jarbeau et al 1995 sperry et al 2012 we collected 30 50 branches 1 year old branches of approximately 10 mm in diameter before sunrise 05 30 06 30 h during rainy days from 10 to 20 mature individuals of each species at the time of collection the cut end of each branch was immediately wrapped in parafilm and the entire branch was covered in black plastic bags to prevent excessive evaporation the bagged branches were brought to the laboratory immediately after collection in the laboratory the branches were exposed and dehydrated on tables to various states of dehydration the leaves from each branch were periodically sampled to determine water potential using a pressure chamber pms corvallis or usa when a targeted dehydration condition was reached the branches were wrapped in a black plastic bag so that the water content of the whole branch was stable and after 2 h a pressure chamber was used to measure the water potential of leaves from different positions along the branch the average water potential of the leaves was used to represent the xylem water potential the difference between the leaves was 0 3 mpa the branches were then cut underwater alternately at each end to obtain a stem segment of 30 cm length and 8 10 mm diameter the proximal end of each segment was connected to the hydraulic measurement system to measure the hydraulic conductivity sperry et al 1988 branch segments were flushed with 0 1 mol l kcl solution at a pressure of 0 1 mpa the distal end of the segment was connected to a pipette and then the initial conductance kh of the segment was determined using the following equation 1 k h f dx dp where f is the kcl solution flux rate dp mpa is the pressure drop along the length of the segment dx m and dp dx is the pressure gradient mpa m 1 santiago et al 2004 the maximum conductance kmax was determined again after flushing the segment with kcl solution at 100 kpa pressure for over 30 min the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity caused by stem embolization plc was measured by comparing hydraulic conductivity before kh and after kmax the removal of air emboli as shown in eq 1 sperry et al 1988 2 p l c 100 1 k h k max for each species the relationship between plc and xylem water pressure p was estimated using eq 3 3 plc 100 1 e a p b where plc is the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity p is the xylem water potential mpa and a and b are the estimated parameters of the plc curve b represents p50 which is negatively related to cavitation resistance and a is the slope of the vulnerability curve 2 2 2 species specific growing season length and leaf water potential species specific growing season length gl was calculated from the period between leaf emergence and leaf senescence the leaf emergence date is defined as the day when the first batch of leaves is fully spread on a few twigs of the observed trees the leaf senescence date is defined as the day when almost all leaves on the observed trees have fallen to the ground chmielewski and rotzer 2001 the time was determined by the start and end time of sap flow starting in 2017 after identifying the precise time of leaf emergence and the date of abscission we observed the number of spread leaves from 3 to 5 individuals in the week of sap flow starting in 2018 to check the exact budding time we also observed the number of residual leaves in the week when sap flow ended in 2018 to determine the exact senescence dates we used a pressure chamber pms corvallis to measure the water potential the predawn leaf water potential ψpredawn and midday leaf water potential ψmidday were measured in the late period of extreme drought events in august 2017 at 05 00 06 00 and 13 00 14 00 h respectively therefore ψmidday represents the minimum leaf water potential of the year ψmin the hydraulic sm is defined as the difference between ψmin and p50 sm ψmin p50 2 2 3 photosynthetic parameters we measured the net photosynthetic rate amax to assess the carbon sequestration capacity and used the stomatal conductance gs to evaluate the degree of risk in stomatal behavior we used a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor lincoln ne usa to measure the amax and gs both variables were measured between 09 00 and 11 00 h at an ambient co2 concentration of approximately 400 mmol m 2 s 1 six sunlit leaves from each of 3 5 individuals per species were chosen as different plant species have variable light saturation points the photosynthetic photon flux density was set as 1200 1500 mmol m 2 s 1 the leaf to air vapor pressure deficit was 1 6 kpa 2 3 leaf area index lai and diameter at breast height dbh we used the leaf area index to evaluate whether the forest declined between 2016 and 2020 the lai was measured on june 1 and june 15 of each year using lai 2200 cc li cor lincoln we measured trunk bole circumference at breast height 1 3 m for cb ts and eu 0 5 m for pp and then calculated the dbh for four species five trees for each species in pf annually from 2016 to 2020 we then calculated the annual average variation in dbh of four species to represent the dbh variation in pf 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 the homogeneity of variance and normal distribution of all datasets were checked before testing the assumptions of the statistical analysis we used the independent samples t test to assess whether there was a significant difference between the functional traits of pf and nf in addition pearson correlation was used to evaluate the correlation between the parameters 3 results 3 1 difference in drought resistance between pf and nf fig 2 shows wide variations in hydraulic traits both within and between the pf and nf individuals all hydraulic sms of the pf were negative and ranged from 0 48 to 0 68 mpa however nearly all nf species had a positive sm except populus adenopoda 0 07 mpa very close to 0 the independent samples t test results revealed that the pf had a lower sm than the nf fig 2b as the sm is determined by the p50 and ψmin the pf has not only a higher cavitation vulnerability p50 1 71 0 23 mpa but also a lower minimum leaf water potential ψmin 2 29 0 04 mpa than nf p50 2 440 0 179 mpa ψmin 1 89 0 06 mpa as shown in fig 2a and table 2 3 2 difference in the carbon gain rate and growth season length between the pf and nf as shown in fig 3 and table 2 the carbon gain rate and growth season length generally exhibited a broad variation the independent samples t test results revealed that the pf had a higher net photosynthetic rate amax 14 52 0 61 µmol m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance gs 0 26 0 06 mmol m 2 s 1 than the nf amax 11 03 0 58 µmol m 2 s 1 gs 0 18 0 07 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 table 2 however the nf had a longer growth season length gl 264 69 4 70 days than the pf 226 13 6 32 days table 2 and presented prolonged photosynthesis 3 3 correlation between carbon gain with growth season length and plant hydraulic traits as shown in fig 4 there was a significant relationship among carbon gain growth season length and plant hydraulic traits as determined by pearson correlation analysis more specifically as shown in fig 4a cavitation vulnerability significantly correlated with the net photosynthetic rate growth season length was negatively correlated with stomatal conductance fig 4b but positively correlated with hydraulic safety margin fig 4c 4 discussion both pf and nf show good adaptability to the current climate and geographical environment conditions tong et al 2018 chen et al 2019 but there is uncertainty about their sustainability under climate change with increasing frequency and duration of droughts therefore in this study we attempted to examine whether the pf has similar resistance to drought induced hydraulic failure as the nf and to provide suggestions for karst ecosystem restoration 4 1 reasons for the difference in drought resistance between the pf and nf the hydraulic sm is the best factor to evaluate drought induced vulnerability to hydraulic failure and tree mortality risk anderegg et al 2016 the nf had a higher hydraulic sm than the pf fig 2b this can be attributed to the fact that the trees in the nf have a lower leaf stomatal conductivity gs fig 3b than those in the pf fig 3 table 2 thereby reducing transpiration water loss and maintaining water potentials within tolerable limits higher ψmin table 2 franks et al 2007 in addition although the soil depth in the pf was slightly greater table 2 the nf species can grow deep roots into the cracks and fissures of karst layers during drought periods nie et al 2019 ding et al 2020 this adaptation resulted in the observed differences in minimum water potentials between nf and pf species therefore even during drought events the nf showed a positive sm fig 2a whereas the pf was under higher leaf water deficit lower ψmin to maintain a stable gas exchange pivovaroff et al 2018 therefore the sm also varied due to the trade off between safety and growth choat et al 2011 reich 2014 ocheltree et al 2016 plants with a higher carbon gain rate amax fig 3b always presented a lower wood density wd and a lower wd will increase cavitation vulnerability p50 enquist et al 2000 hacke et al 2001 2010 plavcova and hacke 2012 plavcova et al 2013 and the significant positive relationship between amax and p50 p 0 05 confirmed this aspect fig 4a except the differences in karst and non karst species such as root depth or growth rate zhu et al 2017 nie et al 2019 ding et al 2020 management such as fertilization can also result in a faster growth rate and high yielding for pf qiu 2010 tan et al 2011 yu et al 2019 consequently management activities potentially influence the drought resistance difference between pf and nf bucci et al 2006 goldstein et al 2013 gessler et al 2017 fang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 although more data and further study are needed these results clearly suggest that nf are more conservative and safer than pf in response to drought events thus indicating the importance of long term nf protection strategies and policies in china in terms of vegetation restoration a global meta analysis showed that most of the species have a positive hydraulic sm meinzer et al 2009 however our results showed that the sm of the pf was negative whereas nearly all nf species presented a positive sm except p adenopoda 0 07 mpa very close to 0 the sm of the pf species was negative because pf neither constrained leaf transpiration that induced xylem tension nor developed denser xylem structural features to avoid emboli the negative sm in the growing season implied that pfs are vulnerable to drought induced productivity decline however the pf did not show drought induced forest decline as both leaf area index and dbh kept increasing during the previous four years the longest dry spell was 12 days in the growing season and 19 days in a year table 2 therefore the pf may also adopt other strategies to compensate for the low sm such as embolism repair brodersen et al 2010 but further research is required to confirm this 4 2 coordination of drought resistance with growth season length the pf would bud later and abscise leaves earlier than the nf and then compensate for the vulnerability of the xylem to drought stress shorter gl table 2 with a significant positive relationship between species specific growing season length gl and the sm p 0 05 fig 4c in this study the positive relationship between leaf lifespan with carbon gain rate or hydraulic efficiency has been reported selaya and anten 2010 fu et al 2012 fu et al 2012 showed that deciduous species have a lower sm than evergreen species however in this study we found the coordination between plant sm and species specific growing season length fig 4c this result indicates that leaf abscission can largely reduce water loss due to transpiration by sacrificing low quality and vulnerable leaves consequently avoiding long term drought induced hydraulic failure of carbon costly stems maherali et al 2004 choat et al 2005 our results highlight the importance of considering the sensitivity of species specific growing season length to water stress in predicting forest mortality 4 3 implications and prospects of this study the results of this study showed that pf and nf can develop alternative functional strategies with differences in cavitation resistance and gl combinations leading to an approximately equal fitness within the subtropical karst environment however because of climate change extreme droughts have become more frequent a higher sm is of primary importance in resisting hydraulic failure and leaf abscission significantly reduces vegetation cover and increases the soil erosion risk especially during extreme precipitation after a long dry spell therefore it is recommended that restoration should be conducted with a combination of pf and nf and not just non karst pf alone a combination of pf and nf in the subtropical karst region will have both ecological fast growth and rapid restoration of vegetation that would not damage the environment and economic medicinal and edible value benefits the results of this study further confirm the importance of these four criteria of reforestation from plant hydraulic perspectives 1 matching species with the site 2 balance ecological and economic benefits 3 diversity principle and 4 native karst species preferred this study had some limitations we did not choose replication at the plot level however both sampling sites selected in this study were large enough 10 000 m2 and representative indeed several studies have used these sampling sites as study areas zhao et al 2010 yang et al 2012 wang et al 2014 chen et al 2018 in addition we focused only on drought resistance and carbon gain in this study but in future studies we will measure the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of the leaves d18o d13c to gain further insights into the water use strategies of the two forest restoration types moreno gutierrez et al 2012 yousfi et al 2012 ding et al 2020 overall our study stands as a pioneer in quantifying the difference in drought resistance with various types of restoration forest and identified a trade off between hydraulic risk and growing season length 5 conclusions knowledge of drought tolerance of various forest types is essential for ecological restoration pf in the karst region has a lower cavitation resistance lower minimum leaf water potential and lower sm but a higher carbon gain rate than nf although the plant hydraulic traits showed that pf has lower drought resistance the plants could avoid xylem hydraulic failure by sacrificing low quality leaves thus pf would not be under a higher hydraulic risk than nf and is promising for use in karst vegetation restoration however pf should be combined with nf to shorten the periods of low vegetation coverage and the associated high soil erosion credit authorship contribution statement ruzhou yi writing original draft

4709,increasing evidence from studies in urban wastewater systems proves that sewer exfiltration may present a profound threat for rising levels of toxic substances and microbial pollution in groundwater new and innovative methods for monitoring sewage exfiltration are continuously developed which provide a solicit ground for a better understanding of key processes and influencing characteristics of sewer exfiltration to support the development of mathematical equations and models worldwide however modelling of sewer exfiltration and its associated impacts on groundwater are still constrained and not fully understood in large urban systems this paper reviews the knowledge advancements and challenges of sewer exfiltration modelling based on the present review we define five key research domains for developing more generic framework of large scale models these domains inquire to advance the representation of hydraulic modelling e g testing exfiltration models coupled with biofilm growth models modelling of solutes originating from sewer leakages e g heavy metals define the practical values of key model parameters of main model components and sub processes for calibration and uncertainty evaluations develop upscaling approaches for integrated multi dimensional sewer exfiltration models and incorporation of sewer exfiltration from private sewers keywords exfiltration rate leakage factor standard leakage area colmation layer private sewers 1 introduction sewer exfiltration is the process of wastewater losses from a defective sewer system to the environment rutsch et al 2008 sewer exfiltration is often associated with soil undermining and bedrock dissolution which may lead to sinkhole development urban infrastructure damages and further expansions of exfiltration areas selvakumar et al 2004 hermosilla 2012 harvey and mcbean 2014 an increasing number of investigations provide solicited evidence that sewer exfiltration can be the source of significant pollutions to groundwater e g reynolds and barrett 2003 lee et al 2015 grimmeisen et al 2017 thus reliable quantification of sewer exfiltration plays an important role in supporting sewer network rehabilitation and management decision of urban areas vulnerable to sewer exfiltration contamination ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 karpf 2012 dvory et al 2018 traditionally sewer exfiltration is measured using various monitoring approaches which serve as foundation for the classification of sewer defects and exfiltration chisala and lerner 2008 harvey and mcbean 2014 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 closed circuit television cctv is so far the most common method to evaluate the structural integrity and defects of sewers and has been used in major cities worldwide amick and burgess 2000 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 techniques using sewer tracers and wastewater indicators e g sodium chloride fluorescent dyes are increasingly applied since these methods can distinguish substances from sewer exfiltration with pollutants from other sources entering groundwater e g ellis and revitt 2001 fenz et al 2005 rieckermann et al 2007 2010 lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 stegeman et al 2019 other techniques for in situ measurements of sewer exfiltration include distributed temperature sensing dts e g nienhuis et al 2013 electric resistivity

scanning e g clemens et al 2015 although a variety of instruments are available to monitor and detect leaks they are often labor intensive and expensive to apply on the whole sewer network thus can hardly represent large spatial pattern or be applied at higher frequencies blackwood et al 2005 2006 wolf and hötztl 2007 additional to field observation techniques there is a need to develop modeling tools to quantify emissions from sewer exfiltration source to groundwater and to predict the structural state of sewers for management decisions of urban wastewater systems yang et al 1999 karpf et al 2009 roehrdanz et al 2017 sewer exfiltration models have been developed to help identify target areas with the highest leakage rate potentials at various temporal and spatial scales yang et al 1999 karpf et al 2009 peche et al 2017 the general principles and approaches for sewer exfiltration models emerged more than a decade ago rutsch et al 2008 karpf et al 2009 peche et al 2017 however model development progress is still slow which is indicated by a limited number of published studies on sewer exfiltration models when compared to models for other environmental applications e g zoppou 2001 fu et al 2019 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 integrated 1d 3d models were developed to simulate sewer exfiltration dynamics but are hard to validate due to the large number of data required for model parametrization rutsch et al 2008 peche et al 2017 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 karpf 2012 and peche 2019 proposed simplified approaches for modeling sewer exfiltration but the methods have been tested only to site specific and pipe scales wolf et al 2012 considered the temporal and spatial variation of sewer exfiltration to groundwater by conducting sampling for the period from 2002 to 2008 in the city of rastatt however no significant findings on lateral and horizontal fluxes of sewer exfiltration were achieved from the limited number of wastewater indicators lee et al 2015 and roehrdanz et al 2017 developed a spatial model of sewer exfiltration which allows predicting the occurrence of exfiltration in shallow groundwater and incorporates various wastewater indicators but the outputs of the model are subjected to the groundwater short term observations in a small region of a city besides the uncertainty of upscalling approaches in sewer exfiltration modelling remains significant issue due to a lack of understanding of core parameters and processes of sewer exfiltration wolf and hötztl 2007 karpf 2012 peche 2019 so far the studies by rutsch et al 2005 and rutsch et al 2008 remain the only reviews that incorporate modelling aspects of sewer exfiltration table 1 though many changes have occurred since then in this study we review and evaluate the current state of sewer exfiltration models with a particular focus on hydrological aspects of model developments and applications the ultimate aim is to review the up to date knowledge and understanding of the whole mechanism of wastewater exfiltration from defective sewers to groundwater and define critical research gaps to reduce uncertainty in decision making relating to outputs from sewer exfiltration models the term exfiltration and leakage are used interchangeably in this field though the latter term often includes both the infiltration of groundwater into sewer pipes and the exfiltration of sewage into the environment as well as diverse types of outflows through defective canals such as drinking water delivery karpf 2012 hatam et al 2019 in the scope of this review most of our discussions are targeted explicitly on the exfiltration from wastewater sewers due to its impacts on groundwater the overall scheme of the review is presented in fig 1 2 an overview of sewer exfiltration processes sewer exfiltration releases pollutants to the environment which may exceed emissions at background conditions and from other sources wolf et al 2012 lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 fig 2 untreated wastewater from sewer exfiltration has been observed to contain high levels of suspended solids organic pollutants and toxic substances usepa 1989 reynolds and barrett 2003 lee et al 2015 pathogenic microorganisms in sewer exfiltration may potentially impair the recreational values of surrounding surface waters cause risks to public health groundwater pollution and serious economic damages burston et al 1993 blackwood et al 2005 sercu et al 2011 karamouz et al 2011 harvey and mcbean 2014 however emissions to the environment from urban sewer leakage often perceive less attention than those from agricultural areas and are even neglected in studies of urban system emissions particularly at large scale studies e g eiswirth and hötzl 1997 burn et al 2007 peche et al 2017 sewer exfiltration can be seen as a conditional process davies et al 2001 rutsch 2006 karpf 2012 the first condition is the existence of a defect in the sewer either due to aging and deterioration of materials poor construction of sewer pipes physical stress e g due to surface loads or plant root intrusion or the effect from the surrounding soil bedding e g desilva et al 2005 chisala and lerner 2008 another prerequisite condition for the occurrence of sewer exfiltration processes is the partly or completely location of defective pipes above the groundwater level ellis et al 2009 boukhemacha et al 2015 finally the hydraulic potential in the sewer pipe has to be higher than the hydraulic potential in the surrounding soil such that gravity induced leakage flow can occur peche et al 2017 2019 the difference in hydraulic heads in the sewer and groundwater governs the direction and the rate of sewer leakage selvakumar et al 2004 roehrdanz et al 2017 the process of sewer exfiltration from damaged pipes into urban groundwater does not remain constant over time ellis et al 2009 boukhemacha et al 2015 peche et al 2017 at first the exfiltration rate is low when the soil environment is dry i e the hydraulic potential of the soil is small the exfiltration rate into the soil increases with increasing soil moisture corresponding to increasing relative permeability at large hydraulic gradients between the pipe and the soil in the pipe vicinity and soil moisture increased sewer exfiltration leads to downwards propagation of a wetting front and sewer outflow may recharge groundwater sewer exfiltration is governed by the presence of a colmation layer forming in the pipe defect vicinity karpf 2012 peche 2019 after the occurrence of a pipe defect high sewer exfiltration rates continue until an equilibrium pressure height between in sewer and soil conditions is reached these high rates often remain over some hours or days largely depending on soil properties such as initial soil moisture and soil hydraulic properties before gradually decreasing karpf and krebs 2004 boukhemacha et al 2015 the reduction in exfiltration rates is due to the stabilization of the colmation layer which causes a change of hydraulic properties in the form of a reduction of porosity and intrinsic permeability of the soil in the pipe vicinity this reduction continues until a mature colmation layer is developed ellis et al 2009 boukhemacha et al 2015 a kinematic wave pulse i e a breakthrough can be initiated by diurnal peak flows or during storm events klinger et al 2007 this is due to a temporary local increase in flow velocity turbulence shear stress changing hydraulic gradients and accompanied by instability of colmation layers leading to a breaking up of the colmation layer ellis et al 2009 as a result a steady state exfiltration condition is disturbed by a short term increase of exfiltration a few orders of magnitudes above the equilibrium of the dry weather flow wolf et al 2007 such wash out events followed by the establishment of steady state conditions have been observed persistently in various studies i e both in laboratory and field tests but the effects are local and only remain over a short time vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 wolf et al 2007 thus it is acknowledged that sewer defects are never completely blocked and are subject to certain degrees of exfiltration when evaluating over extended time periods reynolds and barrett 2003 ellis et al 2009 3 key influencing variables of sewer exfiltration processes stemming from literature influential primary factors that affect sewer exfiltration modelling include pipe characteristics and defective conditions wastewater level and composition in the pipe soil properties hydraulic potential as expressed by water pressure and soil moisture in the soil in the pipe vicinity and colmation layers davies et al 2001 ellis et al 2009 harvey and mcbean 2014 roehrdanz et al 2017 these driving factors and their associated attributes and or important derivatives are therefore reviewed in detail in the following section fig 3 to explore the progress in understanding the key parameters and their role in sewer exfiltration modelling 3 1 sewer pipe characteristics pipe characteristics and conditions are reported to significantly affect the sewer exfiltration rates among various locations in the sewer network dohmann 1995 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 lee et al 2015 major pipe characteristics reported in sewer exfiltration studies include age e g kettler and goulter 1985 diameter desilva et al 2005 length le gat and eisenbeis 2000 types of pipe junctions berardi et al 2008 and material e g harvey and mcbean 2014 aging sewer systems are the most primary cause of sewer exfiltration in soil and groundwater worldwide amick and burgess 2000 reynolds and barrett 2003 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 based on a literature review on the status of sewers and their potential exfiltration rate chisala and lerner 2008 concluded that exfiltration risks increase with the sewer system age and decrease in more modern and younger sewers the higher durability of newer pipe infrastructure is achieved by more inert and stable materials and connections reynolds and barrett 2003 gibson et al 2019 regarding the conditions of sewer pipes typical reasons causing sewer exfiltration include defects at lateral connections broken joints transversal and longitudinal cracks fractures and holes decker 1994 the rate of exfiltration also depends considerably on the defect types for instance vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 reported three times higher exfiltration rates for cracks than for open joints and holes i e 0 02 l d cm2 and 0 06 l d cm2 respectively 3 2 standard defect area many studies suggest that the exfiltration rate is positively correlated with the pipe defect area i e the exfiltration relevant damaged area e g davies et al 2001 howard 2007 meanwhile other studies conclude that this effect might be overestimated since large defects allow more sealing material in the sewage to reach the gravel and thus reduce the rate of sewer exfiltration e g blackwood et al 2006 thus the term standard defect area is often used to represent the status of defective sewers in sewer exfiltration models rutsch et al 2008 it is based on the assumption that similar pipe characteristics and defective conditions induce similar exfiltration rates franz and krebs 2005 karpf 2012 the term standard defect area also named as average defect area or representative elementary area refers to the mean defect size per unit pipe length given as the defect area per pipe length in m2 m in a given pipe network and represents the unique characteristics and defective condition of the entire pipe network within the study boundary in a study by rauch and stegner 1994 the rectangular hole 0 0015 m2 m was used as the standard leak size for all experiments wolf and hötztl 2007 suggested an average size of a defective sewer around 0 002 m2 m based on their literature review and considered the estimated average defect size in their particular case study 0 008 m2 m to be high because the study was focused on critical defects with large size similar to rauch and stegner 1994 karpf 2012 proposes the application of a standard quadratic size of a defective pipe in sewer exfiltration calculations and these values have been adopted successfully in sewer pipe models proposed by peche et al 2017 and peche et al 2019 3 3 colmation layer sewer exfiltration is known as a self sealing or self repairing process due to the effect of a colmation layer forming blackwood et al 2006 karpf et al 2011 a colmation layer is defined as a layer developed of solid inputs from wastewater biomass growth and chemical precipitation and is characterized by fast declining hydraulic conductivity compared to that in the surrounding underground rauch and stegner 1994 ellis et al 2009 meanwhile any overlying biofilm should be referred to as a bridging layer because the formation of this external layer is assumed to not affect the exfiltration rate through a defect ellis et al 2009 karpf et al 2011 for modelling purposes colmation layers are often represented by the two constant properties colmation layer thickness and intrinsic permeability expressed as hydraulic conductivity for simplification accordingly the colmation layer is modelled as a thin layer with a thickness varying between 10 and 20 mm possessing a relatively low permeability vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 karpf et al 2009 peche et al 2017 hydraulic conductivity decreases with time until a constant value is reached this parameter is assumed to represent a mature and stabilized colmation layer up to the thickness of 50 mm the colmation layer is stabilized and hinders the process of exfiltration from defective pipes ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 3 4 soil matrix one of the main difficulties in estimating sewer exfiltration is associated with the complex physico chemical interactions between wastewater in the exfiltration and soil medium which involves the chemical composition in the soil e g ph sulfates chlorides soil moisture hydraulic conductivity porosity and aeration levels ellis et al 2003 nickpay et al 2015 studies at the laboratory to pipe scales indicate a wide range of removal of dissolved organic carbon doc and ammonium from 30 to 73 and from 0 to 99 respectively depending on soil particle size dissolved oxygen supply in the soil and the residence time of sewage flow in the unsaturated zone fuchs et al 2004 when exposed to acidic or sulfate bearing soil medium concrete pipes are more susceptible to corrosion than clay pipes davies et al 2001 jaganathan et al 2010 thus it is often suggested to interpret the effects of soil on sewer exfiltration in modelling studies in the context of the interaction and exchange of the soil matrix i e the matrix potential of the soil below the colmation layer and the colmation layer ellis et al 2009 karpf et al 2011 the soil matrix potential increases and hydraulic conductivity decreases with reduced water content in the soil together affecting the estimation of the hydraulic potential in the pipe karpf et al 2009 more details on this issue are described in the following section on hydraulic potential 3 5 hydraulic potentials in the pipe and in the soil in the pipe vicinity the process of sewer exfiltration depends on the hydraulic potential gradient between pipe water as expressed by wastewater level and water pressure in the soil in the pipe defect vicinity fig 3 the pipe water level may be represented in static mode by a constant water level or pressure head representing e g dry weather flow or calculated dynamically using pipe flow equations or models e g rauch and stegner 1994 karpf et al 2009 for dynamic pipe flow calculations the saint venant equations de saint venant 1871 are used in many studies e g karpf and krebs 2005 kidmose et al 2015 peche et al 2017 later studies include the effect of a colmation layer on the hydraulic potential in the sewer pipes and in the soil matrix surrounding the pipes the water pressure in the soil in the pipe defect vicinity is used for determining the hydraulic gradient i e the actual three dimensional water pressure distribution in the soil is reduced to one spatial dimension by assuming a water flow through the colmation layer to be one dimensional e g karpf 2012 peche et al 2017 this is achieved by defining the hydraulic potential in the soil as the potential directly below the colmation layer and enables to use a one dimensional form of darcy s law or richard s equation according to this the change of the hydraulic potential not only depends on the water level in the pipe and the thickness of the colmation layer but also on the soil matrix potential below the colmation layer including the local soil moisture as expressed by the relative permeability and soil properties as expressed by intrinsic permeability and retention curve parameters beal et al 2004 ellis et al 2009 most of the time the sewer exfiltration process rarely occurs under partially saturated soil conditions and is highly non linear however sewer exfiltration is often linearized by using a modified version of darcy s law in order to reduce computational complexities rutsch et al 2008 karpf 2012 only a few studies exist where the non linearity of the exfiltration process is considered e g kidmose et al 2015 peche et al 2017 3 6 exfiltration rate sewer exfiltration rate is the primary indicator addressed in sewer exfiltration studies to quantitatively estimate the losses from defective sewers numerous studies focusing on sewer exfiltration rates are reported in the literature including reviews by gruenfeld 2000 rutsch et al 2008 and ellis et al 2009 according to these studies a broad variability of values and units of reported exfiltration rates are recorded from field and laboratory investigations this variability depends on the measurement techniques the scale and focus of studies and the particular conditions at the study sites as such it is recommended to develop a standardization of the found quantification approaches for modelling applications rutsch et al 2008 peche et al 2017 corresponding to results from laboratory and field measurements modelling studies provided relatively consistent estimates of exfiltration rates though being tested at different spatial and temporal scales and using methods of different complexity table 2 collates reported values to derive generalized patterns and trends accordingly exfiltration rates are often expressed as the amount of exfiltration per standard area and per unit length of pipes i e l day cm2 or l s km respectively e g chisala and lerner 2008 karpf 2012 ellis et al 2009 pointed out that an over estimation of some reported data at the larger scale might be due to upscaling the results from physical experiments and monitoring concluding from different studies exfiltration rates between 1 0 10 2 and 0 2 l s km or even less in case of sewers carrying large sediment loads provide reasonable mean values for large scale approaches 4 development and applications of sewer exfiltration models together with a reliable estimation of sewer exfiltration at defective pipe sites complex biogeochemical processes need to be considered to model flow and matter transport into soil and groundwater karpf and krebs 2011 initial equations of sewer exfiltration were developed to quantify losses from sewer systems and to gain a better understanding of the effects of sewer exfiltration on groundwater e g yang et al 1999 ly and chui 2012 later studies integrated equations of sewer exfiltration into empirical and process based models to simulate the overall sewer leakage processes reynolds and barrett 2003 peche et al 2017 dvory et al 2018 this section reviews in detail the development and advancements of sewer exfiltration equations and models 4 1 estimation approaches of sewer exfiltration three main approaches for calculations of sewer exfiltration are defined in the literature sewer exfiltration rates leakage factor and leakage functions table 3 4 1 1 sewer exfiltration rates equations of sewer exfiltration are based on a combination of theoretical assumptions and laboratory or field investigations two general approaches are referred to in the review by rutsch et al 2008 one approach is based on the torricelli equation eq 1 calculating exfiltration rates as a function of the coefficient of outflow gravitational acceleration and pipe water level another approach is based on darcy s law eq 2 later studies stressed the importance of a colmation layer in particular the effect of hydraulic properties of the colmation layer on simulating the sewer exfiltration desilva et al 2005 boukhemacha et al 2015 eq 3 eq 4 all above stated calculations are based on the assumption of a stationary exfiltration flow but in practice this condition applies only under constant pipe and soil conditions han 1997 karpf et al 2011 boukhemacha et al 2015 in practice sewer exfiltration into a variably saturated soil is a non linear process for example exfiltration rates using the linear darcy approach tend to be overestimated under wet weather conditions when significant proportions of sewer pipes are pressurized and soil resistance increases with increasing volume of wastewater flow rushton and tomlinson 1979 rutsch et al 2008 similar to the pipe aquifer interaction of sewer exfiltration developing an equation of non linear exfiltration from sewers into an aquifer requires information of both water level and streambed properties eq 5 corresponding to this approach karpf and krebs 2004 propose a sewer exfiltration model which bases on a model for surface water leaking into groundwater han 1997 eq 6 eq 7 4 1 2 leakage factor rauch and stegner 1994 introduced the generic leakage factor k l eq 8 this factor incorporates the two parameters hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the colmation layer which are difficult to determine and often unknown in practice peche 2019 introducing such a lumped leakage factor as a single colmation layer parameter helps to simplify the calibration of sewer exfiltration models eq 10 is a more detailed version of the sewer leakage equation proposed by ellis et al 2009 in order to incorporate interactions and combined effects of the colmation layer the soil layer and the transition zones on exfiltration rates direct calibration of the exfiltration factor k l and its components are often not possible and are alternatively proposed to achieve by experimental analysis karpf and krebs 2011 this method applies the eq 11 and requires data on a dynamic i e colmation layer clogging and break up processes and a structural non dynamic component i e exfiltration area and soil properties 4 1 3 leakage function peche et al 2017 introduced a nonlinear leakage function that relates the nonlinear dependency of sewer exfiltration to pipe water level and water pressure below the colmation layer that relationship can be represented by a 4th order polynomial equation table 3 coefficients in peche et al 2017 were determined using a coupled numerical pipe flow unsaturated flow model for this leakage function soil water pressure and pipe water level act as input variables and specific sewer exfiltration flux via the colmation layer as the output variable this method enables coupling pipe flow and unsaturated zone flow both flow regimes may be calculated with numerical models the leakage function represents an upscaling method because it enables to omit otherwise very fine spatial discretization of the colmation layer 4 2 sewer exfiltration models sewer exfiltration models can broadly be grouped into data driven or process based categories based on model applications table 4 in general none of the available model approaches provides a single solution to the major issues in sewer exfiltration from site specific to large scales and all models are study dependent because of the inherent complexity of pipe sewer exfiltration processes the difference in pipe network conditions and data availability within the study context xu et al 2014a 4 2 1 data driven models data driven models or statistical models employ data driven techniques to reveal the relationships between explanatory variables and the leakage patterns of defective pipes at specific locations the method generalizes a predictive model with a certain degree of confidence liu et al 2010 harvey and mcbean 2014 such modelling approaches are most applicable to asset management and risk planning and modelling the in situ issues of sewer pipe damages in small catchments e g mashford et al 2011 younis and knight 2010 defective sewer inspections most commonly with cctv techniques resulted in an extensive database that is often abstracted at different levels to enable various analyses of the exfiltration pattern and failure rates of the whole sewer network e g le gat 2006 mashford et al 2011 for example davies et al 2001 extracted 12 000 records of cctv data and other explanatory variables for a 634 km long sewer system to develop a statistical model for predicting sewer failure probability younis and knight 2010 used extensive inspection data to develop a generalized linear regression model to predict the probability of aged pipe deterioration in ontario their results suggested that the deterioration of vitrified clay vc pipes is age independent while the service life for reinforced concrete rc pipes is approximately 75 years outputs of sewer exfiltration models are often considered to directly correspond with sewer damages and this principle is applied for the development of various sewer deterioration models e g baur and herz 2002 harvey and mcbean 2014 one common technique is the cohort survival model which was selected as the primary tool to predict the structural condition of sewer pipes at the network level in various regions for instance in norway rostum et al 1999 germany baur and herz 2002 or canada duchesne et al 2012 le gat 2006 and le gat 2008 applied the non homogenous markov chains nhmc model to develop the time dependent probability function to predict sewer deterioration conditions to support short term repair and long term maintenance planning of sewer networks another example is the gompitz model which can predict pipe defective states even when sewers are subjected to very sparse inspections caradot et al 2017 the method was successfully applied in many other countries such as in canada harvey and mcbean 2014 norway rokstad and ugarelli 2015 germany caradot et al 2017 and austria fuchs hanusch et al 2015 artificial intelligence based and machine learning techniques present other alternative methods particularly in cases where the inherent uncertainties of inspection datasets constrain the use of statistical models e g khan et al 2010 mashford et al 2011 artificial neural networks ann were successfully used by najafi et al 2005 and khan et al 2010 to investigate the impact of explanatory parameters on the prediction of the sewer pipe condition based on limited input data applications of machine learning models such as the support vector machine svm helped to overcome the constraints of the sparseness of sewer exfiltration data when predicting the condition of individual sewer pipes in australia colombia and germany mashford et al 2011 hernández et al 2018 the neural network machine learning model in the study by yin et al 2020 also predicted well the deterioration state of individual sewer pipes the gained knowledge from this model can ultimately be generalized with a certain degree of confidence to non inspected pipes to better define rehabilitation planning caradot et al 2017 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 in another study by laakso et al 2018 the machine learning approach identified pipes in critical conditions and revealed key predictor factors which affected the poor pipe conditions in general machine learning models show an advantage over other statistical approaches in revealing the pipe scale sewers in the critical condition e g caradot et al 2018 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 4 2 2 physically based models unlike data driven models physically based models are based on physical process principles and aim to describe the relationships among explanatory parameters relevant to the simulated process zoppou 2001 a dependency among explanatory variables that drive sewer exfiltration processes are often assumed or formulated and dependent variables are incorporated into equations of transport of sewage fluids from defect sources into aquifers yang et al 1999 karpf et al 2011 boukhemacha et al 2015 in general physically based models serve as a useful tool for defining areas vulnerable to groundwater contamination and predicting sewer exfiltration scenarios with a certain degree of spatial and temporal representation mohrlok et al 2008 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 groundwater and water balance models are commonly used in sewer exfiltration studies to estimate the exfiltration rates particularly in areas lacking site specific information on defect conditions and inspections karpf and krebs 2005 xu et al 2014b a reliable representation of areas susceptible to sewer exfiltration pollution typically requires an accurate determination of water balance elements in urban groundwater models boukhemacha et al 2015 lee et al 2015 gogu et al 2017 the core water balance specific inputs include precipitation evaporation interception infiltration and percolation transpiration and root water uptake surface water flow miscellaneous sink source terms e g leaking water mains groundwater infiltration into a leaky pipe network water consumption at households or collected treated wastewater for example nakayama et al 2007 combined data from 730 urban catchments with sewer pipes and data on precipitation to estimate the average leakage of sewer fluids into aquifers in tokyo japan the calculation of sewer exfiltration based on the water balance was used in a case study by xu et al 2014b to represent the shanghai s drainage system china but with the main focus on dry weather flow conditions the simulated groundwater flow is calibrated with data from groundwater monitoring to reduce model complexity of groundwater models some studies focusing on entire pipe networks often consider certain water balance elements including precipitation evaporation interception transpiration root water uptake and surface water flow as lumped into groundwater recharge which is assigned to a neumann type boundary condition at the groundwater model top boundary e g peche et al 2019 rodriguez et al 2020 such a reduction in model complexity enables to omit the calculation of surface water flow and its coupling to the groundwater flow regime rodriguez et al 2020 it is crucial to include elements of the urban water balance into such a lumped groundwater recharge because a mere consideration of water balance elements would truncate the urban water balance when modelling leakage from a specific pipe network all other pipe networks providing exchange fluxes to and from groundwater such as sewer network stormwater network water mains and drain tiles and their respective temporal variations from daily to seasonal flow patterns have to be considered as inputs of the urban water balance other inputs are irrigation and dewatering of construction sites the incorporation of surface coverage elements in the model is particularly important in areas of low pervious or impervious surface cover in which the local groundwater recharge may not be precipitation driven at all mitchell et al 2003 kenway et al 2011 sewer pipe models are developed to supplement the rough estimation of water balance and groundwater models to further advance the model knowledge and to increase the accuracy in predicting sewer exfiltration effects on the environment when incorporating specified exfiltration characteristics and patterns and wastewater flow equations in the model the first sewer exfiltration model at the pipe scale was proposed by desilva et al 2005 in which the flow equation of sewer exfiltration was adapted from the studies of rauch and stegner 1994 and vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 to quantify the daily pattern of sewer exfiltration at the city scale the sewer network exfiltration and infiltration model neimo was developed within the european funded project assessing and improving the sustainability of urban water resources and systems aiswurs and was applied in various countries in europe and australia to reveal the magnitude of sewer exfiltration in regions with different pipe and soil conditions desilva et al 2007 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 another example of a sewer exfiltration model was proposed by karpf and krebs 2011 in which the dynamic and structural components of the exfiltration process including clogging break up of the colmation layer and groundwater infiltration in the vicinity of sewer leaks were introduced in the hydrodynamic model setting karpf and krebs 2011 study showed the complexity of exfiltration hydraulics and identified important parameters and components of exfiltration models which can be managed on the basis of different data availabilities the results of karpf and krebs 2011 were adapted in the study by peche et al 2017 which further reveals the mechanism and parametrisation of sewer exfiltration for upscaled studies on the basis of coupled pipe flow and groundwater flow simulators approximation of sewage exfiltration by means of leakage flow functions which were derived from numerical simulations of pipe water levels and hydraulic pressures below the colmation layer proved to reasonably represent the spatial discretization of pipe defects at broader network scales with reduced computational times peche et al 2017 stimulated by increasing availability of observed sewer exfiltration data and the improvement of computational power model designs have expanded toward integrating multi dimensional coupled pipe soil groundwater models that represent better the spatial and temporal pattern of sewer exfiltration e g schulz et al 2005 mohrlok et al 2008 peche et al 2019 the calibration of integrated sewer exfiltration models is often based on water sampling and groundwater monitoring e g wolf et al 2012 boukhemacha et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 in the study by mohrlok et al 2008 the leakage from pipes is considered the point source which can generate the three dimensional flow and results from this study defined that the long term residence times of wastewater leakage in the soil medium were due to lateral flow spreading dvory et al 2018 used coupled 1d 3d unsaturated and saturated flow and transport models to evaluate the effects of a leakage event after a maintenance incidence they found out that sewer leakage was retained in the porous media of a karst fractured porous unsaturated zone and groundwater system and contributed a continuous supply of the micro contaminant carbamazepine to the groundwater and nearby creeks long after the incidence has stopped bhaskar et al 2015 used the coupled groundwater surface water land surface model parflow maxwell et al 2009 to quantify the long term impact of exfiltration on groundwater storage in baltimore usa and defined that sewer exfiltration is the second main driver causing the change in subsurface storage volume when compared to other factors peche et al 2017 calculated sewer exfiltration based on a hydro dynamic pipe water level and variably soils saturation subsurface flow approach and suggested that for groundwater levels far below leaky pipes sewer exfiltration rates are independent of groundwater and soil water pressure and merely depend on the water level in the sewer pipe peche 2019 this study also revealed that the characteristics of the aquifer strata and colmation layer which in this case were sand and sandy loam had significant effects on the breakthrough time of pipe leakage to the groundwater table in another case study by bhaskar et al 2015 the hydraulic connection between the sewer exfiltration to groundwater varied when passing through various unconfined and confined aquifers incorporating geological and hydrogeological models in the integrated model framework revealed that the exfiltration process from sewers depends strongly on the interaction between the conduit and the hydrogeological strata ly and chui 2012 boukhemacha et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 the study coupling the urban 3d geological and sewer system models in bucharest city romania showed that sewer conduits located completely in the aquitard strata were particularly susceptible to the exfiltration process in contrast conduits located partially or entirely in the aquifer might exhibit either infiltration or exfiltration gogu et al 2017 sewer conduits with a known hydraulic property of backfill material when crossing through different zones of the heterogeneous aquifer and aquitard strata showed very distinct patterns of hydraulic interaction with the hydrogeological matrix and consequently very different rates and loads of sewer leakage to groundwater lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 gogu et al 2017 the volume of artificial recharge from sewer leakage sources to groundwater varied in both space and time in the case study of barcelona city spain due to the complex nature of the aquifer strata tubau et al 2017 thus studies focusing on the effects of sewer exfiltration on groundwater need to properly consider the intersection between the sewer conduits and the aquifer strata by correctly reproducing the hydraulic processes and water balance of core domains of surface water pipe flow hydrogeology and groundwater strata 4 2 3 others these include other models or management tools that do not strictly belong to the two above mentioned categories such as visual mapping and gis operations such models are particularly used in areas with a deficiency of available data for the setup of sewer exfiltration models reconstructing spatial temporal patterns of sewer defect distributions in urban areas by using gis tools is considered a useful supplementary tool to analyze the risk and potential locations of sewer exfiltration to groundwater mohrlok et al 2008 roehrdanz et al 2017 ducci 2018 selvakumar et al 2004 developed a map on the depth to groundwater basing on sewer network and groundwater level data in the usa hopkins and bain 2018 and vystavna et al 2018 applied a similar approach to map the spatial patterns of sewer networks and defined potential sewer leakage hotspots by conducting the proximity analysis between aging sewers and surface waterways ducci 2018 produced the potential nitrate contamination pnc map which incorporates the source of sewer leakage in urban sewage networks by overlaying various thematic maps and statistical data available at the national scale lee et al 2015 and roehrdanz et al 2017 used a logistic regression model and gis tool to predict the high likelihood areas of sewer exfiltration using leakage indicators is an alternative approach in regions where the sewer leakage data constrain the application of models for instance barrett et al 1997 proposed combining stable nitrogen isotopes and microbiological indicators as the most effective parameters for the quantification of groundwater recharge by sewer exfiltration their investigations provide evidence for the presence of sewage in shallow groundwater an approach using various wastewater indicators to analyse the process of sewer exfiltration to groundwater is also proposed in monitoring combined with modelling studies by wolf et al 2012 lee et al 2015 and roehrdanz et al 2017 5 challenges and research needs for sewer exfiltration modelling based on current literature it can be concluded that the primary focuses of sewer exfiltration studies including the identification of important variables affecting sewer exfiltration the behavior and interactions among sewer exfiltration parameters and the presence and types of effects on the environment are well addressed at the scales from single site to certain defined sewer lengths section 2 section 3 based on those grounds various approaches and models have been proposed in the literature to assist the prediction of deterioration status of sewer pipes and to define the critical areas affected by sewer exfiltration to the environment section 4 however effects of sewer exfiltration on the surrounding environment are often not limited to single sites where the leakages from pipe defects are inspected and modeled section 1 long term management decisions and rehabilitation planning often require a determination of the system deterioration and effects at the broader scales of whole sewer pipe networks or catchments e g wolf and hötztl 2007 heinrich 2007 roehrdanz et al 2017 peche 2019 applications of sewer exfiltration models at higher spatial and temporal resolutions are still constrained due to the lack of information and understanding on the role and interactions of key driving factors which are not directly derivable from small scale studies e g rutsch et al 2008 vystavna et al 2018 the following section focuses on the more recent literature addressing these knowledge gaps and defining research needs for future studies on sewer exfiltration modelling 5 1 model hydraulic processes of sewer exfiltration to estimate and adequately predict the effects to groundwater from the sewer exfiltration source studies on the hydraulic modelling aspects of sewer exfiltration need to cover two main areas which include 1 an improved understanding of core processes and interactions among key parameters of sewer exfiltration at the pipe scale and 2 a better understanding of the transport and transformation processes of sewer leakage into aquifer strata for the first aim advanced data driven techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence models proved to be efficient and reliable tools that can help an accurate prediction of pipe deterioration status and its key explanatory variables for a better exploration of sewer exfiltration processes at the pipe scale meanwhile coupling the physically based integrated surface water and sewer pipe models with urban infrastructure hydrogeological and groundwater models is essential to realistically simulate the effects of sewer leakage to groundwater examples from the literature showed diverse applications of data driven and physically based models that primarily targeted only one or another above mentioned aspect and simplified the representation of other aspects of the sewer exfiltration process e g rutsch et al 2008 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 an accurate prediction of sewer exfiltration impacts on groundwater at large scales requires a thorough consideration of both aspects by carefully integrating the model domains from the local conduit surface to the entire sewer network and city scales at the pipe scale an accurate hydraulic simulation of sewer exfiltration needs to consider the condition of the following dependencies initial soil type vertical distance to the groundwater table and pipe water level that may be used to estimate a hydraulic gradient through the colmation layer and the colmation layer condition karpf 2012 guo et al 2017 peche 2019 the initial soil type is often well known if pipes are embedded in well defined backfill material karpf 2012 the vertical distance to the groundwater table may be calculated using pipe network information in the form of pipe invert depth and groundwater maps selvakumar et al 2004 roehrdanz et al 2017 the pipe water level is highly variable and may be simplified by using the dry weather flow water level peche et al 2017 however data of the colmation layer parameters are not readily available and difficult to predict and have to be calibrated or determined using in situ physical experiments e g karpf et al 2009 sewer pipe models are often based on the simplification that hydraulic properties and the depth of the colmation layer are constant results from physical experiments justified the latter e g okubo and matsumoto 1983 rauch and stegner 1994 which shows that these attributes of the colmation layer converge to a constant value within a short time of pipe defect occurrence however this simplification leads to the significant uncertainty in the model outputs of long term predictions due to the negligence of colmation layer dynamics such as colmation layer breaking up effects driven by high pipe water pressure leading to short time large sewer exfiltration rates known as leakage pulses ellis et al 2009 karpf 2012 developing colmation layer forming models which allow predicting both the hydraulic properties and depth of the colmation layer and or filtration models coupled with biofilm growth models are potential important research areas which can help to better represent the processes of hydraulic flow transport to groundwater in integrated pipe subsurface groundwater models as the subject of future studies it is also important to incorporate leakage pulses into sewer exfiltration models in order to better address and to compare the effects of sewer exfiltration under the dry weather flow and stormwater flow conditions for both long term studies and studies focusing on event based impacts of sewer exfiltration at large spatial scales the challenge in modelling the hydraulic processes of sewer exfiltration is associated with the local geology characteristics geyer et al 2007 dvory et al 2018 caverns may form from sewer exfiltration bound percolation when sewer leakage occurs in dissoluble rock e g limestone hermosilla 2012 these caverns represent a substantial variability in local geology and this variability needs to be accounted for when modelling sewer exfiltration in other cases the exchange between conduits and the aquifer strata when sewer infiltrated via carbonate aquifers with preferential flow paths may significantly impact on the local groundwater e g dvory et al 2016 2018 in contrast the presence of areas with very small hydraulic conductivities e g clay lenses may lead to a soil bound sealing of pipe defects and modelling sewer exfiltration in such areas may not be necessary thus the local geology and geological strata characteristics should be well known when modelling the process of sewer exfiltration to groundwater a further challenge in modelling the sewer exfiltration hydraulic processes is caused by the complex nature of underground infrastructures and their interactions with the local hydrogeology which subsequently affect the potential distribution of sewer exfiltration to groundwater urban systems are often characterized by extensive networks of sewage pipes which intersect with other underground infrastructures and constructions e g stormwater canals and drains and various pervious and impervious hydrogeological strata these intersections contribute a significant source of disturbance to the local urban groundwater bhaskar et al 2015 attard et al 2016 studies also revealed that the problem of sewer exfiltration in urbanized regions is not limited to dry weather conditions as often referred in previous studies indeed a significant amount of rainwater and surface flow via pervious urban areas may infiltrate into conduits during storm events and contribute to an increased peak of sewer discharge to groundwater over a longer duration period depending on the local characteristics and conditions of pervious and impervious aquifers e g ly and chui 2012 boukhemacha et al 2015 tubau et al 2017 therefore it is crucial to judiciously analyse local hydrogeology and groundwater maps to accurately estimate the full sewage leakage process and to understand its migration mechanism into groundwater in regions where detailed urban groundwater maps are not available there is a need to apply alternative and more generic approaches e g using leakage factors and functions in order to gain the reasonably accurate estimation of sewer exfiltration to groundwater besides current sewer exfiltration models do not take into account the potential hydraulic disconnection of leaky pipes from groundwater i e the distance of groundwater and leaky sewer at which the disconnection occurs and no significant effect on groundwater is observed peche 2019 some studies with a focus on groundwater pollution suggested that the impact from sewer exfiltration sources was mostly remarkable and relevant near the vicinity of defective pipe areas e g reynolds and barrett 2003 rutsch et al 2008 bhaskar et al 2015 such a hydraulic disconnection is well known for river groundwater interactions e g sophocleous 2002 brunner et al 2009 meanwhile the concept was first described for sewer groundwater interactions in peche et al 2017 however to which spatial boundary i e depth to groundwater this effect should be considered in sewer exfiltration modelling is still largely unknown and should be subject to future research lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 a better obtained knowledge of sewer pipe hydraulic disconnection has the potential for model simplification since solving the nonlinear and computationally costly richards 1931 equation is not necessary for a disconnected leaky pipe 5 2 model wastewater compositions from sewer exfiltration sewer exfiltration is characterized by a diverse composition of substances from industrial commercial and residential sources such as heavy metals surfactants or organic compounds reynolds and barrett 2003 karamouz et al 2011 lee et al 2015 these substances differ in their characteristics and behavior including e g degradation solubility adsorption affinity in the pipe and in groundwater and as such might not be compatible to model in a similar way as pollutant indicators in surface water or groundwater models however very few studies have been focused on modelling of wastewater contaminants in sewer exfiltration e g roehrdanz et al 2017 dvory et al 2018 thus the behavior and effects of most contaminants from sewer exfiltration on the urban environment in the literature remain largely unknown particular on large scales though it is acknowledged that the significant pressure on groundwater from sewer exfiltration is caused by pollutant loads rather than volume of sewer exfiltration discharge e g wolf et al 2012 roehrdanz et al 2017 some studies incorporated sewage solute transport module with coupled sewer flow variably saturated flow and groundwater flow models but the model results are interpretable only within the context of the local small scale regions and limited observation data available for model calibration mohrlok et al 2008 ly and chui 2012 thorndahl et al 2016 in fact the physico chemical compositions of the wastewater largely depend on land use within the urban area and thus often requires intensive sampling and analysis with a focus on total filterable solids components leading to chemical precipitation and bacteria leading to biofilm growth wolf et al 2012 lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 thus the knowledge gained and behavior patterns of these contaminants are not readily available to enable a generalization for larger scale modelling studies than the understanding of hydraulic sewer flow models e g peche et al 2017 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 in other studies wastewater pollutants from sewer exfiltration are roughly represented as fixed concentration amounts or indirectly estimated from population dynamics and other indicators e g vystavna et al 2018 however no uncertainty quantifications in such approaches have been reported so far in the literature for pipe and catchment scale models it is also critically important to correctly characterize the local condition of geological strata and to incorporate the physico chemical adsorption and interactions of wastewater constituents with the soil medium to better understand the transport and transformation of key wastewater leakage compositions into groundwater sewer exfiltration adsorption at pipe soil interfaces is considered as a key factor in the formation of a sedimentary media at the pipe soil surface which is known as a colmation layer and plays a critical role in defining the ultimate quantity and quality of exfiltration to the environment vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 ellis et al 2009 karpf 2012 the porous matrix of an unsaturated saturated zone is extraordinarily heterogeneous vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 ellis et al 2009 this often leads to the assumption of homogeneity to characterize the medium for simplification in large scale studies however the hydraulic interaction between the sewer leakage flow and the hydrogeological matrix in the soil for the known hydraulic properties of the colmation layer might be completely different this clogging phenomenon between the sewer exfiltration flow and the aquifer system environment has to be properly quantified and represented in sewer exfiltration models including stabilization of gas bubbles transport of particles in soil pores attachment of toxic metal and algae or development of preferential flows in order to improve the understanding and reduce the uncertainty in evaluating the impacts of sewer exfiltration on the groundwater nickey et al 2015 besides an improved understanding of sewage solute transport and impacts on vulnerable groundwater sources can help to formulate a legal threshold on allowable limits of sewer leakage in urban wastewater systems 5 3 model calibration and uncertainty analyses in general sewer exfiltration models at large scales are not well established e g hopkins and bain 2018 ducci 2018 one main constrain is due to the fact that the development of large scale models based on site specific experiments or small scale models often requires careful realisation of model parameters i e the knowledge of several parameters with high spatial and temporal resolutions which in most cases are not available karpf 2012 peche 2019 for instance the calibration based on groundwater monitoring merely enables to estimate a hydraulic conductivity for fully saturated conditions thus it is important to use the results of laboratory experiments and field samples to determine the relative hydraulic conductivity function and retention curve parameters to support the correct simulation of flow under unsaturated conditions at the pipe and sewer network scales adapting the leakage factor approach has proven a reliable method which is increasingly used in various pipe to city scale studies to simulate the interaction between groundwater and sewer systems with a less data demand on complex sewer network and local strata conditions e g karpf and krebs 2011 boukhemacha et al 2015 peche et al 2017 for model calibration the following factors should be considered a reasonable discretization of the groundwater model into zones of different soil properties and aquifer characteristics and distinguishing sewers into certain segments which can act either as a drain for the aquifer or as an artificial recharge source to groundwater further consideration of an appropriate number of groundwater observations since the results of model calibration is often dependent on both the model structure and the number of available groundwater observations in the study area tubau et al 2017 suggested that urban recharge models incorporating sewer exfiltration can only be successfully validated when an accurate groundwater flow and transport model is available in the study area a successful calibration is also attributed to the model uncertainty which is an integral problem of all modelling practices and is caused by various sources such as input data model structure and parameterization as well as model simplifications and assumptions rutsch et al 2008 karpf et al 2009 thus the uncertainty of sewer exfiltration models should be addressed in tandem with model calibration to improve the accuracy of modelling outputs the first calibration model incorporating sewer exfiltration was reported in the study by yang et al 1999 though the main focus was on fitting the simulated flow with available observed groundwater data meanwhile applying a monte carlo approach by calculating 2000 randomly selected combinations of seven independent input parameters for the sewer network of the city of rastatt germany wolf et al 2006 and wolf and hötztl 2007 successfully defined the uncertainty ranges for each parameter and the validated exfiltration rate was reported with the confidence interval of 95 karpf 2012 also incorporated monte carlo on 5000 simulations of a sewer pipe network and defined that water level in the pipe and duration of the clogging process have a significant impact on the accuracy of the exfiltration predictions peche et al 2017 performed 60 repetitive simulations to develop a functional relationship between sewer exfiltration fluxes pipe water level and soil water pressure below the colmation layer such that uncertainties regarding the qualitative distribution of that relationship can be reduced significantly studies of lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 and dvory et al 2018 stand among few modelling studies incorporating important contaminants from sewer leakage however the calibration is constrained by the availability of short term groundwater observations in small scale regions and the lack of information on the background concentration of contaminants in the groundwater overall more studies combining monitoring and modelling of sewer exfiltration at pipe and city scales are needed to further verify the important parameters in sewer exfiltration models and their practical default ranges as well as to further test the uncertainty approaches in predicting sewer exfiltration impacts of large scale models 5 4 upscaling and generalization of sewer exfiltration some efforts have been conducted to develop approaches to allow upscaling the results of models from single defect points or pipe lengths to catchment scales in order to provide information for decision support and rehabilitation implementation of urban wastewater systems first efforts towards upscaling observed exfiltration rates aim at representing sewer exfiltration on the whole sewer network scale dohmann et al 1999 quantified exfiltration rates at field scale and upscaled their results based on the statistical information on the structural condition of the sewer system cctv based inspection data have been extrapolated to the city district scale in a study by wolf and hötztl 2007 however results upscaled from field studies tend to overestimate the exfiltration at the sewer network scale since the results are derived from observed pipes with significant damages and defects rutsch et al 2008 possible solutions for large scale modelling of sewer exfiltration target to closer implement the characteristics and behavior of defective sewer networks few studies have been conducted in this direction but the cases are still limited for instance karpf et al 2009 defined a fixed value of colmation properties under stable conditions and proposed the application of a standardized sewer leakage area to ease the use of a pipe to catchment scale modelling this approach was further developed in the study by peche et al 2017 in which an upscaling of leakage using transfer functions was derived from numerical simulations this functional relationship represents sewer exfiltration flux through the colmation layer enables to omit the spatial discretization of colmation layers in numerical models and significantly reduces computation times along with the generalization of general patterns of key parameters and processes of sewer exfiltration integrating various modelling techniques with advanced gis and planning tools to extract available large scale data such as detailed maps of sewer networks urban infrastructure urban groundwater levels and data on structural and operational states of sewer conduits is also a common but effective approach these approaches are increasingly being used to supplement the data shortage from sewer observations required for large scale studies of sewer exfiltration impacts on the environment e g lee et al 2015 ducci 2018 hopkins and bain 2018 the ideal approach to accurately allocate urban areas susceptible to sewer exfiltration contamination and groundwater pollution is to carefully upscale the integrated surface water pipe hydrogeology groundwater model from site specific location to the pipe network and entire city scales in order to accurately simulate the key water balance components however such intensive data requirement of both sewer network and groundwater observations is often unavailable and cannot be satisfied in most urban systems worldwide a potential solution to this common issue might be to perform the multi component and multi scale analyses such analysis requires a full calibrated model at the large city scale that is re calibrated under various simplification settings e g reduced parameters and processes incorporated in the model and separately for smaller regions within the city where distinctions in the sewer infrastructure and hydrogeological conditions are known applying a calibrated large scale model on different scenarios i e including and excluding key model parameters and processes is another research direction which may help to define the driving factors for sewer exfiltration modelling e g bhaskar et al 2015 peche 2019 analyzing and comparing the results of different model framework simplifications and scenarios with the results of the original full city scale model may help to better evaluate the accuracy of various development settings and calibration schemes of sewer exfiltration models as well as to define parameters and processes that may be generalized or have negligible effects on groundwater addressing these issues can help to develop more case studies of large scale urban models incorporating sewer exfiltration processes particularly in regions with a significant data scarce issue 5 5 modelling of sewer exfiltration from private household sources while inspection and rehabilitation of public sewer systems are managed and regulated information on house connection sewers is often limited as it locates in private properties ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 as a result data of sewer exfiltration from private sewer networks as well as privately conducted monitoring and rehabilitation data are in most cases not available to third parties and for exfiltration modelling studies exfiltration from defective sewers of private sewer systems is often indirectly estimated from population statistics e g ducci 2018 vystana et al 2019 or using a population based risk probability matrix e g ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 kaddoura and zayed 2018 results of a few available studies indicate high variability in damage rates of private sewers and hardly monitored exfiltration rates e g kaddoura and zayed 2018 vystana et al 2019 nguyen and venohr 2021 this lack of knowledge leads to the question on whether sewer exfiltration remains underestimated in urban catchments if restricted to public sewers nguyen and venohr 2021 it is recognized that modelling exfiltration from private sewers may contain high uncertainties due to the considerable lack of appropriate data the topic of sewer exfiltration from private house connections represents a research gap that needs to be addressed thoroughly as an integral part of the overall sewer leakage problems in urban areas 6 conclusions sewer exfiltration models proved to be effective and important tools for decision making and rehabilitation planning of urban wastewater environment the following main findings can be drawn from the literature review on sewer exfiltration modelling sewer exfiltration involves various malfunction reasons caused by pipe defects ageing bound failure of structural integrity remains the primary factor causing sewer leakage incidences in sewer systems worldwide with the pressure from rapid urbanisation and climate change the topic of sewer exfiltration modelling has undergone a significant expansion in various directions which can be broadly grouped into statistical physically based and other approaches initial models focus on identifying important variables affecting sewer exfiltration the probability of sewer failures and potential impacts of sewer exfiltration on groundwater in small case studies more modern tools aim to represente the real time spatial pattern of sewer exfiltration and to improve predictions of the failure of large sewer systems for better rehabilitation and inspection plans the general on going trend of sewer exfiltration models are in favor of more integrated approaches i e combining the strength of diverse modelling techniques upscaling tools together with more data from real sewer experiments developed at various spatial temporal and geographical boundaries for a better definition of model parameters and representation of key processes as well as for confirming the validity of current approaches and advancing methods for model calibration and uncertainty analyses modelling of sewer exfiltration processes and linking this emission to groundwater impacts at city or larger scales yet show considerable short comings here lacking details on sewer conditions including age damage but also depth in the ground together with a coupled sewer pipe groundwater modelling are the two major limiting factors for future research a more systematic approach with more model components and tools is recommended when modelling the water losses from defective sewers into groundwater environment at the pipe scale advanced machine learning and data driven techniques could be used to find more accurately the deterioration state of the entire sewer network at this scale models incorporating hydraulic interactions between pipe and groundwater often assume constant damage rates or use simplified leakage equations based on single pipe properties e g pipe length pipe diameter or pipe age machine learning models could also allow an improved understanding of key driving factors affecting the sewer leakage to groundwater as the importance of these factors in sewer leakage models at the scale of the whole sewer network might vary from those defined in small scale studies at major leakages among major parameters affecting the modelling of hydraulic and solute contaminants from sewer exfiltration colmation layer properties and hydraulic potential gradient between pipe and aquifer strata are of critical importance inquiring further research while the hydraulic potential distribution in time and space may be calculated with numerical models on the basis of a well known initial condition a major challenge is the accurate prediction of the extent and hydraulic properties of the colmation layer in present times no reliable model for the prediction of these properties exist and colmation layer properties have to be determined with probing or physical experiments complete physically based integrated surface water pipe and urban infrastructure hydrogeological and groundwater model framework based on an accurate determination of core water balance components is essential to analyse the effects of sewer exfiltration on groundwater quantitatively rather than only qualitatively a more thorough model calibration incorporating the uncertainty analyses is another integral part of future sewer exfiltration models at large scales as groundwater monitoring is still often patchy the consideration of additional contaminates and more in depth analyses of source degradation and transport pathways is required for different types of sewers in most studies private sewer networks and household connections are missing and should be considered upscaling and generalization of calibrated model results from the conduit to city

4709,increasing evidence from studies in urban wastewater systems proves that sewer exfiltration may present a profound threat for rising levels of toxic substances and microbial pollution in groundwater new and innovative methods for monitoring sewage exfiltration are continuously developed which provide a solicit ground for a better understanding of key processes and influencing characteristics of sewer exfiltration to support the development of mathematical equations and models worldwide however modelling of sewer exfiltration and its associated impacts on groundwater are still constrained and not fully understood in large urban systems this paper reviews the knowledge advancements and challenges of sewer exfiltration modelling based on the present review we define five key research domains for developing more generic framework of large scale models these domains inquire to advance the representation of hydraulic modelling e g testing exfiltration models coupled with biofilm growth models modelling of solutes originating from sewer leakages e g heavy metals define the practical values of key model parameters of main model components and sub processes for

exfiltration rate leakage factor standard leakage area colmation layer private sewers 1 introduction sewer exfiltration is the process of wastewater losses from a defective sewer system to the environment rutsch et al 2008 sewer exfiltration is often associated with soil undermining and bedrock dissolution which may lead to sinkhole development urban infrastructure damages and further expansions of exfiltration areas selvakumar et al 2004 hermosilla 2012 harvey and mcbean 2014 an increasing number of investigations provide solicited evidence that sewer exfiltration can be the source of significant pollutions to groundwater e g reynolds and barrett 2003 lee et al 2015 grimmeisen et al 2017 thus reliable quantification of sewer exfiltration plays an important role in supporting sewer network rehabilitation and management decision of urban areas vulnerable to sewer exfiltration contamination ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 karpf 2012 dvory et al 2018 traditionally sewer exfiltration is measured using various monitoring approaches which serve as foundation for the classification of sewer defects and exfiltration chisala and lerner 2008 harvey and mcbean 2014 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 closed circuit television cctv is so far the most common method to evaluate the structural integrity and defects of sewers and has been used in major cities worldwide amick and burgess 2000 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 techniques using sewer tracers and wastewater indicators e g sodium chloride fluorescent dyes are increasingly applied since these methods can distinguish substances from sewer exfiltration with pollutants from other sources entering groundwater e g ellis and revitt 2001 fenz et al 2005 rieckermann et al 2007 2010 lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 stegeman et al 2019 other techniques for in situ measurements of sewer exfiltration include distributed temperature sensing dts e g nienhuis et al 2013 electric resistivity tomography ert e g thompson et al 2012 ground penetrating radar grp hao et al 2012 using robots for pipe inspections e g kirkham et al 2000 impact echo method e g kang et al 2017 or ring laser scanning e g clemens et al 2015 although a variety of instruments are available to monitor and detect leaks they are often labor intensive and expensive to apply on the whole sewer network thus can hardly represent large spatial pattern or be applied at higher frequencies blackwood et al 2005 2006 wolf and hötztl 2007 additional to field observation techniques there is a need to develop modeling tools to quantify emissions from sewer exfiltration source to groundwater and to predict the structural state of sewers for management decisions of urban wastewater systems yang et al 1999 karpf et al 2009 roehrdanz et al 2017 sewer exfiltration models have been developed to help identify target areas with the highest leakage rate potentials at various temporal and spatial scales yang et al 1999 karpf et al 2009 peche et al 2017 the general principles and approaches for sewer exfiltration models emerged more than a decade ago rutsch et al 2008 karpf et al 2009 peche et al 2017 however model development progress is still slow which is indicated by a limited number of published studies on sewer exfiltration models when compared to models for other environmental applications e g zoppou 2001 fu et al 2019 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 integrated 1d 3d models were developed to simulate sewer exfiltration dynamics but are hard to validate due to the large number of data required for model parametrization rutsch et al 2008 peche et al 2017 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 karpf 2012 and peche 2019 proposed simplified approaches for modeling sewer exfiltration but the methods have been tested only to site specific and pipe scales wolf et al 2012 considered the temporal and spatial variation of sewer exfiltration to groundwater by conducting sampling for the period from 2002 to 2008 in the city of rastatt however no significant findings on lateral and horizontal fluxes of sewer exfiltration were achieved from the limited number of wastewater indicators lee et al 2015 and roehrdanz et al 2017 developed a spatial model of sewer exfiltration which allows predicting the occurrence of exfiltration in shallow groundwater and incorporates various wastewater indicators but the outputs of the model are subjected to the groundwater short term observations in a small region of a city besides the uncertainty of upscalling approaches in sewer exfiltration modelling remains significant issue due to a lack of understanding of core parameters and processes of sewer exfiltration wolf and hötztl 2007 karpf 2012 peche 2019 so far the studies by rutsch et al 2005 and rutsch et al 2008 remain the only reviews that incorporate modelling aspects of sewer exfiltration table 1 though many changes have occurred since then in this study we review and evaluate the current state of sewer exfiltration models with a particular focus on hydrological aspects of model developments and applications the ultimate aim is to review the up to date knowledge and understanding of the whole mechanism of wastewater exfiltration from defective sewers to groundwater and define critical research gaps to reduce uncertainty in decision making relating to outputs from sewer exfiltration models the term exfiltration and leakage are used interchangeably in this field though the latter term often includes both the infiltration of groundwater into sewer pipes and the exfiltration of sewage into the environment as well as diverse types of outflows through defective canals such as drinking water delivery karpf 2012 hatam et al 2019 in the scope of this review most of our discussions are targeted explicitly on the exfiltration from wastewater sewers due to its impacts on groundwater the overall scheme of the review is presented in fig 1 2 an overview of sewer exfiltration processes sewer exfiltration releases pollutants to the environment which may exceed emissions at background conditions and from other sources wolf et al 2012 lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 fig 2 untreated wastewater from sewer exfiltration has been observed to contain high levels of suspended solids organic pollutants and toxic substances usepa 1989 reynolds and barrett 2003 lee et al 2015 pathogenic microorganisms in sewer exfiltration may potentially impair the recreational values of surrounding surface waters cause risks to public health groundwater pollution and serious economic damages burston et al 1993 blackwood et al 2005 sercu et al 2011 karamouz et al 2011 harvey and mcbean 2014 however emissions to the environment from urban sewer leakage often perceive less attention than those from agricultural areas and are even neglected in studies of urban system emissions particularly at large scale studies e g eiswirth and hötzl 1997 burn et al 2007 peche et al 2017 sewer exfiltration can be seen as a conditional process davies et al 2001 rutsch 2006 karpf 2012 the first condition is the existence of a defect in the sewer either due to aging and deterioration of materials poor construction of sewer pipes physical stress e g due to surface loads or plant root intrusion or the effect from the surrounding soil bedding e g desilva et al 2005 chisala and lerner 2008 another prerequisite condition for the occurrence of sewer exfiltration processes is the partly or completely location of defective pipes above the groundwater level ellis et al 2009 boukhemacha et al 2015 finally the hydraulic potential in the sewer pipe has to be higher than the hydraulic potential in the surrounding soil such that gravity induced leakage flow can occur peche et al 2017 2019 the difference in hydraulic heads in the sewer and groundwater governs the direction and the rate of sewer leakage selvakumar et al 2004 roehrdanz et al 2017 the process of sewer exfiltration from damaged pipes into urban groundwater does not remain constant over time ellis et al 2009 boukhemacha et al 2015 peche et al 2017 at first the exfiltration rate is low when the soil environment is dry i e the hydraulic potential of the soil is small the exfiltration rate into the soil increases with increasing soil moisture corresponding to increasing relative permeability at large hydraulic gradients between the pipe and the soil in the pipe vicinity and soil moisture increased sewer exfiltration leads to downwards propagation of a wetting front and sewer outflow may recharge groundwater sewer exfiltration is governed by the presence of a colmation layer forming in the pipe defect vicinity karpf 2012 peche 2019 after the occurrence of a pipe defect high sewer exfiltration rates continue until an equilibrium pressure height between in sewer and soil conditions is reached these high rates often remain over some hours or days largely depending on soil properties such as initial soil moisture and soil hydraulic properties before gradually decreasing karpf and krebs 2004 boukhemacha et al 2015 the reduction in exfiltration rates is due to the stabilization of the colmation layer which causes a change of hydraulic properties in the form of a reduction of porosity and intrinsic permeability of the soil in the pipe vicinity this reduction continues until a mature colmation layer is developed ellis et al 2009 boukhemacha et al 2015 a kinematic wave pulse i e a breakthrough can be initiated by diurnal peak flows or during storm events klinger et al 2007 this is due to a temporary local increase in flow velocity turbulence shear stress changing hydraulic gradients and accompanied by instability of colmation layers leading to a breaking up of the colmation layer ellis et al 2009 as a result a steady state exfiltration condition is disturbed by a short term increase of exfiltration a few orders of magnitudes above the equilibrium of the dry weather flow wolf et al 2007 such wash out events followed by the establishment of steady state conditions have been observed persistently in various studies i e both in laboratory and field tests but the effects are local and only remain over a short time vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 wolf et al 2007 thus it is acknowledged that sewer defects are never completely blocked and are subject to certain degrees of exfiltration when evaluating over extended time periods reynolds and barrett 2003 ellis et al 2009 3 key influencing variables of sewer exfiltration processes stemming from literature influential primary factors that affect sewer exfiltration modelling include pipe characteristics and defective conditions wastewater level and composition in the pipe soil properties hydraulic potential as expressed by water pressure and soil moisture in the soil in the pipe vicinity and colmation layers davies et al 2001 ellis et al 2009 harvey and mcbean 2014 roehrdanz et al 2017 these driving factors and their associated attributes and or important derivatives are therefore reviewed in detail in the following section fig 3 to explore the progress in understanding the key parameters and their role in sewer exfiltration modelling 3 1 sewer pipe characteristics pipe characteristics and conditions are reported to significantly affect the sewer exfiltration rates among various locations in the sewer network dohmann 1995 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 lee et al 2015 major pipe characteristics reported in sewer exfiltration studies include age e g kettler and goulter 1985 diameter desilva et al 2005 length le gat and eisenbeis 2000 types of pipe junctions berardi et al 2008 and material e g harvey and mcbean 2014 aging sewer systems are the most primary cause of sewer exfiltration in soil and groundwater worldwide amick and burgess 2000 reynolds and barrett 2003 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 based on a literature review on the status of sewers and their potential exfiltration rate chisala and lerner 2008 concluded that exfiltration risks increase with the sewer system age and decrease in more modern and younger sewers the higher durability of newer pipe infrastructure is achieved by more inert and stable materials and connections reynolds and barrett 2003 gibson et al 2019 regarding the conditions of sewer pipes typical reasons causing sewer exfiltration include defects at lateral connections broken joints transversal and longitudinal cracks fractures and holes decker 1994 the rate of exfiltration also depends considerably on the defect types for instance vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 reported three times higher exfiltration rates for cracks than for open joints and holes i e 0 02 l d cm2 and 0 06 l d cm2 respectively 3 2 standard defect area many studies suggest that the exfiltration rate is positively correlated with the pipe defect area i e the exfiltration relevant damaged area e g davies et al 2001 howard 2007 meanwhile other studies conclude that this effect might be overestimated since large defects allow more sealing material in the sewage to reach the gravel and thus reduce the rate of sewer exfiltration e g blackwood et al 2006 thus the term standard defect area is often used to represent the status of defective sewers in sewer exfiltration models rutsch et al 2008 it is based on the assumption that similar pipe characteristics and defective conditions induce similar exfiltration rates franz and krebs 2005 karpf 2012 the term standard defect area also named as average defect area or representative elementary area refers to the mean defect size per unit pipe length given as the defect area per pipe length in m2 m in a given pipe network and represents the unique characteristics and defective condition of the entire pipe network within the study boundary in a study by rauch and stegner 1994 the rectangular hole 0 0015 m2 m was used as the standard leak size for all experiments wolf and hötztl 2007 suggested an average size of a defective sewer around 0 002 m2 m based on their literature review and considered the estimated average defect size in their particular case study 0 008 m2 m to be high because the study was focused on critical defects with large size similar to rauch and stegner 1994 karpf 2012 proposes the application of a standard quadratic size of a defective pipe in sewer exfiltration calculations and these values have been adopted successfully in sewer pipe models proposed by peche et al 2017 and peche et al 2019 3 3 colmation layer sewer exfiltration is known as a self sealing or self repairing process due to the effect of a colmation layer forming blackwood et al 2006 karpf et al 2011 a colmation layer is defined as a layer developed of solid inputs from wastewater biomass growth and chemical precipitation and is characterized by fast declining hydraulic conductivity compared to that in the surrounding underground rauch and stegner 1994 ellis et al 2009 meanwhile any overlying biofilm should be referred to as a bridging layer because the formation of this external layer is assumed to not affect the exfiltration rate through a defect ellis et al 2009 karpf et al 2011 for modelling purposes colmation layers are often represented by the two constant properties colmation layer thickness and intrinsic permeability expressed as hydraulic conductivity for simplification accordingly the colmation layer is modelled as a thin layer with a thickness varying between 10 and 20 mm possessing a relatively low permeability vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 karpf et al 2009 peche et al 2017 hydraulic conductivity decreases with time until a constant value is reached this parameter is assumed to represent a mature and stabilized colmation layer up to the thickness of 50 mm the colmation layer is stabilized and hinders the process of exfiltration from defective pipes ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 3 4 soil matrix one of the main difficulties in estimating sewer exfiltration is associated with the complex physico chemical interactions between wastewater in the exfiltration and soil medium which involves the chemical composition in the soil e g ph sulfates chlorides soil moisture hydraulic conductivity porosity and aeration levels ellis et al 2003 nickpay et al 2015 studies at the laboratory to pipe scales indicate a wide range of removal of dissolved organic carbon doc and ammonium from 30 to 73 and from 0 to 99 respectively depending on soil particle size dissolved oxygen supply in the soil and the residence time of sewage flow in the unsaturated zone fuchs et al 2004 when exposed to acidic or sulfate bearing soil medium concrete pipes are more susceptible to corrosion than clay pipes davies et al 2001 jaganathan et al 2010 thus it is often suggested to interpret the effects of soil on sewer exfiltration in modelling studies in the context of the interaction and exchange of the soil matrix i e the matrix potential of the soil below the colmation layer and the colmation layer ellis et al 2009 karpf et al 2011 the soil matrix potential increases and hydraulic conductivity decreases with reduced water content in the soil together affecting the estimation of the hydraulic potential in the pipe karpf et al 2009 more details on this issue are described in the following section on hydraulic potential 3 5 hydraulic potentials in the pipe and in the soil in the pipe vicinity the process of sewer exfiltration depends on the hydraulic potential gradient between pipe water as expressed by wastewater level and water pressure in the soil in the pipe defect vicinity fig 3 the pipe water level may be represented in static mode by a constant water level or pressure head representing e g dry weather flow or calculated dynamically using pipe flow equations or models e g rauch and stegner 1994 karpf et al 2009 for dynamic pipe flow calculations the saint venant equations de saint venant 1871 are used in many studies e g karpf and krebs 2005 kidmose et al 2015 peche et al 2017 later studies include the effect of a colmation layer on the hydraulic potential in the sewer pipes and in the soil matrix surrounding the pipes the water pressure in the soil in the pipe defect vicinity is used for determining the hydraulic gradient i e the actual three dimensional water pressure distribution in the soil is reduced to one spatial dimension by assuming a water flow through the colmation layer to be one dimensional e g karpf 2012 peche et al 2017 this is achieved by defining the hydraulic potential in the soil as the potential directly below the colmation layer and enables to use a one dimensional form of darcy s law or richard s equation according to this the change of the hydraulic potential not only depends on the water level in the pipe and the thickness of the colmation layer but also on the soil matrix potential below the colmation layer including the local soil moisture as expressed by the relative permeability and soil properties as expressed by intrinsic permeability and retention curve parameters beal et al 2004 ellis et al 2009 most of the time the sewer exfiltration process rarely occurs under partially saturated soil conditions and is highly non linear however sewer exfiltration is often linearized by using a modified version of darcy s law in order to reduce computational complexities rutsch et al 2008 karpf 2012 only a few studies exist where the non linearity of the exfiltration process is considered e g kidmose et al 2015 peche et al 2017 3 6 exfiltration rate sewer exfiltration rate is the primary indicator addressed in sewer exfiltration studies to quantitatively estimate the losses from defective sewers numerous studies focusing on sewer exfiltration rates are reported in the literature including reviews by gruenfeld 2000 rutsch et al 2008 and ellis et al 2009 according to these studies a broad variability of values and units of reported exfiltration rates are recorded from field and laboratory investigations this variability depends on the measurement techniques the scale and focus of studies and the particular conditions at the study sites as such it is recommended to develop a standardization of the found quantification approaches for modelling applications rutsch et al 2008 peche et al 2017 corresponding to results from laboratory and field measurements modelling studies provided relatively consistent estimates of exfiltration rates though being tested at different spatial and temporal scales and using methods of different complexity table 2 collates reported values to derive generalized patterns and trends accordingly exfiltration rates are often expressed as the amount of exfiltration per standard area and per unit length of pipes i e l day cm2 or l s km respectively e g chisala and lerner 2008 karpf 2012 ellis et al 2009 pointed out that an over estimation of some reported data at the larger scale might be due to upscaling the results from physical experiments and monitoring concluding from different studies exfiltration rates between 1 0 10 2 and 0 2 l s km or even less in case of sewers carrying large sediment loads provide reasonable mean values for large scale approaches 4 development and applications of sewer exfiltration models together with a reliable estimation of sewer exfiltration at defective pipe sites complex biogeochemical processes need to be considered to model flow and matter transport into soil and groundwater karpf and krebs 2011 initial equations of sewer exfiltration were developed to quantify losses from sewer systems and to gain a better understanding of the effects of sewer exfiltration on groundwater e g yang et al 1999 ly and chui 2012 later studies integrated equations of sewer exfiltration into empirical and process based models to simulate the overall sewer leakage processes reynolds and barrett 2003 peche et al 2017 dvory et al 2018 this section reviews in detail the development and advancements of sewer exfiltration equations and models 4 1 estimation approaches of sewer exfiltration three main approaches for calculations of sewer exfiltration are defined in the literature sewer exfiltration rates leakage factor and leakage functions table 3 4 1 1 sewer exfiltration rates equations of sewer exfiltration are based on a combination of theoretical assumptions and laboratory or field investigations two general approaches are referred to in the review by rutsch et al 2008 one approach is based on the torricelli equation eq 1 calculating exfiltration rates as a function of the coefficient of outflow gravitational acceleration and pipe water level another approach is based on darcy s law eq 2 later studies stressed the importance of a colmation layer in particular the effect of hydraulic properties of the colmation layer on simulating the sewer exfiltration desilva et al 2005 boukhemacha et al 2015 eq 3 eq 4 all above stated calculations are based on the assumption of a stationary exfiltration flow but in practice this condition applies only under constant pipe and soil conditions han 1997 karpf et al 2011 boukhemacha et al 2015 in practice sewer exfiltration into a variably saturated soil is a non linear process for example exfiltration rates using the linear darcy approach tend to be overestimated under wet weather conditions when significant proportions of sewer pipes are pressurized and soil resistance increases with increasing volume of wastewater flow rushton and tomlinson 1979 rutsch et al 2008 similar to the pipe aquifer interaction of sewer exfiltration developing an equation of non linear exfiltration from sewers into an aquifer requires information of both water level and streambed properties eq 5 corresponding to this approach karpf and krebs 2004 propose a sewer exfiltration model which bases on a model for surface water leaking into groundwater han 1997 eq 6 eq 7 4 1 2 leakage factor rauch and stegner 1994 introduced the generic leakage factor k l eq 8 this factor incorporates the two parameters hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the colmation layer which are difficult to determine and often unknown in practice peche 2019 introducing such a lumped leakage factor as a single colmation layer parameter helps to simplify the calibration of sewer exfiltration models eq 10 is a more detailed version of the sewer leakage equation proposed by ellis et al 2009 in order to incorporate interactions and combined effects of the colmation layer the soil layer and the transition zones on exfiltration rates direct calibration of the exfiltration factor k l and its components are often not possible and are alternatively proposed to achieve by experimental analysis karpf and krebs 2011 this method applies the eq 11 and requires data on a dynamic i e colmation layer clogging and break up processes and a structural non dynamic component i e exfiltration area and soil properties 4 1 3 leakage function peche et al 2017 introduced a nonlinear leakage function that relates the nonlinear dependency of sewer exfiltration to pipe water level and water pressure below the colmation layer that relationship can be represented by a 4th order polynomial equation table 3 coefficients in peche et al 2017 were determined using a coupled numerical pipe flow unsaturated flow model for this leakage function soil water pressure and pipe water level act as input variables and specific sewer exfiltration flux via the colmation layer as the output variable this method enables coupling pipe flow and unsaturated zone flow both flow regimes may be calculated with numerical models the leakage function represents an upscaling method because it enables to omit otherwise very fine spatial discretization of the colmation layer 4 2 sewer exfiltration models sewer exfiltration models can broadly be grouped into data driven or process based categories based on model applications table 4 in general none of the available model approaches provides a single solution to the major issues in sewer exfiltration from site specific to large scales and all models are study dependent because of the inherent complexity of pipe sewer exfiltration processes the difference in pipe network conditions and data availability within the study context xu et al 2014a 4 2 1 data driven models data driven models or statistical models employ data driven techniques to reveal the relationships between explanatory variables and the leakage patterns of defective pipes at specific locations the method generalizes a predictive model with a certain degree of confidence liu et al 2010 harvey and mcbean 2014 such modelling approaches are most applicable to asset management and risk planning and modelling the in situ issues of sewer pipe damages in small catchments e g mashford et al 2011 younis and knight 2010 defective sewer inspections most commonly with cctv techniques resulted in an extensive database that is often abstracted at different levels to enable various analyses of the exfiltration pattern and failure rates of the whole sewer network e g le gat 2006 mashford et al 2011 for example davies et al 2001 extracted 12 000 records of cctv data and other explanatory variables for a 634 km long sewer system to develop a statistical model for predicting sewer failure probability younis and knight 2010 used extensive inspection data to develop a generalized linear regression model to predict the probability of aged pipe deterioration in ontario their results suggested that the deterioration of vitrified clay vc pipes is age independent while the service life for reinforced concrete rc pipes is approximately 75 years outputs of sewer exfiltration models are often considered to directly correspond with sewer damages and this principle is applied for the development of various sewer deterioration models e g baur and herz 2002 harvey and mcbean 2014 one common technique is the cohort survival model which was selected as the primary tool to predict the structural condition of sewer pipes at the network level in various regions for instance in norway rostum et al 1999 germany baur and herz 2002 or canada duchesne et al 2012 le gat 2006 and le gat 2008 applied the non homogenous markov chains nhmc model to develop the time dependent probability function to predict sewer deterioration conditions to support short term repair and long term maintenance planning of sewer networks another example is the gompitz model which can predict pipe defective states even when sewers are subjected to very sparse inspections caradot et al 2017 the method was successfully applied in many other countries such as in canada harvey and mcbean 2014 norway rokstad and ugarelli 2015 germany caradot et al 2017 and austria fuchs hanusch et al 2015 artificial intelligence based and machine learning techniques present other alternative methods particularly in cases where the inherent uncertainties of inspection datasets constrain the use of statistical models e g khan et al 2010 mashford et al 2011 artificial neural networks ann were successfully used by najafi et al 2005 and khan et al 2010 to investigate the impact of explanatory parameters on the prediction of the sewer pipe condition based on limited input data applications of machine learning models such as the support vector machine svm helped to overcome the constraints of the sparseness of sewer exfiltration data when predicting the condition of individual sewer pipes in australia colombia and germany mashford et al 2011 hernández et al 2018 the neural network machine learning model in the study by yin et al 2020 also predicted well the deterioration state of individual sewer pipes the gained knowledge from this model can ultimately be generalized with a certain degree of confidence to non inspected pipes to better define rehabilitation planning caradot et al 2017 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 in another study by laakso et al 2018 the machine learning approach identified pipes in critical conditions and revealed key predictor factors which affected the poor pipe conditions in general machine learning models show an advantage over other statistical approaches in revealing the pipe scale sewers in the critical condition e g caradot et al 2018 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 4 2 2 physically based models unlike data driven models physically based models are based on physical process principles and aim to describe the relationships among explanatory parameters relevant to the simulated process zoppou 2001 a dependency among explanatory variables that drive sewer exfiltration processes are often assumed or formulated and dependent variables are incorporated into equations of transport of sewage fluids from defect sources into aquifers yang et al 1999 karpf et al 2011 boukhemacha et al 2015 in general physically based models serve as a useful tool for defining areas vulnerable to groundwater contamination and predicting sewer exfiltration scenarios with a certain degree of spatial and temporal representation mohrlok et al 2008 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 groundwater and water balance models are commonly used in sewer exfiltration studies to estimate the exfiltration rates particularly in areas lacking site specific information on defect conditions and inspections karpf and krebs 2005 xu et al 2014b a reliable representation of areas susceptible to sewer exfiltration pollution typically requires an accurate determination of water balance elements in urban groundwater models boukhemacha et al 2015 lee et al 2015 gogu et al 2017 the core water balance specific inputs include precipitation evaporation interception infiltration and percolation transpiration and root water uptake surface water flow miscellaneous sink source terms e g leaking water mains groundwater infiltration into a leaky pipe network water consumption at households or collected treated wastewater for example nakayama et al 2007 combined data from 730 urban catchments with sewer pipes and data on precipitation to estimate the average leakage of sewer fluids into aquifers in tokyo japan the calculation of sewer exfiltration based on the water balance was used in a case study by xu et al 2014b to represent the shanghai s drainage system china but with the main focus on dry weather flow conditions the simulated groundwater flow is calibrated with data from groundwater monitoring to reduce model complexity of groundwater models some studies focusing on entire pipe networks often consider certain water balance elements including precipitation evaporation interception transpiration root water uptake and surface water flow as lumped into groundwater recharge which is assigned to a neumann type boundary condition at the groundwater model top boundary e g peche et al 2019 rodriguez et al 2020 such a reduction in model complexity enables to omit the calculation of surface water flow and its coupling to the groundwater flow regime rodriguez et al 2020 it is crucial to include elements of the urban water balance into such a lumped groundwater recharge because a mere consideration of water balance elements would truncate the urban water balance when modelling leakage from a specific pipe network all other pipe networks providing exchange fluxes to and from groundwater such as sewer network stormwater network water mains and drain tiles and their respective temporal variations from daily to seasonal flow patterns have to be considered as inputs of the urban water balance other inputs are irrigation and dewatering of construction sites the incorporation of surface coverage elements in the model is particularly important in areas of low pervious or impervious surface cover in which the local groundwater recharge may not be precipitation driven at all mitchell et al 2003 kenway et al 2011 sewer pipe models are developed to supplement the rough estimation of water balance and groundwater models to further advance the model knowledge and to increase the accuracy in predicting sewer exfiltration effects on the environment when incorporating specified exfiltration characteristics and patterns and wastewater flow equations in the model the first sewer exfiltration model at the pipe scale was proposed by desilva et al 2005 in which the flow equation of sewer exfiltration was adapted from the studies of rauch and stegner 1994 and vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 to quantify the daily pattern of sewer exfiltration at the city scale the sewer network exfiltration and infiltration model neimo was developed within the european funded project assessing and improving the sustainability of urban water resources and systems aiswurs and was applied in various countries in europe and australia to reveal the magnitude of sewer exfiltration in regions with different pipe and soil conditions desilva et al 2007 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 another example of a sewer exfiltration model was proposed by karpf and krebs 2011 in which the dynamic and structural components of the exfiltration process including clogging break up of the colmation layer and groundwater infiltration in the vicinity of sewer leaks were introduced in the hydrodynamic model setting karpf and krebs 2011 study showed the complexity of exfiltration hydraulics and identified important parameters and components of exfiltration models which can be managed on the basis of different data availabilities the results of karpf and krebs 2011 were adapted in the study by peche et al 2017 which further reveals the mechanism and parametrisation of sewer exfiltration for upscaled studies on the basis of coupled pipe flow and groundwater flow simulators approximation of sewage exfiltration by means of leakage flow functions which were derived from numerical simulations of pipe water levels and hydraulic pressures below the colmation layer proved to reasonably represent the spatial discretization of pipe defects at broader network scales with reduced computational times peche et al 2017 stimulated by increasing availability of observed sewer exfiltration data and the improvement of computational power model designs have expanded toward integrating multi dimensional coupled pipe soil groundwater models that represent better the spatial and temporal pattern of sewer exfiltration e g schulz et al 2005 mohrlok et al 2008 peche et al 2019 the calibration of integrated sewer exfiltration models is often based on water sampling and groundwater monitoring e g wolf et al 2012 boukhemacha et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 in the study by mohrlok et al 2008 the leakage from pipes is considered the point source which can generate the three dimensional flow and results from this study defined that the long term residence times of wastewater leakage in the soil medium were due to lateral flow spreading dvory et al 2018 used coupled 1d 3d unsaturated and saturated flow and transport models to evaluate the effects of a leakage event after a maintenance incidence they found out that sewer leakage was retained in the porous media of a karst fractured porous unsaturated zone and groundwater system and contributed a continuous supply of the micro contaminant carbamazepine to the groundwater and nearby creeks long after the incidence has stopped bhaskar et al 2015 used the coupled groundwater surface water land surface model parflow maxwell et al 2009 to quantify the long term impact of exfiltration on groundwater storage in baltimore usa and defined that sewer exfiltration is the second main driver causing the change in subsurface storage volume when compared to other factors peche et al 2017 calculated sewer exfiltration based on a hydro dynamic pipe water level and variably soils saturation subsurface flow approach and suggested that for groundwater levels far below leaky pipes sewer exfiltration rates are independent of groundwater and soil water pressure and merely depend on the water level in the sewer pipe peche 2019 this study also revealed that the characteristics of the aquifer strata and colmation layer which in this case were sand and sandy loam had significant effects on the breakthrough time of pipe leakage to the groundwater table in another case study by bhaskar et al 2015 the hydraulic connection between the sewer exfiltration to groundwater varied when passing through various unconfined and confined aquifers incorporating geological and hydrogeological models in the integrated model framework revealed that the exfiltration process from sewers depends strongly on the interaction between the conduit and the hydrogeological strata ly and chui 2012 boukhemacha et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 the study coupling the urban 3d geological and sewer system models in bucharest city romania showed that sewer conduits located completely in the aquitard strata were particularly susceptible to the exfiltration process in contrast conduits located partially or entirely in the aquifer might exhibit either infiltration or exfiltration gogu et al 2017 sewer conduits with a known hydraulic property of backfill material when crossing through different zones of the heterogeneous aquifer and aquitard strata showed very distinct patterns of hydraulic interaction with the hydrogeological matrix and consequently very different rates and loads of sewer leakage to groundwater lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 gogu et al 2017 the volume of artificial recharge from sewer leakage sources to groundwater varied in both space and time in the case study of barcelona city spain due to the complex nature of the aquifer strata tubau et al 2017 thus studies focusing on the effects of sewer exfiltration on groundwater need to properly consider the intersection between the sewer conduits and the aquifer strata by correctly reproducing the hydraulic processes and water balance of core domains of surface water pipe flow hydrogeology and groundwater strata 4 2 3 others these include other models or management tools that do not strictly belong to the two above mentioned categories such as visual mapping and gis operations such models are particularly used in areas with a deficiency of available data for the setup of sewer exfiltration models reconstructing spatial temporal patterns of sewer defect distributions in urban areas by using gis tools is considered a useful supplementary tool to analyze the risk and potential locations of sewer exfiltration to groundwater mohrlok et al 2008 roehrdanz et al 2017 ducci 2018 selvakumar et al 2004 developed a map on the depth to groundwater basing on sewer network and groundwater level data in the usa hopkins and bain 2018 and vystavna et al 2018 applied a similar approach to map the spatial patterns of sewer networks and defined potential sewer leakage hotspots by conducting the proximity analysis between aging sewers and surface waterways ducci 2018 produced the potential nitrate contamination pnc map which incorporates the source of sewer leakage in urban sewage networks by overlaying various thematic maps and statistical data available at the national scale lee et al 2015 and roehrdanz et al 2017 used a logistic regression model and gis tool to predict the high likelihood areas of sewer exfiltration using leakage indicators is an alternative approach in regions where the sewer leakage data constrain the application of models for instance barrett et al 1997 proposed combining stable nitrogen isotopes and microbiological indicators as the most effective parameters for the quantification of groundwater recharge by sewer exfiltration their investigations provide evidence for the presence of sewage in shallow groundwater an approach using various wastewater indicators to analyse the process of sewer exfiltration to groundwater is also proposed in monitoring combined with modelling studies by wolf et al 2012 lee et al 2015 and roehrdanz et al 2017 5 challenges and research needs for sewer exfiltration modelling based on current literature it can be concluded that the primary focuses of sewer exfiltration studies including the identification of important variables affecting sewer exfiltration the behavior and interactions among sewer exfiltration parameters and the presence and types of effects on the environment are well addressed at the scales from single site to certain defined sewer lengths section 2 section 3 based on those grounds various approaches and models have been proposed in the literature to assist the prediction of deterioration status of sewer pipes and to define the critical areas affected by sewer exfiltration to the environment section 4 however effects of sewer exfiltration on the surrounding environment are often not limited to single sites where the leakages from pipe defects are inspected and modeled section 1 long term management decisions and rehabilitation planning often require a determination of the system deterioration and effects at the broader scales of whole sewer pipe networks or catchments e g wolf and hötztl 2007 heinrich 2007 roehrdanz et al 2017 peche 2019 applications of sewer exfiltration models at higher spatial and temporal resolutions are still constrained due to the lack of information and understanding on the role and interactions of key driving factors which are not directly derivable from small scale studies e g rutsch et al 2008 vystavna et al 2018 the following section focuses on the more recent literature addressing these knowledge gaps and defining research needs for future studies on sewer exfiltration modelling 5 1 model hydraulic processes of sewer exfiltration to estimate and adequately predict the effects to groundwater from the sewer exfiltration source studies on the hydraulic modelling aspects of sewer exfiltration need to cover two main areas which include 1 an improved understanding of core processes and interactions among key parameters of sewer exfiltration at the pipe scale and 2 a better understanding of the transport and transformation processes of sewer leakage into aquifer strata for the first aim advanced data driven techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence models proved to be efficient and reliable tools that can help an accurate prediction of pipe deterioration status and its key explanatory variables for a better exploration of sewer exfiltration processes at the pipe scale meanwhile coupling the physically based integrated surface water and sewer pipe models with urban infrastructure hydrogeological and groundwater models is essential to realistically simulate the effects of sewer leakage to groundwater examples from the literature showed diverse applications of data driven and physically based models that primarily targeted only one or another above mentioned aspect and simplified the representation of other aspects of the sewer exfiltration process e g rutsch et al 2008 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 an accurate prediction of sewer exfiltration impacts on groundwater at large scales requires a thorough consideration of both aspects by carefully integrating the model domains from the local conduit surface to the entire sewer network and city scales at the pipe scale an accurate hydraulic simulation of sewer exfiltration needs to consider the condition of the following dependencies initial soil type vertical distance to the groundwater table and pipe water level that may be used to estimate a hydraulic gradient through the colmation layer and the colmation layer condition karpf 2012 guo et al 2017 peche 2019 the initial soil type is often well known if pipes are embedded in well defined backfill material karpf 2012 the vertical distance to the groundwater table may be calculated using pipe network information in the form of pipe invert depth and groundwater maps selvakumar et al 2004 roehrdanz et al 2017 the pipe water level is highly variable and may be simplified by using the dry weather flow water level peche et al 2017 however data of the colmation layer parameters are not readily available and difficult to predict and have to be calibrated or determined using in situ physical experiments e g karpf et al 2009 sewer pipe models are often based on the simplification that hydraulic properties and the depth of the colmation layer are constant results from physical experiments justified the latter e g okubo and matsumoto 1983 rauch and stegner 1994 which shows that these attributes of the colmation layer converge to a constant value within a short time of pipe defect occurrence however this simplification leads to the significant uncertainty in the model outputs of long term predictions due to the negligence of colmation layer dynamics such as colmation layer breaking up effects driven by high pipe water pressure leading to short time large sewer exfiltration rates known as leakage pulses ellis et al 2009 karpf 2012 developing colmation layer forming models which allow predicting both the hydraulic properties and depth of the colmation layer and or filtration models coupled with biofilm growth models are potential important research areas which can help to better represent the processes of hydraulic flow transport to groundwater in integrated pipe subsurface groundwater models as the subject of future studies it is also important to incorporate leakage pulses into sewer exfiltration models in order to better address and to compare the effects of sewer exfiltration under the dry weather flow and stormwater flow conditions for both long term studies and studies focusing on event based impacts of sewer exfiltration at large spatial scales the challenge in modelling the hydraulic processes of sewer exfiltration is associated with the local geology characteristics geyer et al 2007 dvory et al 2018 caverns may form from sewer exfiltration bound percolation when sewer leakage occurs in dissoluble rock e g limestone hermosilla 2012 these caverns represent a substantial variability in local geology and this variability needs to be accounted for when modelling sewer exfiltration in other cases the exchange between conduits and the aquifer strata when sewer infiltrated via carbonate aquifers with preferential flow paths may significantly impact on the local groundwater e g dvory et al 2016 2018 in contrast the presence of areas with very small hydraulic conductivities e g clay lenses may lead to a soil bound sealing of pipe defects and modelling sewer exfiltration in such areas may not be necessary thus the local geology and geological strata characteristics should be well known when modelling the process of sewer exfiltration to groundwater a further challenge in modelling the sewer exfiltration hydraulic processes is caused by the complex nature of underground infrastructures and their interactions with the local hydrogeology which subsequently affect the potential distribution of sewer exfiltration to groundwater urban systems are often characterized by extensive networks of sewage pipes which intersect with other underground infrastructures and constructions e g stormwater canals and drains and various pervious and impervious hydrogeological strata these intersections contribute a significant source of disturbance to the local urban groundwater bhaskar et al 2015 attard et al 2016 studies also revealed that the problem of sewer exfiltration in urbanized regions is not limited to dry weather conditions as often referred in previous studies indeed a significant amount of rainwater and surface flow via pervious urban areas may infiltrate into conduits during storm events and contribute to an increased peak of sewer discharge to groundwater over a longer duration period depending on the local characteristics and conditions of pervious and impervious aquifers e g ly and chui 2012 boukhemacha et al 2015 tubau et al 2017 therefore it is crucial to judiciously analyse local hydrogeology and groundwater maps to accurately estimate the full sewage leakage process and to understand its migration mechanism into groundwater in regions where detailed urban groundwater maps are not available there is a need to apply alternative and more generic approaches e g using leakage factors and functions in order to gain the reasonably accurate estimation of sewer exfiltration to groundwater besides current sewer exfiltration models do not take into account the potential hydraulic disconnection of leaky pipes from groundwater i e the distance of groundwater and leaky sewer at which the disconnection occurs and no significant effect on groundwater is observed peche 2019 some studies with a focus on groundwater pollution suggested that the impact from sewer exfiltration sources was mostly remarkable and relevant near the vicinity of defective pipe areas e g reynolds and barrett 2003 rutsch et al 2008 bhaskar et al 2015 such a hydraulic disconnection is well known for river groundwater interactions e g sophocleous 2002 brunner et al 2009 meanwhile the concept was first described for sewer groundwater interactions in peche et al 2017 however to which spatial boundary i e depth to groundwater this effect should be considered in sewer exfiltration modelling is still largely unknown and should be subject to future research lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 a better obtained knowledge of sewer pipe hydraulic disconnection has the potential for model simplification since solving the nonlinear and computationally costly richards 1931 equation is not necessary for a disconnected leaky pipe 5 2 model wastewater compositions from sewer exfiltration sewer exfiltration is characterized by a diverse composition of substances from industrial commercial and residential sources such as heavy metals surfactants or organic compounds reynolds and barrett 2003 karamouz et al 2011 lee et al 2015 these substances differ in their characteristics and behavior including e g degradation solubility adsorption affinity in the pipe and in groundwater and as such might not be compatible to model in a similar way as pollutant indicators in surface water or groundwater models however very few studies have been focused on modelling of wastewater contaminants in sewer exfiltration e g roehrdanz et al 2017 dvory et al 2018 thus the behavior and effects of most contaminants from sewer exfiltration on the urban environment in the literature remain largely unknown particular on large scales though it is acknowledged that the significant pressure on groundwater from sewer exfiltration is caused by pollutant loads rather than volume of sewer exfiltration discharge e g wolf et al 2012 roehrdanz et al 2017 some studies incorporated sewage solute transport module with coupled sewer flow variably saturated flow and groundwater flow models but the model results are interpretable only within the context of the local small scale regions and limited observation data available for model calibration mohrlok et al 2008 ly and chui 2012 thorndahl et al 2016 in fact the physico chemical compositions of the wastewater largely depend on land use within the urban area and thus often requires intensive sampling and analysis with a focus on total filterable solids components leading to chemical precipitation and bacteria leading to biofilm growth wolf et al 2012 lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 thus the knowledge gained and behavior patterns of these contaminants are not readily available to enable a generalization for larger scale modelling studies than the understanding of hydraulic sewer flow models e g peche et al 2017 tscheikner gratl et al 2020 in other studies wastewater pollutants from sewer exfiltration are roughly represented as fixed concentration amounts or indirectly estimated from population dynamics and other indicators e g vystavna et al 2018 however no uncertainty quantifications in such approaches have been reported so far in the literature for pipe and catchment scale models it is also critically important to correctly characterize the local condition of geological strata and to incorporate the physico chemical adsorption and interactions of wastewater constituents with the soil medium to better understand the transport and transformation of key wastewater leakage compositions into groundwater sewer exfiltration adsorption at pipe soil interfaces is considered as a key factor in the formation of a sedimentary media at the pipe soil surface which is known as a colmation layer and plays a critical role in defining the ultimate quantity and quality of exfiltration to the environment vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 ellis et al 2009 karpf 2012 the porous matrix of an unsaturated saturated zone is extraordinarily heterogeneous vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2003 ellis et al 2009 this often leads to the assumption of homogeneity to characterize the medium for simplification in large scale studies however the hydraulic interaction between the sewer leakage flow and the hydrogeological matrix in the soil for the known hydraulic properties of the colmation layer might be completely different this clogging phenomenon between the sewer exfiltration flow and the aquifer system environment has to be properly quantified and represented in sewer exfiltration models including stabilization of gas bubbles transport of particles in soil pores attachment of toxic metal and algae or development of preferential flows in order to improve the understanding and reduce the uncertainty in evaluating the impacts of sewer exfiltration on the groundwater nickey et al 2015 besides an improved understanding of sewage solute transport and impacts on vulnerable groundwater sources can help to formulate a legal threshold on allowable limits of sewer leakage in urban wastewater systems 5 3 model calibration and uncertainty analyses in general sewer exfiltration models at large scales are not well established e g hopkins and bain 2018 ducci 2018 one main constrain is due to the fact that the development of large scale models based on site specific experiments or small scale models often requires careful realisation of model parameters i e the knowledge of several parameters with high spatial and temporal resolutions which in most cases are not available karpf 2012 peche 2019 for instance the calibration based on groundwater monitoring merely enables to estimate a hydraulic conductivity for fully saturated conditions thus it is important to use the results of laboratory experiments and field samples to determine the relative hydraulic conductivity function and retention curve parameters to support the correct simulation of flow under unsaturated conditions at the pipe and sewer network scales adapting the leakage factor approach has proven a reliable method which is increasingly used in various pipe to city scale studies to simulate the interaction between groundwater and sewer systems with a less data demand on complex sewer network and local strata conditions e g karpf and krebs 2011 boukhemacha et al 2015 peche et al 2017 for model calibration the following factors should be considered a reasonable discretization of the groundwater model into zones of different soil properties and aquifer characteristics and distinguishing sewers into certain segments which can act either as a drain for the aquifer or as an artificial recharge source to groundwater further consideration of an appropriate number of groundwater observations since the results of model calibration is often dependent on both the model structure and the number of available groundwater observations in the study area tubau et al 2017 suggested that urban recharge models incorporating sewer exfiltration can only be successfully validated when an accurate groundwater flow and transport model is available in the study area a successful calibration is also attributed to the model uncertainty which is an integral problem of all modelling practices and is caused by various sources such as input data model structure and parameterization as well as model simplifications and assumptions rutsch et al 2008 karpf et al 2009 thus the uncertainty of sewer exfiltration models should be addressed in tandem with model calibration to improve the accuracy of modelling outputs the first calibration model incorporating sewer exfiltration was reported in the study by yang et al 1999 though the main focus was on fitting the simulated flow with available observed groundwater data meanwhile applying a monte carlo approach by calculating 2000 randomly selected combinations of seven independent input parameters for the sewer network of the city of rastatt germany wolf et al 2006 and wolf and hötztl 2007 successfully defined the uncertainty ranges for each parameter and the validated exfiltration rate was reported with the confidence interval of 95 karpf 2012 also incorporated monte carlo on 5000 simulations of a sewer pipe network and defined that water level in the pipe and duration of the clogging process have a significant impact on the accuracy of the exfiltration predictions peche et al 2017 performed 60 repetitive simulations to develop a functional relationship between sewer exfiltration fluxes pipe water level and soil water pressure below the colmation layer such that uncertainties regarding the qualitative distribution of that relationship can be reduced significantly studies of lee et al 2015 roehrdanz et al 2017 and dvory et al 2018 stand among few modelling studies incorporating important contaminants from sewer leakage however the calibration is constrained by the availability of short term groundwater observations in small scale regions and the lack of information on the background concentration of contaminants in the groundwater overall more studies combining monitoring and modelling of sewer exfiltration at pipe and city scales are needed to further verify the important parameters in sewer exfiltration models and their practical default ranges as well as to further test the uncertainty approaches in predicting sewer exfiltration impacts of large scale models 5 4 upscaling and generalization of sewer exfiltration some efforts have been conducted to develop approaches to allow upscaling the results of models from single defect points or pipe lengths to catchment scales in order to provide information for decision support and rehabilitation implementation of urban wastewater systems first efforts towards upscaling observed exfiltration rates aim at representing sewer exfiltration on the whole sewer network scale dohmann et al 1999 quantified exfiltration rates at field scale and upscaled their results based on the statistical information on the structural condition of the sewer system cctv based inspection data have been extrapolated to the city district scale in a study by wolf and hötztl 2007 however results upscaled from field studies tend to overestimate the exfiltration at the sewer network scale since the results are derived from observed pipes with significant damages and defects rutsch et al 2008 possible solutions for large scale modelling of sewer exfiltration target to closer implement the characteristics and behavior of defective sewer networks few studies have been conducted in this direction but the cases are still limited for instance karpf et al 2009 defined a fixed value of colmation properties under stable conditions and proposed the application of a standardized sewer leakage area to ease the use of a pipe to catchment scale modelling this approach was further developed in the study by peche et al 2017 in which an upscaling of leakage using transfer functions was derived from numerical simulations this functional relationship represents sewer exfiltration flux through the colmation layer enables to omit the spatial discretization of colmation layers in numerical models and significantly reduces computation times along with the generalization of general patterns of key parameters and processes of sewer exfiltration integrating various modelling techniques with advanced gis and planning tools to extract available large scale data such as detailed maps of sewer networks urban infrastructure urban groundwater levels and data on structural and operational states of sewer conduits is also a common but effective approach these approaches are increasingly being used to supplement the data shortage from sewer observations required for large scale studies of sewer exfiltration impacts on the environment e g lee et al 2015 ducci 2018 hopkins and bain 2018 the ideal approach to accurately allocate urban areas susceptible to sewer exfiltration contamination and groundwater pollution is to carefully upscale the integrated surface water pipe hydrogeology groundwater model from site specific location to the pipe network and entire city scales in order to accurately simulate the key water balance components however such intensive data requirement of both sewer network and groundwater observations is often unavailable and cannot be satisfied in most urban systems worldwide a potential solution to this common issue might be to perform the multi component and multi scale analyses such analysis requires a full calibrated model at the large city scale that is re calibrated under various simplification settings e g reduced parameters and processes incorporated in the model and separately for smaller regions within the city where distinctions in the sewer infrastructure and hydrogeological conditions are known applying a calibrated large scale model on different scenarios i e including and excluding key model parameters and processes is another research direction which may help to define the driving factors for sewer exfiltration modelling e g bhaskar et al 2015 peche 2019 analyzing and comparing the results of different model framework simplifications and scenarios with the results of the original full city scale model may help to better evaluate the accuracy of various development settings and calibration schemes of sewer exfiltration models as well as to define parameters and processes that may be generalized or have negligible effects on groundwater addressing these issues can help to develop more case studies of large scale urban models incorporating sewer exfiltration processes particularly in regions with a significant data scarce issue 5 5 modelling of sewer exfiltration from private household sources while inspection and rehabilitation of public sewer systems are managed and regulated information on house connection sewers is often limited as it locates in private properties ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 as a result data of sewer exfiltration from private sewer networks as well as privately conducted monitoring and rehabilitation data are in most cases not available to third parties and for exfiltration modelling studies exfiltration from defective sewers of private sewer systems is often indirectly estimated from population statistics e g ducci 2018 vystana et al 2019 or using a population based risk probability matrix e g ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 kaddoura and zayed 2018 results of a few available studies indicate high variability in damage rates of private sewers and hardly monitored exfiltration rates e g kaddoura and zayed 2018 vystana et al 2019 nguyen and venohr 2021 this lack of knowledge leads to the question on whether sewer exfiltration remains underestimated in urban catchments if restricted to public sewers nguyen and venohr 2021 it is recognized that modelling exfiltration from private sewers may contain high uncertainties due to the considerable lack of appropriate data the topic of sewer exfiltration from private house connections represents a research gap that needs to be addressed thoroughly as an integral part of the overall sewer leakage problems in urban areas 6 conclusions sewer exfiltration models proved to be effective and important tools for decision making and rehabilitation planning of urban wastewater environment the following main findings can be drawn from the literature review on sewer exfiltration modelling sewer exfiltration involves various malfunction reasons caused by pipe defects ageing bound failure of structural integrity remains the primary factor causing sewer leakage incidences in sewer systems worldwide with the pressure from rapid urbanisation and climate change the topic of sewer exfiltration modelling has undergone a significant expansion in various directions which can be broadly grouped into statistical physically based and other approaches initial models focus on identifying important variables affecting sewer exfiltration the probability of sewer failures and potential impacts of sewer exfiltration on groundwater in small case studies more modern tools aim to represente the real time spatial pattern of sewer exfiltration and to improve predictions of the failure of large sewer systems for better rehabilitation and inspection plans the general on going trend of sewer exfiltration models are in favor of more integrated approaches i e combining the strength of diverse modelling techniques upscaling tools together with more data from real sewer experiments developed at various spatial temporal and geographical boundaries for a better definition of model parameters and representation of key processes as well as for confirming the validity of current approaches and advancing methods for model calibration and uncertainty analyses modelling of sewer exfiltration processes and linking this emission to groundwater impacts at city or larger scales yet show considerable short comings here lacking details on sewer conditions including age damage but also depth in the ground together with a coupled sewer pipe groundwater modelling are the two major limiting factors for future research a more systematic approach with more model components and tools is recommended when modelling the water losses from defective sewers into groundwater environment at the pipe scale advanced machine learning and data driven techniques could be used to find more accurately the deterioration state of the entire sewer network at this scale models incorporating hydraulic interactions between pipe and groundwater often assume constant damage rates or use simplified leakage equations based on single pipe properties e g pipe length pipe diameter or pipe age machine learning models could also allow an improved understanding of key driving factors affecting the sewer leakage to groundwater as the importance of these factors in sewer leakage models at the scale of the whole sewer network might vary from those defined in small scale studies at major leakages among major parameters affecting the modelling of hydraulic and solute contaminants from sewer exfiltration colmation layer properties and hydraulic potential gradient between pipe and aquifer strata are of critical importance inquiring further research while the hydraulic potential distribution in time and space may be calculated with numerical models on the basis of a well known initial condition a major challenge is the accurate prediction of the extent and hydraulic properties of the colmation layer in present times no reliable model for the prediction of these properties exist and colmation layer properties have to be determined with probing or physical experiments complete physically based integrated surface water pipe and urban infrastructure hydrogeological and groundwater model framework based on an accurate determination of core water balance components is essential to analyse the effects of sewer exfiltration on groundwater quantitatively rather than only qualitatively a more thorough model calibration incorporating the uncertainty analyses is another integral part of future sewer exfiltration models at large scales as groundwater monitoring is still often patchy the consideration of additional contaminates and more in depth analyses of source degradation and transport pathways is required for different types of sewers in most studies private sewer networks and household connections are missing and should be considered upscaling and generalization of calibrated model results from the conduit to city scales could help to define the certain model simplification schemes that are applicable for urban systems with a significant data shortage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
