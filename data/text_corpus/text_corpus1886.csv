9430,energy is currently one of the main production costs in irrigated agriculture and its cost must always be considered in irrigation projects in regions such as the brazilian cerrado where there is a continuous growth of irrigated agriculture it is important to evaluate technologies that can increase the efficiency and viability of irrigation precision irrigation has great potential to increase the economic return on rural properties with a reduction in electricity consumption the present work aimed to evaluate the increased profitability and energy savings potential of the soybean crop using precision irrigation with a center pivot to evaluate the potential benefits of precision irrigation pi irrigation demand was simulated through modeling the irrigation computer model was developed in python language the study was carried out in the area of two center pivots with soils with different hydro physical characteristics soil available water capacity awc was calculated based on field capacity permanent wilting point and bulk density data the irrigation management under homogeneous soil conditions was carried out considering the lowest the average and the highest awc value the management under variable conditions was carried out individually for each pixel considering the real awc value of the pixel also four sowing dates of the soybean crop were considered in a rainy year and a dry year the results indicated an average energy savings potential esp of 5 0 in the rainy year and 4 5 in the dry year the average potential for increasing profitability ipp was 20 4 in the rainy year and 12 5 in the dry year the use of pi can reach esps of up to 25 3 and ipps of up to 106 2 the benefits documented here are an important step towards the development of precision irrigation as an efficient irrigation management strategy keywords economic analysis energy demand irrigation efficiency irrigation at varied rate center pivot 1 introduction in recent decades one of the greatest challenges faced by humanity is to supply food for the entire population by 2050 it is estimated that the population will be about 10 billion people fao 2017 ramankutty et al 2018 united nations 2017 there is no denying that energy is essential for food production and that agriculture is a major user of this resource moraes et al 2014 the cerrado which occupies around 24 of the brazilian territory is responsible for about 70 of the national grains and beef production klink 2014 pereira et al 2012 silva et al 2015 and effectively contribute to supply part of the projected increase in food demand soybean is the main crop cultivated in these regions brazil stands out as a producer and exporter of several agricultural commodities it is one of the world s largest food producers with 7 3 of world agricultural exports allen and valdes 2016 fapda 2014 meade et al 2016 with about 37 million hectares of cultivated area a national average yield of 3 3 mg ha 1 and a total yield of 120 9 million tons in the 2019 2020 harvest brazil is the largest soybean producer in the world conab 2020 in the 2018 19 harvest more than half of the soybean area in brazil was concentrated in the cerrado biome agrosatélite 2020 corresponding to approximately 45 of the national agricultural area ibge 2017 in this region soybean is a crop typically cultivated under dry conditions da silva et al 2019 however the use of irrigated systems has been increasing and it increases the water demand in a region that already faces water problems in some of its main watersheds irrigated agriculture has been increasing in cerrado and it already has about 64 of the irrigation practiced in brazil brasil 2014 studies by althoff and rodrigues 2019 indicate that 80 of the country s center pivots are located in the cerrado also the irrigated area is expected to expand 56 000 ha year on average and may reach up to 3 mha in 2050 which could impact the dynamics of water use in the region ferreira et al 2020 and increase the possibility of energy shortages irrigation is responsible for a large part of energy consumption in rural areas moraes et al 2014 turco et al 2009 usually the producer does not adopt an irrigation control and management method and tends to irrigate in excess in fear that the crop will suffer water stress and reduce yield also historically irrigation management has been practiced considering the irrigated area as a homogeneous unit disregarding the existence of spatial variability within the irrigated area consequently some locations will receive the ideal amount of water while other locations will receive more or less water than the ideal areas receiving less water than the ideal will yield less the places with more water on the other hand waste water and electricity kassing et al 2020 lindblom et al 2017 neupane and guo 2019 rodrigues et al 2001 hence it is important to know how precision irrigation can increase rentability considering the impact of soil variability on crop yield and energy demand for a long time the cost of electricity was relatively low and water was treated as an inexhaustible resource however recently the electricity tariffs have significantly increased and the cost of pumping water in irrigated agriculture has become a fundamental factor that directly impacts the production cost such factors have forced the producer to look for viable alternatives to reduce these costs according to christofidis 2006 a center pivot consumes on average 2713 kwh per hectare per year knowing that the cerrado region has approximately 18 600 pivots which is 80 of the country s center pivots and assuming that the total area irrigated by these pivots is about 1 266 026 ha the total consumption is 3 434 727 6 kw per year lima et al 2009 indicate that with optimization and the adoption of rational irrigation control it would be possible to save up to 25 9 in the energy used and r 118 800 per year although over the last few years there has been a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of this equipment mainly due to the reduction of the system s operating pressure the energy issue in the region continues to be a bottleneck for the sustainable development of irrigation due to possible energy shortages combined with increasing costs in recent years an attempt is made to rationalize energy use by using water more efficiently in irrigation fernandes et al 2020 energy is currently one of the main costs in irrigated agriculture barbosa et al 2018 boyer et al 2014 and its cost should always be considered in irrigation projects especially in times of energy crisis and with constant tariff adjustments energy management in agriculture especially in irrigated agriculture is extremely important to increase the economic return improving irrigation efficiency is a strategy that can contribute to increasing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of irrigated agriculture bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 levidow et al 2014 mo et al 2005 zhang et al 2004 thus it is essential to evaluate and improve tools that contribute to the efficient use of energy in irrigated agriculture technological advances obtained in recent years such as global positioning systems geographic information and water application equipment at variable rates franchin et al 2009 giotto et al 2016 king and kincaid 2004 resende et al 2010 have enabled the practice of precision irrigation in center pivots by using the appropriate controls sensors and decision making tools these irrigation systems can be managed to apply different water requirements within the irrigated area precision irrigation despite being recent and still poorly studied has great potential to contribute to reduce energy consumption improve irrigation efficiency and increase profit there is a great opportunity to use computer models in this field of knowledge computer models have been used in the design and management of irrigation systems and now they can also be used to create soil moisture maps that aid the designer to understand the project s performance and viability maps in recent years several models have been proposed to manage irrigation considering the spatial variability of the soil bhatti et al 2020 cambra baseca et al 2019 gonzález perea et al 2018 li et al 2019 nascimento et al 2014 oldoni and bassoi 2016 o shaughnessy et al 2020 rodrigues et al 2001 2018 yari et al 2020 few studies have been developed to evaluate the performance and benefits of precision irrigation azevedo 2003 gonzález perea et al 2018 kang et al 2011 pereira et al 2013 qiuming et al 2007 yari et al 2017 specific studies related to the use of energy in agriculture in the cerrado region are still scarce especially using central pivot which is an irrigation system particularly suitable for the condition of precision irrigation mainly due to its current level of automation and large irrigated area with a single sideline some studies have indicated the energy savings potential using application systems at variable rates baptista et al 2019 hedley and yule 2009 sadler et al 2005 for instance baptista et al 2019 compared conventional irrigation with irrigation at a variable rate both in a center pivot using the speed control and reduced the energy consumption by 12 2 studies like this one need to be expanded and better evaluated mainly for the central pivot conditions that irrigate large areas to assess the real savings potential simulations aiming to identify the best irrigation strategy to be used to obtain the best economic returns are extremely important as they enable decision making with greater confidence in the results given the characteristics of precision irrigation and its high implementation cost in central pivot systems it is necessary to evaluate its benefits in crop yield therefore the present work aimed to evaluate the potential for increasing the profitability of the soybean crop and save energy using precision irrigation with a center pivot 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas the work was carried out in two center pivot irrigation systems fig 1 that represent the average conditions of the cerrado the first pivot fig 1a called pivobhbv and with an area of 92 8 ha represents the group of pivots in clayey soils 57 2 and with low spatial variability of texture the second pivot fig 1b called pivobhalpa with an area of 126 6 ha has great spatial variability in soil texture i e the soil texture in the center pivot area varies from sand to clay which impact in the soil water retention capacities the region from pivobhbv is characterized by a dry season that starts in april and ends in september and a rainy season that extends from october to march wendt et al 2015 the average annual rainfall is around 1100 mm from which 85 falls in the rainy season rodrigues et al 2012 the average air temperature is about 22 c average relative moisture of 69 and average maximum reference evapotranspiration around 5 7 mm day 1 it was found in the soil survey that in around 94 9 of its drainage area the main class is the red latosol followed by 3 0 of cambisols and 2 1 of gleisols passo et al 2014 the watershed s land use and land cover are mainly agricultural moreira et al 2010 soybeans are the main dry and irrigated crop along with corn wheat and beans the pivobhalpa s region climate is classified as humid tropical with a slight variation at regions further inland the rainy season is from september to march and january has the highest rainfall the dry season extends from april to august the average annual rainfall is about 1300 mm the average air temperature is approximately 21 c average relative moisture of 74 and average maximum reference evapotranspiration around 5 0 mm day 1 it was found in the soil survey embrapa 2011 that in about 60 3 of the watershed s drainage area the main soil class is red latosol followed by 22 8 of red argisol 11 9 of cambisols and 0 45 of neosols the land use and land cover are mainly agricultural followed by native vegetation which covers about 15 of the watershed area the central portion of the region occupied by the cerrado biome demands a lot of water to irrigate crops such as soybean wheat corn beans sugarcane forestry and cotton which are the main crops cultivated in the region 2 2 database 2 2 1 climate the climate data necessary for simulation of the irrigation management at pivobhbv were from a weather station monitored by embrapa cerrados about 40 km away from the study area at pivobhalpa the climate data were from a weather station monitored by the pivot s property 2 km away from the study area daily data on temperature c relative moisture wind speed m s 1 solar radiation w m 2 and rainfall mm were used 2 2 2 soil at pivobhbv most of the necessary soil data came from the study by rodrigues et al 2011 these authors collected soil samples from 99 sites within the bhbv and shared data about soil moisture at field capacity fc soil moisture at permanent wilting point pwp bulk density bd and soil texture from the 99 sampled locations the data from the ones within the pivot and the ones at up to 500 m away from its limit were used a total of 42 sampling points were used after selecting the points a visual analysis of the data spatialization within the pivot area was carried out to identify locations with low sampling density based on this analysis more samples were collected in 8 locations within the pivot area reaching a total of 50 points fig 1a five samples of disturbed and undisturbed soil were taken at each point the retention curves were determined by the standardized centrifuge method da silva and de azevedo 2002 considering the tension points of 1 6 33 100 300 and 1500 kpa at pivobhalpa disturbed and undisturbed samples with two replicates each were obtained in 45 locations within the pivot and its surroundings fig 1b the disturbed soil samples were used to analyze soil texture the undisturbed soil samples were used to assess the retention curve and to determine the overall soil density in the analysis of the retention curves the tension points of 1 10 33 and 1500 kpa were considered at the two pivots the soil samples were taken from the 0 30 cm soil layer which usually represents the crop soil layer 2 3 irrigation management the simulations considered two irrigation management strategies in the first strategy the irrigation management considered homogeneous soil disregarding its spatial variability from now on this management strategy will be called conventional management cm in the second strategy the management considered the spatial variability of the soil this management strategy will be called precision irrigation pi the spatial resolution of the simulations is 5 5m 25 m² for pi the irrigation management was carried out individually in each of the 37 191 pixels of the pivobhbv and the 50 649 pixels of the pivobhalpa which constitute the total area of the center pivots cm was managed considering three scenarios i using as a reference the lowest amount of available water in the soil awc in the irrigated area cm1 ii using the average awc value cm2 and iii using the highest awc value cm3 in scenario 1 for example the area was considered homogeneous and the management was carried out using as a reference the lowest awc value for the entire irrigated area this means that for instance in the case of pivobhbv whose pixels have an area of 25 m2 the smallest awc absolute value was used in the management of the 37 191 pixels that constitute the pivot area the simulations considered two crop years with contrasting climatological conditions in total rainfall terms one rainy year ry and one dry year dy the simulations also considered four sowing dates of the soybean crop sd three scenarios of management considering homogeneous soil cm1 cm2 and cm3 and management considering the spatial variability of the soil a total of 32 scenarios for each center pivot for pivobhbv the year 2014 2015 was considered as rainy and the year 2015 2016 as dry for pivobhalpa the rainy year was 2015 2016 and the dry year was 2016 2017 the four sowing dates of the soybean crop sd used in each year were sd1 september 10th julian days jd 254 sd2 october 10th jd 284 sd3 november 10th jd 315 and sd4 december 10th jd 345 to assess the spatial variability of the awc in the irrigated area a geostatistical analysis was carried out on the fc pwp and bd data then data interpolation was made considering the sampling locations inside and outside the center pivot area the data were interpolated using simple kriging in the r software v 1 2 1335 r core team 2019 in cases where the spatial dependence was classified as poor according to the spatial dependence index sdi proposed by cambardella et al 1994 the maps were interpolated using the inverse distance method with the interpolated data of fc pwp and bd the awc values were calculated for each pixel 2 4 irrigation management strategies simulation model conventional irrigation management was made using the irrigation strategy simulation model issm rodrigues and moreira 2015 a specific module for precision irrigation was developed in python language to carry out the precision irrigation management this module was coupled to the issm model it is necessary to set up the initial characteristics of the soil climate and plant before carrying out the simulations the issm input parameters variables used in this work are shown in table 1 the issm uses the mass conservation equation to estimate soil moisture and irrigation depth disregarding capillary rise the soil water deficit on the day i swdi is calculated by eq 1 1 swd

reached 50 of awc the soils were irrigated to reach field capacity 2 5 evaluation of energy savings potential the evaluation of energy savings potential esp was carried out by comparing the irrigation of soybean crops managed under precision irrigation conditions with irrigation under conventional management considering the three described scenarios of conventional management the model calculates the power needed to pump a given amount of water using eq 4 4 bp q tdh γ ef in which bp power required for pumping in kwh q total system flow in m³ s 1 tdh total dynamic load in m γ specific weight of water 9 806 in kn m 3 and ef total system efficiency in decimal it was considered a total dynamic head equal to 60 m and the total system efficiency equal to 80 tdh of 60 m and total system efficient equal to 80 represents an average value for center pivots in the region the system s flow was calculated by eq 5 5 q ai lb 86400 j t in which ai irrigated area in ha lb gross irrigation depth in mm j number of days to apply lb 110 days and t percentage of time that the system is working decimal the lb used corresponds to the total amount of water applied during the crop cycle in other words during the 110 days the pivot area is calculated as a function of the number of pixels and the area of each pixel thus the energy required er to apply a certain amount of water is obtained by eq 6 6 er bp h in which h is time in hours the energy savings potential esp in kwh was calculated by eq 7 7 esp er cm er pi in which ercm energy required in conventional management kwh and erpi energy required in precision irrigation management kwh the evaluation of the energy savings potential was carried out for each of the conventional irrigation management strategies precision irrigation management was considered as a reference 2 6 evaluation of the potential to increase profitability an economic analysis was carried out considering all irrigation management strategies used in this work this analysis considered the difference between gross revenue and total production cost from each of the evaluated irrigation management strategies gross revenue r ha 1 was calculated based on the simulated crop yield for each strategy and the sale price of soybeans from the region of each pivot table 2 using eq 8 8 g r ya 60 cot in which gr gross revenue r ha 1 ya current crop yield kg ha 1 and cot soybean sack quotation r sack 1 crop yield was calculated using eq 9 as described by stewart et al 1977 and presented by doorenbos and kassam 1979 9 y a y m 1 k y 1 i 1 110 et ai i 1 110 et mi in which ya current crop yield kg ha 1 ym maximum crop yield kg ha 1 etai total current evapotranspiration mm etmi maximum total evapotranspiration mm and ky crop response factor to water stress dimensionless a single ky value of 0 85 was used as a reference for the soybean crop cycle as proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for both cm and pi the crop yield was simulated for each pixel of the pivot the average production cost pc of soybeans in the region was obtained from the production database of the national development company https www conab gov br info agro custos de producao at which detailed information is available on the production cost of the crop in that region during all stages of the crop cycle taking into account the cost of farming financial expenses depreciation fees and charges the information used refers to the production cost for the year 2019 all information related to the average production cost was considered the same for all irrigation management strategies changing only the electricity cost the calculation of the electricity cost ec was based on the required energy kwh simulated for each strategy multiplied by the consumption tariff r kwh 1 from the region where the pivot is located and considering the night tariff the electricity tariff charged by the concessionaires responsible for the distribution of energy in the regions from the pivots was considered the information regarding the soybean sales quotation and electricity tariffs for the two study areas are shown in table 2 the sum of all the costs mentioned constitutes the total production cost tpc according to eq 10 10 tpc pc ec in which tpc total production cost r ha 1 pc soybean production cost r ha 1 ec electricity cost r kwh 1 profit was obtained by the difference between gross revenue and total production cost eq 11 11 l rb tpc in which l profit r ha 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed climate data fig 2 shows the daily climate data from pivobhbv fig 2a and pivobhalpa fig 2b for the soybean crop in the four sowing dates in the rainy and dry years at pivobhbv fig 2a the ry had 106 rainfall events with a total rainfall of 1230 mm in the dy it rained 792 mm with 86 rainfall events on the evaluated sowing dates in the ry it was noted the occurrence of 18 day dry spells in sd2 sd3 and sd4 the dry spells happened when the soybean crop was at 87 54 and 24 days after sowing das and extended to 105 72 and 42 das respectively in dy considering sd3 between 79 and 110 das and sd4 between 49 and 110 das many days without rainfall were verified in the ry the reference evapotranspiration eto ranged from 1 4 to 6 9 mm d 1 with an average eto of 4 4 mm d 1 the average maximum temperature tmax was 29 3 c ranging from 20 3 to 36 4 c the average minimum temperature tmin was 17 1 c ranging from 13 5 to 20 3 c in the dy eto ranged from 1 7 to 7 6 mm d 1 with an average eto of 4 6 mm d 1 the average tmax was 30 6 c ranging from 22 8 to 37 1 c the average tmin was 17 7 c ranging from 13 7 to 21 3 c at pivobhalpa fig 2b the ry had 117 rainfall events with a total rainfall of 1440 mm in the dy it rained 798 6 mm with 94 rainfall events on the evaluated sowing dates in the ry 14 day dry spells happened in sd3 and sd4 the dry spells happened when the soybean crop was at 64 and 34 das and extended to the 77 and 47 das respectively in the dy considering sd3 between 7 and 26 das and between 83 and 103 das many days without rainfall were verified in the ry the reference evapotranspiration eto ranged from 1 0 to 6 0 mm d 1 with an average eto of 3 7 mm d 1 the average maximum temperature tmax was 27 6 c ranging from 16 9 to 35 4 c the average minimum temperature tmin was 18 2 c ranging from 10 8 to 21 6 c in the dy eto ranged from 1 2 to 6 2 mm d 1 with an average eto of 4 0 mm d 1 the average tmax was 27 6 c ranging from 16 6 to 34 4 c the average tmin was 17 2 c ranging from 9 3 to 21 2 c table 3 shows the climate data at pivobhbv and pivobhalpa for the soybean crop in the four sowing dates in the rainy and dry years comparing both locations pivobhalpa had a greater total rainfall and a better distribution of rainfall during the two years evaluated pivobhbv had longer and more frequent dry spells due to bad rainfall distribution at pivobhbv 40 491 mm of the total rainfall during the ry was concentrated between november 22nd and december 12th and 45 355 mm of the total rainfall during the dy was concentrated between january 3rd and january 1st 3 2 soil hydro physical variables the descriptive statistical analysis of the soil hydro physical variables from the two studied pivots are shown in fig 3 texture is one of the main indicators of soil water retention reichardt 1987 the soil from pivobhbv was classified as clayey with an average clay content of 57 2 with a standard deviation of 11 5 and a coefficient of variation of 20 2 overall soils with high clay contents have greater soil water retention capacity klein et al 2010 the average moisture values for field capacity and permanent wilting point were 41 4 and 25 5 respectively bulk density bd had an average value of 1 01 g cm ³ indicating low compaction in the agricultural layer the awc had an average value of 0 0158 mm m 1 indicating a good storage capacity typical of clayey soils the soil of pivobhalpa was classified as clayey sandy with average clay and sand contents around 45 4 and 45 5 respectively the sand and clay fractions had standard deviation values of 13 6 and 11 0 and coefficient of variation of 29 9 and 24 1 respectively indicating a great variability of these soil properties in the pivot area the average values of fc and pwp were 23 4 and 18 8 respectively the bd had an average value of 1 38 g cm ³ that indicates greater compaction and as a consequence less total porosity with greater restrictions for the growth of the root system and plant development the smaller the growth of the root system the less total volume of soil water is available for plants directly impacting the irrigation frequency awc had an average value of 0 0063 mm m 1 a characteristic value of sandy textured soils eca had an average value of 31 7 ms m 1 with a standard deviation of 11 9 ms m 1 and a coefficient of variation of 37 5 at pivobhalpa high values of standard deviation and coefficient of variation were found they demonstrate a high variability of soil characteristics meaning that the variables have a greater dispersion around their averages since the irrigation management strategies evaluated in this work are based on the awc value the spatial variability and frequency of awc in each pixel from each study pivot were verified fig 4 from fig 4 it is observed that the soil from the two pivots have different water storage capacities the greatest spatial variability of available soil water content is found in pivobhalpa fig 4b at pivobhbv fig 4a 57 6 of the pixels have awc values ranging from 0 0145 to 0 01 55 mm m 1 based on the total number of pixels from pivobhbv and considering pixels with an area of 25 m2 236 pixels 0 63 have awc values equal to the smallest value 0 0135 mm m 1 189 pixels 0 51 have awc values equal to the average value 0 0152 mm m 1 and only 4 pixels 0 01 have awc values equal to the highest value 0 0189 mm m 1 11 691 pixels 31 3 and 25 311 pixels 68 1 respectively had awc values below and above the average this variability demonstrates that it is impracticable to operationalize the management to meet the reality of each pixel so some areas will always be areas receiving more or less water than the ideal impacting the irrigation efficiency it is not practical to operate a center pivot based on grids of 5 5 m the central idea of this work is to check the benefits of precision irrigation using a very refine grid of 5 5 the soil variability could be better represented with this fine representation the soil variability impact on irrigation management profitability and energy savings could be better understood as long as the grids are aggregate in management zones which is more usual on management important information is lost and the representation of the impacts get worse at pivobhalpa fig 4b 58 07 of the pixels have awc values ranging between 0 0055 and 0 0070 mm m 1 in 228 pixels 0 45 awc values were equal to the smallest value 0 0042 mm m 1 1890 pixels 3 70 have awc values equal to the average value 0 0064 mm m 1 and 179 pixels 0 35 have awc values equal to the highest value 0 0089 mm m 1 22 331 pixels 44 1 and 26 428 pixels 52 2 respectively had awc values below and above the average 3 3 energy savings potential fig 5 shows the average energy requirement per hectare for pi and cm in the four sowing dates of the soybean crop in a rainy and a dry year it can be seen in fig 5a that at pivobhbv in ry the average required energy during the crop cycle ranged from 700 kwh ha 1 in cm3 to 810 kwh ha 1 in cm1 in dy the average required energy during the crop cycle ranged from 990 kwh ha 1 in cm3 to 1090 kwh ha 1 in cm2 the smallest required energy was found in the cm3 note that the average required energy in the dy was 25 0 higher than the average required energy in the ry in cm1 26 6 in cm2 29 3 in cm3 and 27 1 in pi at pivobhalpa fig 5b for the ry and dy the highest average required energy was found in cm1 being respectively equal to 1160 and 1520 kwh ha 1 in the ry the smallest differences in the average required energy were found between the cm2 and pi managements at pivobhalpa the average required energy in the dy was 23 7 higher than the average required energy in ry in cm1 22 3 in cm2 38 4 in cm3 and 25 7 in pi analyzing fig 6 with the management adopted it is noted that the average total irrigation depth in pi was more similar to the one in cm2 the highest values were found in cm1 and the lowest in cm3 considering both pivots the average required energy in pivobhalpa is about 29 4 higher than in pivobhbv in ry and 28 5 in dy fig 6 shows the energy savings potential calculated by the difference of the total energy required between the pi condition and the cm management considering the four sowing dates of the soybean crop in one rainy year and one dry year there will be energy savings potential when the energy required in a given pixel is greater than the calculated energy required in pi in cm1 by analyzing the energy savings potential from pivobhbv fig 6a it can be noted that the use of pi resulted in energy savings in the four sowing dates of the ry in sd3 the highest esp value was 6824 kwh corresponding to 10 7 of the total energy consumption in the soybean cycle with pi sd1 had an esp of 6345 kwh 7 7 sd2 of 3034 kwh 3 7 and sd4 of 1139 kwh 2 0 for cm2 the highest esp was in sd2 with an esp of 6335 kwh 7 6 in sd1 sd3 and sd4 respectively the esp were 2626 483 and 2631 kwh 3 2 0 8 and 4 6 as for cm3 the use of pi had an esp in sd2 and sd4 of 2162 and 1139 kwh 2 6 and 2 0 respectively in dy cm1 had the highest esp in sd4 of 8578 kwh 8 9 sd1 obtained an esp of 2022 kwh 1 6 in sd2 the esp was 2476 kwh 2 8 and in sd3 it was 2530 kwh 3 1 regarding cm2 the use of pi caused esp in all sowing dates and sd2 and sd4 had the highest values of 7291 and 5983 kwh 8 2 and 6 2 respectively in sd1 and sd3 esp was respectively 2022 and 2530 kwh 1 6 and 3 1 as for cm3 the use of pi caused the greatest energy savings potential in sd1 with an esp value of 5422 kwh 4 3 while sd2 and sd4 had respectively 1329 and 1551 kwh 1 5 and 1 6 at pivobhalpa fig 6b in ry the use of pi over cm1 resulted in energy savings in all conditions the highest esps happened in sd2 and sd4 with values of 26 606 and 27 387 kwh respectively corresponding to 25 3 and 18 3 of the total energy consumption in the soybean cycle with pi the other sowing dates had lower esps sd2 had esp of 7570 kwh 6 1 and sd3 of 14 231 kwh 10 7 as for cm2 the highest esp was in sd3 of 4592 kwh 3 5 in sd1 sd2 and sd4 respectively the esps were 1711 3532 and 2282 kwh 1 6 2 8 and 1 5 regarding cm3 the highest esp was 69 kwh 0 1 in sd1 the other sowing dates did not have esp in dy cm1 had esp in all conditions and sd2 and sd4 had the highest values equal to 22 693 and 28 391 kwh respectively which corresponds to 14 2 and 17 9 of the total energy consumption in the soybean cycle with pi sd1 had an esp of 15 100 kwh 7 1 and sd3 of 16 123 kwh 10 2 regarding cm2 the highest values of esps were in sd2 and sd1 respectively equal to 5254 and 1131 kwh 3 3 and 0 5 in sd3 and sd4 the use of pi did not result in esp as for cm3 the highest esps were 5445 and 1131 kwh 3 4 and 0 5 in sd4 and sd1 respectively sd2 had an esp of 118 kwh 0 1 and sd3 did not have esp at pivobhbv the average esps considering cm1 cm2 and cm3 irrigation management strategies were 4336 3019 and 1651 kwh 6 0 4 0 and 2 3 in the ry and 3901 4457 and 2767 kwh 4 1 4 8 and 2 5 in the dy respectively at pivobhalpa the average esps considering the cm1 cm2 and cm3 respectively were 18 948 3278 and 69 kwh 15 1 2 6 and 0 1 in the ry and 20 577 2185 and 3288 kwh 12 3 1 3 and 2 0 in the dy considering the average esp per year the dy has a higher esp than the ry since the use of water in the dy is higher in all management strategies especially in the cm strategies at pivobhbv the average esp was 3002 kwh 4 1 in ry and 3709 kwh 3 8 in dy at pivobhalpa the average esp was 7432 kwh 5 9 in ry and 8683 kwh 5 2 in dy comparing the results obtained in the two center pivots analyzed in this study esp obtained in pivobhalpa was 2 5 times higher than pivobhbv during ry and 2 3 times higher during dy this can be explained by a combination of factors the main factor however is related to the time of rainfall occurrence if rainfall occurs before the time when irrigation would be applied it can reduce or even avoid the need for irrigation which as consequence will contribute to save energy demand 3 4 increased profitability potential the average production cost of soybean obtained from conab 2019 for the region of brasília df pivobhbv and são paulo sp pivobhalpa is shown in table 4 the average production costs for the year 2019 for pivobhbv and pivobhalpa were 3960 64 and 3740 07 r ha 1 respectively fig 7 shows the increased profitability potential ipp achieved using pi over cm simulated for four sowing dates of the soybean crop in rainy and dry years at pivobhbv fig 7a in ry cm1 had the greatest increased profitability potential with the use of pi in sd1 and sd4 with values of 17 4 and 6 5 r 18 378 80 and r 6845 82 respectively in sd2 the ipp was 2 4 r 2522 27 and in sd3 it was 1 3 r 1353 13 in cm2 the highest ipp was also in sd1 and sd4 with values of 29 0 and 13 5 r 30 601 39 and r 14 247 49 respectively in sd2 the ipp was 0 9 r 933 24 and in sd3 it was 6 6 r 6970 68 cm3 had the highest values of ipps due to the losses in crop yield observed in this management strategy the ipps from cm3 were 106 2 r 112 229 35 in sd3 and 28 2 13 6 and 55 8 r 29 788 91 r 14 354 64 and r 58 996 99 in sd1 sd2 and sd4 respectively the high percentages of increased profitability found in cm3 mainly in sd3 can be explained by the total revenue which was negative 6 2 in this specific case this means that the production cost was higher than the total revenue in other words there was no profit but a loss in dy cm1 had the highest ipps in sd2 and sd3 being respectively equal to 17 1 and 11 6 r 18 028 26 and r 12 238 31 in sd1 the ipp was 1 8 r 1868 79 and in sd4 it was 5 7 r 6014 55 in cm2 the highest ipps occurred in sd3 and sd4 being respectively equal to 9 2 and 9 7 r 9769 63 and r 10 276 82 in sd1 the ipp obtained was 1 1 r 1145 81 and 0 04 r 43 38 in sd2 the increased profitability potential due to the use of pi in the cm3 was expressive in sd2 sd3 and sd4 respectively equal to 44 4 67 1 and 33 8 r 46 903 95 r 70 830 40 and r 35 673 46 at pivobhalpa fig 7b cm1 had a crop yield similar to the one with the use of pi therefore the total revenue was not significantly reduced by the adoption of the cm1 strategy resulting in ipp values equal or very close to zero in ry the most expressive ipp in cm1 was in sd2 0 8 r 1363 26 in sd1 the ipp was 0 02 r 32 91 in sd3 it was 0 01 r 13 88 and in sd4 it was 0 02 r 28 07 cm2 had the highest ipp in sd1 with a value of 16 1 r 26 668 53 and in sd4 with a value of 12 8 r 21 221 13 in sd2 ipp was 2 9 r 4798 67 and in sd3 it was 1 8 r 2954 49 at this pivot the highest ipps were also in cm3 comparing with cm3 the use of pi caused ipp of 95 6 96 8 73 5 and 48 0 r 158 340 25 r 160 359 50 r 121 678 45 and r 79 470 88 in the sd1 sd2 sd3 and sd4 respectively in dy and cm1 the most expressive ipp was in sd3 equal to 2 4 r 4003 29 in sd1 the ipp was 0 05 r 80 07 in sd2 it was 0 06 r 86 96 and in sd4 it was 0 04 r 66 82 in cm2 the highest ipps were in sd4 26 7 r 44 172 35 in sd3 19 1 r 31 659 82 and in sd1 13 4 r 22 252 57 in sd2 the ipp was equal to 5 5 r 9039 39 in cm3 ipp was considerably expressive in sd3 with an ipp of 62 5 r 103 480 93 in this particular case the total revenue from cm3 was very close to the total production cost and as a result the profit was much lower than expected in sd2 sd1 and sd4 respectively the ipps were 30 8 19 1 and 4 5 r 51 000 87 r 31 612 40 and r 7509 78 at pivobhbv the average ipp from cm1 cm2 and cm3 were 6 9 12 5 and 51 0 r 7275 00 r 13 188 20 and r 53 842 47 in the ry and 9 0 5 0 and 36 3 r 9537 48 r 5308 91 and r 38 359 68 in the dy respectively at pivobhalpa the average ipp from cm1 cm2 and cm3 were 0 2 8 4 and 78 5 r 359 53 r 13 910 70 and r 129 962 27 in the ry and 0 6 16 2 and 29 2 r 1059 29 r 26 781 04 and r 48 400 99 in the dy respectively regarding the cm strategies cm3 had the highest ipp indicating that the reduction in crop yield caused by cm3 resulted in a very expressive drop in profit comparing the two years analyzed higher ipp values are found in the ry ry has greater rainfall that reduces the amount and frequency of irrigation impacting the energy consumption which is one of the highest costs associated with the total production cost in the dy the irrigation demand increases and consequently the quantity and frequency of irrigation increases the average values of ipp in the ry were 18 8 r 18 961 18 and 22 0 r 36 390 60 while in the dy they were 12 9 r 13 653 19 and 12 0 r 19 813 43 considering pivobhbv and pivobhalpa respectively comparing both pivots pi showed a greater potential for increased profitability in pivobhalpa due to its greater spatial variability of soil characteristics pivobhalpa had an ipp 1 9 times higher than in pivobhbv during the ry and 1 5 times during the dy in studies carried out by yari et al 2017 under field conditions comparing the use of precision irrigation with conventional irrigation management a reduction in the energy cost of 15 3 and 21 3 was found during the 2013 and 2014 seasons and 17 in 2015 4 conclusions precision irrigation despite being recent and still little studied has great potential to increase the economic return on the rural property with the reduction of energy consumption in this work simulations were carried out in the area of two center pivots irrigated to evaluate the potential for increased profitability and energy savings with the use of precision irrigation the results obtained showed important benefits of irrigation management considering soil water variability the energy required in the soybean crop cycle was on average equal to 1051 kwh ha 1 the average energy savings potential using precision irrigation was equal to 4 8 5706 5 kwh for the conditions analyzed it was found that the use of precision irrigation can reach energy savings potentials of up to 25 3 the average potential for increased profitability with the use of precision irrigation was equal to 16 4 r 22 204 60 for the conditions analyzed it was found that the use of

9430,energy is currently one of the main production costs in irrigated agriculture and its cost must always be considered in irrigation projects in regions such as the brazilian cerrado where there is a continuous growth of irrigated agriculture it is important to evaluate technologies that can increase the efficiency and viability of irrigation precision irrigation has great potential to increase the economic return on rural properties with a reduction in electricity consumption the present work aimed to evaluate the increased profitability and energy savings potential of the soybean crop using precision irrigation with a center pivot to evaluate the potential benefits of precision irrigation pi irrigation demand was simulated through modeling the irrigation computer model was developed in python language the study was carried out in the area of two center pivots with soils with different hydro physical characteristics soil available water capacity awc was calculated based on field capacity permanent wilting point and bulk density data the irrigation management under homogeneous soil conditions was carried out considering the lowest the average and the highest awc value the management under variable conditions was carried out individually for each pixel considering the real awc value of the pixel also four sowing dates of the soybean crop were considered in a rainy year and a dry year the results indicated an average energy savings potential esp of 5 0 in the rainy year and 4 5 in the dry year the average potential for increasing profitability ipp was 20 4 in the rainy year and 12 5 in the dry year the use of pi can reach esps of up to 25 3 and ipps of up to 106 2 the benefits documented here are an important step towards the development of precision irrigation as an efficient irrigation management strategy keywords economic analysis energy demand irrigation efficiency irrigation at varied rate center pivot 1 introduction in recent decades one of the greatest challenges faced by humanity is to supply food for the entire population by 2050 it is estimated that the population will be about 10 billion people fao 2017 ramankutty et al 2018 united nations 2017 there is no denying that energy is essential for food production and that agriculture is a major user of this resource moraes et al 2014 the cerrado which occupies around 24 of the brazilian territory is responsible for about 70 of the national grains and beef production klink 2014 pereira et al 2012 silva et al 2015 and effectively contribute to supply part of the projected increase in food demand soybean is the main crop cultivated in these regions brazil stands out as a producer and exporter of several agricultural commodities it is one of the world s largest food producers with 7 3 of world agricultural exports allen and valdes 2016 fapda 2014 meade et al 2016 with about 37 million hectares of cultivated area a national average yield of 3 3 mg ha 1 and a total yield of 120 9 million tons in the 2019 2020 harvest brazil is the largest soybean producer in the world conab 2020 in the 2018 19 harvest more than half of the soybean area in brazil was concentrated in the cerrado biome agrosatélite 2020 corresponding to approximately 45 of the national agricultural area ibge 2017 in this region soybean is a crop typically cultivated under dry conditions da silva et al 2019 however the use of irrigated systems has been increasing and it increases the water demand in a region that already faces water problems in some of its main watersheds irrigated agriculture has been increasing in cerrado and it already has about 64 of the irrigation practiced in brazil brasil 2014 studies by althoff and rodrigues 2019 indicate that 80 of the country s center pivots are located in the cerrado also the irrigated area is expected to expand 56 000 ha year on average and may reach up to 3 mha in 2050 which could impact the dynamics of water use in the region ferreira et al 2020 and increase the possibility of energy shortages irrigation is responsible for a large part of energy consumption in rural areas moraes et al 2014 turco et al 2009 usually the producer does not adopt an irrigation control and management method and tends to irrigate in excess in fear that the crop will suffer water stress and reduce yield also historically irrigation management has been practiced considering the irrigated area as a homogeneous unit disregarding the existence of spatial variability within the irrigated area consequently some locations will receive the ideal amount of water while other locations will receive more or less water than the ideal areas receiving less water than the ideal will yield less the places with more water on the other hand waste water and electricity kassing et al 2020 lindblom et al 2017 neupane and guo 2019 rodrigues et al 2001 hence it is important to know how precision irrigation can increase rentability considering the impact of soil variability on crop yield and energy demand for a long time the cost of electricity was relatively low and water was treated as an inexhaustible resource however recently the electricity tariffs have significantly increased and the cost of pumping water in irrigated agriculture has become a fundamental factor that directly impacts the production cost such factors have forced the producer to look for viable alternatives to reduce these costs according to christofidis 2006 a center pivot consumes on average 2713 kwh per hectare per year knowing that the cerrado region has approximately 18 600 pivots which is 80 of the country s center pivots and assuming that the total area irrigated by these pivots is about 1 266 026 ha the total consumption is 3 434 727 6 kw per year lima et al 2009 indicate that with optimization and the adoption of rational irrigation control it would be possible to save up to 25 9 in the energy used and r 118 800 per year although over the last few years there has been a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of this equipment mainly due to the reduction of the system s operating pressure the energy issue in the region continues to be a bottleneck for the sustainable development of irrigation due to possible energy shortages combined with increasing costs in recent years an attempt is made to rationalize energy use by using water more efficiently in irrigation fernandes et al 2020 energy is currently one of the main costs in irrigated agriculture barbosa et al 2018 boyer et al 2014 and its cost should always be considered in irrigation projects especially in times of energy crisis and with constant tariff adjustments energy management in agriculture especially in irrigated agriculture is extremely important to increase the economic return improving irrigation efficiency is a strategy that can contribute to increasing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of irrigated agriculture bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 levidow et al 2014 mo et al 2005 zhang et al 2004 thus it is essential to evaluate and improve tools that contribute to the efficient use of energy in irrigated agriculture technological advances obtained in recent years such as global positioning systems geographic information and water application equipment at variable rates franchin et al 2009 giotto et al 2016 king and kincaid 2004 resende et al 2010 have enabled the practice of precision irrigation in center pivots by using the appropriate controls sensors and decision making tools these irrigation systems can be managed to apply different water requirements within the irrigated area precision irrigation despite being recent and still poorly studied has great potential to contribute to reduce energy consumption improve irrigation efficiency and increase profit there is a great opportunity to use computer models in this field of knowledge computer models have been used in the design and management of irrigation systems and now they can also be used to create soil moisture maps that aid the designer to understand the project s performance and viability maps in recent years several models have been proposed to manage irrigation considering the spatial variability of the soil bhatti et al 2020 cambra baseca et al 2019 gonzález perea et al 2018 li et al 2019 nascimento et al 2014 oldoni and bassoi 2016 o shaughnessy et al 2020 rodrigues et al 2001 2018 yari et al 2020 few studies have been developed to evaluate the performance and benefits of precision irrigation azevedo 2003 gonzález perea et al 2018 kang et al 2011 pereira et al 2013 qiuming et al 2007 yari et al 2017 specific studies related to the use of energy in agriculture in the cerrado region are still scarce especially using central pivot which is an irrigation system particularly suitable for the condition of precision irrigation mainly due to its current level of automation and large irrigated area with a single sideline some studies have indicated the energy savings potential using application systems at variable rates baptista et al 2019 hedley and yule 2009 sadler et al 2005 for instance baptista et al 2019 compared conventional irrigation with irrigation at a variable rate both in a center pivot using the speed control and reduced the energy consumption by 12 2 studies like this one need to be expanded and better evaluated mainly for the central pivot conditions that irrigate large areas to assess the real savings potential simulations aiming to identify the best irrigation strategy to be used to obtain the best economic returns are extremely important as they enable decision making with greater confidence in the results given the characteristics of precision irrigation and its high implementation cost in central pivot systems it is necessary to evaluate its benefits in crop yield therefore the present work aimed to evaluate the potential for increasing the profitability of the soybean crop and save energy using precision irrigation with a center pivot 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas the work was carried out in two center pivot irrigation systems fig 1 that represent the average conditions of the cerrado the first pivot fig 1a called pivobhbv and with an area of 92 8 ha represents the group of pivots in clayey soils 57 2 and with low spatial variability of texture the second pivot fig 1b called pivobhalpa with an area of 126 6 ha has great spatial variability in soil texture i e the soil texture in the center pivot area varies from sand to clay which impact in the soil water retention capacities the region from pivobhbv is characterized by a dry season that starts in april and ends in september and a rainy season that extends from october to march wendt et al 2015 the average annual rainfall is around 1100 mm from which 85 falls in the rainy season rodrigues et al 2012 the average air temperature is about 22 c average relative moisture of 69 and average maximum reference evapotranspiration around 5 7 mm day 1 it was found in the soil survey that in around 94 9 of its drainage area the main class is the red latosol followed by 3 0 of cambisols and 2 1 of gleisols passo et al 2014 the watershed s land use and land cover are mainly agricultural moreira et al 2010 soybeans are the main dry and irrigated crop along with corn wheat and beans the pivobhalpa s region climate is classified as humid tropical with a slight variation at regions further inland the rainy season is from september to march and january has the highest rainfall the dry season extends from april to august the average annual rainfall is about 1300 mm the average air temperature is approximately 21 c average relative moisture of 74 and average maximum reference evapotranspiration around 5 0 mm day 1 it was found in the soil survey embrapa 2011 that in about 60 3 of the watershed s drainage area the main soil class is red latosol followed by 22 8 of red argisol 11 9 of cambisols and 0 45 of neosols the land use and land cover are mainly agricultural followed by native vegetation which covers about 15 of the watershed area the central portion of the region occupied by the cerrado biome demands a lot of water to irrigate crops such as soybean wheat corn beans sugarcane forestry and cotton which are the main crops cultivated in the region 2 2 database 2 2 1 climate the climate data necessary for simulation of the irrigation management at pivobhbv were from a weather station monitored by embrapa cerrados about 40 km away from the study area at pivobhalpa the climate data were from a weather station monitored by the pivot s property 2 km away from the study area daily data on temperature c relative moisture wind speed m s 1 solar radiation w m 2 and rainfall mm were used 2 2 2 soil at pivobhbv most of the necessary soil data came from the study by rodrigues et al 2011 these authors collected soil samples from 99 sites within the bhbv and shared data about soil moisture at field capacity fc soil moisture at permanent wilting point pwp bulk density bd and soil texture from the 99 sampled locations the data from the ones within the pivot and the ones at up to 500 m away from its limit were used a total of 42 sampling points were used after selecting the points a visual analysis of the data spatialization within the pivot area was carried out to identify locations with low sampling density based on this analysis more samples were collected in 8 locations within the pivot area reaching a total of 50 points fig 1a five samples of disturbed and undisturbed soil were taken at each point the retention curves were determined by the standardized centrifuge method da silva and de azevedo 2002 considering the tension points of 1 6 33 100 300 and 1500 kpa at pivobhalpa disturbed and undisturbed samples with two replicates each were obtained in 45 locations within the pivot and its surroundings fig 1b the disturbed soil samples were used to analyze soil texture the undisturbed soil samples were used to assess the retention curve and to determine the overall soil density in the analysis of the retention curves the tension points of 1 10 33 and 1500 kpa were considered at the two pivots the soil samples were taken from the 0 30 cm soil layer which usually represents the crop soil layer 2 3 irrigation management the simulations considered two irrigation management strategies in the first strategy the irrigation management considered homogeneous soil disregarding its spatial variability from now on this management strategy will be called conventional management cm in the second strategy the management considered the spatial variability of the soil this management strategy will be called precision irrigation pi the spatial resolution of the simulations is 5 5m 25 m² for pi the irrigation management was carried out individually in each of the 37 191 pixels of the pivobhbv and the 50 649 pixels of the pivobhalpa which constitute the total area of the center pivots cm was managed considering three scenarios i using as a reference the lowest amount of available water in the soil awc in the irrigated area cm1 ii using the average awc value cm2 and iii using the highest awc value cm3 in scenario 1 for example the area was considered homogeneous and the management was carried out using as a reference the lowest awc value for the entire irrigated area this means that for instance in the case of pivobhbv whose pixels have an area of 25 m2 the smallest awc absolute value was used in the management of the 37 191 pixels that constitute the pivot area the simulations considered two crop years with contrasting climatological conditions in total rainfall terms one rainy year ry and one dry year dy the simulations also considered four sowing dates of the soybean crop sd three scenarios of management considering homogeneous soil cm1 cm2 and cm3 and management considering the spatial variability of the soil a total of 32 scenarios for each center pivot for pivobhbv the year 2014 2015 was considered as rainy and the year 2015 2016 as dry for pivobhalpa the rainy year was 2015 2016 and the dry year was 2016 2017 the four sowing dates of the soybean crop sd used in each year were sd1 september 10th julian days jd 254 sd2 october 10th jd 284 sd3 november 10th jd 315 and sd4 december 10th jd 345 to assess the spatial variability of the awc in the irrigated area a geostatistical analysis was carried out on the fc pwp and bd data then data interpolation was made considering the sampling locations inside and outside the center pivot area the data were interpolated using simple kriging in the r software v 1 2 1335 r core team 2019 in cases where the spatial dependence was classified as poor according to the spatial dependence index sdi proposed by cambardella et al 1994 the maps were interpolated using the inverse distance method with the interpolated data of fc pwp and bd the awc values were calculated for each pixel 2 4 irrigation management strategies simulation model conventional irrigation management was made using the irrigation strategy simulation model issm rodrigues and moreira 2015 a specific module for precision irrigation was developed in python language to carry out the precision irrigation management this module was coupled to the issm model it is necessary to set up the initial characteristics of the soil climate and plant before carrying out the simulations the issm input parameters variables used in this work are shown in table 1 the issm uses the mass conservation equation to estimate soil moisture and irrigation depth disregarding capillary rise the soil water deficit on the day i swdi is calculated by eq 1 1 swd

reached 50 of awc the soils were irrigated to reach field capacity 2 5 evaluation of energy savings potential the evaluation of energy savings potential esp was carried out by comparing the irrigation of soybean crops managed under precision irrigation conditions with irrigation under conventional management considering the three described scenarios of conventional management the model calculates the power needed to pump a given amount of water using eq 4 4 bp q tdh γ ef in which bp power required for pumping in kwh q total system flow in m³ s 1 tdh total dynamic load in m γ specific weight of water 9 806 in kn m 3 and ef total system efficiency in decimal it was considered a total dynamic head equal to 60 m and the total system efficiency equal to 80 tdh of 60 m and total system efficient equal to 80 represents an average value for center pivots in the region the system s flow was calculated by eq 5 5 q ai lb 86400 j t in which ai irrigated area in ha lb gross irrigation depth in mm j number of days to apply lb 110 days and t percentage of time that the system is working decimal the lb used corresponds to the total amount of water applied during the crop cycle in other words during the 110 days the pivot area is calculated as a function of the number of pixels and the area of each pixel thus the energy required er to apply a certain amount of water is obtained by eq 6 6 er bp h in which h is time in hours the energy savings potential esp in kwh was calculated by eq 7 7 esp er cm er pi in which ercm energy required in conventional management kwh and erpi energy required in precision irrigation management kwh the evaluation of the energy savings potential was carried out for each of the conventional irrigation management strategies precision irrigation management was considered as a reference 2 6 evaluation of the potential to increase profitability an economic analysis was carried out considering all irrigation management strategies used in this work this analysis considered the difference between gross revenue and total production cost from each of the evaluated irrigation management strategies gross revenue r ha 1 was calculated based on the simulated crop yield for each strategy and the sale price of soybeans from the region of each pivot table 2 using eq 8 8 g r ya 60 cot in which gr gross revenue r ha 1 ya current crop yield kg ha 1

dimensionless a single ky value of 0 85 was used as a reference for the soybean crop cycle as proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for both cm and pi the crop yield was simulated for each pixel of the pivot the average production cost pc of soybeans in the region was obtained from the production database of the national development company https www conab gov br info agro custos de producao at which detailed information is available on the production cost of the crop in that region during all stages of the crop cycle taking into account the cost of farming financial expenses depreciation fees and charges the information used refers to the production cost for the year 2019 all information related to the average production cost was considered the same for all irrigation management strategies changing only the electricity cost the calculation of the electricity cost ec was based on the required energy kwh simulated for each strategy multiplied by the consumption tariff r kwh 1 from the region where the pivot is located and considering the night tariff the electricity tariff charged by the concessionaires responsible for the distribution of energy in the regions from the pivots was considered the information regarding the soybean sales quotation and electricity tariffs for the two study areas are shown in table 2 the sum of all the costs mentioned constitutes the

and pivobhalpa fig 2b for the soybean crop in the four sowing dates in the rainy and dry years at pivobhbv fig 2a the ry had 106 rainfall events with a total rainfall of 1230 mm in the dy it rained 792 mm with 86 rainfall events on the evaluated sowing dates in the ry it was noted the occurrence of 18 day dry spells in sd2 sd3 and sd4 the dry spells happened when the soybean crop was at 87 54 and 24 days after sowing das and extended to 105 72 and 42 das respectively in dy considering sd3 between 79 and 110 das and sd4 between 49 and 110 das many days without rainfall were verified in the ry the reference evapotranspiration eto ranged from 1 4 to 6 9 mm d 1 with an average eto of 4 4 mm d 1 the average maximum temperature tmax was 29 3 c ranging from 20 3 to 36 4 c the average minimum temperature tmin was 17 1 c ranging from 13 5 to 20 3 c in the dy eto ranged from 1 7 to 7 6 mm d 1 with an average eto of 4 6 mm d 1 the average tmax was 30 6 c ranging from 22 8 to 37 1 c the average tmin was 17 7 c ranging from 13 7 to 21 3 c at pivobhalpa fig 2b the ry had 117 rainfall events with a total rainfall of 1440 mm in the dy it rained 798 6 mm with 94 rainfall events on the evaluated sowing dates in the ry 14 day dry spells happened in sd3 and sd4 the dry spells happened when the soybean crop was at 64 and 34 das and extended to the 77 and 47 das respectively in the dy considering sd3 between 7 and 26 das and between 83 and 103 das many days without rainfall were verified in the ry the reference evapotranspiration eto ranged from 1 0 to 6 0 mm d 1 with an average eto of 3 7 mm d 1 the average maximum temperature tmax was 27 6 c ranging from 16 9 to 35 4 c the average minimum temperature tmin was 18 2 c ranging from 10 8 to 21 6 c in the dy eto ranged from 1 2

pivobhbv and pivobhalpa for the soybean crop in the four sowing dates in the rainy and dry years comparing both locations pivobhalpa had a greater total rainfall and a better distribution of rainfall during the two years evaluated pivobhbv had longer and more frequent dry spells due to bad rainfall distribution at pivobhbv 40 491 mm of the total rainfall during the ry was concentrated between november 22nd and december 12th and 45 355 mm of the total rainfall during the dy was concentrated between january 3rd and january 1st 3 2 soil hydro physical variables the descriptive statistical analysis of the soil hydro physical variables from the two studied pivots are shown in fig 3 texture is one of the main indicators of soil water retention reichardt 1987 the soil from pivobhbv was classified as clayey with an average clay content of 57 2 with a standard deviation of 11 5 and a coefficient of variation of 20 2 overall soils with high clay contents have greater soil water retention capacity klein et al 2010 the average moisture values for field capacity and permanent wilting point were 41 4 and 25 5 respectively bulk density bd had an average value of 1 01 g cm ³ indicating low compaction in the agricultural layer the awc had an average value of 0 0158 mm m 1 indicating a good storage capacity typical of clayey soils the soil of pivobhalpa was classified as clayey sandy with average clay and sand contents around 45 4 and 45 5 respectively the sand and clay fractions had standard deviation values of 13 6 and 11 0 and coefficient of variation of 29 9 and 24 1 respectively indicating a great variability of these soil properties in the pivot area the average values of fc and pwp were 23 4 and 18 8 respectively the bd had an average value of 1 38 g cm ³ that indicates greater compaction and as a consequence less total porosity with greater restrictions for the growth of the root system and plant development the smaller the growth of the root system the less total volume of soil water is available for plants directly impacting the irrigation frequency awc had an average value of 0 0063 mm m 1 a characteristic value of sandy textured soils eca had an average value of 31 7 ms m 1 with a standard deviation of 11 9 ms m 1 and a coefficient of variation of 37 5 at pivobhalpa high values of standard deviation and coefficient of variation were found they demonstrate a high variability of soil characteristics meaning that the variables have a greater dispersion around their averages since the irrigation management strategies evaluated in this work are based on the awc value the spatial variability and frequency of awc in each pixel from each study pivot were verified fig 4 from fig 4 it is observed that the soil from the two pivots have different water storage capacities the greatest spatial variability of available soil water content is found in pivobhalpa fig 4b at pivobhbv fig 4a 57 6 of the pixels have awc values ranging from 0 0145 to 0 01 55 mm m 1 based on the total number of pixels from pivobhbv and considering pixels with an area of 25 m2 236 pixels 0 63 have awc values equal to the smallest value 0 0135 mm m 1 189 pixels 0 51 have awc values equal to the average value 0 0152 mm m 1 and only 4 pixels 0 01 have awc values equal to the highest value 0 0189 mm m 1 11 691 pixels 31 3 and 25 311 pixels 68 1 respectively had awc values below and above the average this variability demonstrates that it is impracticable to operationalize the management to meet the reality of each pixel so some areas will always be areas receiving more or less water than the ideal impacting the irrigation efficiency it is not practical to operate a center pivot based on grids of 5 5 m the central idea of this work is to check the benefits of precision irrigation using a very refine grid of 5 5 the soil variability could be better represented with this fine representation the soil variability impact on irrigation management profitability and energy savings could be better understood as long as the grids are aggregate in management zones which is more usual on management important information is lost and the representation of the impacts get worse at pivobhalpa fig 4b 58 07 of the pixels have awc values ranging between 0 0055 and 0 0070 mm m 1 in 228 pixels 0 45 awc values were equal to the smallest value 0 0042 mm m 1 1890 pixels 3 70 have awc values equal to the average value 0 0064 mm m 1 and 179 pixels 0 35 have awc values equal to the highest value 0 0089 mm m 1 22 331 pixels 44 1 and 26 428 pixels 52 2 respectively had awc values below and above the average 3 3 energy savings potential fig 5 shows the average energy requirement per hectare for pi and cm in the four sowing dates of the soybean crop in a rainy and a dry year it can be seen in fig 5a that at pivobhbv in ry the average required energy during the crop cycle ranged from 700 kwh ha 1 in cm3 to 810 kwh ha 1 in cm1 in dy the average required energy during the crop cycle ranged from 990 kwh ha 1 in cm3 to 1090 kwh ha 1 in cm2 the smallest required energy was found in the cm3 note that the average required energy in the dy was 25 0 higher than the average required energy in the ry in cm1 26 6 in cm2 29 3 in cm3 and 27 1 in pi at pivobhalpa fig 5b for the ry and dy the highest average required energy was found in cm1 being respectively equal to 1160 and 1520 kwh ha 1 in the ry the smallest differences in the average required energy were found between the cm2 and pi managements at pivobhalpa the average required energy in the dy was 23 7 higher than the average required energy in ry in cm1 22 3 in cm2 38 4 in cm3 and 25 7 in pi analyzing fig 6 with the management adopted it is noted that the average total irrigation depth in pi was more similar to the one in cm2 the highest values were found in cm1 and the lowest in cm3 considering both pivots the average required energy in pivobhalpa is about 29 4 higher than in pivobhbv in ry and 28 5 in dy fig 6 shows the energy savings potential calculated by the difference of the total energy required between the pi condition and the cm management considering the four sowing dates of the soybean crop in one rainy year and one dry year there will be energy savings potential when the energy required in a given pixel is greater than the calculated energy required in pi in cm1 by analyzing the energy savings potential from pivobhbv fig 6a it can be noted that the use of pi resulted in energy savings in the four sowing dates of the ry in sd3 the highest esp value was 6824 kwh corresponding to 10 7 of the total energy consumption in the soybean cycle with pi sd1 had an esp of 6345 kwh 7 7 sd2 of 3034 kwh 3 7 and sd4 of 1139 kwh 2 0 for cm2 the highest esp was in sd2 with an esp of 6335 kwh 7 6 in sd1 sd3 and sd4 respectively the esp were 2626 483 and 2631 kwh 3 2 0 8 and 4 6 as for cm3 the use of pi had an esp in sd2 and sd4 of 2162 and 1139 kwh 2 6 and 2 0 respectively in dy cm1 had the highest esp in sd4 of 8578 kwh 8 9 sd1 obtained an esp of 2022 kwh 1 6 in sd2 the esp was 2476 kwh 2 8 and in sd3 it was 2530 kwh 3 1 regarding cm2 the use of pi caused esp in all sowing dates and sd2 and sd4 had the highest values of 7291 and 5983 kwh 8 2 and 6 2 respectively in sd1 and sd3 esp was respectively 2022 and 2530 kwh 1 6 and 3 1 as for cm3 the use of pi caused the greatest energy savings potential in sd1 with an esp value of 5422 kwh 4 3 while sd2 and sd4 had respectively 1329 and 1551 kwh 1 5 and 1 6 at pivobhalpa fig 6b in ry the use of pi over cm1 resulted in energy savings in all conditions the highest esps happened in sd2 and sd4 with values of 26 606 and 27 387 kwh respectively corresponding to 25 3 and 18 3 of the total energy consumption in the soybean cycle with pi the other sowing dates had lower esps sd2 had esp of 7570 kwh 6 1 and sd3 of 14 231 kwh 10 7 as for cm2 the highest esp was in sd3 of 4592 kwh 3 5 in sd1 sd2 and sd4 respectively the esps were 1711 3532 and 2282 kwh 1 6 2 8 and 1 5 regarding cm3 the highest esp was 69 kwh 0 1 in sd1 the other sowing dates did not have esp in dy cm1 had esp in all conditions and sd2 and sd4 had the highest values equal to 22 693 and 28 391 kwh respectively which corresponds to 14 2 and 17 9 of the total energy consumption in the soybean cycle with pi sd1 had an esp of 15 100 kwh 7 1 and sd3 of 16 123 kwh 10 2 regarding cm2 the highest values of esps were in sd2 and sd1 respectively equal to 5254 and 1131 kwh 3 3 and 0 5 in sd3 and sd4 the use of pi did not result in esp as for cm3 the highest esps were 5445 and 1131 kwh 3 4 and 0 5 in sd4 and sd1 respectively sd2 had an esp of 118 kwh 0 1 and sd3 did not have esp at pivobhbv the average esps considering cm1 cm2 and cm3 irrigation management strategies were 4336 3019 and 1651 kwh 6 0 4 0 and 2 3 in the ry and 3901 4457 and 2767 kwh 4 1 4 8 and 2 5 in the dy respectively at pivobhalpa the average esps considering the cm1 cm2 and cm3 respectively were 18 948 3278 and 69 kwh 15 1 2 6 and 0 1 in the ry and 20 577 2185 and 3288 kwh 12 3 1 3 and 2 0 in the dy considering the average esp per year the dy has a higher esp than the ry since the use of water in the dy is higher in all management strategies especially in the cm strategies at pivobhbv the average esp was 3002 kwh 4 1 in ry and 3709 kwh 3 8 in dy at pivobhalpa the average esp was 7432 kwh 5 9 in ry and 8683 kwh 5 2 in dy comparing the results obtained in the two center pivots analyzed in this study esp obtained in pivobhalpa was 2 5 times higher than pivobhbv during ry and 2 3 times higher during dy this can be explained by a combination of factors the main factor however is related to the time of rainfall occurrence if rainfall occurs before the time when irrigation would be applied it can reduce or even avoid the need for irrigation which as consequence will contribute to save energy demand 3 4 increased profitability potential the average production cost of soybean obtained from conab 2019 for the region of brasília df pivobhbv and são paulo sp pivobhalpa is shown in table 4 the average production costs for the year 2019 for pivobhbv and pivobhalpa were 3960 64 and 3740 07 r ha 1 respectively fig 7 shows the increased profitability potential ipp achieved using pi over cm simulated for four sowing dates of the soybean crop in rainy and dry years at pivobhbv fig 7a in ry cm1 had the greatest increased profitability potential with the use of pi in sd1 and sd4 with values of 17 4 and 6 5 r 18 378 80 and r 6845 82 respectively in sd2 the ipp was 2 4 r 2522 27 and in sd3 it was 1 3 r 1353 13 in cm2 the highest ipp was also in sd1 and sd4 with values of 29 0 and 13 5 r 30 601 39 and r 14 247 49 respectively in sd2 the ipp was 0 9 r 933 24 and in sd3 it was 6 6 r 6970 68 cm3 had the highest values of ipps due to the losses in crop yield observed in this management strategy the ipps from cm3 were 106 2 r 112 229 35 in sd3 and 28 2 13 6 and 55 8 r 29 788 91 r 14 354 64 and r 58 996 99 in sd1 sd2 and sd4 respectively the high percentages of increased profitability found in cm3 mainly in sd3 can be explained by the total revenue which was negative 6 2 in this specific case this means that the production cost was higher than the total revenue in other words there was no profit but a loss in dy cm1 had the highest ipps in sd2 and sd3 being respectively equal to 17 1 and 11 6 r 18 028 26 and r 12 238 31 in sd1 the ipp was 1 8 r 1868 79 and in sd4 it was 5 7 r 6014 55 in cm2 the highest ipps occurred in sd3 and sd4 being respectively equal to 9 2 and 9 7 r 9769 63 and r 10 276 82 in sd1 the ipp obtained was 1 1 r 1145 81 and 0 04 r 43 38 in sd2 the increased profitability potential due to the use of pi in the cm3 was expressive in sd2 sd3 and sd4 respectively equal to 44 4 67 1 and 33 8 r 46 903 95 r 70 830 40 and r 35 673 46 at pivobhalpa fig 7b cm1 had a crop yield similar to the one with the use of pi therefore the total revenue was not significantly reduced by the adoption of the cm1 strategy resulting in ipp values equal or very close to zero in ry the most expressive ipp in cm1 was in sd2 0 8 r 1363 26 in sd1 the ipp was 0 02 r 32 91 in sd3 it was 0 01 r 13 88 and in sd4 it was 0 02 r 28 07 cm2 had the highest ipp in sd1 with a value of 16 1 r 26 668 53 and in sd4 with a value of 12 8 r 21 221 13 in sd2 ipp was 2 9 r 4798 67 and in sd3 it was 1 8 r 2954 49 at this pivot the highest ipps were also in cm3 comparing with cm3 the use of pi caused ipp of 95 6 96 8 73 5 and 48 0 r 158 340 25 r 160 359 50 r 121 678 45 and r 79 470 88 in the sd1 sd2 sd3 and sd4 respectively in dy and cm1 the most expressive ipp was in sd3 equal to 2 4 r 4003 29 in sd1 the ipp was 0 05 r 80 07 in sd2 it was 0 06 r 86 96 and in sd4 it was 0 04 r 66 82 in cm2 the highest ipps were in sd4 26 7 r 44 172 35 in sd3 19 1 r 31 659 82 and in sd1 13 4 r 22 252 57 in sd2 the ipp was equal to 5 5 r 9039 39 in cm3 ipp was considerably expressive in sd3 with an ipp of 62 5 r 103 480 93 in this particular case the total revenue from cm3 was very close to the total production cost and as a result the profit was much lower than expected in sd2 sd1 and sd4 respectively the ipps were 30 8 19 1 and 4 5 r 51 000 87 r 31 612 40 and r 7509 78 at pivobhbv the average ipp from cm1 cm2 and cm3 were 6 9 12 5 and 51 0 r 7275 00 r 13 188 20 and r 53 842 47 in the ry and 9 0 5 0 and 36 3 r 9537 48 r 5308 91 and r 38 359 68 in the dy respectively at pivobhalpa the average ipp from cm1 cm2 and cm3 were 0 2 8 4 and 78 5 r 359 53 r 13 910 70 and r 129 962 27 in the ry and 0 6 16 2 and 29 2 r 1059 29 r 26 781 04 and r 48 400 99 in the dy respectively regarding the cm strategies cm3 had the highest ipp indicating that the reduction in crop yield caused by cm3 resulted in a very expressive drop in profit comparing the two years analyzed higher ipp values are found in the ry ry has greater rainfall that reduces the amount and frequency of irrigation impacting the energy consumption which is one of the highest costs associated with the total production cost in the dy the irrigation demand increases and consequently the quantity and frequency of irrigation increases the average values of ipp in the ry were 18 8 r 18 961 18 and 22 0 r 36 390 60 while in the dy they were 12 9 r 13 653 19 and 12 0 r 19 813 43 considering pivobhbv and pivobhalpa respectively comparing both pivots pi showed a greater potential for increased profitability in pivobhalpa due to its greater spatial variability of soil characteristics pivobhalpa had an ipp 1 9 times higher than in pivobhbv during the ry and 1 5 times during the dy in studies carried out by yari et al 2017 under field conditions comparing the use of precision irrigation with conventional irrigation management a reduction in the energy cost of 15 3 and 21 3 was found during the 2013 and 2014 seasons and 17 in 2015 4 conclusions precision irrigation despite being recent and still little studied has great potential to increase the economic return on the rural property with the reduction of energy consumption in this work simulations were carried out in the area of two center pivots irrigated to evaluate the potential for increased profitability and energy savings with the use of precision irrigation the results obtained showed important benefits of irrigation management considering soil water variability the energy required in the soybean crop cycle was on average equal to 1051 kwh ha 1 the average energy savings potential using precision irrigation was equal to 4 8 5706 5 kwh for the conditions analyzed it was found that the use of precision irrigation can reach energy savings potentials of up to 25 3 the average potential for increased profitability with the use of precision irrigation was equal to 16 4 r 22 204 60 for the conditions analyzed it was found that the use of precision irrigation can reach increased profitability potentials of up to 106 2 funding this study was funded in part by the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa cerrados brazil the

then quantified using a quantifluor st fluorometer promega usa the purified amplified products of equal molecular weight were assembled and sequenced on an illumina miseq platform allwegene beijing following the standard protocol 2 300 for paired end sequencing an illumina hiseq platform allwegene beijing was used for high throughput sequencing the raw sequencing data were filtered and pruned using preprocessing and information of sequence data prinseq and moetur tools the uclust tool in quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime was used to conduct a cluster analysis on sequences with a sequence similarity threshold of 97 and operational taxonomic units otus with biological significance were classified based on the species annotation in the greengenes 16 s rrna database 2 3 sequencing data processing the observed otu index was used to compare species richness among treatments and the shannon index was used to compare community diversity among treatments the above indexes were calculated using mothur software version 1 30 2 to compare between sample variation in the composition of the total microbial community unweighted unifrac distances were calculated using the qiime pipeline spearman correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the relationships between environmental factors and microbial phyla and the composition of microbial species was explored by constructing a heatmap in r version 3 2 5 for statistics and mapping t tests were conducted to evaluate the significance of differences in the abundances of species between groups principal component

experimental data were expressed as the mean values of triplicate data and graphs containing these data were constructed using origin 8 0 software structural equation modeling sem with microbial communities soil properties and nitrogen transformation as variables was used to clarify the direct and indirect effect pathways in rstudio version 1 4 1717 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial community diversity after removing low quality sequences chimeras and non specific amplified sequences using the sequence information preprocessing software prinseq and moetur qiime software was used to extract the non repeated sequences from the optimized sequences and obtained a total of 114 688 otus rstudio software was used to calculate the alpha diversity index of the microbial community including the shannon and observed otu index fig 1 these indexes were the lowest in the control group indicating that the experimental conditions had a significant effect on the structure and abundance of the original microbial community there was a significant difference in the alpha coefficient among all treatments p 0 05 the boxplots of alpha diversity revealed similar patterns the observed otu index and shannon index were highest in group 2 and lowest in group 7 the shannon index was highest in group 1 the alpha diversity index was highest in group 2 and the average values of the observed otu index and shannon index were 2564 03 and 9 83 respectively the alpha diversity index was lowest in group 7 and the average values of the observed otu index and shannon index were 1976 64 and 9 00 respectively these findings indicate that the soil samples of group 2 had a the highest microbial community diversity b the most uniform species distribution and c the largest number of species across different sediment and moisture conditions the opposite pattern was observed for group 7 soil moisture which is critically important for the survival and metabolism of microorganisms affects the diversity of soil microbial communities small changes in the moisture content can affect the flow of both soil microbial matter and energy rietz et al 2003 previous studies sarah et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 have shown that the diversity of the soil microbial community can be significantly enhanced when water conditions are appropriate hou et al 2019 characterized structural changes in microbial communities in the channels of a loess area and found that variation in sediment particle size and content in the soil had a significant effect on the diversity of microbial communities the findings of this study confirms the above conclusions however microbial community diversity varied among groups depending on the moisture contents particle sizes and sediment concentrations p 0 05 the findings indicate that microbial community diversity is highest under 100 wfps 1 sediment concentration and 0 069 mm sediment particle size 3 2 microbial community structure and functional analysis 3 2 1 pca and nmds analysis principal component 1 was correlated with changes in the microbial composition of each sample and explained 35 37 of the variation in the original variables principal component 2 explained 13 23 of the variation in the data the pca and nmds analysis revealed significant differences between the experimental groups and the control group fig 2 and suggested that muddy water irrigation had a significant effect on the microbial communities of air dried soil samples p 0 05 however the sediment particle sizes sediment concentrations and moisture contents had no significant effect on microbial composition and structure indicating that the experimental bacterial communities were similar among groups 3 2 2 distribution of dominant bacterial phyla the effective sequences were classified in samples from all treatments at the phylum level according to the greengenes 16 s rrna database and a total of 56 phyla were detected fig 3 there were no significant differences in the spatial distances between the coordinates of each sample according to the pca and nmds analysis however the relative abundance distribution of each group varied proteobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria chloroflexi and actinobacteria were the most abundant in all treatments in the control group samples proteobacteria and bacteroidetes accounted for 86 15 of all phyla but these two phyla only accounted for 64 68 71 02 of all phyla in the other 16 groups huang et al 2011 reported that proteobacteria is the most abundant group of bacteria in soil and water environments and this finding is consistent with our results microbial community diversity was low in the control group soil samples and microbial diversity and the number of microbial species were high in the treatments the relative abundance of the original flora was reduced which might increase microbial biomass and this was consistent with the results shown in fig 2 according to the results of the previous section the microbial communities of group 2 highest alpha diversity index group 7 lowest alpha diversity index and the original samples were examined in group 2 the top five bacterial phyla were proteobacteria acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes bacteroidetes and chlorocurbacteria with relative abundances of 50 45 13 37 11 23 8 69 and 4 44 respectively in group 7 the top five bacterial phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria and actinobacteria with relative abundances of 53 15 16 64 12 44 8 52 and 2 74 respectively the top five bacterial phyla observed in the control soil samples were proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and firmicutes with relative abundances of 59 34 26 81 3 88 2 60 and 1 94 respectively although proteobacteria was the most abundant in the three groups ck group 2 and group 7 their relative abundance was 8 89 and 6 19 lower in groups 2 and 7 respectively compared with ck the two most abundant bacterial phyla in group 7 were proteobacteria and bacteroidetes these two phyla were also the most abundant in ck and accounted for 86 15 and 70 of all phyla respectively the second most abundant bacterial phylum in the soil samples of group 2 was acidobacteria relative abundance of 13 4 and bacteroidetes was the fourth most abundant phylum relative abundance of 8 69 the four most abundant phyla in the control group and group 7 were proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and actinobacteria the relative abundance of gemmatimonadetes was similar in groups 2 and 7 11 23 and 12 44 respectively this suggests that the low alpha diversity of group 7 was associated with small changes in bacterial community structure p 0 05 the relative abundance of gemmatimonadetes was greater than 10 in all treatments and its relative abundance in the soil samples of the control group was only 1 76 which made it the seventh most abundant phylum this is similar to its average abundance in natural environments debruyn et al 2011 gemmatimonadetes comprise chlorophyll based phototrophic species that can support basic biological processes members of the phylum gemmatimonadetes can adapt to dry soils and have been identified as particularly important species in the dryland ecosystems of north china which suggests that gemmatimonadetes might be sensitive to changes in water conditions and play an important role in globally dominant ecosystems shi et al 2020 debruyn et al 2011 proposed this hypothesis and suggested that the abundance of gemmatimonadetes is negatively correlated with soil moisture there was a significant negative correlation between the relative abundance of this phylum and moisture conditions r 0 5331 p 0 001 the relative abundance of gemmatimadetes has been noted to be high in some studies for example the relative abundance of gematimonadetes is approximately 10 in paddy soil osman et al 2017 another study in the yellow river basin has shown that gematimonadetes is dominant in wetlands 10 wang et al 2020 the above findings coupled with the results of our experiments show that the relative abundances of gematimonadetes are high when moisture conditions are sufficient thus it might play an important role in paddy fields 3 2 3 distribution of dominant bacterial genera bacteria with a relative abundance greater than 1 including 20 bacterial genera such as lysobacter pontibacter gillisia gemmabacter kaistobacter and thiobacillus were selected according to species annotation and abundance information at the genus level for each group of samples microbial community structure was analyzed using a heatmap displaying species abundance and the relative abundances of microbial genera are shown in different shades to reveal microbial community structure and function fig 4 in the control group the dominant bacteria with relative abundance greater than 5 were lysobacter 25 52 gillisia 12 27 kaistobacter 6 93 and pontibacter 5 84 in group 2 highest alpha diversity index the dominant bacteria with relative abundance greater than 3 were kaistobacter 5 41 pontibacter 4 38 unspecified iii1 15 4 15 lysobacter 4 10 unspecified gemm 5 3 95 unspecified ds 18 3 92 thiobacillus 3 47 and unspecified gemm 1 3 06 in group 7 lowest alpha diversity index the dominant genera with relative abundance greater than 4 were pontibacter 7 72 lysobacter 7 34 unspecified gemm 5 7 24 gillisia 4 93 and kaistobacter 4 86 species diversity at the genus level in group 2 was higher than that in the control group and group 7 the total relative abundance of lysobacter and gillisia in the control group was 37 79 which was much higher than that of other species this accounts for variation in their absolute numbers as well as the uniformity in community structure the number of species was highest in group 2 the proportion of the top eight bacteria was uniform the highest was 5 41 and the lowest was 3 06 differences in the relative abundances among species were small the species richness of group 7 was higher than that of the control group but the uniformity of community structure was less pronounced than that of group 2 and the proportions of the top five bacterial genera significantly differed overlap was observed for 80 of the top five bacterial genera in the control group and group 7 this indicates that although the relative abundance of the original dominant bacterial colony in group 7 decreased its ecological niche remained unchanged however the structure of the top five dominant bacteria in group 2 changed significantly lysobacter which occupied the first two positions in the control group and group 7 was reduced to the fourth position gillisia was no longer the dominant bacterial genus in group 2 this suggests that kaistobacter occupies a wider ecological niche compared with its competitors and gillisia was significantly inhibited in group 2 the abundance of unspecified gemm 5 was high in both groups 2 and 7 but this taxon was not abundant in the control group this might stem from the combined actions of different environmental factors in sum pca and nmds analysis revealed that muddy water irrigation can significantly alter microbial community structure in the soil the relative abundance heatmap at the phylum and genus levels showed that although water management and sediment conditions did not have significant effects on microbial community structure according to pca and nmds analysis differences in phyla and genera were still observed among treatments which indicates that moisture conditions sediment particle sizes and sediment concentrations can affect bacterial community structure 3 3 correlation analysis and sem 3 3 1 correlation analysis of the bacterial community and environmental factors the survival and biological activities of microorganisms are substantially affected by the external environment and community structure and the abundances of species are highly correlated with environmental factors to enhance the understanding of the relationship between the bacterial community and external environmental factors a rda was conducted and a spearman correlation heatmap was built to analyze the relationships between dominant bacterial genera and 12 soil properties at the genus level fig 5 including sbd ph stp enzyme activities urease amo hr and nirs nh4 no3 nitri nitrification rate denitri denitrification rate and the accumulated mineralization rate rda1 and rda2 explained a total of 35 8 of the changes in all strains p 0 001 and the five environmental factors with the strongest effects on microbial community structure were nh4 r2 0 50 p 0 001 no3 r2 0 42 p 0 001 sbd r2 0 42 p 0 001 stp r2 0 42 p 0 001 and denitri r2 0 42 p 0 001 this finding indicates that sbd is the most important factor affecting soil microorganisms after nh4 and no3 significant correlations were observed for 25 bacterial genera including acidobacteria actinobacteria armorobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes nitrohelicobacteria proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia the genera that have direct effects on nitrogen transformation included ramlibacter mesorhizobium azospirillum anaeromyxobacter rubrivivax and candidatus solibacter ramlibacter is a gram negative bacterium within the β proteobacteria class that can reduce nitrate to nitrite at an optimal ph 7 5 and temperature 30 c along with the aid of growth factors because of its structural composition ramlibacter can survive extreme environmental conditions such as long term drought temperature changes and ultraviolet radiation de luca et al 2019 rubrivivax is a gram negative bacterium within the phylum bacteroidetes mesorhizobium and azospirillum are within the class α proteobacteria rubrivivax mesorhizobium and azospirillum can fix nitrogen using different enzymes and compounds nagashima et al 2012 kaneko et al 2002 anaeromyxobacter a gram negative bacterium within the class δ proteobacteria occurs widely in undisturbed and contaminated soils sediments and agricultural soils it can not only reduce n2o to n2 but it can also convert both no3 and no2 to nh4 the metabolic activities of anaeromyxobacter are diverse it can reduce iron nitrate or nitrate to ammonia as well as n2o to n2 anaerobic conditions can have substantial effects on agricultural production soil nutrient cycling and plant microbial interactions anaeromyxobacter grows well under anaerobic conditions because they are not affected by changes in redox conditions and remain active at a ph range of 6 8 5 sanford et al 2002 whole genome sequencing has revealed that candidatus solibacter possesses an abnormally large genome and this has contributed to its ability to rapidly adapt to novel environmental conditions which confers it with a competitive advantage candidatus solibacter produces enzymes to decompose organic carbon in the environment and it contributes to the reduction of both nitrate and nitrite sait et al 2006 it produces a biofilm composed of an organic polysaccharide matrix between soil particles and thus can mitigate moisture and nutrient fluxes in the soil environment pearce et al 2012 four genera have indirect effects on nitrogen conversion limnobacter methylophaga geobacter and gallionella limnobacter and methylophaga are sulfur reducing bacteria srb within the phyla nitrohelicobacteria and verrucobacteria respectively srb are the main bacteria involved in the sulfur cycle in ecosystems which is closely tied to the nitrogen cycle sahinkaya et al 2011 showed that ammonia and sulfate in wastewater can act as electron donors and acceptors respectively in the simultaneous denitrification and sulfur removal under anaerobic conditions geobacter is an iron reducing bacterium within the class δ proteobacteria and the order sulfuromonas microbial driven anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox coupled iron reduction process known as feammox has been documented to occur in the natural environment yang et al 2012 the main drivers of the anammox process are iron reducing bacteria and the microorganism mediated iron reduction process is an important geochemical process that contributes to the degradation of organic matter and plays a key role in shaping the distribution of trace elements and nutrients which indicates that geobacter might be responsible for the nitrogen cycle gallionella is an iron oxidizing and chemolithotrophic bacterium within the class β proteobacteria and order nitrosomonas that can oxidize nh4 to no2 azospirillum limnobacter methylophaga geobacter and gallionella are nitrogen related genera that were significantly correlated with sbd and stp the relative abundances of all other bacteria were significantly affected by ph with the exception of geobacter and this might be explained by their special metabolic and structural features the nitrification rate was not significantly correlated with rubrivivax ramlibacter and gallionella and the denitrification rate was not significantly correlated with candidatus solibacter mesorhizobium and gallionella the mineralization rate was significantly correlated with anaeromyxobacter rubrivivax candidatus solibacter ramlibacter and mesorhizobium all genera were significantly correlated with nh4 with the exception of methylophaga and gallionella all genera were significantly correlated with no3 these findings indicated that ph nh4 and no3 had the strongest effects on the relative abundances of nitrogen related bacterial genera mesorhizobium was negatively correlated with hr activity limnobacter methylophaga and geobacter were significantly correlated with amo activity p 0 05 3 3 2 network analysis of dominant genera and sem the results of the network analysis of the top 30 bacterial species at the genus level are shown in fig 6 correlation coefficients were calculated among bacterial species to identify symbiotic relationships in each treatment p 0 05 r 0 6 the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria chlorobi and nitrospirae the three most abundant genera within the phylum proteobacteria were lysobacter kaistobacter and thiobacillus the two most abundant genera within bacteroidetes were pontibacter and gillisia there were four unspecified genera within the phylum gemmatimonadetes and gemm 5 was the most abundant there were four abundant unspecified genera within the phylum acidobacteria and unspecified ignavibactriaceae and nitrospira were the only genera within the phyla chlorobi and nitrospirae respectively most genera within the phylum proteobacteria were positively correlated with the other phyla lysobacter was positively correlated with pontibacter unspecified gemm 5 unspecified gemm 3 and an unspecified genus two unspecified genera within the phylum acidobacteria were positively correlated with each other as well as with proteobacteria nitrospira was positively correlated with unspecified gemm 1 within the phylum gemmatimonadetes the genus unspecified ignavibactriaceae from chlorobi was negatively correlated with lysobacter from the phylum proteobacteria and the genus gillisia from the phylum bacteroidetes was negatively correlated with an unspecified genus from the phylum proteobacteria these findings indicate that most of the relationships among dominant genera are symbiotic a few competitive relationships were observed among genera from bacteroidetes and chlorobi nitrospira are involved in the nitrification process and can oxidize nitrite to nitrate members of them such as comammox even can conduct both ammonia and nitrite oxidation which makes them important nitrogen related bacteria li et al 2022 sem is a statistical approach that employs a series of linear equations to characterize the relationships between observed variables and potential variables as well as between potential variables cao et al 2017 the relationships between potential variables i e soil properties microbial community and nitrogen transformation and their observed variables were evaluated according to the correlations between the bacterial community and environmental factors nitrogen related genera were estimated via the sum of the relative abundance of the top 200 most relevant genera including methylophaga ramlibacter anaeromyxobacter geobacter candidatus solibacter gallionella and rubrivivax the structural equation model explained the observed changes well cfi 1 00 gif 0 858 rmr 0 008 rmsea 0 000 p 0 640 sem revealed that soil properties had a significant effect on both nitrogen transformation and the microbial community p 0 05 nitrogen transformation had no significant effect on the microbial community and there was no strong correlation between them fig 7 yang et al 2019 studied the effects of grassland soil texture on soil microorganisms through sem analysis and found that sbd can have a direct effect on soil respiration and soil organic carbon and sbd has a significant positive and direct effect on the shannon index of bacterial taxa previous studies have shown that soil properties have a substantial effect on the soil nitrogen content liu et al 2021 the findings of these previous studies are consistent with the results of our study azospirillum limnobacter methylophaga geobacter and gallionella were the five nitrogen related genera identified from 25 genera associated with sbd this suggests that sbd has an indirect effect on nitrogen conversion by affecting nitrogen related microorganisms there was a significant correlation between non nitrogen related microorganisms and nitrogen related microorganisms suggesting that the microbial community might affect the nitrogen transformation process through its effects on nitrogen related bacteria 4 conclusion in this study 16 s rrna sequencing was used to characterize the effect of different sediment particle sizes sediment concentrations and moisture conditions on the microbial communities of paddy soils in the yellow river basin muddy water irrigation significantly increased the diversity of soil microorganisms the optimal conditions for maximizing alpha diversity were 100 wfps 1 sediment concentration and 0 069 mm particle size proteobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria chloroflexi and actinobacteria were the main phyla in all treatments muddy water irrigation significantly altered the structure of the microbial community but the differences between treatment groups were not marked rda revealed that sbd was the most important factor affecting soil microorganisms with the exception of nh4 and no3 the correlation analysis showed that ph nh4 and no3 were most closely related to the relative abundance of nitrogen related genera azospirillum limnobacter methylophaga ramlibacter mesorhizobium anaeromyxobacter geobacter candidatus solibacter gallionella and rubrivivax were the main nitrogen related genera in all treatments among the 10 nitrogen related genera azospirillum limnobacter methylophaga geobacter and gallionella were significantly correlated with sbd and stp sem revealed that sbd and ph were the most important factors affecting nitrogen transformation and the microbial community and no3 nh4 and the nitrification rate were the main factors affecting the microbial community sbd might have an indirect effect on the soil nitrogen conversion process by affecting nitrogen related microbial communities an incubation experiment was used to study the effects of sediment particle sizes sediment concentrations and moisture conditions on soil microbial communities although an examination of the role of plants on soil microorganisms was beyond the scope of our study our findings still provide new insights into the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in the yellow river basin and could aid the development of water and sediment management strategies in this region however soil properties are affected by various factors and soil texture will change gradually with muddy water irrigation additional studies of this dynamic process are needed to clarify various outstanding issues declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

mesorhizobium anaeromyxobacter geobacter candidatus solibacter gallionella and rubrivivax were the most abundant nitrogen related genera across all treatments soil bulk density sbd was significantly correlated with azospirillum limnobacter methylophaga geobacter and gallionella alpha diversity was highest in the treatment with 100 wfps 1 sediment concentration and 0 069 mm particle size ph nh4 and no3 were most closely related to the relative abundance of nitrogen related genera according to correlation analysis redundancy analysis rda showed that sbd was the most important factor affecting soil microorganisms however nh4 and no3 also had substantial effects on soil microorganisms structural equation modeling revealed that sbd and ph were the most important factors affecting nitrogen transformation and the microbial community however no3 nh4 and the nitrification rate also had significant effects overall the results indicate that muddy water irrigation can be used to enhance the diversity of the soil microbial community the findings will also aid future research examining the effects of moisture and sediment variables on soil microbial communities in the yellow river basin

chen et al 2012 muddy water irrigation is considered an economical as well as intensive approach for utilizing the water resources in this area traditional irrigation is considered the most cost effective alternative to drip or sprinkler irrigation because of the topographical complexity of the yellow river basin as well as its high costs han et al 2021 muddy water irrigation has become a critically important approach for managing freshwater and sediment resources especially in arid and semi arid regions of northwestern china guo et al 2015 yang et al 2017 however few studies have systematically characterized the effects of different sediment conditions coupled with different moisture conditions on the soil microbial communities of paddy fields in the yellow river basin here an orthogonal experimental design was used to clarify the effects of sediment particle sizes the concentrations of different sediments and moisture conditions on soil microbial communities and nitrogen

sequencing data processing the observed otu index was used to compare species richness among treatments and the shannon index was used to compare community diversity among treatments the above indexes were calculated using mothur software version 1 30 2 to compare between sample variation in the composition of the total microbial community unweighted unifrac distances were calculated using the qiime pipeline spearman correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the relationships between environmental factors and microbial phyla and the composition of microbial species was explored by

microbial community diversity after removing low quality sequences chimeras and non specific amplified sequences using the sequence information preprocessing software prinseq and moetur qiime software was used to extract the non repeated sequences from the optimized sequences and obtained a total of 114 688 otus rstudio software was used to calculate the alpha diversity index of the microbial community including the shannon and observed otu index fig 1 these indexes were the lowest in the control group indicating that the experimental conditions had a significant effect on the structure and abundance of the original microbial community there was a significant difference in the alpha coefficient among all treatments p 0 05 the boxplots of alpha diversity revealed similar patterns the observed otu index and shannon index were highest in group 2 and lowest in group 7 the shannon index was highest in group 1 the alpha diversity index was highest in group 2 and the average values of the observed otu index and shannon index were 2564 03 and 9 83 respectively the alpha diversity index was lowest in group 7 and the average values of the observed otu index and shannon index were 1976 64 and 9 00 respectively these findings indicate that the soil samples of group 2 had a the highest microbial community diversity b the most uniform species distribution and c the largest number of species across different sediment and moisture conditions the opposite pattern was observed for group 7 soil moisture which is critically important for the survival and metabolism of microorganisms affects the diversity of soil microbial communities small changes in the moisture content can affect the flow of both soil microbial matter and energy rietz et al 2003 previous studies sarah et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 have shown that the diversity of the soil microbial community can be significantly enhanced when water conditions are appropriate hou et al 2019 characterized structural changes in microbial communities in the channels of a loess area and found that variation in sediment particle size and content in the soil had a significant effect on the diversity of microbial communities the findings of this study confirms the above conclusions however microbial community diversity varied among groups depending on the moisture contents particle sizes and sediment concentrations p 0 05 the findings indicate that microbial community diversity is highest under 100 wfps 1 sediment concentration and 0 069 mm sediment particle size 3 2 microbial community structure and functional analysis 3 2 1 pca and nmds analysis principal component 1 was correlated with changes in the microbial composition of each sample and explained 35 37 of the variation in the original variables principal component 2 explained 13 23 of the variation in the data the pca and nmds analysis revealed significant differences between the experimental groups and the control group fig 2 and suggested that muddy water irrigation had a significant effect on the microbial communities of air dried soil samples p 0 05 however the sediment particle sizes sediment concentrations and moisture contents had no significant effect on microbial composition and structure indicating that the experimental bacterial communities were similar among groups 3 2 2 distribution of dominant bacterial phyla the effective sequences were classified in samples from all treatments at the phylum level according to the greengenes 16 s rrna database and a total of 56 phyla were detected fig 3 there were no significant differences in the spatial distances between the coordinates of each sample according to the pca and nmds analysis however the relative abundance distribution of each group varied proteobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria chloroflexi and actinobacteria were the most abundant in all treatments in the control group samples proteobacteria and bacteroidetes accounted for 86 15 of all phyla but these two phyla only accounted for 64 68 71 02 of all phyla in the other 16 groups huang et al 2011 reported that proteobacteria is the most abundant group of bacteria in soil and water environments and this finding is consistent with our results microbial community diversity was low in the control group soil samples and microbial diversity and the number of microbial species were high in the treatments the relative abundance of the original flora was reduced which might increase microbial biomass and this was consistent with the results shown in fig 2 according to the results of the previous section the microbial communities of group 2 highest alpha diversity index group 7 lowest alpha diversity index and the original samples were examined in group 2 the top five bacterial phyla were proteobacteria acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes bacteroidetes and chlorocurbacteria with relative abundances of 50 45 13 37 11 23 8 69 and 4 44 respectively in group 7 the top five bacterial phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria and actinobacteria with relative abundances of 53 15 16 64 12 44 8 52 and 2 74 respectively the top five bacterial phyla observed in the control soil samples were proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria acidobacteria and firmicutes with relative abundances of 59 34 26 81 3 88 2 60 and 1 94 respectively although proteobacteria was the most abundant in the three groups ck group 2 and group 7 their relative abundance was 8 89 and 6 19 lower in groups 2 and 7 respectively compared with ck the two most abundant bacterial phyla in group 7 were proteobacteria and bacteroidetes these two phyla were also the most abundant in ck and accounted for 86 15 and 70 of all phyla respectively the second most abundant bacterial phylum in the soil samples of group 2 was acidobacteria relative abundance of 13 4 and bacteroidetes was the fourth most abundant phylum relative abundance of 8 69 the four most abundant phyla in the control group and group 7 were proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and actinobacteria the relative abundance of gemmatimonadetes was similar in groups 2 and 7 11 23 and 12 44 respectively this suggests that the low alpha diversity of group 7 was associated with small changes in bacterial community structure p 0 05 the relative abundance of gemmatimonadetes was greater than 10 in all treatments and its relative abundance in the soil samples of the control group was only 1 76 which made it the seventh most abundant phylum this is similar to its average abundance in natural environments debruyn et al 2011 gemmatimonadetes comprise chlorophyll based phototrophic species that can support basic biological processes members of the phylum gemmatimonadetes can adapt to dry soils and have been identified as particularly important species in the dryland ecosystems of north china which suggests that gemmatimonadetes might be sensitive to changes in water conditions and play an important role in globally dominant ecosystems shi et al 2020 debruyn et al 2011 proposed this hypothesis and suggested that the abundance of gemmatimonadetes is negatively correlated with soil moisture there was a significant negative correlation between the relative abundance of this phylum and moisture conditions r 0 5331 p 0 001 the relative abundance of gemmatimadetes has been noted to be high in some studies for example the relative abundance of gematimonadetes is approximately 10 in paddy soil osman et al 2017 another study in the yellow river basin has shown that gematimonadetes is dominant in wetlands 10 wang et al 2020 the above findings coupled with the results of our experiments show that the relative abundances of gematimonadetes are high when moisture conditions are sufficient thus it might play an important role in paddy fields 3 2 3 distribution of dominant bacterial genera bacteria with a relative abundance greater than 1 including 20 bacterial genera such as lysobacter pontibacter gillisia gemmabacter kaistobacter and thiobacillus were selected according to species annotation and abundance information at the genus level for each group of samples microbial community structure was analyzed using a heatmap displaying species abundance and the relative abundances of microbial genera are shown in different shades to reveal microbial community structure and function fig 4 in the control group the dominant bacteria with relative abundance greater than 5 were lysobacter 25 52 gillisia 12 27 kaistobacter 6 93 and pontibacter 5 84 in group 2 highest alpha diversity index the dominant bacteria with relative abundance greater than 3 were kaistobacter 5 41 pontibacter 4 38 unspecified iii1 15 4 15 lysobacter 4 10 unspecified gemm 5 3 95 unspecified ds 18 3 92 thiobacillus 3 47 and unspecified gemm 1 3 06 in group 7 lowest alpha diversity index the dominant genera with relative abundance greater than 4 were pontibacter 7 72 lysobacter 7 34 unspecified gemm 5 7 24 gillisia 4 93 and kaistobacter 4 86 species diversity at the genus level in group 2 was higher than that in the control group and group 7 the total relative abundance of lysobacter and gillisia in the control group was 37 79 which was much higher than that of other species this accounts for variation in their absolute numbers as well as the uniformity in community structure the number of species was highest in group 2 the proportion of the top eight bacteria was uniform the highest was 5 41 and the lowest was 3 06 differences in the relative abundances among species were small the species richness of group 7 was higher than that of the control group but the uniformity of community structure was less pronounced than that of group 2 and the proportions of the top five bacterial genera significantly differed overlap was observed for 80 of the top five bacterial genera in the control group and group 7 this indicates that although the relative abundance of the original dominant bacterial colony in group 7 decreased its ecological niche remained unchanged however the structure of the top five dominant bacteria in group 2 changed significantly lysobacter which occupied the first two positions in the control group and group 7 was reduced to the fourth position gillisia was no longer the dominant bacterial genus in group 2 this suggests that kaistobacter occupies a wider ecological niche compared with its competitors and gillisia was significantly inhibited in group 2 the abundance of unspecified gemm 5 was high in both groups 2 and 7 but this taxon was not abundant in the control group this might stem from the combined actions of different environmental factors in sum pca and nmds analysis revealed that muddy water irrigation can significantly alter microbial community structure in the soil the relative abundance heatmap at the phylum and genus levels showed that although water management and sediment conditions did not have significant effects on microbial community structure according to pca and nmds analysis differences in phyla and genera were still observed among treatments which indicates that moisture conditions sediment particle sizes and sediment concentrations can affect bacterial community structure 3 3 correlation analysis and sem 3 3 1 correlation analysis of the bacterial community and environmental factors the survival and biological activities of microorganisms are substantially affected by the external environment and community structure and the abundances of species are highly correlated with environmental factors to enhance the understanding of the relationship between the bacterial community and external environmental factors a rda was conducted and a spearman correlation heatmap was built to analyze the relationships between dominant bacterial genera and 12 soil properties at the genus level fig 5 including sbd ph stp enzyme activities urease amo hr and nirs nh4 no3 nitri nitrification rate denitri denitrification rate and the accumulated mineralization rate rda1 and rda2 explained a total of 35 8 of the changes in all strains p 0 001 and the five environmental factors with the strongest effects on microbial community structure were nh4 r2 0 50 p 0 001 no3 r2 0 42 p 0 001 sbd r2 0 42 p 0 001 stp r2 0 42 p 0 001 and denitri r2 0 42 p 0 001 this finding indicates that sbd is the most important factor affecting soil microorganisms after nh4 and no3 significant correlations were observed for 25 bacterial genera including acidobacteria actinobacteria armorobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes nitrohelicobacteria proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia the genera that have direct effects on nitrogen transformation included ramlibacter mesorhizobium azospirillum anaeromyxobacter rubrivivax and candidatus solibacter ramlibacter is a gram negative bacterium within the β proteobacteria class that can reduce nitrate to nitrite at an optimal ph 7 5 and temperature 30 c along with the aid of growth factors because of its structural composition ramlibacter can survive extreme environmental conditions such as long term drought temperature changes and ultraviolet radiation de luca et al 2019 rubrivivax is a gram negative bacterium within the phylum bacteroidetes mesorhizobium and azospirillum are within the class α proteobacteria rubrivivax mesorhizobium and azospirillum can fix nitrogen using different enzymes and compounds nagashima et al 2012 kaneko et al 2002 anaeromyxobacter a gram negative bacterium within the class δ proteobacteria occurs widely in undisturbed and contaminated soils sediments and agricultural soils it can not only reduce n2o to n2 but it can also convert both no3 and no2 to nh4 the metabolic activities of anaeromyxobacter are diverse it can reduce iron nitrate or nitrate to ammonia as well as n2o to n2 anaerobic conditions can have substantial effects on agricultural production soil nutrient cycling and plant microbial interactions anaeromyxobacter grows well under anaerobic conditions because they are not affected by changes in redox conditions and remain active at a ph range of 6 8 5 sanford et al 2002 whole genome sequencing has revealed that candidatus solibacter possesses an abnormally large genome and this has contributed to its ability to rapidly adapt to novel environmental conditions which confers it with a competitive advantage candidatus solibacter produces enzymes to decompose organic carbon in the environment and it contributes to the reduction of both nitrate and nitrite sait et al 2006 it produces a biofilm composed of an organic polysaccharide matrix between soil particles and thus can mitigate moisture and nutrient fluxes in the soil environment pearce et al 2012 four genera have indirect effects on nitrogen conversion limnobacter methylophaga geobacter and gallionella limnobacter and methylophaga are sulfur reducing bacteria srb within the phyla nitrohelicobacteria and verrucobacteria respectively srb are the main bacteria involved in the sulfur cycle in ecosystems which is closely tied to the nitrogen cycle sahinkaya et al 2011 showed that ammonia and sulfate in wastewater can act as electron donors and acceptors respectively in the simultaneous denitrification and sulfur removal under anaerobic conditions geobacter is an iron reducing bacterium within the class δ proteobacteria and the order sulfuromonas microbial driven anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox coupled iron reduction process known as feammox has been documented to occur in the natural environment yang et al 2012 the main drivers of the anammox process are iron reducing bacteria and the microorganism mediated iron reduction process is an important geochemical process that contributes to the degradation of organic matter and plays a key role in shaping the distribution of trace elements and nutrients which indicates that geobacter might be responsible for the nitrogen cycle gallionella is an iron oxidizing and chemolithotrophic bacterium within the class β proteobacteria and order nitrosomonas that can oxidize nh4 to no2 azospirillum limnobacter methylophaga geobacter and gallionella are nitrogen related genera that were significantly correlated with sbd and stp the relative abundances of all other bacteria were significantly affected by ph with the exception of geobacter and this might be explained by their special metabolic and structural features the nitrification rate was not significantly correlated with rubrivivax ramlibacter and gallionella and the denitrification rate was not significantly correlated with candidatus solibacter mesorhizobium and gallionella the mineralization rate was significantly correlated with anaeromyxobacter rubrivivax candidatus solibacter ramlibacter and mesorhizobium all genera were significantly correlated with nh4 with the exception of methylophaga and gallionella all genera were significantly correlated with no3 these findings indicated that ph nh4 and no3 had the strongest effects on the relative abundances of nitrogen related bacterial genera mesorhizobium was negatively correlated with hr activity limnobacter methylophaga and geobacter were significantly correlated with amo activity p 0 05 3 3 2 network analysis of dominant genera and sem the results of the network analysis of the top 30 bacterial species at the genus level are shown in fig 6 correlation coefficients were calculated among bacterial species to identify symbiotic relationships in each treatment p 0 05 r 0 6 the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria chlorobi and nitrospirae the three most abundant genera within the phylum proteobacteria were lysobacter kaistobacter and thiobacillus the two most abundant genera within bacteroidetes were pontibacter and gillisia there were four unspecified genera within the phylum gemmatimonadetes and gemm 5 was the most abundant there were four abundant unspecified genera within the phylum acidobacteria and unspecified ignavibactriaceae and nitrospira were the only genera within the phyla chlorobi and nitrospirae respectively most genera within the phylum proteobacteria were positively correlated with the other phyla lysobacter was positively correlated with pontibacter unspecified gemm 5 unspecified gemm 3 and an unspecified genus two unspecified genera within the phylum acidobacteria were positively correlated with each other as well as with proteobacteria nitrospira was positively correlated with unspecified gemm 1 within the phylum gemmatimonadetes the genus unspecified ignavibactriaceae from chlorobi was negatively correlated with lysobacter from the phylum proteobacteria and the genus gillisia from the phylum bacteroidetes was negatively correlated with an unspecified genus from the phylum proteobacteria these findings indicate that most of the relationships among dominant genera are symbiotic a few competitive relationships were observed among genera from bacteroidetes and chlorobi nitrospira are involved in the nitrification process and can oxidize nitrite to nitrate members of them such as comammox even can conduct both ammonia and nitrite oxidation which makes them important nitrogen related bacteria li et al 2022 sem is a statistical approach that employs a series of linear equations to characterize the relationships between observed variables and potential variables as well as between potential variables cao et al 2017 the relationships between potential variables i e soil properties microbial community and nitrogen transformation and their observed variables were evaluated according to the correlations between the bacterial community and environmental factors nitrogen related genera were estimated via the sum of the relative abundance of the top 200 most relevant genera including methylophaga ramlibacter anaeromyxobacter geobacter candidatus solibacter gallionella and rubrivivax the structural equation model explained the observed changes well cfi 1 00 gif 0 858 rmr 0 008 rmsea 0 000 p 0 640 sem revealed that soil properties had a significant effect on both nitrogen transformation and the microbial community p 0 05 nitrogen transformation had no significant effect on the microbial community and there was no strong correlation between them fig 7 yang et al 2019 studied the effects of grassland soil texture on soil microorganisms through sem analysis and found that sbd can have a direct effect on soil respiration and soil organic carbon and sbd has a significant positive and direct effect on the shannon index of bacterial taxa previous studies have shown that soil properties have a substantial effect on the soil nitrogen content liu et al 2021 the findings of these previous studies are consistent with the results of our study azospirillum limnobacter methylophaga geobacter and gallionella were the five nitrogen related genera identified from 25 genera associated with sbd this suggests that sbd has an indirect effect on nitrogen conversion by affecting nitrogen related microorganisms there was a significant correlation between non nitrogen related microorganisms and nitrogen related microorganisms suggesting that the microbial community might affect the nitrogen transformation process through its effects on nitrogen related bacteria 4 conclusion in this study 16 s rrna sequencing was used to characterize the effect of different sediment particle sizes sediment concentrations and moisture conditions on the microbial communities of paddy soils in the yellow river basin muddy water irrigation significantly increased the diversity of soil microorganisms the optimal conditions for maximizing alpha diversity were 100 wfps 1 sediment concentration and 0 069 mm particle size proteobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria chloroflexi and actinobacteria were the main phyla in all treatments muddy water irrigation significantly altered the structure of the microbial community but the differences between treatment groups were not marked rda revealed that sbd was the most important factor affecting soil microorganisms with the exception of nh4 and no3 the correlation analysis showed that ph nh4 and no3 were most closely related to the relative abundance of nitrogen related genera azospirillum limnobacter methylophaga ramlibacter mesorhizobium anaeromyxobacter geobacter candidatus solibacter gallionella and rubrivivax were the main nitrogen related genera in all treatments among the 10 nitrogen related genera azospirillum limnobacter methylophaga geobacter and gallionella were significantly correlated with sbd and stp sem revealed that sbd and ph were the most important factors affecting nitrogen transformation and the microbial community and no3 nh4 and the nitrification rate were the main factors affecting the microbial community sbd might have an indirect effect on the soil nitrogen conversion process by affecting nitrogen related microbial communities an incubation experiment was used to study the effects of sediment particle sizes sediment concentrations and moisture conditions on soil microbial communities although an examination of the role of plants on soil microorganisms was beyond the scope of our study our findings still provide new insights into the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in the yellow river basin and could aid the development of water and sediment management strategies in this region however soil properties are affected by various factors and soil texture will change gradually with muddy water irrigation additional studies of this dynamic process are needed to clarify various outstanding issues declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

9432,one of the critical factors in the optimal design of drip fertigation systems is determining the distribution of nitrate in the soil handling such a complex non linear process is challenging the main goal of this study is to develop an accurate hybrid boruta random forest brf whale optimization algorithm woa integrated with an artificial neural network ann to estimate the nitrate concentration n o 3 in the distribution system in addition to applying ann and support vector regression svr methods various training algorithms and kernel functions are used as standalone validation models to evaluate the robustness of the woa ann model for nitrate pattern estimation the algorithm uses 11 variables extracted from the experimental study which are optimally arranged in five input combinations employing the brf feature selection fs and regression analyses the statistical and diagnostic analyses showed that the brf fs is the best approach to optimize the woa ann model the proposed approach provided the best metrics i e r 0 962 rmse 0 029 mg l mae 0 024 and u95 0 056 and improved the ann s accuracy by 30 it also outperformed the ann r 0 913 and rmse 0 042 mg l and svr r 0 901 and rmse 0 045 mg l when applied to estimate the n o 3 values an external validation analysis showed the robustness of all applied machine learning models moreover the significant scoring assessment also showed that when using the brf fs approach the initial nitrate concentration in soil n 0 and nitrate concentration in irrigation water f n o 3 had the most influence on the estimation of nitrate pattern respectively keywords artificial neural network drip irrigation boruta random forest nitrate pattern external validation whale optimization algorithm 1 introduction due to accuracy of allocating water and chemicals the drip irrigation system with fertigation supplies has been recognized as a suitable and effective method for supplying water and nutrients according to crop requirements when compared to the conventional systems bar yosef 1999 hanson et al 2006 li et al 2007 li and liu 2011 qiu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 2014 proper management and design of drip irrigation systems are imperative to supply appropriate amounts of water and nutrients to improve efficiency by decreasing the losses of deep percolation and nitrate leaching as an environmental problem in the groundwater che et al 2021 also incorrect management and practice of drip irrigation systems could lead to unsuitable spatial distributions of water and nutrients thereby reducing the expected yield and increasing the groundwater pollution gärdenäs et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 li et al 2007 li and liu 2011 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 as an essential nutrient and a significant component of fertigation different nitrogen compounds are supplied through a drip irrigation system therefore accurate knowledge of water and nitrate dynamics in the soil is needed to reduce nitrate leaching and optimize the fertigation and irrigation strategies guo et al 2017 li et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 recently several researchers have worked on estimating water and nitrate patterns in drip irrigation this is mainly due to the concern associated with the pollution of shallow groundwater and water surface sources caused by the vast application and improper management of nitrogen fertilizers li et al 2007 qiu et al 2017 scherger et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 the dimension of wetted moisture bulb and spatial distribution of soil nitrate concentrations under drip fertigation depends on various parameters such as the soil physical properties e g soil saturated hydraulic conductivity soil bulk density proportions of clay sand and silt soil emitter discharge the volume of applied water emitter installation depth initial moisture content input nitrate concentration in irrigation water and the initial nitrate concentration in the soil gärdenäs et al 2005 granata et al 2016 li et al 2004a li and liu 2011 qiu et al 2017 shiri et al 2020 simulation of the nitrogen distribution is complex due to transformation convection and dispersion processes li et al 2003 there are primarily three categories of studies predicting the water and nitrate distribution namely analytical numerical and empirical models analytical models typically determine the governing flow equations e g richards equation using the specified initial and boundary conditions cook et al 2003 misra et al 1974 mmolawa and or 2000 moncef and khemaies 2016 wagenet et al 1977 numerical model e g hydrus 2d software simunek et al 1999 solat et al 2021 which enables implementation of three dimensional asymmetrical water flow solute transport using the galerkin finite element method for numerical solutions governing the water flow equations deb et al 2016 hanson et al 2006 wang et al 2016 liu et al 2021 empirical models use regression analysis or dimensional analysis to simulate the water and nitrate distribution al ogaidi et al 2016 karimi et al 2022 2020 malek and peters 2011 despite the benefits of the analytical and numerical models they are not always easy to use techniques they are susceptible to the boundary and initial conditions issues and may become unstable they also need significant computing time and a higher level of human skills than other models despite its simplicity each empirical model is applicable in its experimental range and cannot be generalized to other conditions consequently it is desirable to develop and apply appropriate approaches to simulate the water and nitrate distributions with acceptable accuracy and computational costs artificial intelligence ai models are powerful approaches they can provide robust techniques to predict the water and nitrate distribution patterns in the soil profile under fertigation through identifying the inputs and outputs relationships these techniques have been used in many hydrology and water resources

moisture and erosion yavari et al 2018 maroufpoor et al 2019a a literature review shows that limited research has been conducted utilizing intelligent techniques to evaluate the nitrate distribution pattern li et al 2004b hence the present study aims at predicting the nitrate distribution patterns under drip irrigation systems using advanced ai techniques previous investigations indicated limited application of ai approaches to model nitrate distribution patterns under subsurface drip irrigation in contrast various studies have been conducted to simulate nitrate distribution patterns under surface drip irrigation through numerical models therefore the main goal of this study is to apply ai approaches to simulate nitrate distribution under surface and subsurface drip irrigation using various easy to use parameters in this research to accurately estimate the nitrate pattern in drip irrigation systems a new feature selection fs approach comprised of a whale optimization algorithm woa applied to aartificial nneural nnetwork woa ann was developed the woa ann model was also optimized using the boruta random forest brf feature selection brf fs the woa ann performance was compared with a standalone ann and support vector regression svr models using various training algorithms and kernel functions further several features were extracted from the experimental data and optimized according to their importance scores using the brf fs in the form of the five selective input combinations various statistical metrics diagnostic analysis and external validation were performed to evaluate the robustness of proposed machine learning ml based models it should be highlighted that to the best of our knowledge this is the first time this ml based technique is developed and applied for solving non linear irrigation problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental work was conducted at the central laboratory of the college of agricultural and natural resources of the university of tehran iran these experiments were conducted in a 2d lab model elnesr and alazba 2019 indicated that both the 2d and 3d simulations had suitable performance in modeling when the experiment s settings are consistent with the laws of physics the schematic of the sampling is shown in fig 1 the soil container s length width and height used in the experiments are 3 0 5 and 1 22 m respectively plexiglas sheets in a soil container were employed to determine the progression of wetting patterns during the experiment the soil container is divided into three separate sections fig 1 and a type of soil texture was placed in each section table 2 due to the higher horizontal distribution of water in heavy textured soils the length of the heavy soil compartment was considered to be larger than that of the medium textured and the light textured soils the soils were pounded layer by layer 10 cm during the filling of the model according to the bulk density a coarse surface was created using sand and glue on lysimeter walls to prevent preferential flow kandelous and šimůnek 2010 water was moved from a reservoir with a volume of 250 l to the emitter using a pump through polyethylene pipes the main sub main and lateral diameters were 50 20 and 16 mm in this path the following were used a valve to guide and control the flow a filtration system to avoid clogging the emitter a pressure gauge to apply constant pressure of 2 bar in all experiments and an off on valve to control the flow of containers by pass was adopted to regulate the inflow and return excess

nitrate concentration in this study were selected using the n recommended application rate varied between 100 and 300 kg ha for crops che et al 2021 scherger et al 2021 these values are consistent with the research of li et al 2004a urea fertilizer ch4n2o was utilized and injected in the last one third of each irrigation event the reason for choosing urea fertilizer is that it is widely used and it is also known as a safe compound with complete solubility gülser 2005 li et al 2021 piwpuan et al 2013 in total 36 experiments were performed using an irrigation time of 6 h per experiment at the end of each experiment and while emptying the soil from the lysimeter containers soil samples were taken from the points specified in fig 1 14 points with different locations were considered for

behavior of neurons in the brain through mathematically defined functions this method s practical and logical nature makes it useful in classification and prediction issues this model has non linear behavior and can be trained meaning the output are determined by finding the relationship embedded in the process the model is trained using a set of data to calculate the appropriate outputs from inputs according to the relationship found in the training phase among the many examples of neural networks the backward propagation network is the most widely used the neural network consists of layers that have elements with three similar functions called neurons each layer is connected to its previous and subsequent layers the mathematical model of a neural network can be summarized as follows haykin 2009 jamei et al 2020 8 y k ˆ f 0 j 1 m w kj f h i 1 n w ij x i w j 0 w k 0 where n is the total number of neurons in the input layer m is the total number of neurons in the hidden

optimization algorithm woa in 2016 mirjalili and lewis 2016 the social behavior of humpback whales inspired this algorithm the whale algorithm starts with a set of random solutions search agents update their position in each iteration using three operators called encircling prey bubble net attack method exploitation phase and prey search exploration phase in encircling prey humpback whales detect prey and surround it the whale algorithm assumes that the best solution is the prey at each time once the best search agent has been identified other search agents will update their location to the best search agent the following equations express this behavior mirjalili and lewis 2016 9 d c x t x t 10 x t 1 x t a d in the above equations t is the current iteration a and c are the coefficient vectors x is the location vector which is the best solution obtained at the moment x is the location vector and dot means point multiplication element to element it should be noted that if there is a better solution x must be updated in each iteration the equations of a and c vectors are as follows mirjalili and lewis 2016 11 a 2 a r a 12 c 2 r where a decreases linearly from 2 to zero during the iterations in both exploration and exploitation phases and r is a random vector between zero and 1 in the bubble net attack method exploitation phase the humpback whale swims around the prey along a contractile circle and at the same time in a spiral path to model this simultaneous behavior it is assumed that the whale chooses one of the contractile siege mechanisms or the spiral model with a 50 probability to update the whale s position during optimization the mathematical model of this phase is defined as follows mirjalili and lewis 2016 13 x t 1 x t a d if p 0 5 d e bl cos 2 π l x t if p 0 5 where d x t x t and denotes the distance i th whale to the prey the best solution ever obtained b is a constant for defining the shape of a logarithmic helix l is a random number between 1 1 and p is a random number between 0 and 1 vector a is used with random values between 1 and 1 to bring the search agents closer to the reference whale in the search for prey exploration phase instead of using the data of the best search agent random agent selection is used to update the position of the search agent the mathematical model of this process is as follows mirjalili and lewis 2016 14 d c x rand x 15 x t 1 x rand a d x rand is the randomly selected position vector random whale of the current population and vector a is used with random values greater than one or less than 1 to force the search agent to move away from the reference whale fig 2 illustrates the flowchart of the whale optimization algorithm the initial population and the number of iterations for optimization in this study were 45 and 2500 respectively 2 6 boruta random forest feature section optimizer brf kursa et al 2010 proposed the concept of the boruta random forest brf optimizer algorithm to determine the significant features brf algorithm established around the rf algorithm through a wrapper method breiman 2001 recently the brf algorithm has been applied successfully in various fields for example streamflow prediction masrur ahmed et al 2021 and soil moisture forecasting ahmed et al 2021a prasad et al 2019 nevertheless the extensive application of feature selection algorithm has been found in modeling forest bio diversity leutner et al 2012 predicting seabed hardness li et al 2016 and air quality forecasting lyu et al 2017 the overall brf algorithm is summarized in the following steps kursa and rudnicki 2010 step 1 generate a randomly ordered shadow duplicated variable x t for a particular input vector x t step 2 remove correlations and add randomness between

rehamnia et al 2021 shahsavar et al 2021 and root mean square error rmse malik and kumar 2020 have been utilized to evaluate the accuracy of applied hybrid ml models in simulation of nitrate

procedure as already mentioned 298 data points were extracted from the experimental data and the nitrate distribution pattern was measured using 11 predictors i e k s q z r f n o 3 n 0 percentage of clay sand and silt soil ρ b and φ 0 data were randomly divided into training and test sets the training part included 70 of the data 209 and the rest was included in the testing phase all ml models were developed using matlab 2018a environment in a pc with an intel core i7 6700 3 2 3 6 ghz and 8 gb ram furthermore the brf fs was performed using an open source r package and boruta was implemented using a python library the approach workflow is shown in fig 3 selecting the best model inputs in ml based studies where the number of inputs is high has significant impact on the model accuracy and computational cost thus to identify the best input combination for estimating the n o 3 a comprehensive feature selection analysis was conducted using pearson correlation and brf algorithm as a random forest based wrapper process using the pearson correlation coefficient fig 4 demonstrated the linear correlation between all 11 candidate inputs and output parameters as shown in fig 4 the q rp 0 68 f n o 3 rp 0 67 and n0 rp 0 67 showing higher pearson correlation values and sand rp 0 079 and silt rp 0 064 due to the lowest pearson correlation values are identified as the most and the least influential parameters respectively when estimating the n o 3 values to accurately and reliably determine the input combinations the brf fs was implemented to verify the pearson analysis results as aforementioned the median z score s respective features predictors are the critical metrics to confirm or reject them comparing the best median shadow inputs the media z score distributions in fig 5 showes that no predictor is eliminated from the input subsets on basis of a more significant z score 2 88 than those of median shadowmax value thus all predictors combo1 can be considered as input combinations to be studied however due to the differences between their z score values for they can be categorized in terms of significance to identify the most suitable model inputs the brf fs outcomes showed that n0 f n o 3 q φ 0 r and z have z score of higher than 14 meaning these can be considered as the main n o 3 predictors these results are in agreement with the pearson analysis results as the result of the pearson and brf fs analyses the silt and sand parameters are removed from the set of input variables their z score was less than 8 which were identified in the combo 2 then ρ b ks and clay were removed from the list of predictors to form the combo 3 5 respectively table 4 summarizes the chosen input combination to estimate the n o 3 values in order to model the nitrate distribution pattern first the standalone ann method using five training algorithms namely lm gd gda gdx and scg the svr method using three kernel functions namelylinear polynomial and rbf and woa hybrid with ann model were evaluated this exercise identified and used the best ann training algorithm and kernel function for the other combinations in addition to achieve the best performance of each of these ml approachs the trial and error process through sequential running models was adopted to reach the best architecture of the models and optimal hyperparameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 application results and analysis six statistical performance indicators in combo 1 using all predictors were calculated to evaluate the prediction accuracy of ann svr and woa ann models estimating n o 3 in drip irrigation please see table 5 the structure presented in table 4 and 5 for ann shows the number of input parameters hidden layer neurons and output parameters from the network ann models based on the lm training algorithm ann1 and on basis of the highest correlation coefficient r 0 913 and the lowest diagnostic metrics rmse 0 042 mg l tstat 0 747 and u95 0 082 had the best performance in comparison with the ann models followed by ann3 r 0 899 and rmse 0 047 mg l ann5 r 0 899 and rmse 0 046 mg l ann5 ann2 and ann4 respectively at the testing stage further among the svr models svr3 using the rbf kernel function on basis of r 0 901 rmse 0 045 mg l u95 0 087 and si 0 175 was superior to the svr1 r 0 869 rmse 0 052 and svr2 r 0 801 rmse 0 075 respectively woa ann as the main novelty of the present research was used to estimate the n o 3 values it can be seen that in the testing phase the woa ann with 45 population and 2500 iterations model with an architecture similar to the best ann model i e ann1 on basis of r 0 962 rmse 0 029 mg l u95 0 056 and si 0 112 can increase the accuracy by 30 and was identified as the superior predictive ml models fig 6 shows the correlation coefficient and uncertainty variations of all the models in combo 1 the woa ann model achieved r 0 962 and the smallest u95 0 056 outperforming the ann1 and svr3 the scatter plots of measured vs estimated n o 3 values are shownin fig 7 comparing the performance of all the predictive models for combo 1 during the training and testing stages the woa ann model with the least violation of 15 error lines and the closest to the 1 1 line has the best performance among all the studied ml models followed by ann1 and svr3 models based on these results only these three optimal models i e woa ann ann1 and svr3 will be considered at this stage the remaining combinations were examined to validate the predictive performance of the superior models i e woa ann ann1 and svr3 for estimating the n o 3 pattern in drip irrigation table 6 lists all the metrics and optimal architecture setting parameters of these models it can be seen that among the remaining combinations i e combos 2 3 4 and 5 the outcomes of combo 2 outperformed the other combinations with the r rmse and mae average of 0 916 0 041 and 0 034 respectively for estimating the n o 3 pattern in this set the woa ann model achieving r 0 961 and rmse 0 029 improved the accuracy of ann1 by 30 and outperformed the svr3 with r 0 893 and rmse 0 046 for the testing phase likewise the weakest performances are related to combo 5 and 3 with the r and rmse average by 0 875 and 0 0523 and 0 872 and 0 0503 respectively fig 8 shows the spider plots of statistical indicators evaluating the performance of predictive models for the testing phase of combo 2 to combo 5 regarding the multifaceted distribution of the metrics the woa ann model provided the best agreement with the measured datasets in combo 2 and combo 5 compared with the other models in contrast in combo 3 and 4 the svr3 in terms of r 0 892 rmse 0 046 and u95 0 0908 and r 0 899 rmse 0 045 and u95 0 088 had better accuracy than the woa ann and ann1 models respectively fig 9 showes the scatter plots comparing measured and estimated nitrate patterns n o 3 from optimal models in the testing and training phase of combos 2 5 the distribution of estiamted n o 3 levels were compared with the observed data around the line of identity indicating that combo 2 generally shows a better performance than other combos followed by combos 4 3 and 5 respectively in general the woa ann model with the least deviation of the benchmark error lines 15 provided a more reliable estimating of n o 3 than ann1 and svr3 models in order to comprehensively validate the efficiency of the predictive ml approaches a general comparison between the total input combinations and the superior models i e ann1 svr3 and woa ann was conducted to this end the probability distribution function pdf of all selected models in the considered input combinations was compared with the measured values of n o 3 see fig 10 this type of plot shows the probability density of the data at different values usually smoothed by a kernel density estimator in each combination the superior model is distinguished from others using a filled pattern based on the interquartile range iqr q75 q25 metric it is clear that the woa ann model iqr 0 1311 due to its consistency with the measured value iqr 0 1453 outperformed the ann1 iqr 0 1045 and svr3 iqr 0 1245 in addition combo1 and combo 2 provided more promising results than the other approaches the woa ann appraoch provided the most similar distribution pattern in comparison wiht ann1 and svr3 however the svr3 algorithm in combo 3 and combo 4 achieved closer iqr values 0 1287 and 0 1350 respectively to the measured n o 3 iqr 0 1453 performing better than the woa ann and ann1 approaches in addition combo 1 using all predictors was identified as the optimal input combination and was evaluated in the validation stages taylor s diagram has recently been recognized as one of the most efficient multi criterion graphical tools including the correlation coefficient and standard deviation for assessing the robustness of ai models in a quarter circle environment taylor 2001 fig 11 shows the taylor diagrams of the ai based methods applied during the training left panel and testing phases right panel both training and testing results of the prediction methods show that the representation points of the woa ann model by the shortest distance to the reference point giving the best agreement with the measured data points followed by ann1 and svr3 respectively however the ann1 model efficiency was relatively similar to those of the svr3 in the next validation stage the physical expected trend and residual values of each of the ml technique are compared see fig 12 the physical trend extracted from the model showed that the woa ann model could efficiently capture the nonlinearities better than the ann1 and svr3 modelsconfirming its robustness in estimating the nitrate pattern the distribution of the residual values around the benchmark red line indicates that the svr3 method is less accurate than the woa ann and ann1 models the elliptical area marked with a dashed line clearly shows a the better performance of the predictive models supporting the woa ann model superior predictive performancefollowed by the ann1 and svr3 respectively a diagnostic analysis in the form of the scatter diffused plot left panel and violin plot right panel illustrate the distribution of the relative deviation rd of each of the ml approaches see fig 13 the red dot line shows the rd interval between 25 and 25 fig 13 demonstrats the outcome of the woa ann model on basis of lower rd range 67 5 in the testing phase providing the most accurate results and highest reliability than those of ann1 90 8 and svr3 106 7 for modeling the n o 3 values 3 2 external validation and sensitivity analysis the approach proposed by tropsha et al 2003 has been used to evaluate the robustness of the developed ml models in this approach new criteria are calculated based on the model s prediction performance for external validation in table 7 the validation criteria and their related equations are presented when m and n are less than 0 1 and k and k p are in the range of 0 85 1 15 the criteria are satisfied higher values of correlation coefficient r are preferred based on table 7 the woa ann model has the highest value of r for the training and testing datasets r 0 9629 for training and r 0 9624 for the testing datasets the woa ann has the highest value of m and n m 0 0743 and n 0 0775 for testing data and the lowest value of m and n were produced by the svr model m 0 2325 and n 0 2294 for the testing dataset according to table 7 the values of m n k and k p for all the developed models are in the range m n 0 1 and 0 85 k k p 1 15 therefore it can be concluded that all models have the predictive goodness and high correlation between the observed and predictive values fig 14 shows the described criteria for external validation as shown in fig 14 for all developed models the criteria are in the permesible range for the training and testings datasets 3 3 future directions in this work optimized and robustness hybrid ml models were proposed and developed in future studies it worth trying the ensemble ml models such as the bagging and boosting tree based ml approaches that can integrate the advantages of the standalone models the current models providedaccepable perofrmance predicting the nitrate pattern under 2d lab setting without plants it is necessary that similar research carried out under 3d field settings with plant in addition considering that this study has been conducted for homogeneous profiles under continuous drip irrigation it is suggested to perform studies on modeling the nitrate pattern for layered textural soil profiles under pulse mode this study was conducted to simulate the nitrate pattern under the injection strategy in the last third of irrigation this approace can be expanded to consider comprehensive studies recommended for typical fertilizer e g phosphorus and potassium under various strategies 4 conclusion the main goal of this research was to provide novel nature inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms integrated with the ann approach namely woa ann optimized with a brf fs strategy for estimating the nitrate pattern in distribution systems standalone ann and svr models based on various training algorithms and kernel functions were examined to validate the woa ann performance overall 298 extracted experimental data sets including 11 independent input parameters were used to construct the predictive models estimating the nitrate pattern brf fs and pearson analysis confired that q f n o 3 and n0 are the most significant features based on the brf fs z score five selective input combinations were considered to implement the models at first the optimal training algorithm and kernel function for ann and svr based models were developed which are lm and rbf respectively the robustness of the models was assessed on basis ofsi mae r tstat u95 and rmse the overall statistical and graphical validation assessment showed that that the predictive performance of the ml models in combo 1 was superior in comparison with the alternative approaches and their ranking is as follows combo1 combo2 combo4 combo3 combo5 further the assessment of the results in the testing stage demonstrated that the woa ann model provided r 0 96 and rmse 0 029 mg l outperforming the ann1 and svr3 respectively external validation alsoshowed the better performance performance of the woa ann model based on m 0 0743 and n 0 0775 overall it can be concluded that woa ann is capble of capturing the data patterns

susceptible to the boundary and initial conditions issues and may become unstable they also need significant computing time and a higher level of human skills than other models despite its simplicity each empirical model is applicable in its experimental range and cannot be generalized to other conditions consequently it is desirable to develop and apply appropriate approaches to simulate the water and nitrate distributions with acceptable accuracy and computational costs artificial intelligence ai models are powerful approaches they can provide robust techniques to predict the water and

moisture and erosion yavari et al 2018 maroufpoor et al 2019a a literature review shows that limited research has been conducted utilizing intelligent techniques to evaluate the nitrate distribution

evaluate the robustness of proposed machine learning ml based models it should be highlighted that to the best of our knowledge this is the first time this ml based technique is developed and applied for solving non linear irrigation problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental work was conducted at the central laboratory of the college of agricultural and natural resources of the university of tehran iran these experiments were conducted in a 2d lab model elnesr and alazba 2019 indicated that both the 2d and 3d simulations had suitable performance in modeling when the experiment s settings are consistent with the laws of physics the schematic of the sampling is shown in fig 1 the soil container s length width and height used in the experiments are 3 0 5 and 1 22 m respectively plexiglas sheets in a soil container were employed to determine the progression of wetting patterns during the experiment the soil container is divided into three separate sections fig 1 and a type of soil texture was placed in each section table 2 due to the higher horizontal distribution of water in heavy textured soils the length of the heavy soil compartment was considered to be larger than that of the medium textured and the light textured soils the soils were pounded layer by layer 10 cm during the filling of the model according to the bulk density a coarse surface was created using sand and glue on lysimeter walls to prevent preferential flow kandelous and šimůnek 2010 water was moved from a reservoir with a volume of 250 l to the emitter using a pump through polyethylene pipes the main sub main and lateral diameters were 50 20 and 16 mm in this path the following were used a valve to guide and control the flow a filtration system to avoid clogging the emitter a pressure gauge to apply constant pressure of 2 bar in all experiments and an off on valve to control the flow of containers by pass was adopted to regulate the inflow and return excess water to the tank the emitters were placed at different depths e g surface 15 30 and 45 cm and connected to the water tank using micro polyethylene tubes the discharge of the emitter was 4 8 8 and 12 l h 2 2 measurements at the end of the experiments and while emptying the soil from the containers soil samples were collected from the points specified in fig 1 and transferred to the laboratory to measure both the soil moisture and nitrate the soil container was left in the laboratory from 24 to 48 h to get the soil stability and uniform initial water distribution therefore slight differences

nitrate concentration in this study were selected using the n recommended application rate varied between 100 and 300 kg ha for crops che et al 2021 scherger et al 2021 these values are consistent with the research of li et al 2004a urea fertilizer ch4n2o was utilized and injected in the last one third of each irrigation event the reason for choosing urea fertilizer is that it is widely used and it is also known as a safe compound with complete solubility gülser 2005 li et al 2021 piwpuan et al 2013 in total 36 experiments were performed using an irrigation time of 6 h per experiment at the end of each experiment and while emptying the soil from the lysimeter containers soil samples were taken from the points specified in fig 1 14 points with different locations were considered for sampling fig 1 based on the wetted front a number of these points were used in each experiment to measure the nitrate levels the samples were first maintained for 24 h in the laboratory to dry they were completely mixed with the specific ratios of saturated extract and by passing through filter papers finally the nitrate values were measured using a spectrophotometer 6705 uv vis jenway with a

behavior of neurons in the brain through mathematically defined functions this method s practical and logical nature makes it useful in classification and prediction issues this model has non linear behavior and can be trained meaning the output are determined by finding the relationship embedded in the process the model is trained using a set of data to calculate the appropriate outputs from inputs according to the relationship found in the training phase among the many examples of neural networks the backward propagation network is the most widely used the neural network consists of layers that have elements with three similar functions called neurons each layer is connected to its previous and subsequent layers the mathematical model of a neural network can be summarized as follows haykin 2009 jamei et al 2020 8 y k ˆ f 0 j 1 m w kj f h i 1 n w ij x i w j 0 w k 0 where n is the total number of neurons in the input layer m is the total number of neurons in the hidden

fields including wind speed and groundwater quality has already been evaluated maroufpoor et al 2019b 2019a 2 5 whale optimization algorithm woa mirjalili and lewis firstly introduced the whale optimization algorithm woa in 2016 mirjalili and lewis 2016 the social behavior of humpback whales inspired this algorithm the whale algorithm starts with a set of random solutions search agents update their position in each iteration using three operators called encircling prey bubble net attack method exploitation phase and prey search exploration phase in encircling prey humpback whales detect prey and surround it the whale algorithm assumes that the best solution is the prey at each time once the best search agent has been identified other search agents will update their location to the best search agent the following equations express this behavior mirjalili and lewis 2016 9 d c x t x t 10 x t 1 x t a d in the above equations t is the current iteration a and c are the coefficient vectors x is the location vector which is the best solution obtained at the moment x is the location vector and dot means point multiplication element to element it should be noted that if there is a better solution x must be updated in each iteration the equations of a and c vectors are as follows mirjalili and lewis 2016 11 a 2 a r a 12 c 2 r where a decreases linearly from 2 to zero during the iterations in both exploration and exploitation phases and r is a random vector between zero and 1 in the bubble net attack method exploitation phase the humpback whale swims around the prey along a contractile circle and at the same time in a spiral path to model this simultaneous behavior it is assumed that the whale chooses one of the contractile siege mechanisms or the spiral model with a 50 probability to update the whale s position during optimization the mathematical model of this phase is defined as follows mirjalili and lewis 2016 13 x t 1 x t a d if p 0 5 d e bl cos 2 π l x t if p 0 5 where d x t x t and denotes the distance i th whale to the prey the best solution ever obtained b is a constant for defining the shape of a logarithmic helix l is a random number between 1 1 and p is a random number between 0 and 1 vector a is used with random values between 1 and 1 to bring the search agents closer to the reference whale in the search for prey exploration phase instead of using the data of the best search agent random agent selection is used to update the position of the search agent the mathematical model of this process is as follows mirjalili and lewis 2016 14 d c x rand x 15 x t 1 x rand a d x rand is the randomly selected position vector random whale of the current population and vector a is used with random values greater than one or less than 1 to force the search agent to move away from the reference whale fig 2 illustrates the flowchart of the whale optimization algorithm the initial population and the number of iterations for optimization in this study were 45 and 2500 respectively 2 6 boruta random forest feature section optimizer brf kursa et al 2010 proposed the concept of the boruta random forest brf optimizer algorithm to determine the significant features brf algorithm established around the rf algorithm through a wrapper method breiman 2001 recently the brf algorithm has been applied successfully in various fields for example streamflow prediction masrur ahmed et al 2021 and soil moisture forecasting ahmed et al 2021a prasad et al 2019 nevertheless the extensive application of feature selection algorithm has been found in modeling forest bio diversity leutner et al 2012 predicting seabed hardness li et al 2016 and air quality forecasting lyu et al 2017 the overall brf algorithm is summarized in the following steps kursa and rudnicki 2010 step 1 generate a randomly ordered shadow duplicated variable x t for a particular input vector x t step 2 remove correlations and add randomness between shadow predictors inputs and outputs y t for a set of t distinct predictors x t ϵ r n and target variable y t ϵ r with n several inputs and t 1 2 t step 3 predict the y t using x t and x t inputs through an rf model step 4 determine the mean decrease accuracy mda for each x t and x t over all trees m tree 500 in this work using eq 16 hur et al 2017 strobl et al 2008 16 mda 1 m tree m 1 m tree

where std outlines the standard deviation of accuracy losses and then the maximum z score among duplicate attributes mzsa is calculated step 6 if z scores mzsa then inputs that are marked as unimportant and separated permanently until inputs having z scores mzsa are marked confirmed step 7 produced new shadow inputs and rest the algorithm when all inputs parameters are confirmed or reached to iteration threshold i e maxi runs 100 in the current work 2 7 model performance indices several performance indices including scatter index si malik et al 2019 mean absolute error mae malik

rehamnia et al 2021 shahsavar et al 2021 and root mean square error rmse malik and kumar 2020 have been utilized to evaluate the accuracy of applied hybrid ml models in simulation of nitrate distribution pattern in the drip irrigation system mathematically the si mae r tstat u95 and rmse are defined as follows 18 si 1 n i 1 n no 3 obs i no 3 pre i 2 no 3 obs 19 mae 1 n i 1 n no 3 pre i no

procedure as already mentioned 298 data points were extracted from the experimental data and the nitrate distribution pattern was measured using 11 predictors i e k s q z r f n o 3 n 0 percentage of clay sand and silt soil ρ b and φ 0 data were randomly divided into training and test sets the training part included 70 of the data 209 and the rest was included in the testing phase all ml models were developed using matlab 2018a environment in a pc with an intel core i7 6700 3 2 3 6 ghz and 8 gb ram furthermore the brf fs was performed using an open source r package and boruta was implemented using a python library the approach workflow is shown in fig 3 selecting the best model inputs in ml based studies where the number of inputs is high has significant impact on the model accuracy and computational cost thus to identify the best input combination for estimating the n o 3 a comprehensive feature selection analysis was conducted using pearson correlation and brf algorithm as a random forest based wrapper process using the pearson correlation coefficient fig 4 demonstrated the linear correlation between all 11 candidate inputs and output parameters as shown in fig 4 the q rp 0 68 f n o 3 rp 0 67 and n0 rp 0 67 showing higher pearson correlation values and sand rp 0 079 and silt rp 0 064 due to the lowest pearson correlation values are identified as the most and the least influential parameters respectively when estimating the n o 3 values to accurately and reliably determine the input combinations the brf fs was implemented to verify the pearson analysis results as aforementioned the median z score s respective features predictors are the critical metrics to confirm or reject them comparing the best median shadow inputs the media z score distributions in fig 5 showes that no predictor is eliminated from the input subsets on basis of a more significant z score 2 88 than those of median shadowmax value thus all predictors combo1 can be considered as input combinations to be studied however due to the differences between their z score values for they can be categorized in terms of significance to identify the most suitable model inputs the brf fs outcomes showed that n0 f n o 3 q φ 0 r and z have z score of higher than 14 meaning these can be considered as the main n o 3 predictors these results are in agreement with the pearson analysis results as the result of the pearson and brf fs analyses the silt and sand parameters are removed from the set of input variables their z score was less than 8 which were identified in the combo 2 then ρ b ks and clay were removed from the list of predictors to form the combo 3 5 respectively table 4 summarizes the chosen input combination to estimate the n o 3 values in order to model the nitrate distribution pattern first the standalone ann method using five training algorithms namely lm gd gda gdx and scg the svr method using three kernel functions namelylinear polynomial and rbf and woa hybrid with ann model were evaluated this exercise identified and used the best ann training algorithm and kernel function for the other combinations in addition to achieve the best performance of each of these ml approachs the trial and error process through sequential running models was adopted to reach the best architecture of the models and optimal hyperparameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 application results and analysis six statistical performance indicators in combo 1 using all predictors were calculated to evaluate the prediction accuracy of ann svr and woa ann models estimating n o 3 in drip irrigation please see table 5 the structure presented in table 4 and 5 for ann shows the number of input parameters hidden layer neurons and output parameters from the network ann models based on the lm training algorithm ann1 and on basis of the highest correlation coefficient r 0 913 and the lowest diagnostic metrics rmse 0 042 mg l tstat 0 747 and u95 0 082 had the best performance in comparison with the ann models followed by ann3 r 0 899 and rmse 0 047 mg l ann5 r 0 899 and rmse 0 046 mg l ann5 ann2 and ann4 respectively at the testing stage further among the svr models svr3 using the rbf kernel function on basis of r 0 901 rmse 0 045 mg l u95 0 087 and si 0 175 was superior to the svr1 r 0 869 rmse 0 052 and svr2 r 0 801 rmse 0 075 respectively woa ann as the main novelty of the present research was used to estimate the n o 3 values it can be seen that in the testing phase the woa ann with 45 population and 2500 iterations model with an architecture similar to the best ann model i e ann1 on basis of r 0 962 rmse 0 029 mg l u95 0 056 and si 0 112 can increase the accuracy by 30 and was identified as the superior predictive ml models fig 6 shows the correlation coefficient and uncertainty variations of all the models in combo 1 the woa ann model achieved r 0 962 and the smallest u95 0 056 outperforming the ann1 and svr3 the scatter plots of measured vs estimated n o 3 values are shownin fig 7 comparing the performance of all the predictive models for combo 1 during the training and testing stages the woa ann model with the least violation of 15 error lines and the closest to the 1 1 line has the best performance among all the studied ml models followed by ann1 and svr3 models based on these results only these three optimal models i e woa ann ann1 and svr3 will be considered at this stage the remaining combinations were examined to validate the predictive performance of the superior models i e woa ann ann1 and svr3 for estimating the n o 3 pattern in drip irrigation table 6 lists all the metrics and optimal architecture setting parameters of these models it can be seen that among the remaining combinations i e combos 2 3 4 and 5 the outcomes of combo 2 outperformed the other combinations with the r rmse and mae average of 0 916 0 041 and 0 034 respectively for estimating the n o 3 pattern in this set the woa ann model achieving r 0 961 and rmse 0 029 improved the accuracy of ann1 by 30 and outperformed the svr3 with r 0 893 and rmse 0 046 for the testing phase likewise the weakest performances are related to combo 5 and 3 with the r and rmse average by 0 875 and 0 0523 and 0 872 and 0 0503 respectively fig 8 shows the spider plots of statistical indicators evaluating the performance of predictive models for the testing phase of combo 2 to combo 5 regarding the multifaceted distribution of the metrics the woa ann model provided the best agreement with the measured datasets in combo 2 and combo 5 compared with the other models in contrast in combo 3 and 4 the svr3 in terms of r 0 892 rmse 0 046 and u95 0 0908 and r 0 899 rmse 0 045 and u95 0 088 had better accuracy than the woa ann and ann1 models respectively fig 9 showes the scatter plots comparing measured and estimated nitrate patterns n o 3 from optimal models in the testing and training phase of combos 2 5 the distribution of estiamted n o 3 levels were compared with the observed data around the line of identity indicating that combo 2 generally shows a better performance than other combos followed by combos 4 3 and 5 respectively in general the woa ann model with the least deviation of the benchmark error lines 15 provided a more reliable estimating of n o 3 than ann1 and svr3 models in order to comprehensively validate the efficiency of the predictive ml approaches a general comparison between the total input combinations and the superior models i e ann1 svr3 and woa ann was conducted to this end the probability distribution function pdf of all selected models in the considered input combinations was compared with the measured values of n o 3 see fig 10 this type of plot shows the probability density of the data at different values usually smoothed by a kernel density estimator in each combination the superior model is distinguished from others using a filled pattern based on the interquartile range iqr q75 q25 metric it is clear that the woa ann model iqr 0 1311 due to its consistency with the measured value iqr 0 1453 outperformed the ann1 iqr 0 1045 and svr3 iqr 0 1245 in addition combo1 and combo 2 provided more promising results than the other approaches the woa ann appraoch provided the most similar distribution pattern in comparison wiht ann1 and svr3 however the svr3 algorithm in combo 3 and combo 4 achieved closer iqr values 0 1287 and 0 1350 respectively to the measured n o 3 iqr 0 1453 performing better than the woa ann and ann1 approaches in addition combo 1 using all predictors was identified as the optimal input combination and was evaluated in the validation stages taylor s diagram has recently been recognized as one of the most efficient multi criterion graphical tools including the correlation coefficient and standard deviation for assessing the robustness of ai models in a quarter circle environment taylor 2001 fig 11 shows the taylor diagrams of the ai based methods applied during the training left panel and testing phases right panel both training and testing results of the prediction methods show that the representation points of the woa ann model by the shortest distance to the reference point giving the best agreement with the measured data points followed by ann1 and svr3 respectively however the ann1 model efficiency was relatively similar to those of the svr3 in the next validation stage the physical expected trend and residual values of each of the ml technique are compared see fig 12 the physical trend extracted from the model showed that the woa ann model could efficiently capture the nonlinearities better than the ann1 and svr3 modelsconfirming its robustness in estimating the nitrate pattern the distribution of the residual values around the benchmark red line indicates that the svr3 method is less accurate than the woa ann and ann1 models the elliptical area marked with a dashed line clearly shows a the better performance of the predictive models supporting the woa ann model superior predictive performancefollowed by the ann1 and svr3 respectively a diagnostic analysis in the form of the scatter diffused plot left panel and violin plot right panel illustrate the distribution of the relative deviation rd of each of the ml approaches see fig 13 the red dot line shows the rd interval between 25 and 25 fig 13 demonstrats the outcome of the woa ann model on basis of lower rd range 67 5 in the testing phase providing the most accurate results and highest reliability than those of ann1 90 8 and svr3 106 7 for modeling the n o 3 values 3 2 external validation and sensitivity analysis the approach proposed by tropsha et al 2003 has been used to evaluate the robustness of the developed ml models in this approach new criteria are calculated based on the model s prediction performance for external validation in table 7 the validation criteria and their related equations are presented when m and n are less than 0 1 and k and k p are in the range of 0 85 1 15 the criteria are satisfied higher values of correlation coefficient r are preferred based on table 7 the woa ann model has the highest value of r for the training and testing datasets r 0 9629 for training and r 0 9624 for the testing datasets the woa ann has the highest value of m and n m 0 0743 and n 0 0775 for testing data and the lowest value of m and n were produced by the svr model m 0 2325 and n 0 2294 for the testing dataset according to table 7 the values of m n k and k p for all the developed models are in the range m n 0 1 and 0 85 k k p 1 15 therefore it can be concluded that all models have the predictive goodness and high correlation between the observed and predictive values fig 14 shows the described criteria for external validation as shown in fig 14 for all developed models the criteria are in the permesible range for the training and testings datasets 3 3 future directions in this work optimized and robustness hybrid ml models were proposed and developed in future studies it worth trying the ensemble ml models such as the bagging and boosting tree based ml approaches that can integrate the advantages of the standalone models the current models providedaccepable perofrmance predicting the nitrate pattern under 2d lab setting without plants it is necessary that similar research carried out under 3d field settings with plant in addition considering that this study has been conducted for homogeneous profiles under continuous drip irrigation it is suggested to perform studies on modeling the nitrate pattern for layered textural soil profiles under pulse mode this study was conducted to simulate the nitrate pattern under the injection strategy in the last third of irrigation this approace can be expanded to consider comprehensive studies recommended for typical fertilizer e g phosphorus and potassium under various strategies 4 conclusion the main goal of this research was to provide novel nature inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms integrated with the ann approach namely woa ann optimized with a brf fs strategy for estimating the nitrate pattern in distribution systems standalone ann and svr models based on various training algorithms and kernel functions were examined to validate the woa ann performance overall 298 extracted experimental data sets including 11 independent input parameters were used to construct the predictive models estimating the nitrate pattern brf fs and pearson analysis confired that q f n o 3 and n0 are the most significant features based on the brf fs z score five selective input combinations were considered to implement the models at first the optimal training algorithm and kernel function for ann and svr based models were developed which are lm and rbf respectively the robustness of the models was assessed on basis ofsi mae r tstat u95 and rmse the overall statistical and graphical validation assessment showed that that the predictive performance of the ml models in combo 1 was superior in comparison with the alternative approaches and their ranking is as follows combo1 combo2 combo4 combo3 combo5 further the assessment of the results in the testing stage demonstrated that the woa ann model provided r 0 96 and rmse 0 029 mg l outperforming the ann1 and svr3 respectively external validation alsoshowed the better performance performance of the woa ann model based on m 0 0743 and n 0 0775 overall it can be concluded that woa ann is capble of capturing the data patterns

on fruit yield and quality remains unclear a pot study was conducted to examine the effects of water salinity and biochar addition on tomato yield and quality in a solar greenhouse of northwest china there were twelve treatments combining two irrigation levels of high w1 and low irrigation w2 2 3 w1 three salinity levels with 0 0 3 and 0 6 of soil dry weight salts referred to s0 s1 and s2 respectively and two biochar addition levels with 0 b0 and 1 b1 of soil dry weight biochar water salinity and the interaction between water and salinity were found significant affecting yield and irrigation water productivity iwp biochar addition reduced yield and iwp ranging from by 7 of w2s0 to 43 of w1s2 the difference in yield and iwp between w1 and w2 was greater for lower salinity treatments the reduction percentage of w2 relative to w1 was 70 38 and 29 for yield 58 14 and 0 9 for iwp under s0 s1 and s2 respectively the effects of water salinity and biochar treatments was found inconsistent for different quality parameters adding biochar had no significant effect on firmness and slightly increased total soluble solids tss and vitamin c vc at both irrigation levels while lower irrigation and higher salinity generally led to higher tss and vc the absolute slope value of the linear regression of yield and quality parameters with soil electrical conductivity was smaller under w2 relative to w1 indicating that the salinity effect was less pronounced when water stress was greater the results are valuable in developing and evaluating remedy measures for improving saline

certain extent most studies were conducted under either drought or salinity stress and few studies were conducted under the coupled drought and salinity stresses therefore how the yield and quality of tomato would respond to the coupled water and salinity stress and whether there was an interaction between the two factors remain unclear biochar produced by pyrolysis of biomass in an oxygen poor or anaerobic environment is a highly aromatic carbon rich and porous solid particulate material antal and grønli 2003 biochar addition in recent years has attracted increasing attention as an amendment to saline soils for improving soil productivity biochar could modify physical chemical and microbiological properties of saline soils and saifullah et al 2018 reviewed the biochar addition s effects on saline soils extensively for example biochar addition increased total porosity and water holding capacity of saline soils via changing the soil pore structure and enhancing soil aggregation chaganti and crohn 2015 obia et al 2016 biochar addition has also been found to improve nutrient content of saline soils such as n p k and ca by increasing the input reducing nutrient leaching and gaseous loss and changing the nutrient utilization rate etc drake et al 2015 kanthle et al 2016 in addition to the improvement in soil properties previous studies have also shown that adding biochar could improve seed germination rate and plant growth as well as improve the quality of vegetables on saline soils wang and xu 2013 saifullah et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 for example adding the appropriate amount of biochar could increase the yield of tomatoes tripti et al 2017 zeeshan et al 2020 guo et al 2021a and improve the quality of tomatoes such as tss vc and lycopene akhtar et al 2014 almaroai and eissa 2020 biochar addition also improved the lipid protein starch and total soluble sugars of torreya grandis zhang et al 2017 and increased the starch protein and amino acid content of wheat grains xu et al 2021 increased the soluble protein and hardness but decreased the total acid of grapes wei et al 2020 however the conclusions on the impact of biochar on crop yields are inconsistent depending on different experimental conditions such as crop characteristics types of biochar amount of biochar and soil properties petruccelli et al 2015 fischer et al 2019 although most studies have shown that biochar had positive effects on crop productivity of saline soils and some studies have indicated that adding biochar could improve certain quality of fruits whether adding biochar could lead to the improvement in both yield and quality in areas where high salinity and severe drought coexist remains unclear therefore the objective of the study was to investigate the effects of the coupled salinity and drought on tomato yield and quality as well as whether adding corn stover biochar could mitigate some adverse effects of water and salt stresses in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design a pot experiment one plant per pot was carried out in a solar greenhouse of the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province 37 52 20 n and 102 50 50 e 1581 m altitude the experiments were done from april to september 2019 the site belongs to a continental temperate arid climate with sufficient sunlight large diurnal temperature difference intense evaporation and sparse rainfall the average annual precipitation is 164 4 mm and the average annual free water surface evaporation is 2000 mm hu et al 2020 the environmental conditions in greenhouse were controlled with relative humidity of 57 5 day night temperatures of 25 5 a local tomato variety fenxi solanum lycopersicum was used in the study tomato seedlings at 3 4 leaf were transplanted on may 2 2019 into conical shaped pots with a diameter of 35 cm at the top a diameter of 30 cm at the bottom and a height of 36 cm the soil used in the experiment was taken from the corn field in the experiment station and classified as aridisol usda soil taxonomy with sandy loam texture having sand silt and clay content of 52 5 40 5 and 7 0 respectively the soil had a field water capacity of 0 282 cm3 cm 3 ph of 8 37 and bulk density of 1 53 g cm 3 the soil was air dried and passed through 2 mm sieve before filling into the pots each pot was filled with 40 kg air dried soil the basal fertilization was adopted according to the local fertilization practice before put into the pot the soil was mixed thoroughly with compound fertilizer n p k 15 15 15 at the rate of 0 45 t ha 1 diammonium phosphate at 0 375 t ha 1 and medium trace element fertilizer fertilizer for mg ca zn and b trace elements required for crop growth at 0 3 t ha 1 as well as with different rates of salts and biochar for treatments of different salinity and biochar levels salt added into the soil is composed of nacl mgso4 and caso4 with the mass ratio is 2 2 1 there were three salt gradients in the experiment 0 0 3 and 0 6 of soil dry weight referred as s0 s1 and s2 respectively hereafter biochar was added at the rate of 0 and 1 of soil dry weight as b0 and b1 respectively the biochar used in the experiment was derived from corn stalk and provided by shenghong biomass energy development corporation pingyao shanxi china the biochar was produced through pyrolysis at 500 c for 10 hrs with organic content of about 68 and ph of 9 47 two irrigation levels of high w1 and low w2 levels were applied for w1 irrigation was applied when the soil water content reached 50 of the field capacity during seeding and vegetative growth stage and 40 of the field capacity in fruit expanding and mature stage during the seedling stage the same amount of water was applied for w1 and w2 treatments while during the other stages irrigation for w2 was applied at the same time of w1 with 2 3 the volume of w1 table 1 therefore there was a total of 12 treatments combining two irrigation levels three salinity levels and two biochar addition rates there were 9 replicative pots for each treatment resulting in 108 pots in total 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 soil water content and ec soil samples were taken at three depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm in three randomly selected pot for each treatment roughly every 20 days part of the soil samples was used to measure soil water content by the gravimetric method and the other part of the soil samples was used to measure soil ec using a conductivity meter s230 mettler toledo international inc switzerland soil ec was measured for the solution with a soil to water ratio of 1 5 after the soil was air dried and passed through 1 mm sieve the average soil water content and ec over the three depths represented the overall soil water content and ec respectively for each pot 2 2 2 crop growth yield and iwp tomato height was measured from the soil surface to the top of the plant every 7 days from the beginning of the tomato seedling stage fresh yield single fruit weight and the number of fruits in the pot were measured at harvest irrigation water productivity iwp kg m 3 was calculated by the following equation iwp y i 100 where y is fruit yield kg pot 1 i is the irrigation m3 pot 1 2 2 3 fruit quality index starting from the early stage of fruit swelling fruits were harvested with 10 day interval fruit quality indexes including longitudinal and transverse diameters hardness tss vc and soluble sugar content were measured at each harvest for each time three fruits were randomly selected for each pot of each treatment the size of the fruit is measured with a vernier caliper fruit firmness was measured with a firmness tester fhr 5 takemura electric works ltd japan the same fruits then were used to measure tss using a hand held brix meter atago pr 32 co ltd tokyo japan vc with the 2 6 dichloroindophenol method soluble sugar content with the anthrone colorimetric method 2 3 data analysis three way analysis of variance anova was used to compare the differences in tomato growth parameters height and stem diameter yield and quality indexes shape index firmness tss vc and soluble sugar with salinity level irrigation level and biochar addition rate and their two way and three way interactions as the fixed factors in the model a significance level of 0 05 was used for testing the treatment differences correlation analysis was conducted between tomato yield and quality indexes with soil water content and ec at different growth stages the analyses were carried out with spss version 20 0 spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 soil water content and ec dynamics the changes of soil water on three typical days one for each growth stage of vegetative growth fruit expansion and mature stages for different treatments are shown in fig 1 apparently high salinity and biochar addition rate treatment s2b1 had the highest swc under both irrigation levels anova analysis conducted for an individual day showed that salinity was consistently significant p 0 001 in affecting soil water content during the entire growing season among the three salinity treatments swc had an order of s0 s1 s2 for most sampling days throughout the growing season with s2 having significantly larger swc than s0 there was no significant difference in swc between the two irrigation treatments during the growing season except for the day right after an irrigation event fig 1 b biochar addition did not affect swc significantly for s0 and s1 treatments under both irrigation levels but led to significantly larger swc for s2 treatments for most occasions the changes of ec on the same days as swc for different water salinity and biochar treatments are shown in fig 2 as expected salinity treatment affected soil ec consistently and significantly at different times during the growth season with s1 and s2 resulting in significantly larger ec than s0 over the growing season meanwhile s2 led to significantly larger ec than s1 for w2 treatments during fruit expansion and mature stages in terms of between irrigation levels ec was only found significantly different for s2 at 84 dat right after an irrigation event with w2 having larger ec than w1 biochar addition had no significant effect on soil ec for all water and salinity treatments over the growth stage 3 2 crop growth and yield plant height is an important indicator for evaluating tomato growth status and fig 3 shows the change of plant height over time during the whole growth stage the treatment effects of water salinity and biochar addition varied between different growth stages during the earlier stage 56 dat irrigation level had little impact on plant height while biochar addition was found significant and resulted in shorter plant height the opposite was true during the later stage 56 dat when high irrigation level had greater plant height and biochar had no significant effect salinity was found consistently significant over the entire growth stage leading to lower plant height for higher salinity treatments over the entire growth stage plant height was the highest for w1s0b0 and lowest for w2s2b1 the main effects of water salinity and biochar and the interaction between water and salinity were found significant in affecting tomato yield and iwp table 2 in general the effect of biochar on yield and iwp was fairly similar biochar addition led to lower yield and iwp for all water and salinity treatments and the reduction was more pronounced for high irrigation w1 and higher salinity treatments for w1 s2b1 led to 44 lower yield and iwp than s2b0 while on average yield of addition biochar treatments was about 85 of the yield of biochar free treatments for w2 treatments high irrigation level resulted in larger yield especially for low salinity treatment of s0 for s0 w1 had 2 5 times higher yield than w2 while for the other salinity treatments yield of w1 was about 30 greater than w2 salinity effects were found to vary between the two irrigation level treatments for w1 s0 led to a significantly higher yield than s1 and s2 while there was no significant difference between s1 and s2 for w2 larger salinity led to a slightly higher yield although the difference was not statistically significant there was no significant difference in iwp between treatments except that w1s0 had much larger iwp than the other treatments 3 3 fruit quality the comparisons of tomato quality parameters including fruit shape index tss soluble sugar vc and firmness between treatments for different mature stages are shown in table 3 apparently all fruit quality parameters including shape tss soluble sugar vc and firmness were the best at red ripe stage water salinity and biochar largely had no effects on most of fruit quality parameters excluding soluble sugar content during green ripe stage and had little effect on shape index at any stage relative to the other parameters the difference in soluble sugar content between treatments varied much greatly between the four stages and at each of the four stages water salinity biochar and almost all the interactions were found significant in affecting soluble sugar content biochar addition and water stress largely decreased soluble sugar content during green ripe stage while increased sugar content at the over ripe stage salinity effect on soluble sugar content was not consistent for different stages at the red ripe stage the order of sugar content was s1 s2 s0 at w1 while at w2 s0 had larger sugar content than s2 in general biochar addition slightly improved tss and vc at red ripe stage for all water and salinity treatments except w2s2 for w2s2 biochar addition reduced vc by about 53 at red ripe stage relative s0 s1 and s2 led to significantly higher tss and vc contents at red ripe stage while there was no difference between s1 and s2 apparently severer water stress led to better quality in terms of tss soluble sugar and vc contents at red ripe stage fruit quality parameters of shape index tss and vc at the earlier stage of green ripe and turning color was not correlated with those at the later stage with a correlation coefficient less than 0 2 firmness index at turning color stage was negatively correlated with that at red ripe stage with a correlation coefficient of 0 77 while soluble sugar content at the turning color stage correlated positively with that at the red ripe stage with a correlation coefficient of 0 87 for tss and vc strong correlation was found between red ripe and overripe stages with a correlation coefficient larger than 0 7 3 4 response of crop yield and quality to water and salt stress the relationships between tomato yield and mean ec over the growth stage as well as between quality parameters with ec for different water treatments are shown in fig 4 apparently yield responded to soil ec differently at different irrigation levels yield decreased linearly with increasing ec only for w1 while no significant linear relationship was found for w2 the relationships between quality indexes and ec varied for different indexes under different water levels the influence of soil ec on fruit shape index is not significant for w1 tss soluble sugar vc and fruit firmness were found to increase as soil ec increased with r 2 of linear regression of 0 64 0 56 0 67 and 0 32 respectively for w2 tss and vc were found increasing with soil ec but with much smaller r 2 however the trend was reversed for soluble sugar content and fruit firmness at w2 and they both decreased with soil ec increasing with r 2 of 0 53 and 0 031 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effect of different biochar water and salinity treatments on tomato yield adding biochar inhibited tomato growth and reduced yield to some extent in the study which is inconsistent with the results of many previous studies most previous studies have shown that adding biochar could promote crop growth and increase crop yields hossain et al 2010 agbna et al 2017 for example guo et al 2021b found that adding 50 t ha 1 fruit trees biochar increased the yield of tomatoes by 55 23 than the treatment without biochar addition zeeshan et al 2020 showed that adding 20 t ha 1 of the wood biochar on the contaminated soil with the size of particles less than 3 mm increased tomato yield by 68 57 however there were other studies that reported the negative effects of biochar addition on crop yield vaccari et al 2015 voca et al 2020 vaccari et al 2015 showed that 14 t ha 1 wheat bran pellets biochar addition did not affect the production of tomatoes significantly bailey et al 2011 has pointed out that the effect would not be the same for all biochar added in all soils and the effects of biochar on soil properties and plant growth varied depending on characteristics of biochar itself as well as on soil properties purakayastha et al 2019 we reasoned that the negative effects of biochar addition on tomato yield in this study were likely related to small particles and high ph of biochar added and the water and salt stress conditions might further acerbate the negative effect particles of biochar used in the study were less than 2 mm which could reduce soil macropore fraction and increase water retention capability villagra mendoza and horn 2018 as a result it became more difficult for roots to absorb water especially under water and salt stress conditions biochar added had high ph than soil 9 5 vs 8 4 in the study and high ph might affect the release of nutrients to soils thus leading to the reduction in yield sigua et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 blok et al 2017 as expected water and salt stress have a negative effect on crop growth and yield in the study which is consistent with the results of previous studies chen et al 2013 yang et al 2017 2019 our result indicated that salt stress had a significantly negative effect on crop yield only when water stress was relatively moderate when water stress was severe enough as w2 in the study salinity would have little or even slightly positive effect on yield noticeably the two linear regression lines of yield with ec for w1 and w2 intersected at about 1 36 ds m 1 indicating that when soil ec was higher than 1 36 ds m 1 salt stress would be the dominant factor determining tomato yield and increasing water supply would not help mitigate the salt stress effect previous studies have reported similar results that when soil salinity reaches a certain level the effect of water stress is reduced and salt stress becomes dominant yang et al 2019 showed adding 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 salts into soils reduced the effect of water stress on tomato and the salinity effect became dominant another study showed that spinach yield was significantly reduced by water stress when salt stress was relatively light while under greater salt stress the yield between water treatments became similar ors and suarez 2017 4 2 effect of different biochar water and salinity treatments on tomato quality parameters some studies have shown that adding biochar can improve the quality of tomatoes such as the increase in tss soluble sugar content total acid and vc akhtar et al 2014 keabetswe et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b however biochar showed little effect on shape index firmness and vc and only slightly increased tss 6 on average in this study the inconsistency may be attributable to the specific experimental conditions and biochar used in the study sani et al 2020 found that 0 6 t ha 1 timber waste biochar produced at 400 c improved tss protein and antioxidant compounds of tomatoes almaroai and eissa 2020 reported that 10 t ha 1 corn stalks biochar produced at 450 c increased total acidity tss vc tomato by 33 29 and 39 respectively compared to the control they attributed the improvement in tomato quality to the increase of leaf photosynthesis and nutrient uptake as mentioned earlier the increased soil ph and change in soil pore structure from biochar addition created unfavorable condition for tomato growth which might reduce photosynthesis and nutrient uptake further previous studies on biochar s improvement of tomato quality were conducted rarely under the coupled water and salt stress conditions we speculate that under severe water and salt stress conditions the capacity of adding biochar on improving tomato yield and quality was greatly limited many studies have shown that the effect of water and salt stress on fruit quality are similar and both water and salt stress can improve fruit quality to some extent mitchell et al 1991 yin et al 2010 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a li et al 2021a wu et al 2021 generally water and salt stress increase tss vc soluble sugar content of fruits under saline water irrigation organic acids and soluble sugar content increased with salinity increasing from 2 to 9 ds m 1 cuartero and fernández muñoz 1999 and deficit irrigation at proper level increased tss vc soluble sugar and fruit firmness of tomato fruits significantly van de wal et al 2017 chen et al 2014 it is believed that water and salt stress improve the quality of tomatoes through increasing ion content by reducing water content in fruits and preventing translocation of the phloem to fruit mitchell et al 1991 guichard et al 2001 the size of the tomato fruit reduced by salt stress also contributed to the higher tss content yurtseven et al 2005 on the other hand studies on the response of tomato fruit quality to the coupled water and salt stresses are fewer and a limited number of studies indicated that there was no interaction between water and salt stresses on tomato quality yang et al 2019 reported that the interaction between water three levels of full irrigation 2 3 and 1 2 full irrigation and salinity 0 2 3 and 4 of soil dry weight treatments was not significant in affecting tss total soluble sugar and firmness in a pot study in a field study with saline water irrigation salinity and irrigation frequency did not have a significant effect on any tomato fruit quality index of shape index firmness tss and citric acid cantore et al 2012 however water and salinity interacted significantly on tss soluble sugar and vc in this study we speculate that different setups in water treatments might contribute to the apparent inconsistency in their studies water stress was not so severe as in our study water was applied at 1 2 full irrigation for the most water stress treatment in yang et al 2019 study while water treatment differed in irrigation frequency not much in the amount of water used in the study of cantore et al 2012 in our study water amount was less than the 1 2 full irrigation treatment in yang et al 2019 as indicated by the lower water content about 10 for most of the growth stage the slopes from linear regression of quality parameters of tss soluble sugar and firmness with ec were significantly different between w1 and w2 treatments which confirmed that there was significant interaction between water and salt stress on them for both soluble sugar and fruit firmness the change direction with increasing ec was opposite under w1 and w2 treatment suggesting that the salinity stress effect on fruit quality is fairly different under different water levels tomato fruit quality parameters change as the maturity stage changes as a result knowledge of the changing pattern of fruit quality over the maturity stages is critical for choosing the right harvest time previous studies have shown that the highest fruit quality occurs at the red ripe stage and harvesting before and after that often leads to the quality decline casierra posada and avendaño 2008 in general our results agreed with those results that the red ripe stage has the highest quality regarding tss and vc few studies have examined the effects on the evolution of fruit quality under either water or salinity or the combined stresses this study suggested that water and salinity stresses tend to have no effect on fruit quality index at the earlier maturity stage of green ripe but likely have a significant effect at later stages the effects were found variable for different maturity stages as indicated by no significant correlation for the quality index between the earlier two maturity stages with the later stages the mechanisms associated with how drought and salinity stresses affect the development of tomato fruits need further study 5 conclusion in this study the effects of biochar addition drought and salinity stresses on yield and quality of tomatoes were conducted in a solar greenhouse biochar addition failed to improve tomato yield in general likely associated with the biochar properties and the experimental conditions used in the study the responses of tomato quality parameters to water salinity and biochar treatments were variable for different parameters adding biochar was found to have little effect on shape index vc and firmness and be able to improve tss and soluble sugar to some extent overall severer water and salinity stresses led to lower yield and higher tss and vc of tomato fruits the results also indicated that the response of tomato yield and quality to salinity stress differed at different water levels the decline in yield and some quality parameters tss vc and shape index was found more pronounced when the irrigation level was relatively higher extra caution should be taken regarding biochar addition for mitigating the adverse effects of drought and or salinity on crop yield in arid and semi arid regions the combined water and salinity stresses might alter the behavior of biochar in soils leading to different results as those found in sufficient water supply and no salinity stress environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

9433,improving productivity of saline soils under drought condition is critical for sustainable agricultural development in arid areas whether biochar addition can interact with drought and salinity on fruit yield and quality remains unclear a pot study was conducted to examine the effects of water salinity and biochar addition on tomato yield and quality in a solar greenhouse of northwest china

2000 mm hu et al 2020 the environmental conditions in greenhouse were controlled with relative humidity of 57 5 day night temperatures of 25 5 a local tomato variety fenxi solanum lycopersicum was used in the study tomato seedlings at 3 4 leaf were transplanted on may 2 2019 into conical shaped pots with a diameter of 35 cm at the top a diameter of 30 cm at the bottom and a height of 36 cm the soil used in the experiment was taken from the corn field in the experiment station and classified as aridisol usda soil taxonomy with sandy loam texture having sand silt and clay content of 52 5 40 5 and 7 0 respectively the soil had a field water capacity of 0 282 cm3 cm 3 ph of 8 37 and bulk density of 1 53 g cm 3 the soil was air dried and passed through 2 mm sieve before filling into the pots each pot was filled with 40 kg air dried soil the basal fertilization was adopted according to the local fertilization practice before put into the pot the soil was mixed thoroughly with compound fertilizer n p k 15 15 15 at the rate of 0 45 t ha 1 diammonium phosphate at 0 375 t ha 1 and medium trace element fertilizer fertilizer for mg ca zn and b trace elements required for crop growth at 0 3 t ha 1 as well as with different rates of salts and biochar for treatments of different salinity and biochar levels salt added into the soil is composed of nacl mgso4 and caso4 with the mass ratio is 2 2 1 there were three salt gradients in the experiment 0 0 3 and 0 6 of soil dry weight referred as s0 s1 and s2 respectively hereafter biochar was added at the rate of 0 and 1 of soil dry weight as b0 and b1 respectively the biochar used in the experiment was derived from corn stalk and provided by shenghong biomass energy development corporation pingyao shanxi china the biochar was produced through pyrolysis at 500 c for 10 hrs with organic content of about 68 and ph of 9 47 two irrigation levels of high w1 and low w2 levels were applied for w1 irrigation was applied when the soil water content reached 50 of the field capacity during seeding and vegetative growth stage and 40 of the field capacity in fruit expanding and mature stage during the seedling stage the same amount of water was applied for w1 and w2 treatments while during the other stages irrigation for w2 was applied at the same time of w1 with 2 3 the volume of w1 table 1 therefore there was a total of 12 treatments combining two irrigation levels three salinity levels and two biochar addition rates there were 9 replicative pots for each treatment resulting in 108 pots in total 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 soil water content and ec soil samples were taken at three depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm in three randomly selected pot for each treatment roughly every 20 days part of the soil samples was used to measure soil water content by the gravimetric method and the other part of the soil samples was used to measure soil ec using a conductivity meter s230 mettler toledo international inc switzerland soil ec was measured for the solution with a soil to water ratio of 1 5 after the soil was air dried and passed through 1 mm sieve the average soil water content and ec over the three depths represented the overall soil water content and ec respectively for each pot 2 2 2 crop growth yield and iwp tomato height was measured from the soil surface to the top of the plant every 7 days from the beginning of the tomato seedling stage fresh yield single fruit weight and the number of fruits in the pot were measured at harvest irrigation water productivity iwp kg m 3 was calculated by the following equation iwp y i 100 where y is fruit yield kg pot 1 i is the irrigation m3 pot 1 2 2 3 fruit quality index starting from the early stage of fruit swelling fruits were harvested with 10 day interval fruit quality indexes including longitudinal and transverse diameters hardness tss vc and soluble sugar content were measured at each harvest for each time three fruits were randomly selected for each pot of each treatment the size of the fruit is measured with a vernier caliper fruit firmness was measured with a firmness tester fhr 5 takemura electric works ltd japan the same fruits then were used to measure tss using a hand held brix meter atago pr 32 co ltd tokyo japan vc with the 2 6 dichloroindophenol method soluble sugar content with the anthrone colorimetric method 2 3 data analysis three way analysis of variance anova was used to compare the differences in tomato growth parameters height and stem diameter yield and quality indexes shape index firmness tss vc and soluble sugar with salinity level irrigation level and biochar addition rate and their two way and three way interactions as the fixed factors in the model a significance level of 0 05 was used for testing the treatment differences correlation analysis was conducted between tomato yield and quality indexes with soil water content and ec at different growth stages the analyses were carried out with spss version 20 0 spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 soil water content and ec dynamics the changes of soil water on three typical days one for each growth stage of vegetative growth fruit expansion and mature stages for different treatments are shown in fig 1 apparently high salinity and biochar addition rate treatment s2b1 had the highest swc under both irrigation levels anova analysis conducted for an individual day showed that salinity was consistently significant p 0 001 in affecting soil water content during the entire growing season among the three salinity treatments swc had an order of s0 s1 s2 for most sampling days throughout the growing season with s2 having significantly larger swc than s0 there was no significant difference in swc between the two irrigation treatments during the growing season except for the day right after an irrigation event fig 1 b biochar addition did not affect swc significantly for s0 and s1 treatments under both irrigation levels but led to significantly larger swc for s2 treatments for most occasions the changes of ec on the same days as swc for different water salinity and biochar treatments are shown in fig 2 as expected salinity treatment affected soil ec consistently and significantly at different times during the growth season with s1 and s2 resulting in significantly larger ec than s0 over the growing season meanwhile s2 led to significantly larger ec than s1 for w2 treatments during fruit expansion and mature stages in terms of between irrigation levels ec was only found significantly different for s2 at 84 dat right after an irrigation event with w2 having larger ec than w1 biochar addition had no significant effect on soil ec for all water and salinity treatments over the growth stage 3 2 crop growth and yield plant height is an important indicator for evaluating tomato growth status and fig 3 shows the change of plant height over time during the whole growth stage the treatment effects of water salinity and biochar addition varied between different growth stages during the earlier stage 56 dat irrigation level had little impact on plant height while biochar addition was found significant and resulted in shorter plant height the opposite was true during the later stage 56 dat when high irrigation level had greater plant height and biochar had no significant effect salinity was found consistently significant over the entire growth stage leading to lower plant height for higher salinity treatments over the entire growth stage plant height was the highest for w1s0b0 and lowest for w2s2b1 the main effects of water salinity and biochar and the interaction between water and salinity were found significant in affecting tomato yield and iwp table 2 in general the effect of biochar on yield and iwp was fairly similar biochar addition led to lower yield and iwp for all water and salinity treatments and the reduction was more pronounced for high irrigation w1 and higher salinity treatments for w1 s2b1 led to 44 lower yield and iwp than s2b0 while on average yield of addition biochar treatments was about 85 of the yield of biochar free treatments for w2 treatments high irrigation level resulted in larger yield especially for low salinity treatment of s0 for s0 w1 had 2 5 times higher yield than w2 while for the other salinity treatments yield of w1 was about 30 greater than w2 salinity effects were found to vary between the two irrigation level treatments for w1 s0 led to a significantly higher yield than s1 and s2 while there was no significant difference between s1 and s2 for w2 larger salinity led to a slightly higher yield although the difference was not statistically significant there was no significant difference in iwp between treatments except that w1s0 had much larger iwp than the other treatments 3 3 fruit quality the comparisons of tomato quality parameters including fruit shape index tss soluble sugar vc and firmness between treatments for different mature stages are shown in table 3 apparently all fruit quality parameters including shape tss soluble sugar vc and firmness were the best at red ripe stage water salinity and biochar largely had no effects on most of fruit quality parameters excluding soluble sugar content during green ripe stage and had little effect on shape index at any stage relative to the other parameters the difference in soluble sugar content between treatments varied much greatly between the four stages and at each of the four stages water salinity biochar and almost all the interactions were found significant in affecting soluble sugar content biochar addition and water stress largely decreased soluble sugar content during green ripe stage while increased sugar content at the over ripe stage salinity effect on soluble sugar content was not consistent for different stages at the red ripe stage the order of sugar content was s1 s2 s0 at w1 while at w2 s0 had larger sugar content than s2 in general biochar addition slightly improved tss and vc at red ripe stage for all water and salinity treatments except w2s2 for w2s2 biochar addition reduced vc by about 53 at red ripe stage relative s0 s1 and s2 led to significantly higher tss and vc contents at red ripe stage while there was no difference between s1 and s2 apparently severer water stress led to better quality in terms of tss soluble sugar and vc contents at red ripe stage fruit quality parameters of shape index tss and vc at the earlier stage of green ripe and turning color was not correlated with those at the later stage with a correlation coefficient less than 0 2 firmness index at turning color stage was negatively correlated with that at red ripe stage with a correlation coefficient of 0 77 while soluble sugar content at the turning color stage correlated positively with that at the red ripe stage with a correlation coefficient of 0 87 for tss and vc strong correlation was found between red ripe and overripe stages with a correlation coefficient larger than 0 7 3 4 response of crop yield and quality to water and salt stress the relationships between tomato yield and mean ec over the growth stage as well as between quality parameters with ec for different water treatments are shown in fig 4 apparently yield responded to soil ec differently at different irrigation levels yield decreased linearly with increasing ec only for w1 while no significant linear relationship was found for w2 the relationships between quality indexes and ec varied for different indexes under different water levels the influence of soil ec on fruit shape index is not significant for w1 tss soluble sugar vc and fruit firmness were found to increase as soil ec increased with r 2 of linear regression of 0 64 0 56 0 67 and 0 32 respectively for w2 tss and vc were found increasing with soil ec but with much smaller r 2 however the trend was reversed for soluble sugar content and fruit firmness at w2 and they both decreased with soil ec increasing with r 2 of 0 53 and 0 031 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effect of different biochar water and salinity treatments on tomato yield adding biochar inhibited tomato growth and reduced yield to some extent in the study which is inconsistent with the results of many previous studies most previous studies have shown that adding biochar could promote crop growth and increase crop yields hossain et al 2010 agbna et al 2017 for example guo et al 2021b found that adding 50 t ha 1 fruit trees biochar increased the yield of tomatoes by 55 23 than the treatment without biochar addition zeeshan et al 2020 showed that adding 20 t ha 1 of the wood biochar on the contaminated soil with the size of particles less than 3 mm increased tomato yield by 68 57 however there were other studies that reported the negative effects of biochar addition on crop yield vaccari et al 2015 voca et al 2020 vaccari et al 2015 showed that 14 t ha 1 wheat bran pellets biochar addition did not affect the production of tomatoes significantly bailey et al 2011 has pointed out that the effect would not be the same for all biochar added in all soils and the effects of biochar on soil properties and plant growth varied depending on characteristics of biochar itself as well as on soil properties purakayastha et al 2019 we reasoned that the negative effects of biochar addition on tomato yield in this study were likely related to small particles and high ph of biochar added and the water and salt stress conditions might further acerbate the negative effect particles of biochar used in the study were less than 2 mm which could reduce soil macropore fraction and increase water retention capability villagra mendoza and horn 2018 as a result it became more difficult for roots to absorb water especially under water and salt stress conditions biochar added had high ph than soil 9 5 vs 8 4 in the study and high ph might affect the release of nutrients to soils thus leading to the reduction in yield sigua et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 blok et al 2017 as expected water and salt stress have a negative effect on crop growth and yield in the study which is consistent with the results of previous studies chen et al 2013 yang et al 2017 2019 our result indicated that salt stress had a significantly negative effect on crop yield only when water stress was relatively moderate when water stress was severe enough as w2 in the study salinity would have little or even slightly positive effect on yield noticeably the two linear regression lines of yield with ec for w1 and w2 intersected at about 1 36 ds m 1 indicating that when soil ec was higher than 1 36 ds m 1 salt stress would be the dominant factor determining tomato yield and increasing water supply would not help mitigate the salt stress effect previous studies have reported similar results that when soil salinity reaches a certain level the effect of water stress is reduced and salt stress becomes dominant yang et al 2019 showed adding 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 salts into soils reduced the effect of water stress on tomato and the salinity effect became dominant another study showed that spinach yield was significantly reduced by water stress when salt stress was relatively light while under greater salt stress the yield between water treatments became similar ors and suarez 2017 4 2 effect of different biochar water and salinity treatments on tomato quality parameters some studies have shown that adding biochar can improve the quality of tomatoes such as the increase in tss soluble sugar content total acid and vc akhtar et al 2014 keabetswe et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b however biochar showed little effect on shape index firmness and vc and only slightly increased tss 6 on average in this study the inconsistency may be attributable to the specific experimental conditions and biochar used in the study sani et al 2020 found that 0 6 t ha 1 timber waste biochar produced at 400 c improved tss protein and antioxidant compounds of tomatoes almaroai and eissa 2020 reported that 10 t ha 1 corn stalks biochar produced at 450 c increased total acidity tss vc tomato by 33 29 and 39 respectively compared to the control they attributed the improvement in tomato quality to the increase of leaf photosynthesis and nutrient uptake as mentioned earlier the increased soil ph and change in soil pore structure from biochar addition created unfavorable condition for tomato growth which might reduce photosynthesis and nutrient uptake further previous studies on biochar s improvement of tomato quality were conducted rarely under the coupled water and salt stress conditions we speculate that under severe water and salt stress conditions the capacity of adding biochar on improving tomato yield and quality was greatly limited many studies have shown that the effect of water and salt stress on fruit quality are similar and both water and salt stress can improve fruit quality to some extent mitchell et al 1991 yin et al 2010 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a li et al 2021a wu et al 2021 generally water and salt stress increase tss vc soluble sugar content of fruits under saline water irrigation organic acids and soluble sugar content increased with salinity increasing from 2 to 9 ds m 1 cuartero and fernández muñoz 1999 and deficit irrigation at proper level increased tss vc soluble sugar and fruit firmness of tomato fruits significantly van de wal et al 2017 chen et al 2014 it is believed that water and salt stress improve the quality of tomatoes through increasing ion content by reducing water content in fruits and preventing translocation of the phloem to fruit mitchell et al 1991 guichard et al 2001 the size of the tomato fruit reduced by salt stress also contributed to the higher tss content yurtseven et al 2005 on the other hand studies on the response of tomato fruit quality to the coupled water and salt stresses are fewer and a limited number of studies indicated that there was no interaction between water and salt stresses on tomato quality yang et al 2019 reported that the interaction between water three levels of full irrigation 2 3 and 1 2 full irrigation and salinity 0 2 3 and 4 of soil dry weight treatments was not significant in affecting tss total soluble sugar and firmness in a pot study in a field study with saline water irrigation salinity and irrigation frequency did not have a significant effect on any tomato fruit quality index of shape index firmness tss and citric acid cantore et al 2012 however water and salinity interacted significantly on tss soluble sugar and vc in this study we speculate that different setups in water treatments might contribute to the apparent inconsistency in their studies water stress was not so severe as in our study water was applied at 1 2 full irrigation for the most water stress treatment in yang et al 2019 study while water treatment differed in irrigation frequency not much in the amount of water used in the study of cantore et al 2012 in our study water amount was less than the 1 2 full irrigation treatment in yang et al 2019 as indicated by the lower water content about 10 for most of the growth stage the slopes from linear regression of quality parameters of tss soluble sugar and firmness with ec were significantly different between w1 and w2 treatments which confirmed that there was significant interaction between water and salt stress on them for both soluble sugar and fruit firmness the change direction with increasing ec was opposite under w1 and w2 treatment suggesting that the salinity stress effect on fruit quality is fairly different under different water levels tomato fruit quality parameters change as the maturity stage changes as a result knowledge of the changing pattern of fruit quality over the maturity stages is critical for choosing the right harvest time previous studies have shown that the highest fruit quality occurs at the red ripe stage and harvesting before and after that often leads to the quality decline casierra posada and avendaño 2008 in general our results agreed with those results that the red ripe stage has the highest quality regarding tss and vc few studies have examined the effects on the evolution of fruit quality under either water or salinity or the combined stresses this study suggested that water and salinity stresses tend to have no effect on fruit quality index at the earlier maturity stage of green ripe but likely have a significant effect at later stages the effects were found variable for different maturity stages as indicated by no significant correlation for the quality index between the earlier two maturity stages with the later stages the mechanisms associated with how drought and salinity stresses affect the development of tomato fruits need further study 5 conclusion in this study the effects of biochar addition drought and salinity stresses on yield and quality of tomatoes were conducted in a solar greenhouse biochar addition failed to improve tomato yield in general likely associated with the biochar properties and the experimental conditions used in the study the responses of tomato quality parameters to water salinity and biochar treatments were variable for different parameters adding biochar was found to have little effect on shape index vc and firmness and be able to improve tss and soluble sugar to some extent overall severer water and salinity stresses led to lower yield and higher tss and vc of tomato fruits the results also indicated that the response of tomato yield and quality to salinity stress differed at different water levels the decline in yield and some quality parameters tss vc and shape index was found more pronounced when the irrigation level was relatively higher extra caution should be taken regarding biochar addition for mitigating the adverse effects of drought and or salinity on crop yield in arid and semi arid regions the combined water and salinity stresses might alter the behavior of biochar in soils leading to different results as those found in sufficient water supply and no salinity stress environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

9434,biological soil crust bsc as a nature based strategy has a great potential to restore soil and water in arid and semi arid natural ecosystems yet little is known about its effects on soil fertility and productivity as affected by the bsc inoculation in agroecosystems we hypothesis that bsc inoculation can improve soil quality while increasing crop productivity and economic benefits in semiarid rainfed region to address this issue we carried out field experiment using forage maize zea mays l from 2018 to 2019 with four treatments as follows 1 conventional flat planting control ck 2 flat planting with the inoculation of bsc bsc 3 ridge furrow planting rf and 4 sectional ridge furrow planting srf the results showed that bsc inoculation significantly enhanced maize shoot and root biomass by 53 63 and 30 67 accordingly p 0 05 compared with ck in two growing seasons also bsc treatment slightly increased soil water content and soil temperature while significantly decreasing soil ph and soil bulk density relative to ck rf and srf p 0 05 compared with ck the bsc inoculation markedly improved soil microbial biomass carbon by 54 and nitrogen by 52 soil organic carbon by 21 and total nitrogen by 30 respectively p 0 05 critically the contents of above four parameters were 42 32 19 and 32 greater in bsc than rf and srf respectively p 0 05 simultaneously the bsc significantly decreased soil c n ratio by 7 while srf and rf slightly decreased c n ratio by 0 2 and 2 only in comparison with ck interestingly soil c n mineralization efficiency were significantly greater in the bsc treatment than ck rf and srf p 0 05 in addition the economic benefit under bsc was the highest relative to other three planting systems in conclusion bsc can be used as a nature based strategy nbs to improve soil properties promote microbial c n uptake and utilization via enhancing c n mineralization and lowering c n ratio in conclusion bsc can act as a green solution to achieve high productivity and promote soil fertility in semiarid agricultural ecosystem keywords biological soil crust soil physical structure soil carbon nitrogen mineralization forage maize agroecosystem 1 introduction in the arid and semi arid regions of china most of agricultural lands are mountainous and hilly areas with poor soil quality and accelerated soil erosion zhang et al 2021 unpredictable rainfall high evaporation rate and low water utilization efficiency frequently aggravate drought stress and negatively affect agricultural production qin et al 2018 also poor soil quality low precipitation and high temperature are the limiting factors this regions mo et al 2016 to cope with the above issues some management strategies have been adapted to improve soil quality water use and crop production including the conversion of cropland to grassland crop rotation ridge furrow with film mulching and so on gu et al 2021 over last decades plastic film mulch and chemical fertilizers have been widely used to improve crop yield li et al 2018 q li et al 2018 x r li et al 2018 however the remains of residual film in soil after plastic film mulching can result in soil compaction hinders root growth and ultimately reduce crop yield f li et al 2020 m li et al 2020 y li et al 2020 in addition inappropriate use of chemical fertilizer has also brought many problems such as imbalanced soil nutrient reduced microbial diversity and degraded soil structure chen et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to find an appropriate and efficient strategy to sustain and or improve soil quality and crop yield currently an innovative nature based strategy nbs is extremely desirable under global environment change especially in the arid and semi arid agricultural lands hérivaux and

improve soil health soil properties and consequently increase crop yield existing study suggests that biological soil crusts bsc can be considered as an effective biofertilizer to fix carbon and nitrogen and improve soil fertility vinoth et al 2020 conceptually the bsc are ndowed with a special structure built by microbial phototrophs most commonly as cyanobacteria they can aggregate on soil surfaces in arid and semiarid areas gao et al 2020 during the period of growth and development they can produce plant growth promoting hormones and growth regulating substances like vitamins amino acids and sugars vinoth et al 2020 on the other hand the dry matter of bsc can contributes to the accumulation of organic matter and nitrogen fixation thus improving soil fertility zhao et al 2020 also bsc can markedly improve water holding capacity and soil temperature q li et al 2018 x r li et al 2018 and help improve soil quality gao et al 2020 malam issa et al 2001 demonstrated that bcs organisms were able to boost surface soils stabilize via binding fine particles and soil organic matter into macroaggregate adessi et al 2018 found that the water holding capacity was reduced by 80 under the absence of cyanobacteria exopolysaccharides hashim et al 2020 reported the soil particles binding was highly depend on the presence of filaments and secreted exopolysaccharides some evidences indicated that the soil stability under bsc inoculation can be elevated by 135 relative to that of non inoculation kuwabara et al 2021 thus the bsc inoculation may play a critical role in enhancing soil ability to resist erosion in short bsc are likely to act as a crucial nbs to boost the sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems zhao et al 2021 on the other hand soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn are ubiquitous as soil quality indicator bünemann et al 2018 in general soc and tn contents are affected by a series of factors such as root litter diversity man et al 2020 microbial activity wei et al 2020 and mineralization al maliki and breesam 2020 in this aspect carbon mineralization is an important indicator of the soc decomposition bahn et al 2008 it is to most extent controlled by soil microbes and nutrient supply and the latter can be frequently affected by biotic and abioticfactors such as root residues soil temperature hu et al 2014 water availability mo et al 2016 and soil properties al maliki and breesam 2020 similarly soil n mineralization is another key component affecting n cycling in terrestrial ecosystems hasi et al 2021 in contrast it is also largely affected by soil physical and chemical properties including soil bulk density bimüller et al 2016 soil temperature liu et al 2017 carbon and nitrogen contents chen et al 2019 organic matter inputs in rhizosphere jiang et al 2021 and soil microbial diversity and activity kuzyakov and xu 2013 to sum up the bsc play a major role in the degradation ecosystem conservation since they can provide a rapid and accurate solution to restore soil quality hu et al 2014 in desert ecosystems the importance of bsc in c and n mineralization has been widely recognized zhao et al 2021 however few studies were available about the effects of bsc on soil c and n accumulations n agroecosystems to address the above issue we hypothesized that bsc inoculation might improve soil quality while increasing crop productivity and economic benefits in degraded agricultural soils in order to test the hypothesis field experiment was carried out in the slope field of forage maize zea mays l located in the semiarid region of loess plateau northwest china in this study soil physical properties microbial biomass nitrogen and organic contents in forage maize field have been determined and compared across two growing seasons the major objectives of this study were designed as follows 1 to assess the responses of forage productivity and water use to bsc inoculation and planting pattern 2 to clarify the dynamics of soil physical properties and soil organic carbon nitrogen accumulation in response to bsc inoculation 3 to evaluate economic benefit as affected by bsc addition and 4 to confirm the feasibility and potentials of bsc to restore degraded soils while improving field productivity in the semiarid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study was

results 3 1 forage biomass different planting patterns led to pronounced differences in fresh shoot and root biomass production of forage maize fig 2 over the two growing seasons shoot biomass was increased by 53 63 in bsc 7 21 in rf and 3 24 in srf respectively relative to ck fig 2a b similarly the root biomass was improved by 30 31 in bsc 5 6 in rf and 11 19 respectively comparing with ck p 0 05 fig 2c d repeated measures anova analysis showed that the inoculation of bsc significantly enhanced maize shoot and root biomass p 0 05 relative to ck yet ridge furrow systems rf and srf were observed to slightly improve biomass production without significant different except for the shoot biomass of rf fig 2e f 3 2 soil temperature and soil water storage capacity soil temperature and soil water content swc were measured in different planting patterns and two growing seasons fig 3 fig 4 following two year planting swc was significantly higher in bsc than ck did also especially in each april repeated measures anova analysis showed that there was no significant difference in swc between bsc and rf treatments cross whole growing stages while srf was markedly different from ck p 0 05 fig 3 noticeably soil temperatures was significantly higher in bsc than other planting treatments and ck in two growing seasons fig 4 furthermore it was higher in the rf and srf treatments than ck similar trend was observed in two growing seasons totally repeated measures anova analysis showed that bsc treatments resulted in significant higher soil water storage in two growing seasons compared to rf srf and ck p 0 05 fig 4 3 3 soil ph soil bulk density sbd and soil total porosity stp soil ph sbd and stp were measured and compared among different planting patterns since they were the key indicators of soil physical properties fig 5 from oct 2018 to apr 2020 soil ph showed a slightly increasing trend in ck bsc and rf while srf presented a tendency of declined firstly then increasing and repeated measures anova analysis demonstrated than soil ph value of bsc was significantly low than ck rf and srf treatments indicating a phenomenon of soil acidification fig 5a similarly bsc inoculation decreased sbd significantly compared with ck rf and srf and uch trend was mildly enhanced by the end of second growing season fig 5b on the contrary the stp showed the opposite trend across 2018 2019 growing season and 2020 fallow period repeated measures anova analysis indicated than stp of bsc was significantly greater than rf and srf p 0 05 while rf and srf presented a markedly decreasing trend relative to ck p 0 05 fig 5c 3 4 the dynamics of soil microbial biomass dynamics of soil microbial biomass were compared among different planting patterns during two growing seasons since microbial biomass was a critical indicator of soil carbon and nitrogen pool as shown in fig 6 in 2018 the contents of mbc mbn and mbc mbn were significantly higher by 75 89 59 124 and 22 19 respectively in the bsc treatment compared to ck p 0 05 fig 6a b c rf and srf treatments also showed a mild increasing trend compared to ck fig 6a b c similarly in the 2019 the bsc inoculation distinctly enhanced the contents of mbc mbn mbc mbn by 25 55 31 54 and 19 18 p 0 05 respectively compared to ck particularly in apr 2020 it increased soil mbc mbn and mbc mbn by 46 43 and 2 respectively compared to ck fig 6a b c in addition repeated measures anova analysis demonstrated that the bsc inoculation significant increased mbc and mbn level in comparison with ck rf and srf treatments p 0 05 yet the mbc mbn ratio was no significantly affected 3 5 soil organic carbon total nitrogen and carbon nitrogen ratio the highest soc and tn contents were observed under the bsc inoculation followed by srf rf and ck the two parameters displayed fluctuating rising trend from apr 2018 to apr 2020 however the carbon nitrogen c n ratio showed an opposite trend in two growing seasons fig 6 compared with ck the bsc inoculation significantly improved the soc and tn concentration p 0 05 w specifically the bsc treatments increased the soc and tn content by 17 25 and 13 44 compared with ck during the period from 2018 to 2020 respectively on the other hand the soc and tn level in rf and srf treatment presented a slight increasing trend in 2018 and c n ratio showed opposite trend compared to ck yet those parameters displayed less change after apr 2019 except for tn and c n ratio in apr 2019 fig 6d e in contrast the c n ratio tended to gradually reduced in the bsc treatment in two growing seasons compared with ck fig 6f in addition repeated measures anova analysis showed that bsc inoculation significantly increased soc and tn content than ck rf and srf treatments p 0 05 particularly the soc tn ratio was significantly lower than ck rf and srf p 0 05 3 6 soil net nitrification net ammonification and net n mineralization the net nitrification net ammonification and net n mineralization in forage maize field showed a differentiate pattern under three treatments in two growing seasons fig 7a b c the net nitrification was significantly greater in bsc than ck rf and srf treatment fig 7a similarly in two growing season from 2018 to 2019 the bsc and rf treatments significantly enhanced the net ammonification relative to ck in which the effect of bsc treatment was the strongest fig 7b additionally the net n mineralization also showed the similar trend as presented above overall inoculated bsc resulted in the highest mineralization rate was 8 23 and 6 24 greater in rf and srf than ck respectively fig 7c 3 7 cumulative c mineralization and c mineralization rate the dynamics of soil cumulative c mineralization and c mineralization rate in bsc and ridge furrow systems are presented in fig 7 in all four groups soil cumulative c mineralization amount was generally increased with the continuous incubation time and the of bsc treatment was markedly greater than other three groups interestingly the rf and srf treatments started to decline after incubation for 60 days on the other hand soil cumulative c mineralization amount was significantly greater under bsc inoculation than control p 0 05 in addition the amount of soil c mineralization in rf and srf group was also generally greater than ck except after 50 days fig 7d similarly the soil c mineralization rate of all treatments showed a similar changing pattern i e the c mineralization rate was highest at the first incubation day then gradually decreased at the late stage of inoculation it started to remain stable critically the c mineralization rate was the highest in the bsc condition relative to other groups p 0 05 fig 7e 3 8 economic benefit the total cost varied from 2875 to 7975 cny ha 1 in 2018 and 2875 4975 cny ha 1 in 2019 in the four planting systems respectively table 1 in general bsc inoculation had the highest total cost in comparison with ck rf and srf due to the additional high cost to purchase bsc material in 2018 simultaneously bsc treatment was found to have the highest total cost owing to its high labor cost in managing bsc material in 2019 however the bsc treatment achieved the highest total profit ranging from 9133 to 13 961 cny ha 1 in 2018 and 9622 to 15 699 cny ha 1 in 2019 respectively to sum up the economic benefit was presented as the following order srf rf ck bsc in 2018 when it came to 2019 bsc inoculation turned to harvest markedly higher net economic benefit than other three planting systems in 2019 with the order of bsc rf srf ck whereas it showed that bsc inoculation was markedly higher than other three planting systems in 2019 showing bsc rf srf ck 3 9 relationships among the soil physicochemical parameters and biomass in order to evaluate the effects of bsc inoculation on soil quality and plant growth it is needed to quantitatively analyze the relationships among soil physicochemical parameters and plant biomass the sem results indicated that different planting patterns substantially affected the relationships among soil physicochemical parameters microbial biomass c n mineralization rates and biomass fig 8 firstly different planting patterns ck bsc rf and srf had different effects on soil moisture and sbd which varied from each other in ck across two growing seasons the dynamics of soc tn and microbial biomass were closely linked with sbd and swc and microbial biomass was associated with soil tn c n and soc whereas biomass accumulation can be explained by the n mineralization fig 8a as affected by bsc a large proportion in microbial biomass variation can be described by sbd and soc c mineralization can be depicted by sbd moreover soil n mineralization can be accounted by swc and tn whereas the most of the variation in biomass accumulation were explained by the n mineralization fig 8b when it came to rf treatments microbial biomass was tightly associated with sbd soc and tn c mineralization variations can be described by soc and microbial biomass while n mineralization can be explained by soil tn and microbial biomass fig 8c in addition a high proportion of soc tn and microbial biomass can be explained by swc and plant biomass can be explained by n mineralization fig 8d fig 8d 4 discussion 4 1 effects of bsc on forage maize biomass soil temperature is a key factor in semiarid rainfed field and often positively affects plant productivity highe soil temperatures can promote nutrient decomposition rate by increasing the movement of soluble substrates in the soil jian et al 2020 in the present study inoculated bsc and rf planting models evidently promoted the growth of shoot and root the data indicated that the inoculation of bsc exerted a significant promoting effect on biomass accumulation fig 2 in most cases this sort of promoting effect was closely associated with different indicators such as soil temperature water use efficiency and soil fertilizer qin et al 2018 atieno et al 2020 primarily soil temperature can directly enhance roots growth and fine root generation and indirectly improve water and nutrient absorption by roots via affecting soil microbial activities and organic matter decomposition and transformation kuzyakov and xu 2013 in this study the average soil temperature was 0 62 higher in bsc treatment than ck fig 4 it was possible for crust covering to reduce the heat loss from soils and the differences in soil temperature between day and night time on the other hand due to the coverage of bsc soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization amount were observed to increase this was beneficial to provide sufficient nutrients for the growth of microorganisms the better growth of microbial communities can increase microbial diversity and further promote the nutrients absorption by plants bimüller et al 2016 jiang et al 2021 in addition the pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed that the shoot and root biomass have less correlation with soil temperature fig s1 this was mainly because the test plots were located on the windward slope and the ground temperature was generally low to most extent this can offsets the difference in temperature among the treatments on the other hand soil water storage is an essential factor affecting water uptake and plant growth legates et al 2011 in the present study the bsc inoculation showed no significant difference in swc compared with ck and rf treatment fig 3 as a pioneer vegetation in arid and semi arid areas the growth performance of bsc can reflect local climate change exactly xiao and hu 2017 generally bsc tend to grow better in moist and shaded environments in this study forage maize provided a relatively shaded and humid growing environment for bsc growth and the latter in turn increased surface infiltration of rainwater and reduced surface evapotranspiration this positive interaction can efficiently improve soil water availability in crop root zones particularly the structural equation model showed that sws had a positive effect on biomass accumulation fig 8 and since maize biomass was the highest as affected by the bsc this trend also implied that high biomass frequently resulted from high soil water consumption f li et al 2020 m li et al 2020 y li et al 2020 in this region annual precipitation was relatively low and uneven and further limited crop biomass accumulation liu et al 2014 moreover fertilization is another important factor affecting crop growth f li et al 2020 m li et al 2020 y li et al 2020 globally a large amount of chemical fertilizer have been used in agricultural population sun et al 2020 this practice has caused increasing degradation in soil quality in the current study bsc introduction was found to significantly enhance maize biomass which was probably resulted from the contribution of bsc to soil carbon and nitrogen stocks also soil microbial biomass turned to promote soil nutrient transformation organic matter mineralization it can facilitate the recycling of soil carbon nitrogen phosphorus and other elements liu et al 2017 in this regard soil microbial biomass is considered as an important source of soil fertility ramírez et al 2020 according to our observations the contents of soil mbc and mbn in bsc treatment were significantly greater than that of other three groups fig 6a b demonstrating that the application of bsc not only accelerate the mineralization and decomposition of soil organic matter and nitrogen but also improved the physical and chemical properties of soils to sum up bsc addition can help increase soil microbial biomass and ultimately elevate plant biomass duan et al 2021 4 2 effects of bsc on soil physical structure existing studies showed that soil structure is closely associated with soil bulk density and soil porosity a recent study showed that the soils with a low bulk density and high porosity can be used as an indicator of improvement in soil structure belnap and büdel 2016 zhou et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 our results indicated that following the inoculation of bsc soil bulk density was significantly decreased fig 5b a possible explanation was that the inoculation of bsc improved soil carbon and nitrogen supply and simultaneously enhanced nutrient availability in soils this process was helpful to fill the spaces among soil particles with root exudates rodriguez caballero et al 2018 according to our observations suggesting that high soil bulk density was negatively correlated with maize biomass fig s1 suggesting that the high soil bulk density was closely correlated with soil compaction and consequently reduced the air proportion in soils ramírez et al 2020 thus appropriate soil bulk density was helpful to provide relatively sufficient nutrients for the aboveground part such as stem and leaf particularly at the later growth stage finally fine nutrient supply was critical for delaying maize senescence promoting photosynthesis and increasing dry matter accumulation in the later growth stages 4 3 effects of bsc on soil carbon mineralization in semiarid agricultural system soc accumulation is briefly derived the balance between carbon inputs and soc mineralization outputs generally carbon input is mainly resulted from crop shoot and root biomass while carbon mineralization is highly dependent on soil physicochemical and microbiological characteristics f li et al 2020 m li et al 2020 y li et al 2020 in present study soc was observed to increase as a result of bsc inoculation fig 6d furthermore higher shoot and root biomass were observed in bsc treatment fig 2 pearson analysis showed that soil carbon level was significantly positive associated with shoot and root biomasses fig s1 existing knowledge indicated that the number of root litter can potentially increase soil c storage and proved the potential of carbon sequestration as reported previously the inoculation of bsc can increase the input of root litter in soils add organic matter to soils and ultimately enhanced carbon mineralization jiang et al 2021 man et al 2020 also found that increasing soil carbon input via root litter an result in higher levels of decomposed c our data suggested that inoculated bsc significantly improved soil cumulative carbon mineralization fig 7 especially with prolonged incubation time in addition the cumulative carbon mineralization amount of bsc treatment had a rapid increase up to a peak value on the 90th day in bsc treatment relative to other four groups however the carbon mineralization rate exhibited an opposite trend noticeably it shortly reached the highest value after 1 day incubation and showed a rapid decline in following 20 days after that it turned to be relatively stable fig 7d e the possible reason was that at the beginning of cultivation there existed relatively sufficient nutrients supply in soil for microbial activity ty maintenance this status turned to increase the release of co2 and soil organic carbon mineralization rate as time prolonged soil nutrient supply started to reduce which in turn lowered microbial activities in this case the release of co2 and the mineralization rate decreased accordingly the data demonstrated a time dependent dynamics of carbon mineralization amount and its rate in response to the bsc addition to sum up biocrust mulching can elevate soil carbon level and the mbc mbn concentration while lowering c n ratio through regulating microorganism activities and cumulative co2 release yan et al 2021 4 4 effects of bsc on soil nitrogen mineralization soil nitrogen is a key element in the nitrogen cycle and mobilization in general its bioavailability is highly dependent on nitrogen mineralization in soils theoretically soil nitrogen mineralization is defined as the conversion of organic nitrogen to its inorganic forms hu et al 2014 one way anova analysis showed that the net nitrification net ammonification and net nitrogen mineralization in the soil were totally promoted across all the bsc involved plots ultimately reaching up to the highest value fig 7 shan et al 2011 found that soil temperature soil moisture and soil microbes significantly affect soil inorganic nitrogen transformation and nitrogen mineralization particularly soil microbes are among the dominant elements affecting soil nitrogen mineralization shan et al 2011 as presented above soil nitrogen mineralization was significantly positively correlated with the contents of soil nitrogen in this study fig s1 hence it can be argued that the dynamics of nitrogen mineralization were largely dependent on the microbial activities as a result of bsc inoculation soil carbon and nitrogen sources would be elevated and beneficial for microbial growth in summary the increasing colonization of bsc played a vital role in soil nitrogen transformation marusenko et al 2013 under the presence of bsc nitrogen mineralization was highly relied on high temperature and soil moisture hu et al 2014 fine hydrothermal environment can efficiently stimulate microbial metabolic activities and biomass accumulation and ultimately enhanced nitrogen mineralization interestingly our results indicated that nitrogen mineralization was less correlated with soil temperature fig s1 this may be due to the relatively cold climate environment in our study site on the northwest of the loess plateau local ground temperature was in a low level across the whole growing season in present study the differences in soil and air temperature among the treatments were not evident in addition the difference in swc was not a key indicator to judge water use dynamic across two growing seasons therefore the mineralization of soil nitrogen was only slightly correlated with soil temperature and swc 4 5 effects of bsc on forage maize economic benefits a common knowledge is that economic benefit of agricultural production is frequently affected by composite series of factors including labor input commercial fertilizer field management commercial seeds market price dynamics and so on zhang et al 2017 mo et al 2017 found that net economic benefit was increased when the mulching tillage technology was applied by local farmers mulching treatment can help promote crop productivity and thereby improve the profitability of producers in our study the economic benefit of bsc treatment was relatively low with only 272 cny ha 1 in 2018 in compared with ck yet it turned to increase up to 3977 cny ha 1 in 2019 a relatively high value this was mainly because of the differences in annual input in two trial years in the first year higher budget was input to purchase materials and hire labors this indeed increased the early investment and accordingly led to low net benefit in bsc treatment in 2018 when it came to 2019 there were no inputs to purchase the materials of bsc and others bsc resources were available for the use in second growing season which accordingly reduced economic input and promoted economic profit another reason was that the bsc inoculation improved soil quality and water availability which turned to enhance shoot biomass harvest this trend can evidently improve economic benefits in addition there was less labor input in 2019 since labor was the necessary factor for agricultural production hoagland et al 2010 in practice labor cost was truly greater in the mulching condition than that of on mulching while grain income was much greater than the latter as is widely known mulching planting has outstanding advantages in increasing productivity mo et al 2017 also ridge and furrow system has similar effectiveness as mulching system did in present study economic benefits in rr and srf treatments were slightly greater by 16 19 and 13 23 respectively relative to ck to some extent rf and srf establishments can help collect and store more rainwater resource and thus result in relatively higher productivity in this study both rf and srf were used as the nbs to diminish the environmental risks as did by plastic mulching in semiarid rainfed agricultural system comparatively the bsc introduction achieved relatively high economic harvest as a nbs in this case bsc inoculation can act as a promising adaptive farming management to improve soil quality promote maize dry matter accumulation and increase farmers revenue in the rural communities dominated by small farmers currently the low consumption but high efficiency sustainable agricultural production pattern is urgently needed muo and azeez 2019 in this study bsc inoculation displayed a promising potential in this aspect while the bsc establishment required relatively high input in the first growing season it turned to save some of investments in the second one the bsc input led to relatively high net economic output following two growing season more importantly it significantly resulted in better ecological environment effectiveness it is noted that current investigation has been performed on the basis of pure manual operation by small farmers if the industrial solution and organizational management system were incorporated in the bsc application manpower cost would be lowered substantially along with the development of industrial 4 0 worldwide the bsc led green solution would be effectively applied and extended certainly it requires strong interdisciplinary cooperation to combine with artificial intelligent and corporate with commercial sectors it can be predicted that new industrial solution can greatly reduce the cost of the transplantation and management of bsc and reach a wide acceptability by small farmers it is noted that further investigations should be needed in terms of bsc research and development as a nbs in present study a destructive sampling method was used to collect bsc materials the inoculated parts consisted of top part rhizoid part and rhizoid soil complex 1 cm depth to some extent they played critical functional roles of carbon nitrogen source providing necessary nutrients for crop growth yet the differentiate contribution of three parts were not systematically identified and compared also the investigation was only conducted in semiarid rainfed agricultural region it is needed to evaluate the ecological and productive effects of bsc in a wider climatic scope in addition the bsc material used in this study belonged to moss type more types of biocrusts should be tested and screened to identify their corresponding structures and functions however this study first reported the positive effects of moss led bsc on soil restoration the effects would be more pronounced when combining with no tillage strategy 5 conclusions in the semiarid northwest china plastic film mulching has brought about increasing white pollution and soil degradation over last two decades it is urgently needed to explore a green solution to restore soil structure and fertility via a nature based strategy we found that the bsc played a crucial functional role in increasing maize biomass and improving soil microbial biomass through decreasing soil c n ratio and enhancing soil c n mineralization particularly the bsc can significantly improve physical structure and nutrient cycling of soils the results also highlighted the functional role of bsc in optimizing soil c n availability the introduction of bsc into degraded cropland can be regarded as a novel nature based strategy to balance soil productivity and sustainability at the same time attention should be paid on how to combine bsc strategy and big data in the future so as to realize the intelligent and efficient cultivation and management of bsc in conclusion bsc can act as a promising nature based strategy to conserve soil system in semi arid rainfed agricultural regions finally further explorations would be necessary in a wider scope and more species types declaration of

9434,biological soil crust bsc as a nature based strategy has a great potential to restore soil and water in arid and semi arid natural ecosystems yet little is known about its effects on soil fertility and productivity as affected by the bsc inoculation in agroecosystems we hypothesis that bsc inoculation can improve soil quality while increasing crop productivity and economic benefits in semiarid rainfed region to address this issue we carried out field experiment using forage maize zea mays l from 2018 to 2019 with four treatments as follows 1 conventional flat planting control ck 2 flat planting with the inoculation of bsc bsc 3 ridge furrow planting rf and 4 sectional ridge furrow planting srf the results showed that bsc inoculation significantly enhanced maize shoot and root biomass by 53 63 and 30 67 accordingly p 0 05 compared with ck in two growing seasons also bsc treatment slightly increased soil water content and soil temperature while significantly decreasing soil ph and soil bulk density relative to ck rf and srf p 0 05 compared with ck the bsc inoculation markedly improved soil microbial biomass carbon by 54 and nitrogen by 52 soil organic carbon by 21 and total nitrogen by 30 respectively p 0 05 critically the contents of above four parameters were 42 32 19 and 32 greater in bsc than rf and srf respectively p 0 05 simultaneously the bsc significantly decreased soil c n ratio by 7 while srf and rf slightly decreased c n ratio by 0 2 and 2 only in comparison with ck interestingly soil c n mineralization efficiency were significantly greater in the bsc treatment than ck rf and srf p 0 05 in addition the economic benefit under bsc was the highest relative to other three planting systems in conclusion bsc can be used as a nature based strategy nbs to improve soil properties promote microbial c n uptake and utilization via enhancing c n mineralization and lowering c n ratio in conclusion bsc can act as a green solution to achieve high productivity and promote soil fertility in semiarid agricultural ecosystem keywords biological soil crust soil physical structure soil carbon nitrogen mineralization forage maize agroecosystem 1 introduction in the arid and semi arid regions of china most of agricultural lands are mountainous and hilly areas with poor soil quality and accelerated soil erosion zhang et al 2021 unpredictable rainfall high evaporation rate and low water utilization efficiency frequently aggravate drought stress and negatively affect agricultural production qin et al 2018 also poor soil quality low precipitation and high temperature are the limiting factors this regions mo et al 2016 to cope with the above issues some management strategies have been adapted to improve soil quality water use and crop production including the conversion of cropland to grassland crop rotation ridge furrow with film mulching and so on gu et al 2021 over last decades plastic film mulch and chemical fertilizers have been widely used to improve crop yield li et al 2018 q li et al 2018 x r li et al 2018 however the remains of residual film in soil after plastic film mulching can result in soil compaction hinders root growth and ultimately reduce crop yield f li et al 2020 m li et al 2020 y li et al 2020 in addition inappropriate use of chemical fertilizer has also brought many problems such as imbalanced soil nutrient reduced microbial diversity and degraded soil structure chen et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to find an appropriate and efficient strategy to sustain and or improve soil quality and crop yield currently an innovative nature based strategy nbs is extremely desirable under global environment change especially in the arid and semi arid agricultural lands hérivaux and coent 2021 in this regard biofertilizer is considered as a nbs to improve soil fertility and crop productivity its development and application have received a wide attention in the last decade due to its eco friendly nature atieno et al 2020 maroušek et al 2020a found that the fermentation and utilization of biogas residues could increase soil water retention enhance yields and improve the economy beside its eco friendly nature biofertilizers can supply nutrients improve soil health soil properties and consequently increase crop yield currently an innovative nature based strategy nbs is

improve soil health soil properties and consequently increase crop yield existing study suggests that biological soil crusts bsc can be considered as an effective biofertilizer to fix carbon and nitrogen and improve soil fertility vinoth et al 2020 conceptually the bsc are ndowed with a special structure built by microbial phototrophs most commonly as cyanobacteria they can aggregate on soil surfaces in arid and semiarid areas gao et al 2020 during the period of growth and development they can produce plant growth promoting hormones and growth regulating substances like vitamins amino acids and sugars vinoth et al 2020 on the other hand the dry matter of bsc can contributes to the accumulation of organic matter and nitrogen fixation thus improving soil fertility zhao et al 2020 also bsc can markedly improve water holding capacity and soil temperature q li et al 2018 x r li et al 2018 and help improve soil quality gao et al 2020 malam issa et al 2001 demonstrated that bcs organisms were able to boost surface soils stabilize via binding fine particles and soil organic matter into macroaggregate adessi et al 2018 found that the water holding capacity was reduced by 80 under the absence of cyanobacteria exopolysaccharides hashim et al 2020 reported the soil particles binding was highly depend on the presence of filaments and secreted exopolysaccharides some evidences indicated that the soil stability under bsc inoculation can be elevated by 135 relative to that of non inoculation kuwabara et al 2021 thus the bsc inoculation may play a critical role in enhancing soil ability to resist erosion in short bsc are likely to act as a crucial nbs to boost the sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems zhao et al 2021 on the other hand soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn are ubiquitous as soil quality indicator bünemann et al 2018 in general soc and tn contents are affected by a series of factors such as root litter diversity man et al 2020 microbial activity wei et al 2020 and mineralization al maliki and breesam 2020 in this aspect carbon mineralization is an important indicator of the soc decomposition bahn et al 2008 it is to most extent controlled by soil microbes and nutrient supply and the latter can be frequently affected by biotic and abioticfactors such as root residues soil temperature hu et al 2014 water availability mo et al 2016 and soil properties al maliki and breesam 2020 similarly soil n mineralization is another key component affecting n cycling in terrestrial ecosystems hasi et al 2021 in contrast it is also largely affected by soil physical and chemical properties including soil bulk density bimüller et al 2016 soil temperature liu et al 2017 carbon and nitrogen contents chen et al 2019 organic matter inputs in rhizosphere jiang et al 2021 and soil microbial diversity and activity kuzyakov and xu 2013 to sum up the bsc play a major role in the degradation ecosystem conservation since they can provide a rapid and accurate solution to restore soil quality hu et al 2014 in desert ecosystems the importance of bsc in c and n mineralization has been widely recognized zhao et al 2021 however few studies were available about the effects of bsc on soil c and n accumulations n agroecosystems to address the above issue we hypothesized that bsc inoculation might improve soil quality while increasing crop productivity and economic benefits in degraded agricultural soils in order to test the hypothesis field experiment was carried out in the slope field of forage maize zea mays l located in the semiarid region of loess plateau northwest china in this study soil physical properties microbial biomass nitrogen and organic contents in forage maize field have been determined and compared across two growing seasons the major objectives of this study were designed as follows 1 to assess the responses of forage productivity and water use to bsc inoculation and planting pattern 2 to clarify the dynamics of soil physical properties and soil organic carbon nitrogen accumulation in response to bsc inoculation 3 to evaluate economic benefit as affected by bsc addition and 4 to confirm the feasibility and potentials of bsc to restore degraded soils while improving field productivity in the semiarid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study was

results 3 1 forage biomass different planting patterns led to pronounced differences in fresh shoot and root biomass production of forage maize fig 2 over the two growing seasons shoot biomass was increased by 53 63 in bsc 7 21 in rf and 3 24 in srf respectively relative to ck fig 2a b similarly the root biomass was improved by 30 31 in bsc 5 6 in rf and 11 19 respectively comparing with ck p 0 05 fig 2c d repeated measures anova analysis showed that the inoculation of bsc significantly enhanced maize shoot and root biomass p 0 05 relative to ck yet ridge furrow systems rf and srf were observed to slightly improve biomass production without significant different except for the shoot biomass of rf fig 2e f 3 2 soil temperature and soil water storage capacity soil temperature and soil water content swc were measured in different planting patterns and two growing seasons fig 3 fig 4 following two year planting swc was significantly higher in bsc than ck did also especially in each april repeated measures anova analysis showed that there was no significant difference in swc between bsc and rf treatments cross whole growing stages while srf was markedly different from ck p 0 05 fig 3 noticeably soil temperatures was significantly higher in bsc than other planting treatments and ck in two growing seasons fig 4 furthermore it was higher in the rf and srf treatments than ck similar trend was observed in two growing seasons totally repeated measures anova analysis showed that bsc treatments resulted in significant higher soil water storage in two growing seasons compared to rf srf and ck p 0 05 fig 4 3 3 soil ph soil bulk density sbd and soil total porosity stp soil ph sbd and stp were measured and compared among different planting patterns since they were the key indicators of soil physical properties fig 5 from oct 2018 to apr 2020 soil ph showed a slightly increasing trend in ck bsc and rf while srf presented a tendency of declined firstly then increasing and repeated measures anova analysis demonstrated than soil ph value of bsc was significantly low than ck rf and srf treatments indicating a phenomenon of soil acidification fig 5a similarly bsc inoculation decreased sbd significantly compared with ck rf and srf and uch trend was mildly enhanced by the end of second growing season fig 5b on the contrary the stp showed the opposite trend across 2018 2019 growing season and 2020 fallow period repeated measures anova analysis indicated than stp of bsc was significantly greater than rf and srf p 0 05 while rf and srf presented a markedly decreasing trend relative to ck p 0 05 fig 5c 3 4 the dynamics of soil microbial biomass dynamics of soil microbial biomass were compared among different planting patterns during two growing seasons since microbial biomass was a critical indicator of soil carbon and nitrogen pool as shown in fig 6 in 2018 the contents of mbc mbn and mbc mbn were significantly higher by 75 89 59 124 and 22 19 respectively in the bsc treatment compared to ck p 0 05 fig 6a b c rf and srf treatments also showed a mild increasing trend compared to ck fig 6a b c similarly in the 2019 the bsc inoculation distinctly enhanced the contents of mbc mbn mbc mbn by 25 55 31 54 and 19 18 p 0 05 respectively compared to ck particularly in apr 2020 it increased soil mbc mbn and mbc mbn by 46 43 and 2 respectively compared to ck fig 6a b c in addition repeated measures anova analysis demonstrated that the bsc inoculation significant increased mbc and mbn level in comparison with ck rf and srf treatments p 0 05 yet the mbc mbn ratio was no significantly affected 3 5 soil organic carbon total nitrogen and carbon nitrogen ratio the highest soc and tn contents were observed under the bsc inoculation followed by srf rf and ck the two parameters displayed fluctuating rising trend from apr 2018 to apr 2020 however the carbon nitrogen c n ratio showed an opposite trend in two growing seasons fig 6 compared with ck the bsc inoculation significantly improved the soc and tn concentration p 0 05 w specifically the bsc treatments increased the soc and tn content by 17 25 and 13 44 compared with ck during the period from 2018 to 2020 respectively on the other hand the soc and tn level in rf and srf treatment presented a slight increasing trend in 2018 and c n ratio showed opposite trend compared to ck yet those parameters displayed less change after apr 2019 except for tn and c n ratio in apr 2019 fig 6d e in contrast the c n ratio tended to gradually reduced in the bsc treatment in two growing seasons compared with ck fig 6f in addition repeated measures anova analysis showed that bsc inoculation significantly increased soc and tn content than ck rf and srf treatments p 0 05 particularly the soc tn ratio was significantly lower than ck rf and srf p 0 05 3 6 soil net nitrification net ammonification and net n mineralization the net nitrification net ammonification and net n mineralization in forage maize field showed a differentiate pattern under three treatments in two growing seasons fig 7a b c the net nitrification was significantly greater in bsc than ck rf and srf treatment fig 7a similarly in two growing season from 2018 to 2019 the bsc and rf treatments significantly enhanced the net ammonification relative to ck in which the effect of bsc treatment was the strongest fig 7b additionally the net n mineralization also showed the similar trend as presented above overall inoculated bsc resulted in the highest mineralization rate was 8 23 and 6 24 greater in rf and srf than ck respectively fig 7c 3 7 cumulative c mineralization and c mineralization rate the dynamics of soil cumulative c mineralization and c mineralization rate in bsc and ridge furrow systems are presented in fig 7 in all four groups soil cumulative c mineralization amount was generally increased with the continuous incubation time and the of bsc treatment was markedly greater than other three groups interestingly the rf and srf treatments started to decline after incubation for 60 days on the other hand soil cumulative c mineralization amount was significantly greater under bsc inoculation than control p 0 05 in addition the amount of soil c mineralization in rf and srf group was also generally greater than ck except after 50 days fig 7d similarly the soil c mineralization rate of all treatments showed a similar changing pattern i e the c mineralization rate was highest at the first incubation day then gradually decreased at the late stage of inoculation it started to remain stable critically the c mineralization rate was the highest in the bsc condition relative to other groups p 0 05 fig 7e 3 8 economic benefit the total cost varied from 2875 to 7975 cny ha 1 in 2018 and 2875 4975 cny ha 1 in 2019 in the four planting systems respectively table 1 in general bsc inoculation had the highest total cost in comparison with ck rf and srf due to the additional high cost to purchase bsc material in 2018 simultaneously bsc treatment was found to have the highest total cost owing to its high labor cost in managing bsc material in 2019 however the bsc treatment achieved the highest total profit ranging from 9133 to 13 961 cny ha 1 in 2018 and 9622 to 15 699 cny ha 1 in 2019 respectively to sum up the economic benefit was presented as the following order srf rf ck bsc in 2018 when it came to 2019 bsc inoculation turned to harvest markedly higher net economic benefit than other three planting systems in 2019 with the order of bsc rf srf ck whereas it showed that bsc inoculation was markedly higher than other three planting systems in 2019 showing bsc rf srf ck 3 9 relationships among the soil physicochemical parameters and biomass in order to evaluate the effects of bsc inoculation on soil quality and plant growth it is needed to quantitatively analyze the relationships among soil physicochemical parameters and plant biomass the sem results indicated that different planting patterns substantially affected the relationships among soil physicochemical parameters microbial biomass c n mineralization rates and biomass fig 8 firstly different planting patterns ck bsc rf and srf had different effects on soil moisture and sbd which varied from each other in ck across two growing seasons the dynamics of soc tn and microbial biomass were closely linked with sbd and swc and microbial biomass was associated with soil tn c n and soc whereas biomass accumulation can be explained by the n mineralization fig 8a as affected by bsc a large proportion in microbial biomass variation can be described by sbd and soc c mineralization can be depicted by sbd moreover soil n mineralization can be accounted by swc and tn whereas the most of the variation in biomass accumulation were explained by the n mineralization fig 8b when it came to rf treatments microbial biomass was tightly associated with sbd soc and tn c mineralization variations can be described by soc and microbial biomass while n mineralization can be explained by soil tn and microbial biomass fig 8c in addition a high proportion of soc tn and microbial biomass can be explained by swc and plant biomass can be explained by n mineralization fig 8d fig 8d 4 discussion 4 1 effects of bsc on forage maize biomass soil temperature is a key factor in semiarid rainfed field and often positively affects plant productivity highe soil temperatures can promote nutrient decomposition rate by increasing the movement of soluble substrates in the soil jian et al 2020 in the present study inoculated bsc and rf planting models evidently promoted the growth of shoot and root the data indicated that the inoculation of bsc exerted a significant promoting effect on biomass accumulation fig 2 in most cases this sort of promoting effect was closely associated with different indicators such as soil temperature water use efficiency and soil fertilizer qin et al 2018 atieno et al 2020 primarily soil temperature can directly enhance roots growth and fine root generation and indirectly improve water and nutrient absorption by roots via affecting soil microbial activities and organic matter decomposition and transformation kuzyakov and xu 2013 in this study the average soil temperature was 0 62 higher in bsc treatment than ck fig 4 it was possible for crust covering to reduce the heat loss from soils and the differences in soil temperature between day and night time on the other hand due to the coverage of bsc soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization amount were observed to increase this was beneficial to provide sufficient nutrients for the growth of microorganisms the better growth of microbial communities can increase microbial diversity and further promote the nutrients absorption by plants bimüller et al 2016 jiang et al 2021 in addition the pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed that the shoot and root biomass have less correlation with soil temperature fig s1 this was mainly because the test plots were located on the windward slope and the ground temperature was generally low to most extent this can offsets the difference in temperature among the treatments on the other hand soil water storage is an essential factor affecting water uptake and plant growth legates et al 2011 in the present study the bsc inoculation showed no significant difference in swc compared with ck and rf treatment fig 3 as a pioneer vegetation in arid and semi arid areas the growth performance of bsc can reflect local climate change exactly xiao and hu 2017 generally bsc tend to grow better in moist and shaded environments in this study forage maize provided a relatively shaded and humid growing environment for bsc growth and the latter in turn increased surface infiltration of rainwater and reduced surface evapotranspiration this positive interaction can efficiently improve soil water availability in crop root zones particularly the structural equation model showed that sws had a positive effect on biomass accumulation fig 8 and since maize biomass was the highest as affected by the bsc this trend also implied that high biomass frequently resulted from high soil water consumption f li et al 2020 m li et al 2020 y li et al 2020 in this region annual precipitation was relatively low and uneven and further limited crop biomass accumulation liu et al 2014 moreover fertilization is another important factor affecting crop growth f li et al 2020 m li et al 2020 y li et al 2020 globally a large amount of chemical fertilizer have been used in agricultural population sun et al 2020 this practice has caused increasing degradation in soil quality in the current study bsc introduction was found to significantly enhance maize biomass which was probably resulted from the contribution of bsc to soil carbon and nitrogen stocks also soil microbial biomass turned to promote soil nutrient transformation organic matter mineralization it can facilitate the recycling of soil carbon nitrogen phosphorus and other elements liu et al 2017 in this regard soil microbial biomass is considered as an important source of soil fertility ramírez et al 2020 according to our observations the contents of soil mbc and mbn in bsc treatment were significantly greater than that of other three groups fig 6a b demonstrating that the application of bsc not only accelerate the mineralization and decomposition of soil organic matter and nitrogen but also improved the physical and chemical properties of soils to sum up bsc addition can help increase soil microbial biomass and ultimately elevate plant biomass duan et al 2021 4 2 effects of bsc on soil physical structure existing studies showed that soil structure is closely associated with soil bulk density and soil porosity a recent study showed that the soils with a low bulk density and high porosity can be used as an indicator of improvement in soil structure belnap and büdel 2016 zhou et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 our results indicated that following the inoculation of bsc soil bulk density was significantly decreased fig 5b a possible explanation was that the inoculation of bsc improved soil carbon and nitrogen supply and simultaneously enhanced nutrient availability in soils this process was helpful to fill the spaces among soil particles with root exudates rodriguez caballero et al 2018 according to our observations suggesting that high soil bulk density was negatively correlated with maize biomass fig s1 suggesting that the high soil bulk density was closely correlated with soil compaction and consequently reduced the air proportion in soils ramírez et al 2020 thus appropriate soil bulk density was helpful to provide relatively sufficient nutrients for the aboveground part such as stem and leaf particularly at the later growth stage finally fine nutrient supply was critical for delaying maize senescence promoting photosynthesis and increasing dry matter accumulation in the later growth stages 4 3 effects of bsc on soil carbon mineralization in semiarid agricultural system soc accumulation is briefly derived the balance between carbon inputs and soc mineralization outputs generally carbon input is mainly resulted from crop shoot and root biomass while carbon mineralization is highly dependent on soil physicochemical and microbiological characteristics f li et al 2020 m li et al 2020 y li et al 2020 in present study soc was observed to increase as a result of bsc inoculation fig 6d furthermore higher shoot and root biomass were observed in bsc treatment fig 2 pearson analysis showed that soil carbon level was significantly positive associated with shoot and root biomasses fig s1 existing knowledge indicated that the number of root litter can potentially increase soil c storage and proved the potential of carbon sequestration as reported previously the inoculation of bsc can increase the input of root litter in soils add organic matter to soils and ultimately enhanced carbon mineralization jiang et al 2021 man et al 2020 also found that increasing soil carbon input via root litter an result in higher levels of decomposed c our data suggested that inoculated bsc significantly improved soil cumulative carbon mineralization fig 7 especially with prolonged incubation time in addition the cumulative carbon mineralization amount of bsc treatment had a rapid increase up to a peak value on the 90th day in bsc treatment relative to other four groups however the carbon mineralization rate exhibited an opposite trend noticeably it shortly reached the highest value after 1 day incubation and showed a rapid decline in following 20 days after that it turned to be relatively stable fig 7d e the possible reason was that at the beginning of cultivation there existed relatively sufficient nutrients supply in soil for microbial activity ty maintenance this status turned to increase the release of co2 and soil organic carbon mineralization rate as time prolonged soil nutrient supply started to reduce which in turn lowered microbial activities in this case the release of co2 and the mineralization rate decreased accordingly the data demonstrated a time dependent dynamics of carbon mineralization amount and its rate in response to the bsc addition to sum up biocrust mulching can elevate soil carbon level and the mbc mbn concentration while lowering c n ratio through regulating microorganism activities and cumulative co2 release yan et al 2021 4 4 effects of bsc on soil nitrogen mineralization soil nitrogen is a key element in the nitrogen cycle and mobilization in general its bioavailability is highly dependent on nitrogen mineralization in soils theoretically soil nitrogen mineralization is defined as the conversion of organic nitrogen to its inorganic forms hu et al 2014 one way anova analysis showed that the net nitrification net ammonification and net nitrogen mineralization in the soil were totally promoted across all the bsc involved plots ultimately reaching up to the highest value fig 7 shan et al 2011 found that soil temperature soil moisture and soil microbes significantly affect soil inorganic nitrogen transformation and nitrogen mineralization particularly soil microbes are among the dominant elements affecting soil nitrogen mineralization shan et al 2011 as presented above soil nitrogen mineralization was significantly positively correlated with the contents of soil nitrogen in this study fig s1 hence it can be argued that the dynamics of nitrogen mineralization were largely dependent on the microbial activities as a result of bsc inoculation soil carbon and nitrogen sources would be elevated and beneficial for microbial growth in summary the increasing colonization of bsc played a vital role in soil nitrogen transformation marusenko et al 2013 under the presence of bsc nitrogen mineralization was highly relied on high temperature and soil moisture hu et al 2014 fine hydrothermal environment can efficiently stimulate microbial metabolic activities and biomass accumulation and ultimately enhanced nitrogen mineralization interestingly our results indicated that nitrogen mineralization was less correlated with soil temperature fig s1 this may be due to the relatively cold climate environment in our study site on the northwest of the loess plateau local ground temperature was in a low level across the whole growing season in present study the differences in soil and air temperature among the treatments were not evident in addition the difference in swc was not a key indicator to judge water use dynamic across two growing seasons therefore the mineralization of soil nitrogen was only slightly correlated with soil temperature and swc 4 5 effects of bsc on forage maize economic benefits a common knowledge is that economic benefit of agricultural production is frequently affected by composite series of factors including labor input commercial fertilizer field management commercial seeds market price dynamics and so on zhang et al 2017 mo et al 2017 found that net economic benefit was increased when the mulching tillage technology was applied by local farmers mulching treatment can help promote crop productivity and thereby improve the profitability of producers in our study the economic benefit of bsc treatment was relatively low with only 272 cny ha 1 in 2018 in compared with ck yet it turned to increase up to 3977 cny ha 1 in 2019 a relatively high value this was mainly because of the differences in annual input in two trial years in the first year higher budget was input to purchase materials and hire labors this indeed increased the early investment and accordingly led to low net benefit in bsc treatment in 2018 when it came to 2019 there were no inputs to purchase the materials of bsc and others bsc resources were available for the use in second growing season which accordingly reduced economic input and promoted economic profit another reason was that the bsc inoculation improved soil quality and water availability which turned to enhance shoot biomass harvest this trend can evidently improve economic benefits in addition there was less labor input in 2019 since labor was the necessary factor for agricultural production hoagland et al 2010 in practice labor cost was truly greater in the mulching condition than that of on mulching while grain income was much greater than the latter as is widely known mulching planting has outstanding advantages in increasing productivity mo et al 2017 also ridge and furrow system has similar effectiveness as mulching system did in present study economic benefits in rr and srf treatments were slightly greater by 16 19 and 13 23 respectively relative to ck to some extent rf and srf establishments can help collect and store more rainwater resource and thus result in relatively higher productivity in this study both rf and srf were used as the nbs to diminish the environmental risks as did by plastic mulching in semiarid rainfed agricultural system comparatively the bsc introduction achieved relatively high economic harvest as a nbs in this case bsc inoculation can act as a promising adaptive farming management to improve soil quality promote maize dry matter accumulation and increase farmers revenue in the rural communities dominated by small farmers currently the low consumption but high efficiency sustainable agricultural production pattern is urgently needed muo and azeez 2019 in this study bsc inoculation displayed a promising potential in this aspect while the bsc establishment required relatively high input in the first growing season it turned to save some of investments in the second one the bsc input led to relatively high net economic output following two growing season more importantly it significantly resulted in better ecological environment effectiveness it is noted that current investigation has been performed on the basis of pure manual operation by small farmers if the industrial solution and organizational management system were incorporated in the bsc application manpower cost would be lowered substantially along with the development of industrial 4 0 worldwide the bsc led green solution would be effectively applied and extended certainly it requires strong interdisciplinary cooperation to combine with artificial intelligent and corporate with commercial sectors it can be predicted that new industrial solution can greatly reduce the cost of the transplantation and management of bsc and reach a wide acceptability by small farmers it is noted that further investigations should be needed in terms of bsc research and development as a nbs in present study a destructive sampling method was used to collect bsc materials the inoculated parts consisted of top part rhizoid part and rhizoid soil complex 1 cm depth to some extent they played critical functional roles of carbon nitrogen source providing necessary nutrients for crop growth yet the differentiate contribution of three parts were not systematically identified and compared also the investigation was only conducted in semiarid rainfed agricultural region it is needed to evaluate the ecological and productive effects of bsc in a wider climatic scope in addition the bsc material used in this study belonged to moss type more types of biocrusts should be tested and screened to identify their corresponding structures and functions however this study first reported the positive effects of moss led bsc on soil restoration the effects would be more pronounced when combining with no tillage strategy 5 conclusions in the semiarid northwest china plastic film mulching has brought about increasing white pollution and soil degradation over last two decades it is urgently needed to explore a green solution to restore soil structure and fertility via a nature based strategy we found that the bsc played a crucial functional role in increasing maize biomass and improving soil microbial biomass through decreasing soil c n ratio and enhancing soil c n mineralization particularly the bsc can significantly improve physical structure and nutrient cycling of soils the results also highlighted the functional role of bsc in optimizing soil c n availability the introduction of bsc into degraded cropland can be regarded as a novel nature based strategy to balance soil productivity and sustainability at the same time attention should be paid on how to combine bsc strategy and big data in the future so as to realize the intelligent and efficient cultivation and management of bsc in conclusion bsc can act as a promising nature based strategy to conserve soil system in semi arid rainfed agricultural regions finally further explorations would be necessary in a wider scope and more species types declaration of
