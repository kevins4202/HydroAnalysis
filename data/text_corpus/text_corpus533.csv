2665,supraglacial debris is widespread on the hindu kush pamir karakoram himalaya hpkh glaciers which influences ice melt rates and glacier response to climate change with important consequences for regional water resources supraglacial debris has shown an expanding trend with glacier shrinkage and mass loss but knowledge about regional spatial patterns of debris cover and associated impacts on hpkh glaciers is still incomplete which markedly affects the assessment accuracy of regional debris covered glacier status and hydrological impacts here we address these issues based on aster imagery glacier inventory and a physically based ice melt model we find that about 14 3 of the regional glacier area is covered by supraglacial debris and its thickness decreases gradually from northwest to southeast of the region overall except for the glaciers of western himalaya and karakoram where the acceleration effect of debris cover is dominant the insulation effect of debris cover on the glaciers of pamir hindu kush central and eastern himalaya is particularly significant the heterogeneous distribution of debris thickness and the resulting melt hotspots ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds enhance debris covered surface thinning in the hpkh region but it is not the dominant cause of surface thinning overall the net effect of considering spatially distributed debris thickness can reduce total mass loss of debris covered glaciers by 0 44 0 04 m water equivalent w e yr 1 as a result the presence of debris cover retards accelerated glacier melting caused by current climate warming with important implications for slowing down regional water shortage and ecological environment risk in the hpkh region our findings highlight the importance of including the debris cover effect in regional glacier models for assessing future glacier change and associated hydrological impacts in the hpkh region keywords debris cover effect thermal resistance ice melting surface thinning water resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hindu kush pamir karakoram himalaya region hpkh contains the most heavily glaciated area in the middle and low latitudes of the world rgi consortium 2017 where meltwater from glaciers is an important freshwater source for the indus ganges amu darya yarkand and gaizi rivers and their downstream regions particularly in arid and semi arid areas yao et al 2012 pritchard 2019 immerzeel et al 2020 azam et al 2021 with the continuous accumulation of the superimposed effects of climate change hpkh glaciers exhibit a range of responses to the changing climate with considerable temporal and spatial variability bolch et al 2012 azam et al 2021 bhattacharya et al 2021 miles et al 2021 such heterogeneous changes in glaciers markedly increase the complexity of glacio hydrological processes in glacier fed catchments of the hpkh region with important consequences for seasonal and interannual runoff of these catchments which in turn exerts a crucial impact on the sustainable economic activities and the political stability in these catchments and downstream regions pritchard 2019 immerzeel et al 2020 azam et al 2021 a layer of supraglacial debris is widespread on the ablation zones of the hpkh glaciers kraaijenbrink et al 2017 mölg et al 2018 scherler et al 2018 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 xie et al 2020 supraglacial debris cover has distinctive physical properties and thermal processes compared to clean ice or snow leading to different ice melting processes beneath östrem 1959 nakawo and young 1981 mattson et al 1993 nicholson and benn 2006 latif et al 2019 2020 note that the distribution of supraglacial debris leads to reduced surface albedo compared to that of clean ice surface benn and evans 2010 which can result in additional energy transmission due to the increased absorption of shortwave radiation ice melt rate is enhanced beneath thin debris layers compared to that of bare ice due to additional energy transmitted efficiently to the underlying ice while thick debris layers suppress ice melt rate where the energy is not only consumed in heating the debris layer but also returned to the atmosphere and the rest is transmitted efficiently to the underlying ice field experiments on different glaciers have confirmed that debris cover can enhance or suppress ice melt rate relative to that of bare ice hereafter termed debris cover effect which relies on the thickness variability of the debris layer östrem 1959 nakawo and young 1981 mattson et al 1993 nicholson and benn 2006 consequently the heterogeneous distribution of debris cover on the glaciers largely influences ice melting rate and its spatial pattern benn et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 as well as the formation and development of ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds in ablation zones benn et al 2012 miles et al 2018 buri et al 2021 thereby affecting changes in debris covered glaciers scherler et al 2011 kääb et al 2012 nuimura et al 2012 pellicciotti et al 2015 and variation in catchment runoff fujita and sakai 2014 zhang et al 2019 a study of debris thickness variability and its impact on a himalayan debris covered glacier found that omitting the spatial heterogeneity of debris thickness can lead to underestimate ice melt rates beneath the debris layer by 11 30 nicholson et al 2018 whereas accounting for an accurate debris cover map results in improved melt estimates over the global glacier domain herreid and pellicciotti 2020 runoff simulation in a himalayan debris covered glaciated catchment suggested that glacier meltwater stemming from the debris covered surface contributes more than half of the total runoff fujita and sakai 2014 with glacier shrinkage and sustained mass loss the spatial expansion and thickening of the debris layer have been observed on different debris covered glaciers e g stokes et al 2007 kirkbride and deline 2013 tielidze et al 2020 xie et al 2020 and especially the structure and properties of the debris layer are unique for each glacier the debris cover effect therefore becomes more complex than before on hpkh glaciers however there remains a critical challenge in studying the role of debris cover in debris covered glacier status and associated hydrological impacts due to insufficient information on the large scale physical and thermal properties of the debris layer relying on visual interpretation or fully automated big data approaches based on different remote sensing datasets recent studies have quantified the debris covered extent on glaciers at regional global scales e g kraaijenbrink et al 2017 mölg et al 2018 scherler et al 2018 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 while a global dataset of debris thickness is estimated for all debris covered glaciers 2 km2 rounce et al 2021 these studies have shown that the debris covered surface on hpkh glaciers is second to that on alaskan glaciers nevertheless observations of debris thickness and thermal properties of the debris layer are available for very few glaciers in the hpkh region e g mihalcea et al 2008 rounce and mckinney 2014 ashraf and khan 2016 2017 mccarthy et al 2017 nicholson et al 2018 shah et al 2019 steiner et al 2021 in situ debris thickness measurements conducted on several glaciers in the hpkh region through manual excavation rounce and mckinney 2014 patel et al 2016 surveying debris above exposed ice cliffs nicholson and benn 2013 nicholson and mertes 2017 and ground penetrating radar mccarthy et al 2017 indicate considerable variation in debris thickness over short horizontal distances recent studies suggest that melt beneath the debris layer is particularly sensitive to the thermal conductivity and thickness of debris cover and the variability of the thermal conductivity in space is high on a single glacier nicholson and benn 2013 rounce and mckinney 2014 steiner et al 2021 therefore knowledge gaps regarding physical and thermal properties of the debris layer remain for large scale glacier mass balance and runoff simulations in the hpkh region as a result current glacier mass balance or hydrological models have generally omitted e g hock et al 2019 or overparameterized the influence of debris thickness and its spatial heterogeneity e g kraaijenbrink et al 2017 these studies cannot fully consider the physical processes of energy water exchange between the supraglacial debris and atmosphere interface in the debris covered area leading to the models lacking the capability to finely capture the spatial pattern of debris cover and its associated impacts this is one of potential uncertainties in large scale mass change and runoff simulations and future projections for debris covered glaciers herreid and pellicciotti 2020 rounce et al 2020 furthermore the role of the debris cover effect in the debris cover anomaly phenomenon pellicciotti et al 2015 which is the similarity in the thinning rates of debris covered and clean glaciers in the hpkh region kääb et al 2012 nuimura et al 2012 pellicciotti et al 2015 remains controversial to address these knowledge gaps we attempt to adopt the parameter of thermal resistance of the debris layer which is the ratio of debris thickness to the thermal conductivity of the debris layer nakawo and young 1981 1982 we first provide the spatial pattern of the thermal resistance of the debris layer on hpkh glaciers based on remotely sensed imagery and glacier inventory then we use thermal resistance dataset to derive information on the extent and thickness of debris cover on glaciers across the region finally we investigate the potential influence of debris cover and its role in regional changes of debris covered glaciers and associated impacts by applying a physically based ice melt model which can consider various surface conditions such as debris covered and clean ice surfaces in particular the model is driven by the thermal resistance rather than the thickness and thermal conductivity of the debris layer overall this study provides an integrated view of debris thickness variability and its impacts on a large scale which is the first step toward understanding and predicting the status of debris covered glaciers and their responses to climate change as well as assessing the associated hydrological impacts in the hpkh region 2 study area the hpkh region is located in the southwestern edge of the tibetan plateau fig 1 which hosts about 47 000 glaciers covering a total area of 55 000 km2 rgi consortium 2017 the karakoram has the greatest glacier area in the region table 1 which represents 39 7 of the total glacier area in the region followed by the pamir with 22 1 of the total glacier area about 14 5 9 8 and 9 3 of the total glacier area is found in the western central and eastern himalaya respectively whereas 4 6 is in the hindu kush of all hpkh glaciers 82 are 1 0 km2 only contributing 18 of the total glacier area while 3 5 are 5 0 km2 contributing 56 8 of the total glacier area more importantly ablation zones of many glaciers in the region are covered by extensive supraglacial debris with heterogeneous thickness kraaijenbrink et al 2017 mölg et al 2018 xie et al 2020 the behaviors of hpkh glaciers are more heterogeneous and complex in response to changing climate compared to other mountain ranges of high mountain asia bolch et al 2012 azam et al 2021 bhattacharya et al 2021 miles et al 2021 glacier retreat stability advance and surge coexist in the hpkh region hewitt 2011 bhambri et al 2013 bolch et al 2017 on average glaciers in the karakoram and pamir have undergone balanced budgets or insignificant mass loss over the past several decades during past decades while glaciers in the himalaya and hindu kush have experienced highly negative mass balance bolch et al 2012 kääb et al 2012 gardelle et al 2012 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 bhattacharya et al 2021 miles et al 2021 the region is under the influence of the westerlies and the indian monsoon with significant variation in temperature and precipitation bookhagen and burbank 2010 immerzeel et al 2012 lutz et al 2014 yao et al 2019 this together with orographic forcing spatial variability and debris cover intensifies the complexity and variability of regional glacier changes bolch et al 2012 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 miles et al 2021 3 data and methods 3 1 data the datasets used in this study are glacier inventory aster images debris covered extent data debris thickness and ablation observations meteorological data and a digital elevation model dem we present detailed information regarding these datasets below glacier information of the hpkh region is derived from the randolph glacier inventory version 6 0 rgi 6 0 rgi consortium 2017 265 aster images are collected from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https search earthdata nas a gov search most images are cloud free and in a few cases the amount of cloud in a single image is 10 acquisition time of these images is mainly concentrated at the end of the melt season between 2010 and 2018 fig 2 solar radiation fluxes corresponding to the nearest acquisition time and location of aster images are taken from the ncep ncar reanalysis data kalnay et al 1996 two published datasets of the debris covered extent are derived from mölg et al 2018 and scherler et al 2018 respectively hereafter designated as the m2018 and s2018 datasets respectively the m2018 dataset mapped the debris covered extent on the glaciers in the karakoram and pamir through visual interpretation based on alos 1 palsar 1 images while the s2018 dataset automatically mapped the global debris covered extent using different algorithms based on landsat 8 and sentinel 2 images and rgi 6 0 a global dataset of debris thickness is derived from rounce et al 2021 which is estimated using an approach combining sub debris melt and surface temperature inversion method this dataset provides the information of the extent and thickness of debris cover hereafter designated as the r2021 dataset we collect ten debris covered glaciers in the karakoram and himalaya mountains where field observations of debris thickness and ice melt rate beneath the debris layer were carried out table 2 the existing data mentioned above are used to validate the performance of our approaches daily meteorological data from the s14fd dataset iizumi et al 2017 are used to estimate ice melt rates on different surface conditions including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and downward shortwave radiation flux outputs of the s14fd data are available for the period of 1958 2013 with a grid size of 0 5 which were corrected with the raw data of the jra 55 reanalysis iizumi et al 2017 the s14fd dataset was confirmed to be more accurate than other forcing datasets in representing observed climate variables in recent decades particularly the temperature and precipitation extremes iizumi et al 2017 in this study s14fd daily data are used directly to force the ice melt model over the period 2004 2013 in addition the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm dem https gdex cr usgs gov gdex is used in this study with a spatial resolution of 30 m based on srtm dem we can obtain the topographic information of the region and spatially distribute the meteorological data 3 2 methods 3 2 1 thermal resistance of the debris layer the thermal resistance of the debris layer is calculated as debris thickness divided by its thermal conductivity nakawo and young 1981 1982 however field determinations of the thickness and thermal conductivity of the debris layer are specifically time consuming and unrealistic resulting in sparse coverage of very few glaciers to overcome this difficulty recent studies mapped the thermal resistance of the debris layer based on aster images and reanalysis data with the assumption that the turbulent heat fluxes were omitted in the surface energy balance e g suzuki et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 fujita and sakai 2014 zhang et al 2016 this parameter has been applied to different debris covered glaciers e g nakawo and rana 1999 suzuki et al 2007 fujita and sakai 2014 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 which confirmed that the spatial pattern of the thermal resistance can be used to extract the characteristics of the extent and thickness of the debris layer at different scales suziki et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 fujita and sakai 2014 zhang et al 2016 the calculation process of thermal resistance used in this study is identical to that presented in the studies of zhang et al 2011 2016 and is described briefly here we calculate surface temperature from the average of the five thermal infrared tir bands of aster image using the equation presented in the study of alley and nilsen 2001 while surface albedo is estimated from the three visible and near infrared vnir bands using the formulas proposed by yüksel et al 2008 then we combine aster derived surface temperature and surface albedo with both downward radiation fluxes from ncep ncar reanalysis data at the timing and location closest to aster acquisition to calculate the thermal resistance of the debris layer the spatial resolution of the thermal resistance is 90 m the same as the grid size of the aster tir image 3 2 2 debris cover extraction the extent of debris cover on hpkh glaciers is mapped for the entire region according to aster derived thermal resistance values and glacier outlines and median elevation defined in the rgi 6 0 for the statistics of debris cover we consider only the ablation zones of glaciers in the region i e the zone below the median elevation a thermal resistance value 0 indicates a debris covered glacier surface while a value 0 indicates a debris free surface then we calculate the proportion of debris covered area for each glacier of the region i e the ratio of debris covered area and glacier area based on the debris covered area obtained above and glacier area defined in the rgi 6 0 the significant positive correlation between aster derived thermal resistance and debris thickness variability has been observed on different glaciers in high mountain asia e g suzuki et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 zhang and liu 2017 based on this relationship we derive the pattern of variation in debris thickness across the region according to the spatial distribution of thermal resistance finally we analyze the spatial characteristics of debris thickness in different mountain ranges of the region 3 2 3 ice melt ratio to assess the influence of debris cover and its spatial heterogeneity on hpkh glaciers we adopt the ice melt ratio parameter for each grid cell which is defined as the ice melt rate beneath the debris layer divided by that with the assumption of no debris in the same grid cell ice melt rates at both conditions for each grid cell are estimated using a physically based energy balance model zhang et al 2011 2012 the model considers the net radiation flux latent heat flux sensible heat flux and conductive heat flux across the debris ice atmosphere interface and computes the energy available for melting from energy exchange between the debris covered and debris free surfaces and the atmosphere all of which are described in detail in the studies of zhang et al 2011 2012 according to the spatial distribution of thermal resistance r the energy available for ice melting at debris covered r 0 and debris free r 0 surfaces qm is respectively estimated as follows 1 q g 1 α r s ε r l ε σ t s 273 15 4 q s q l q m q g t s t i r r 0 2 q m 1 α r s ε r l ε σ t s 273 15 4 q s q l q g r 0 where rs and rl are the downward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes w m 2 respectively qs and ql are the sensible and latent heat fluxes respectively q g and qg are the conductive heat fluxes through the debris layer and into the ice w m 2 respectively r is the thermal resistance of the debris layer m2 k w 1 ε is the emissivity taken to be 1 dimensionless σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 for upward longwave radiation emitted from the surface with temperature of ts c and ti is the ice temperature at the ice debris surface which is assumed to be 0 c zhang et al 2011 α and α are the albedos of debris covered and debris free surfaces which are assumed to be 0 2 and 0 3 respectively zhang et al 2011 2012 the downward longwave radiation is estimated from air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation using an empirical scheme kondo 1994 while the turbulent latent and sensible heat fluxes are calculated using a bulk aerodynamic method kondo 1994 then the melt rate of the debris covered debris free surface m is calculated for surface energy balance 0 as follows 3 m q m l f where lf is the latent heat of fusion of ice 3 33 105 j kg 1 all terms of the energy balance are taken to be positive toward the surface with the exception of the shortwave radiation component all components of the energy balance are determined from surface temperature that is calculated numerically by iteration the model is forced by daily s14fd meteorological data from 2004 to 2013 ice melt rates for each grid cell are calculated for the debris covered surface and assumed no debris surface respectively and averaged over the study period then we estimate the ice melt ratio of each grid cell on hpkh glaciers here the grid size for the ice melt ratio calculation is the same as that for the dataset of aster derived thermal resistances 3 2 4 validation validating our approach is challenging in the hpkh region due to the sparse observations related to debris cover on glaciers but it is vital for our method to realistically map the spatial pattern of the extent and thickness of debris cover and capture its impacts on a large scale therefore all available datasets observed or previously estimated on hpkh glaciers are used to validate the accuracy of our results these data are respectively 1 the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets of the debris covered extent 2 debris thickness data observed or estimated on the nine glaciers in the karakoram and himalaya table 2 and derived from the r2021 dataset and 3 ice melt data observed on the barpu ashraf and khan 2017 biafo ashraf and khan 2016 baltoro collier et al 2015 and hinarche mayer et al 2010 glaciers although these datasets only cover a small set of glaciers in the hpkh region such integrative validation can allow us to clearly understand the accuracy of the approaches used in this study first we compare the debris covered area between our results extracted from aster derived thermal resistances and the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets then we perform a comparison of the spatial pattern of observed debris thicknesses and aster derived thermal resistances of debris layers this allows assessment of the capability of our method to obtain the spatial pattern of the extent and thickness of the debris layer finally our modelled ice melt rates are compared to observations beneath different debris thicknesses on the four glaciers this allows evaluation of the performance of our ice melt model forced by s14fd daily meteorological data without any bias correction 4 results 4 1 evaluation of mapping accuracy we calculate the distribution of thermal resistance on hpkh glaciers from aster images and rgi 6 0 and then map the supraglacial debris cover of the entire region a comparison of the area altitude distribution of supraglacial debris in our results and the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets for each mountain range is shown in fig 3 the area altitude distribution of debris cover revealed by aster derived thermal resistance is consistent with those of the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets and the correlation coefficient between them exceeds 0 90 p 0 001 although our results and the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets show slight differences in the debris covered area in the high elevation region fig 3 especially in the karakoram fig 3b the debris covered area in this region for these datasets accounts for only a small proportion of the entire region in addition for glaciers 1 0 km2 in the hindu kush karakoram himalaya region the total difference between the results of herreid and pellicciotti 2020 and our results is about 1 6 of the total debris covered area 5 480 km2 vs 5 391 km2 table 3 to evaluate the relation between aster derived thermal resistances and observed debris thicknesses we compare individual debris thickness measurements to the thermal resistance derived from the pixel nearest to the observed location fig 4 shows a comparison of aster derived thermal resistances and debris thickness measurements on nine glaciers in the region which records continuous variation of debris cover in ablation zones the aster derived thermal resistances correlate reasonably well with the debris thickness measurements on different glaciers yielding correlation coefficients ranging from 0 77 to 0 94 with an average value of 0 85 p 0 05 in particular the spatial pattern of the thermal resistance of the debris layer corresponds well with the observed distribution of debris thickness on the glaciers fig 4 which is confirmed by comparison of aster derived thermal resistance and debris thickness derived from the r2021 dataset for each mountain ranges fig s1 overall our approach extracts the extent and thickness of debris cover well compared to the observations and the previous estimates our analyses of the approach accuracy lead confidence to support aster derived thermal resistance as a proxy for reasonably deriving the debris covered extent and debris thickness on hpkh glaciers 4 2 thermal resistance and debris thickness on hpkh glaciers the spatial distribution of aster derived thermal resistance of the debris layer on hpkh glaciers is illustrated in fig 5 indicating considerable spatial variability in the region overall the thermal resistance of the debris layer is generally higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast of the region fig 5 the regional average thermal resistance of all debris covered areas is 5 1 10 2 m2 k w 1 the thermal resistance altitude distribution reveals that the value of the thermal resistance is markedly higher at glacier termini and decreases gradually with increasing altitude fig 6 this spatial trend of thermal resistance agrees well with the observed pattern of debris thickness that increases toward downglacier the variation in the thermal resistance tends to be gentle with increasing altitude but changes considerably in the upper part of ablation zones fig 6 especially on the glaciers of the eastern himalaya fig 4 shows that the spatial distribution of aster derived thermal resistance has a positive association with that of debris thickness therefore we analyze the pattern of debris thickness on glaciers based on this relationship the average thermal resistance on glaciers of the hindu kush is highest in the region table 4 and is markedly higher than the average of the region this suggests that the average debris thickness on hindu kush glaciers is the thickest in the hpkh region followed by the central himalaya glaciers while it is the thinnest in the western himalaya our statistics from the thermal resistance dataset indicate that the average thickness of the debris layer in the karakoram is comparable to that in the pamir the average thermal resistances of these two regions are lower than the average of the region table 4 in the himalaya debris thickness tends to be thick in the central part and thin on both sides fig 5 and the average debris thickness in the eastern is slightly greater than that in the western table 4 4 3 debris cover on hpkh glaciers we identify that 58 of all glaciers in the hpkh region are covered with supraglacial debris cover and the debris covered surface accounts for about 14 3 of the total glacier area of the region for glaciers 1 km2 the total amount of debris covered glacier area is 6639 km2 which constitutes 85 of the total debris covered area of the region the region contains 1 137 glaciers each covering a debris covered area of 1 0 km2 and 96 glaciers each covering a debris covered area of 10 0 km2 for these 96 glaciers the total amount of debris covered area contributes 31 2 of the total regional debris covered area the regional debris cover map shows considerable variability between different mountain ranges table 4 the karakoram contains the greatest debris covered area in the hpkh region representing 34 4 of the total debris covered area of the region followed by the pamir 19 6 although the hindu kush has the smallest area of debris cover in the region the debris covered proportion 22 4 is the largest among different mountain ranges for the entire himalaya table 4 the largest debris covered area is found in the western himalaya with a debris covered proportion of 18 3 while the eastern himalaya has the smallest debris covered area as well as the smallest debris covered proportion in addition the karakoram and pamir host 67 debris covered glaciers with an area of 50 km2 with debris covered proportions varying from 2 0 to 36 0 and the area of debris cover accounting for 43 of the total debris covered area of the two mountain ranges we plot the area altitude distributions of the debris covered surface ablation zone and glacier of different mountain ranges fig 7 revealing further differences in debris covered surface between mountain ranges the most apparent difference is the elevation of debris distribution the lowest elevation of supraglacial debris distribution extends from 2200 m karakoram to 3800 m eastern himalaya and the others lies between the two fig 7 most of the regional debris covered area is located in the karakoram and pamir together 54 with supraglacial debris spanning a large elevation range by contrast the elevation span of supraglacial debris is relatively small in the hindu kush and eastern himalaya overall about 87 of the regional debris covered area is concentrated between 3 600 and 5 500 m where the average proportion of debris cover is about 23 most of glacier area below 3 600 m is covered by supraglacial debris with an average debris covered proportion of 72 while only 5 occurs above 5 500 m where the average proportion of debris cover is relatively small 1 in particular the proportion of debris cover in the lower elevation region of the central himalaya reaches 86 while the proportion is relatively small even in the lower part of the pamir 4 4 debris cover effect on hpkh glaciers we calculate the ice melt ratio of the debris covered surface on hpkh glaciers and its spatial distribution is shown in fig 8 an ice melt ratio 1 0 indicates that the ice melting beneath the debris layer is accelerated relative to that of climatically equivalent exposed ice hereafter termed the acceleration effect this process coincides with enhanced ice melting beneath thin debris layers typically 0 03 0 05 m on the other hand a ratio 1 0 indicates that the presence of the debris cover suppresses ice melting relative to that of climatically equivalent exposed ice hereafter termed the insulation effect ice melt ratios of the region vary from 0 1 to 1 8 indicating significant regional differences in the debris cover effect fig 8 in the hpkh region the acceleration effect of debris cover is dominant in the western himalaya and karakoram about 57 of the debris covered surface in the western himalaya where the ice melt ratio is 1 0 has experienced accelerating melting similarly about 52 of the debris covered surface in the karakoram has undergone accelerating melting by contrast the insulation effect of debris cover is dominant in the pamir hindu kush central and eastern himalaya fig 8 except for the pamir where the acceleration effect of debris cover is comparable to the insulation effect the insulation effect of debris cover in the other three regions is particularly significant about 76 of the total debris covered surface in the central himalaya inhibits ice melting while 68 and 64 are in the eastern himalaya and hindu kush respectively the hpkh region contains 30 glaciers with an area of 100 km2 contributing 15 3 of the regional glacier area these glaciers are all debris covered glaciers on which the debris covered proportions vary between 7 3 and 37 3 and the total area of debris cover contributes 18 of the total debris covered area of the region of these glaciers the acceleration effect of debris cover is dominant on 12 glaciers while the insulation effect is dominant on 15 glaciers and the two effects are equivalent on 3 glaciers in particular the debris covered area suppressing ice melting on 10 glaciers exceeds 60 for the entire region the net effect of considering spatially distributed debris thickness is the insulation effect fig 8 compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface the spatial distribution of debris cover leads to 28 reduction in ice melting over the entire region i e the mass loss of debris covered glaciers is reduced by 0 44 m w e yr 1 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty analysis the mapping of debris covered surface on hpkh glaciers relies heavily upon the spatial distribution of thermal resistance of debris layer there is uncertainty associated with the thermal resistance calculation caused by the assumption of neglecting turbulent fluxes in surface energy balance calculation in addition dry and wet conditions of the debris covered surface affect the thermal resistance through turbulent fluxes suzuki et al 2007 note that most aster images used in this study are carefully collected around noon on a clear day therefore the surface is generally in the dry condition on the time of aster data acquisition to identify how the assumption affects the estimated thermal resistance a sensitivity analysis is performed in which we run the approach to calculate the thermal resistance with 5 10 and 15 of the original value of net radiation flux to consider turbulent fluxes in surface energy balance calculation the sensitivity analysis reveals that the reduction of surface energy flux by 5 15 leads to an average increase of thermal resistance of 2 9 table s1 while the increase of surface energy flux by 5 15 results in an average decrease of thermal resistance of 8 16 this indicates that the uncertainty in thermal resistance is less sensitive to surface energy flux decrease caused by calculation assumptions compared to flux increase which is not 10 in general surface energy losses through turbulent fluxes reduce the positive net radiation fluxes during daylight hours nicholson and stiperski 2020 steiner et al 2021 therefore surface energy flux is unlikely to increase due to turbulent fluxes in the debris covered surface during daylight hours furthermore the uncertainty of thermal resistance and associated impacts has been discussed in previous studies which have confirmed that the uncertainty of thermal resistance arising from neglecting turbulent fluxes in energy balance calculation and using multitemporal aster data has relatively little influence on the spatial pattern of thermal resistance suzuki et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 ablation calculation zhang et al 2012 2016 and runoff simulation fujita and sakai 2014 in particular thermal resistances of debris layers on a himalayan glacier were estimated from observed meteorological data using two methods one considers all energy balance components of the debris covered surface and the other only considers the net radiation suzuki et al 2007 their results showed a small difference in thermal resistances calculated by two methods as discussed above the assumption of neglecting turbulent fluxes is unlikely to affect the calculation of the thermal resistance of the debris layer similarly the influence of uncertainty in thermal resistance on the ice melt ratio is assessed by a sensitivity analysis we run the model to calculate the ice melt ratio with 5 10 and 15 of the original value of thermal resistance the sensitivity analysis suggests that although the ice melting ratio varies with thermal resistance it is relatively less sensitive to thermal resistance table s1 on average the maximum uncertainty due to thermal resistance gives an ice melt ratio uncertainty within 8 we perform a comparison in mountain ranges where the debris covered extent has been mapped to evaluate major differences between our results and those of other studies compared to the results of herreid and pellicciotti 2020 our calculation of the debris covered area in the hindu kush karakoram himalaya region is 1 6 smaller whereas our result in the pamir karakoram region is slightly larger compared to the m2018 and s2018 datasets table3 these differences are mainly due to the different methods used and incomplete glacier inventory mölg et al 2018 scherler et al 2018 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 investigated the influences of the rgi 6 0 and topographical shading on mapping debris cover in different glaciated regions of the world and found that errors caused by these factors are relatively small in high mountain asia compared to other glaciated regions of the world the error within the rgi 6 0 including inaccurate or outdated glacier outlines summed to 2 8 of glacier area whereas the topographical shading error contributes to 2 4 of the glacier area furthermore two debris covered glaciers are selected from the pamir and karakoram region where the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets are all available the information of two glaciers can be found in table s2 we obtained the debris covered extent of two glaciers from the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets and then compared to our results figs s2 and s3 comparison analyses with the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets indicate that our result is comparable to the m2018 and s2018 datasets and is slightly larger than the r2021 dataset and the differences between these datasets mainly occurs in higher elevation region meanwhile the debris covered extent of five debris covered glaciers in the hunza catchment of the karakoram fig s4 is mapped through visual interpretation based on planetscope ps imagery with a pixel size of 3 125 m hereafter termed ps data comparing ps data from high resolution imagery to our results fig s5 the total difference is 4 5 of the total debris covered area 126 km2 vs 121 km2 as discussed above comparison of our results with multi datasets and high resolution data shows that our results derived from the spatial distribution of thermal resistance are acceptable on a large scale it is worth noting that the principal advantage of our approach is the fact that it requires relatively few input parameters and with the increasing enrichment of different types of remote sensing data and the gradual improvement of glacier inventory data it will be possible to accurately obtain the information on the extent and thickness of debris cover at different scales particularly in glacier areas without any debris observations in addition the daily outputs of the s14fd dataset without any bias correction are used to force the physically based ice melt model in this study an assessment of the s14fd outputs confirmed that the outputs can reasonably capture variation in observed climate variables and are more accuracy than other meteorological datasets iizumi et al 2017 a comparison between the s14fd outputs and observed meteorological records from three stations located in the hunza catchment indicate that the daily and monthly s14fd temperatures correlate well with ground observations figs s6 and s7 and analysis of the daily and monthly temperature data for three stations yield correlation coefficients r of 0 96 0 98 and 0 97 and 0 99 0 99 and 0 99 respectively in particular the s14fd temperature is able to capture the observed seasonal variability well fig s6 furthermore we compare modelled ice melt rates beneath the debris layer with observations from four debris covered glaciers in the region fig 9 a scatter plot of modelled versus observed ice melt rates beneath the debris layer on different glaciers shows good agreement except for the baltoro glacier where simulations are quite different from observations overall our results on different glaciers yield correlation coefficients of 0 74 and relative errors of 17 this gives us sufficient confidence to directly use the s14fd outputs as input for forcing our ice melt model to estimate ice melt rates at the regional scale 5 2 cause of the debris cover anomaly previous studies have suggested that the thinning rate of debris covered surface is similar to that of debris free surface kääb et al 2012 nuimura et al 2012 pellicciotti et al 2015 king et al 2019 which is referred to as the debris cover anomaly pellicciotti et al 2015 this phenomenon has been reported not only in the hpkh region but also in the european alps mölg et al 2019 and alaska anderson et al 2021 the mechanism of this phenomenon is complex and still controversial some studies suggested that the wide distribution of melt hotspots such as thin debris ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds on debris covered surface accelerates surface thinning e g sakai et al 2000 2002 patel et al 2016 miles et al 2018 buri et al 2021 rowan et al 2021 while others postulated that dynamic thinning under thick debris results from declining ice flow e g anderson and anderson 2018 anderson et al 2021 rounce et al 2021 we use the surface energy balance model to calculate regional ice melt ratios and found quite strong spatial differences in the debris cover effect fig 8 the average melt ratio of the entire hpkh region is 0 72 0 06 indicating that the reduction of total ice melting is about 28 due to the insulation effect of debris cover compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface which is equivalent to 0 44 0 04 m w e yr 1 of total mass loss for debris covered glaciers although 46 of total debris covered surface of the hpkh region experiences accelerating ice melting fig 8 and the distribution of melt hotspots locally increases surface thinning it cannot compensate overall for the reduction of total ice melting due to the insulation effect of debris cover this implies that the heterogeneous distribution of debris thickness and the resulting melt hotspots accelerate debris covered surface thinning to a certain extent but it is not the dominant cause of the debris cover anomaly in the hpkh region from another aspect our analysis supports the hypothesis that the predominant cause of the debris cover anomaly is the reduction of ice flux into the debris covered area leads to dynamic thinning under thick debris layers as reported previously anderson and anderson 2018 anderson et al 2021 rounce et al 2021 anderson et al 2021 explored four feedbacks of supraglacial debris ice cliffs supraglacial ponds and relief relating glacier thinning to ice melt changes on alaska s kennicott glacier and found that the debris cover anomaly is predominately caused by dynamic thinning rounce et al 2021 estimated that the contribution of accelerated melting due to ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds to the debris cover anomaly varies between 3 and 35 with the remaining 65 97 attributable to the influence of glacial dynamic processes however the complex interactions between the climate debris glacier dynamic system and its spatiotemporal changes result in the complicated cause of the debris cover anomaly due to the complexity of the climate debris glacier dynamic system it is difficult to diagnose the influences of different processes on debris covered glacier responses therefore further studies are required to determine the contributions of supraglacial debris and other processes related to the layer and ice dynamic processes to the debris cover anomaly 5 3 role of the debris cover effect in regional water resources hpkh glaciers markedly modulate the release of freshwater into regional rivers and the dynamic changes in these glaciers are crucial for local people relying on these water resources pritchard 2019 azam et al 2021 in particular the hpkh region contains the greatest debris covered area in high mountain asia kraaijenbrink et al 2017 scherler et al 2018 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 where spatial variation in supraglacial debris has a significant influence on ice melting and its spatial pattern through the surface atmosphere energy water exchange and albedo change benn et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 nicholson et al 2018 therefore accurate determination of the regional spatial distribution of debris thickness and associated impacts is of great significance for understanding regional glacier water resources effect and adaptation to climate change note that the ablation zone of a glacier is not only the main distribution area of debris cover but also the major runoff producing area in the glaciated catchment supraglacial debris cover changes the structure and seasonal evolution of the drainage system on the glacier through altering ice melting processes beneath the debris layer and its spatial pattern thus affecting the formation and variation of runoff in the glaciated catchment mair et al 2002 fujita and sakai 2014 fyffe et al 2019 jones et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 field observations of ablation beneath the debris layer have been carried out on a few debris covered glaciers in the hpkh region table 2 on biafo glacier in the karakoram the debris layer with a thickness of 0 01 m enhances ice melting by up to 19 compared to clean ice surface while the debris layer with a thickness of 0 07 m reduces ice melting by 34 ashraf and khan 2016 in the same region the ice melt rate beneath the debris layer on barpu glacier is reduced by 26 on average compared to clean ice surface ashraf and khan 2017 this phenomenon has also been observed on other debris covered glaciers such as baltoro and hinarche glaciers where the mean melt rates at the debris covered surface are decreased by about 22 and 30 respectively compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface mihalcea et al 2008 mayer et al 2010 muhammad et al 2020 found that clean ice melt rates are faster than the debris covered ice and even a thin debris layer 0 01 m thick does not enhance ice melting in the lower altitudes overall field ablation observations on different glaciers have indicated that the sub debris ice melting process is primarily controlled by the insulation effect of debris cover which is consistent with our findings fig 8 as estimated above the western himalaya and karakoram are dominated by the acceleration effect of debris cover where more than half of the debris covered surface experiences accelerating ice melting fig 8 according to our estimates the meltwater generated from the debris covered surface in the western himalaya and karakoram increases by 18 4 and 15 3 compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface respectively note that glacier meltwater is dominant in river runoff of these two regions and the maximum contribution of glacier meltwater can reach about 85 in the basins lutz et al 2014 2016 more importantly agriculture in the indus basin increasingly depends on meltwater in the present and future periods lutz et al 2022 consequently excess meltwater from the debris covered surface caused by the acceleration effect of debris cover in the western himalaya and karakoram can further regulate the runoff into regional reiver systems mainly the upper indus especially in dry season increasing the importance of meltwater to river runoff in these two regions by contrast the rest of the hpkh region including the pamir hindu kush central and eastern himalaya are dominated by the insulation effect of debris cover except the pamir 52 most of the debris covered surface in the hindu kush central and eastern himalaya inhibit ice melting fig 8 leading to a reduction of ice melting of 33 37 compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface this reduction in ice melting from debris covered surface suppresses further shrinkage of glacier termini and mass loss in the pamir hindu kush central and eastern himalaya in which higher rates of mass loss are observed on glaciers in recent years driven by changes in temperature and precipitation kraaijenbrink et al 2017 bhattacharya et al 2021 miles et al 2021 consequently the insulation effect of debris cover in these regions allows debris covered ice to survive for longer at lower altitudes than neighbouring clean ice glaciers overall the insulation effect of debris cover is dominant in the entire hpkh region fig 8 as a result the amount of ice melting on the entire debris covered glaciers of the region is reduced by 0 44 0 04 m w e yr 1 due to the insulation effect of debris cover which is equivalent to 3 0 2 and 1 5 0 1 of mean annual runoff of the entire indus and ganges rivers respectively thus the presence of debris cover retards glacier shrinkage and mass loss caused by climate warming in the hpkh region which will have a profound impact on the seasonal and interannual variability of river runoff in glacier fed catchments in this region as well as the temporal and spatial patterns and future trends of regional water resources 6 conclusion we present the extent and thickness of supraglacial debris cover on hpkh glaciers by using aster images and rgi 6 0 and quantify the debris cover effect and its spatial heterogeneity by applying a physically based ice melt model of all hpkh glaciers 58 are debris covered glaciers where the debris covered area contributes 14 3 of the total regional glacier area mainly concentrating on glaciers 1 km2 the karakoram contains the greatest debris covered area in the region while the hindu kush has the smallest area approximately 87 of the total debris covered surface is concentrated between altitudes of 3 600 5 500 m and the area below 3 600 m is almost completely covered by supraglacial debris with a debris covered proportion of 72 regional thermal resistance estimates reveal that debris thickness shows considerable spatial variability across the region which decreases gradually from northwest to southeast our analysis of ice melt ratios reveals that 46 of regional debris covered surface enhances ice melting and promotes the formation and development of melt hotspots like ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds supraglacial debris and other processes that occur within the layer may affect the local thinning of debris covered glaciers but it is not the dominant cause overall the insulation effect of debris cover reduces ice melting by 28 compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface this significantly influences variation in regional glacier meltwater and slows down the regional water shortage and ecological environment risk caused by warming accelerated ice melting our estimates of supraglacial debris improve the capability of the model to capture spatially distributed debris thickness and associated impacts in regional glacier

2665,supraglacial debris is widespread on the hindu kush pamir karakoram himalaya hpkh glaciers which influences ice melt rates and glacier response to climate change with important consequences for regional water resources supraglacial debris has shown an expanding trend with glacier shrinkage and mass loss but knowledge about regional spatial patterns of debris cover and associated impacts on hpkh glaciers is still incomplete which markedly affects the assessment accuracy of regional debris covered glacier status and hydrological impacts here we address these issues based on aster imagery glacier inventory and a physically based ice melt model we find that about 14 3 of the regional glacier area is covered by supraglacial debris and its thickness decreases gradually from northwest to southeast of the region overall except for the glaciers of western himalaya and karakoram where the acceleration effect of debris cover is dominant the insulation effect of debris cover on the glaciers of pamir hindu kush central and eastern himalaya is particularly significant the heterogeneous distribution of debris thickness and the resulting melt hotspots ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds enhance debris covered surface thinning in the hpkh region but it is not the dominant cause of surface thinning overall the net effect of considering spatially distributed debris thickness can reduce total mass loss of debris covered glaciers by 0 44 0 04 m water equivalent w e yr 1 as a result the presence of debris cover retards accelerated glacier melting caused by current climate warming with important implications for slowing down regional water shortage and ecological environment risk in the hpkh region our findings highlight the importance of including the debris cover effect in regional glacier models for assessing future glacier change and associated hydrological impacts in the hpkh region keywords debris cover effect thermal resistance ice melting surface thinning water resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hindu kush pamir karakoram himalaya region hpkh contains the most heavily glaciated area in the middle and low latitudes of the world rgi consortium 2017 where meltwater from glaciers is an important freshwater source for the indus ganges amu darya yarkand and gaizi rivers and their downstream regions particularly in arid and semi arid areas yao et al 2012 pritchard 2019 immerzeel et al 2020 azam et al 2021 with the continuous accumulation of the superimposed effects of climate change hpkh glaciers exhibit a range of responses to the changing climate with considerable temporal and spatial variability bolch et al 2012 azam et al 2021 bhattacharya et al 2021 miles et al 2021 such heterogeneous changes in glaciers markedly increase the complexity of glacio hydrological processes in glacier fed catchments of the hpkh region with important consequences for seasonal and interannual runoff of these catchments which in turn exerts a crucial impact on the sustainable economic activities and the political stability in these catchments and downstream regions pritchard 2019 immerzeel et al 2020 azam et al 2021 a layer of supraglacial debris is widespread on the ablation zones of the hpkh glaciers kraaijenbrink et al 2017 mölg et al 2018 scherler et al 2018 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 xie et al 2020 supraglacial debris cover has distinctive physical properties and thermal processes compared to clean ice or snow leading to different ice melting processes beneath östrem 1959 nakawo and young 1981 mattson et al 1993 nicholson and benn 2006 latif et al 2019 2020 note that the distribution of supraglacial debris leads to reduced surface albedo compared to that of clean ice surface benn and evans 2010 which can result in additional energy transmission due to the increased absorption of shortwave radiation ice melt rate is enhanced beneath thin debris layers compared to that of bare ice due to additional energy transmitted efficiently to the underlying ice while thick debris layers suppress ice melt rate where the energy is not only consumed in heating the debris layer but also returned to the atmosphere and the rest is transmitted efficiently to the underlying ice field experiments on different glaciers have confirmed that debris cover can enhance or suppress ice melt rate relative to that of bare ice hereafter termed debris cover effect which relies on the thickness variability of the debris layer östrem 1959 nakawo and young 1981 mattson et al 1993 nicholson and benn 2006 consequently the heterogeneous distribution of debris cover on the glaciers largely influences ice melting rate and its spatial pattern benn et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 as well as the formation and development of ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds in ablation zones benn et al 2012 miles et al 2018 buri et al 2021 thereby affecting changes in debris covered glaciers scherler et al 2011 kääb et al 2012 nuimura et al 2012 pellicciotti et al 2015 and variation in catchment runoff fujita and sakai 2014 zhang et al 2019 a study of debris thickness variability and its impact on a himalayan debris covered glacier found that omitting the spatial heterogeneity of debris thickness can lead to underestimate ice melt rates beneath the debris layer by 11 30 nicholson et al 2018 whereas accounting for an accurate debris cover map results in improved melt estimates over the global glacier domain herreid and pellicciotti 2020 runoff simulation in a himalayan debris covered glaciated catchment suggested that glacier meltwater stemming from the debris covered surface contributes more than half of the total runoff fujita and sakai 2014 with glacier shrinkage and sustained mass loss the spatial expansion and thickening of the debris layer have been observed on different debris covered glaciers e g stokes et al 2007 kirkbride and deline 2013 tielidze et al 2020 xie et al 2020 and especially the structure and properties of the debris layer are unique for each glacier the debris cover effect therefore becomes more complex than before on hpkh glaciers however there remains a critical challenge in studying the role of debris cover in debris covered glacier status and associated hydrological impacts due to insufficient information on the large scale physical and thermal properties of the debris layer relying on visual interpretation or fully automated big data approaches based on different remote sensing datasets recent studies have quantified the debris covered extent on glaciers at regional global scales e g kraaijenbrink et al 2017 mölg et al 2018 scherler et al 2018 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 while a global dataset of debris thickness is estimated for all debris covered glaciers 2 km2 rounce et al 2021 these studies have shown that the debris covered surface on hpkh glaciers is second to that on alaskan glaciers nevertheless observations of debris thickness and thermal properties of the debris layer are available for very few glaciers in the hpkh region e g mihalcea et al 2008 rounce and mckinney 2014 ashraf and khan 2016 2017 mccarthy et al 2017 nicholson et al 2018 shah et al 2019 steiner et al 2021 in situ debris thickness measurements conducted on several glaciers in the hpkh region through manual excavation rounce and mckinney 2014 patel et al 2016 surveying debris above exposed ice cliffs nicholson and benn 2013 nicholson and mertes 2017 and ground penetrating radar mccarthy et al 2017 indicate considerable variation in debris thickness over short horizontal distances recent studies suggest that melt beneath the debris layer is particularly sensitive to the thermal conductivity and thickness of debris cover and the variability of the thermal conductivity in space is high on a single glacier nicholson and benn 2013 rounce and mckinney 2014 steiner et al 2021 therefore knowledge gaps regarding physical and thermal properties of the debris layer remain for large scale glacier mass balance and runoff simulations in the hpkh region as a result current glacier mass balance or hydrological models have generally omitted e g hock et al 2019 or overparameterized the influence of debris thickness and its spatial heterogeneity e g kraaijenbrink et al 2017 these studies cannot fully consider the physical processes of energy water exchange between the supraglacial debris and atmosphere interface in the debris covered area leading to the models lacking the capability to finely capture the spatial pattern of debris cover and its associated impacts this is one of potential uncertainties in large scale mass change and runoff simulations and future projections for debris covered glaciers herreid and pellicciotti 2020 rounce et al 2020 furthermore the role of the debris cover effect in the debris cover anomaly phenomenon pellicciotti et al 2015 which is the similarity in the thinning rates of debris covered and clean glaciers in the hpkh region kääb et al 2012 nuimura et al 2012 pellicciotti et al 2015 remains controversial to address these knowledge gaps we attempt to adopt the parameter of thermal resistance of the debris layer which is the ratio of debris thickness to the thermal conductivity of the debris layer nakawo and young 1981 1982 we first provide the spatial pattern of the thermal resistance of the debris layer on hpkh glaciers based on remotely sensed imagery and glacier inventory then we use thermal resistance dataset to derive information on the extent and thickness of debris cover on glaciers across the region finally we investigate the potential influence of debris cover and its role in regional changes of debris covered glaciers and associated impacts by applying a physically based ice melt model which can consider various surface conditions such as debris covered and clean ice surfaces in particular the model is driven by the thermal resistance rather than the thickness and thermal conductivity of the debris layer overall this study provides an integrated view of debris thickness variability and its impacts on a large scale which is the first step toward understanding and predicting the status of debris covered glaciers and their responses to climate change as well as assessing the associated hydrological impacts in the hpkh region 2 study area the hpkh region is located in the southwestern edge of the tibetan plateau fig 1 which hosts about 47 000 glaciers covering a total area of 55 000 km2 rgi consortium 2017 the karakoram has the greatest glacier area in the region table 1 which represents 39 7 of the total glacier area in the region followed by the pamir with 22 1 of the total glacier area about 14 5 9 8 and 9 3 of the total glacier area is found in the western central and eastern himalaya respectively whereas 4 6 is in the hindu kush of all hpkh glaciers 82 are 1 0 km2 only contributing 18 of the total glacier area while 3 5 are 5 0 km2 contributing 56 8 of the total glacier area more importantly ablation zones of many glaciers in the region are covered by extensive supraglacial debris with heterogeneous thickness kraaijenbrink et al 2017 mölg et al 2018 xie et al 2020 the behaviors of hpkh glaciers are more heterogeneous and complex in response to changing climate compared to other mountain ranges of high mountain asia bolch et al 2012 azam et al 2021 bhattacharya et al 2021 miles et al 2021 glacier retreat stability advance and surge coexist in the hpkh region hewitt 2011 bhambri et al 2013 bolch et al 2017 on average glaciers in the karakoram and pamir have undergone balanced budgets or insignificant mass loss over the past several decades during past decades while glaciers in the himalaya and hindu kush have experienced highly negative mass balance bolch et al 2012 kääb et al 2012 gardelle et al 2012 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 bhattacharya et al 2021 miles et al 2021 the region is under the influence of the westerlies and the indian monsoon with significant variation in temperature and precipitation bookhagen and burbank 2010 immerzeel et al 2012 lutz et al 2014 yao et al 2019 this together with orographic forcing spatial variability and debris cover intensifies the complexity and variability of regional glacier changes bolch et al 2012 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 miles et al 2021 3 data and methods 3 1 data the datasets used in this study are glacier inventory aster images debris covered extent data debris thickness and ablation observations meteorological data and a digital elevation model dem we present detailed information regarding these datasets below glacier information of the hpkh region is derived from the randolph glacier inventory version 6 0 rgi 6 0 rgi consortium 2017 265 aster images are collected from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https search earthdata nas a gov search most images are cloud free and in a few cases the amount of cloud in a single image is 10 acquisition time of these images is mainly concentrated at the end of the melt season between 2010 and 2018 fig 2 solar radiation fluxes corresponding to the nearest acquisition time and location of aster images are taken from the ncep ncar reanalysis data kalnay et al 1996 two published datasets of the debris covered extent are derived from mölg et al 2018 and scherler et al 2018 respectively hereafter designated as the m2018 and s2018 datasets respectively the m2018 dataset mapped the debris covered extent on the glaciers in the karakoram and pamir through visual interpretation based on alos 1 palsar 1 images while the s2018 dataset automatically mapped the global debris covered extent using different algorithms based on landsat 8 and sentinel 2 images and rgi 6 0 a global dataset of debris thickness is derived from rounce et al 2021 which is estimated using an approach combining sub debris melt and surface temperature inversion method this dataset provides the information of the extent and thickness of debris cover hereafter designated as the r2021 dataset we collect ten debris covered glaciers in the karakoram and himalaya mountains where field observations of debris thickness and ice melt rate beneath the debris layer were carried out table 2 the existing data mentioned above are used to validate the performance of our approaches daily meteorological data from the s14fd dataset iizumi et al 2017 are used to estimate ice melt rates on different surface conditions including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and downward shortwave radiation flux outputs of the s14fd data are available for the period of 1958 2013 with a grid size of 0 5 which were corrected with the raw data of the jra 55 reanalysis iizumi et al 2017 the s14fd dataset was confirmed to be more accurate than other forcing datasets in representing observed climate variables in recent decades particularly the temperature and precipitation extremes iizumi et al 2017 in this study s14fd daily data are used directly to force the ice melt model over the period 2004 2013 in addition the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm dem https gdex cr usgs gov gdex is used in this study with a spatial resolution of 30 m based on srtm dem we can obtain the topographic information of the region and spatially distribute the meteorological data 3 2 methods 3 2 1 thermal resistance of the debris layer the thermal resistance of the debris layer is calculated as debris thickness divided by its thermal conductivity nakawo and young 1981 1982 however field determinations of the thickness and thermal conductivity of the debris layer are specifically time consuming and unrealistic resulting in sparse coverage of very few glaciers to overcome this difficulty recent studies mapped the thermal resistance of the debris layer based on aster images and reanalysis data with the assumption that the turbulent heat fluxes were omitted in the surface energy balance e g suzuki et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 fujita and sakai 2014 zhang et al 2016 this parameter has been applied to different debris covered glaciers e g nakawo and rana 1999 suzuki et al 2007 fujita and sakai 2014 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 which confirmed that the spatial pattern of the thermal resistance can be used to extract the characteristics of the extent and thickness of the debris layer at different scales suziki et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 fujita and sakai 2014 zhang et al 2016 the calculation process of thermal resistance used in this study is identical to that presented in the studies of zhang et al 2011 2016 and is described briefly here we calculate surface temperature from the average of the five thermal infrared tir bands of aster image using the equation presented in the study of alley and nilsen 2001 while surface albedo is estimated from the three visible and near infrared vnir bands using the formulas proposed by yüksel et al 2008 then we combine aster derived surface temperature and surface albedo with both downward radiation fluxes from ncep ncar reanalysis data at the timing and location closest to aster acquisition to calculate the thermal resistance of the debris layer the spatial resolution of the thermal resistance is 90 m the same as the grid size of the aster tir image 3 2 2 debris cover extraction the extent of debris cover on hpkh glaciers is mapped for the entire region according to aster derived thermal resistance values and glacier outlines and median elevation defined in the rgi 6 0 for the statistics of debris cover we consider only the ablation zones of glaciers in the region i e the zone below the median elevation a thermal resistance value 0 indicates a debris covered glacier surface while a value 0 indicates a debris free surface then we calculate the proportion of debris covered area for each glacier of the region i e the ratio of debris covered area and glacier area based on the debris covered area obtained above and glacier area defined in the rgi 6 0 the significant positive correlation between aster derived thermal resistance and debris thickness variability has been observed on different glaciers in high mountain asia e g suzuki et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 zhang and liu 2017 based on this relationship we derive the pattern of variation in debris thickness across the region according to the spatial distribution of thermal resistance finally we analyze the spatial characteristics of debris thickness in different mountain ranges of the region 3 2 3 ice melt ratio to assess the influence of debris cover and its spatial heterogeneity on hpkh glaciers we adopt the ice melt ratio parameter for each grid cell which is defined as the ice melt rate beneath the debris layer divided by that with the assumption of no debris in the same grid cell ice melt rates at both conditions for each grid cell are estimated using a physically based energy balance model zhang et al 2011 2012 the model considers the net radiation flux latent heat flux sensible heat flux and conductive heat flux across the debris ice atmosphere interface and computes the energy available for melting from energy exchange between the debris covered and debris free surfaces and the atmosphere all of which are described in detail in the studies of zhang et al 2011 2012 according to the spatial distribution of thermal resistance r the energy available for ice melting at debris covered r 0 and debris free r 0 surfaces qm is respectively estimated as follows 1 q g 1 α r s ε r l ε σ t s 273 15 4 q s q l q m q g t s t i r r 0 2 q m 1 α r s ε r l ε σ t s 273 15 4 q s q l q g r 0 where rs and rl are the downward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes w m 2 respectively qs and ql are the sensible and latent heat fluxes respectively q g and qg are the conductive heat fluxes through the debris layer and into the ice w m 2 respectively r is the thermal resistance of the debris layer m2 k w 1 ε is the emissivity taken to be 1 dimensionless σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 for upward longwave radiation emitted from the surface with temperature of ts c and ti is the ice temperature at the ice debris surface which is assumed to be 0 c zhang et al 2011 α and α are the albedos of debris covered and debris free surfaces which are assumed to be 0 2 and 0 3 respectively zhang et al 2011 2012 the downward longwave radiation is estimated from air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation using an empirical scheme kondo 1994 while the turbulent latent and sensible heat fluxes are calculated using a bulk aerodynamic method kondo 1994 then the melt rate of the debris covered debris free surface m is calculated for surface energy balance 0 as follows 3 m q m l f where lf is the latent heat of fusion of ice 3 33 105 j kg 1 all terms of the energy balance are taken to be positive toward the surface with the exception of the shortwave radiation component all components of the energy balance are determined from surface temperature that is calculated numerically by iteration the model is forced by daily s14fd meteorological data from 2004 to 2013 ice melt rates for each grid cell are calculated for the debris covered surface and assumed no debris surface respectively and averaged over the study period then we estimate the ice melt ratio of each grid cell on hpkh glaciers here the grid size for the ice melt ratio calculation is the same as that for the dataset of aster derived thermal resistances 3 2 4 validation validating our approach is challenging in the hpkh region due to the sparse observations related to debris cover on glaciers but it is vital for our method to realistically map the spatial pattern of the extent and thickness of debris cover and capture its impacts on a large scale therefore all available datasets observed or previously estimated on hpkh glaciers are used to validate the accuracy of our results these data are respectively 1 the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets of the debris covered extent 2 debris thickness data observed or estimated on the nine glaciers in the karakoram and himalaya table 2 and derived from the r2021 dataset and 3 ice melt data observed on the barpu ashraf and khan 2017 biafo ashraf and khan 2016 baltoro collier et al 2015 and hinarche mayer et al 2010 glaciers although these datasets only cover a small set of glaciers in the hpkh region such integrative validation can allow us to clearly understand the accuracy of the approaches used in this study first we compare the debris covered area between our results extracted from aster derived thermal resistances and the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets then we perform a comparison of the spatial pattern of observed debris thicknesses and aster derived thermal resistances of debris layers this allows assessment of the capability of our method to obtain the spatial pattern of the extent and thickness of the debris layer finally our modelled ice melt rates are compared to observations beneath different debris thicknesses on the four glaciers this allows evaluation of the performance of our ice melt model forced by s14fd daily meteorological data without any bias correction 4 results 4 1 evaluation of mapping accuracy we calculate the distribution of thermal resistance on hpkh glaciers from aster images and rgi 6 0 and then map the supraglacial debris cover of the entire region a comparison of the area altitude distribution of supraglacial debris in our results and the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets for each mountain range is shown in fig 3 the area altitude distribution of debris cover revealed by aster derived thermal resistance is consistent with those of the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets and the correlation coefficient between them exceeds 0 90 p 0 001 although our results and the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets show slight differences in the debris covered area in the high elevation region fig 3 especially in the karakoram fig 3b the debris covered area in this region for these datasets accounts for only a small proportion of the entire region in addition for glaciers 1 0 km2 in the hindu kush karakoram himalaya region the total difference between the results of herreid and pellicciotti 2020 and our results is about 1 6 of the total debris covered area 5 480 km2 vs 5 391 km2 table 3 to evaluate the relation between aster derived thermal resistances and observed debris thicknesses we compare individual debris thickness measurements to the thermal resistance derived from the pixel nearest to the observed location fig 4 shows a comparison of aster derived thermal resistances and debris thickness measurements on nine glaciers in the region which records continuous variation of debris cover in ablation zones the aster derived thermal resistances correlate reasonably well with the debris thickness measurements on different glaciers yielding correlation coefficients ranging from 0 77 to 0 94 with an average value of 0 85 p 0 05 in particular the spatial pattern of the thermal resistance of the debris layer corresponds well with the observed distribution of debris thickness on the glaciers fig 4 which is confirmed by comparison of aster derived thermal resistance and debris thickness derived from the r2021 dataset for each mountain ranges fig s1 overall our approach extracts the extent and thickness of debris cover well compared to the observations and the previous estimates our analyses of the approach accuracy lead confidence to support aster derived thermal resistance as a proxy for reasonably deriving the debris covered extent and debris thickness on hpkh glaciers 4 2 thermal resistance and debris thickness on hpkh glaciers the spatial distribution of aster derived thermal resistance of the debris layer on hpkh glaciers is illustrated in fig 5 indicating considerable spatial variability in the region overall the thermal resistance of the debris layer is generally higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast of the region fig 5 the regional average thermal resistance of all debris covered areas is 5 1 10 2 m2 k w 1 the thermal resistance altitude distribution reveals that the value of the thermal resistance is markedly higher at glacier termini and decreases gradually with increasing altitude fig 6 this spatial trend of thermal resistance agrees well with the observed pattern of debris thickness that increases toward downglacier the variation in the thermal resistance tends to be gentle with increasing altitude but changes considerably in the upper part of ablation zones fig 6 especially on the glaciers of the eastern himalaya fig 4 shows that the spatial distribution of aster derived thermal resistance has a positive association with that of debris thickness therefore we analyze the pattern of debris thickness on glaciers based on this relationship the average thermal resistance on glaciers of the hindu kush is highest in the region table 4 and is markedly higher than the average of the region this suggests that the average debris thickness on hindu kush glaciers is the thickest in the hpkh region followed by the central himalaya glaciers while it is the thinnest in the western himalaya our statistics from the thermal resistance dataset indicate that the average thickness of the debris layer in the karakoram is comparable to that in the pamir the average thermal resistances of these two regions are lower than the average of the region table 4 in the himalaya debris thickness tends to be thick in the central part and thin on both sides fig 5 and the average debris thickness in the eastern is slightly greater than that in the western table 4 4 3 debris cover on hpkh glaciers we identify that 58 of all glaciers in the hpkh region are covered with supraglacial debris cover and the debris covered surface accounts for about 14 3 of the total glacier area of the region for glaciers 1 km2 the total amount of debris covered glacier area is 6639 km2 which constitutes 85 of the total debris covered area of the region the region contains 1 137 glaciers each covering a debris covered area of 1 0 km2 and 96 glaciers each covering a debris covered area of 10 0 km2 for these 96 glaciers the total amount of debris covered area contributes 31 2 of the total regional debris covered area the regional debris cover map shows considerable variability between different mountain ranges table 4 the karakoram contains the greatest debris covered area in the hpkh region representing 34 4 of the total debris covered area of the region followed by the pamir 19 6 although the hindu kush has the smallest area of debris cover in the region the debris covered proportion 22 4 is the largest among different mountain ranges for the entire himalaya table 4 the largest debris covered area is found in the western himalaya with a debris covered proportion of 18 3 while the eastern himalaya has the smallest debris covered area as well as the smallest debris covered proportion in addition the karakoram and pamir host 67 debris covered glaciers with an area of 50 km2 with debris covered proportions varying from 2 0 to 36 0 and the area of debris cover accounting for 43 of the total debris covered area of the two mountain ranges we plot the area altitude distributions of the debris covered surface ablation zone and glacier of different mountain ranges fig 7 revealing further differences in debris covered surface between mountain ranges the most apparent difference is the elevation of debris distribution the lowest elevation of supraglacial debris distribution extends from 2200 m karakoram to 3800 m eastern himalaya and the others lies between the two fig 7 most of the regional debris covered area is located in the karakoram and pamir together 54 with supraglacial debris spanning a large elevation range by contrast the elevation span of supraglacial debris is relatively small in the hindu kush and eastern himalaya overall about 87 of the regional debris covered area is concentrated between 3 600 and 5 500 m where the average proportion of debris cover is about 23 most of glacier area below 3 600 m is covered by supraglacial debris with an average debris covered proportion of 72 while only 5 occurs above 5 500 m where the average proportion of debris cover is relatively small 1 in particular the proportion of debris cover in the lower elevation region of the central himalaya reaches 86 while the proportion is relatively small even in the lower part of the pamir 4 4 debris cover effect on hpkh glaciers we calculate the ice melt ratio of the debris covered surface on hpkh glaciers and its spatial distribution is shown in fig 8 an ice melt ratio 1 0 indicates that the ice melting beneath the debris layer is accelerated relative to that of climatically equivalent exposed ice hereafter termed the acceleration effect this process coincides with enhanced ice melting beneath thin debris layers typically 0 03 0 05 m on the other hand a ratio 1 0 indicates that the presence of the debris cover suppresses ice melting relative to that of climatically equivalent exposed ice hereafter termed the insulation effect ice melt ratios of the region vary from 0 1 to 1 8 indicating significant regional differences in the debris cover effect fig 8 in the hpkh region the acceleration effect of debris cover is dominant in the western himalaya and karakoram about 57 of the debris covered surface in the western himalaya where the ice melt ratio is 1 0 has experienced accelerating melting similarly about 52 of the debris covered surface in the karakoram has undergone accelerating melting by contrast the insulation effect of debris cover is dominant in the pamir hindu kush central and eastern himalaya fig 8 except for the pamir where the acceleration effect of debris cover is comparable to the insulation effect the insulation effect of debris cover in the other three regions is particularly significant about 76 of the total debris covered surface in the central himalaya inhibits ice melting while 68 and 64 are in the eastern himalaya and hindu kush respectively the hpkh region contains 30 glaciers with an area of 100 km2 contributing 15 3 of the regional glacier area these glaciers are all debris covered glaciers on which the debris covered proportions vary between 7 3 and 37 3 and the total area of debris cover contributes 18 of the total debris covered area of the region of these glaciers the acceleration effect of debris cover is dominant on 12 glaciers while the insulation effect is dominant on 15 glaciers and the two effects are equivalent on 3 glaciers in particular the debris covered area suppressing ice melting on 10 glaciers exceeds 60 for the entire region the net effect of considering spatially distributed debris thickness is the insulation effect fig 8 compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface the spatial distribution of debris cover leads to 28 reduction in ice melting over the entire region i e the mass loss of debris covered glaciers is reduced by 0 44 m w e yr 1 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty analysis the mapping of debris covered surface on hpkh glaciers relies heavily upon the spatial distribution of thermal resistance of debris layer there is uncertainty associated with the thermal resistance calculation caused by the assumption of neglecting turbulent fluxes in surface energy balance calculation in addition dry and wet conditions of the debris covered surface affect the thermal resistance through turbulent fluxes suzuki et al 2007 note that most aster images used in this study are carefully collected around noon on a clear day therefore the surface is generally in the dry condition on the time of aster data acquisition to identify how the assumption affects the estimated thermal resistance a sensitivity analysis is performed in which we run the approach to calculate the thermal resistance with 5 10 and 15 of the original value of net radiation flux to consider turbulent fluxes in surface energy balance calculation the sensitivity analysis reveals that the reduction of surface energy flux by 5 15 leads to an average increase of thermal resistance of 2 9 table s1 while the increase of surface energy flux by 5 15 results in an average decrease of thermal resistance of 8 16 this indicates that the uncertainty in thermal resistance is less sensitive to surface energy flux decrease caused by calculation assumptions compared to flux increase which is not 10 in general surface energy losses through turbulent fluxes reduce the positive net radiation fluxes during daylight hours nicholson and stiperski 2020 steiner et al 2021 therefore surface energy flux is unlikely to increase due to turbulent fluxes in the debris covered surface during daylight hours furthermore the uncertainty of thermal resistance and associated impacts has been discussed in previous studies which have confirmed that the uncertainty of thermal resistance arising from neglecting turbulent fluxes in energy balance calculation and using multitemporal aster data has relatively little influence on the spatial pattern of thermal resistance suzuki et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 ablation calculation zhang et al 2012 2016 and runoff simulation fujita and sakai 2014 in particular thermal resistances of debris layers on a himalayan glacier were estimated from observed meteorological data using two methods one considers all energy balance components of the debris covered surface and the other only considers the net radiation suzuki et al 2007 their results showed a small difference in thermal resistances calculated by two methods as discussed above the assumption of neglecting turbulent fluxes is unlikely to affect the calculation of the thermal resistance of the debris layer similarly the influence of uncertainty in thermal resistance on the ice melt ratio is assessed by a sensitivity analysis we run the model to calculate the ice melt ratio with 5 10 and 15 of the original value of thermal resistance the sensitivity analysis suggests that although the ice melting ratio varies with thermal resistance it is relatively less sensitive to thermal resistance table s1 on average the maximum uncertainty due to thermal resistance gives an ice melt ratio uncertainty within 8 we perform a comparison in mountain ranges where the debris covered extent has been mapped to evaluate major differences between our results and those of other studies compared to the results of herreid and pellicciotti 2020 our calculation of the debris covered area in the hindu kush karakoram himalaya region is 1 6 smaller whereas our result in the pamir karakoram region is slightly larger compared to the m2018 and s2018 datasets table3 these differences are mainly due to the different methods used and incomplete glacier inventory mölg et al 2018 scherler et al 2018 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 investigated the influences of the rgi 6 0 and topographical shading on mapping debris cover in different glaciated regions of the world and found that errors caused by these factors are relatively small in high mountain asia compared to other glaciated regions of the world the error within the rgi 6 0 including inaccurate or outdated glacier outlines summed to 2 8 of glacier area whereas the topographical shading error contributes to 2 4 of the glacier area furthermore two debris covered glaciers are selected from the pamir and karakoram region where the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets are all available the information of two glaciers can be found in table s2 we obtained the debris covered extent of two glaciers from the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets and then compared to our results figs s2 and s3 comparison analyses with the m2018 s2018 and r2021 datasets indicate that our result is comparable to the m2018 and s2018 datasets and is slightly larger than the r2021 dataset and the differences between these datasets mainly occurs in higher elevation region meanwhile the debris covered extent of five debris covered glaciers in the hunza catchment of the karakoram fig s4 is mapped through visual interpretation based on planetscope ps imagery with a pixel size of 3 125 m hereafter termed ps data comparing ps data from high resolution imagery to our results fig s5 the total difference is 4 5 of the total debris covered area 126 km2 vs 121 km2 as discussed above comparison of our results with multi datasets and high resolution data shows that our results derived from the spatial distribution of thermal resistance are acceptable on a large scale it is worth noting that the principal advantage of our approach is the fact that it requires relatively few input parameters and with the increasing enrichment of different types of remote sensing data and the gradual improvement of glacier inventory data it will be possible to accurately obtain the information on the extent and thickness of debris cover at different scales particularly in glacier areas without any debris observations in addition the daily outputs of the s14fd dataset without any bias correction are used to force the physically based ice melt model in this study an assessment of the s14fd outputs confirmed that the outputs can reasonably capture variation in observed climate variables and are more accuracy than other meteorological datasets iizumi et al 2017 a comparison between the s14fd outputs and observed meteorological records from three stations located in the hunza catchment indicate that the daily and monthly s14fd temperatures correlate well with ground observations figs s6 and s7 and analysis of the daily and monthly temperature data for three stations yield correlation coefficients r of 0 96 0 98 and 0 97 and 0 99 0 99 and 0 99 respectively in particular the s14fd temperature is able to capture the observed seasonal variability well fig s6 furthermore we compare modelled ice melt rates beneath the debris layer with observations from four debris covered glaciers in the region fig 9 a scatter plot of modelled versus observed ice melt rates beneath the debris layer on different glaciers shows good agreement except for the baltoro glacier where simulations are quite different from observations overall our results on different glaciers yield correlation coefficients of 0 74 and relative errors of 17 this gives us sufficient confidence to directly use the s14fd outputs as input for forcing our ice melt model to estimate ice melt rates at the regional scale 5 2 cause of the debris cover anomaly previous studies have suggested that the thinning rate of debris covered surface is similar to that of debris free surface kääb et al 2012 nuimura et al 2012 pellicciotti et al 2015 king et al 2019 which is referred to as the debris cover anomaly pellicciotti et al 2015 this phenomenon has been reported not only in the hpkh region but also in the european alps mölg et al 2019 and alaska anderson et al 2021 the mechanism of this phenomenon is complex and still controversial some studies suggested that the wide distribution of melt hotspots such as thin debris ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds on debris covered surface accelerates surface thinning e g sakai et al 2000 2002 patel et al 2016 miles et al 2018 buri et al 2021 rowan et al 2021 while others postulated that dynamic thinning under thick debris results from declining ice flow e g anderson and anderson 2018 anderson et al 2021 rounce et al 2021 we use the surface energy balance model to calculate regional ice melt ratios and found quite strong spatial differences in the debris cover effect fig 8 the average melt ratio of the entire hpkh region is 0 72 0 06 indicating that the reduction of total ice melting is about 28 due to the insulation effect of debris cover compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface which is equivalent to 0 44 0 04 m w e yr 1 of total mass loss for debris covered glaciers although 46 of total debris covered surface of the hpkh region experiences accelerating ice melting fig 8 and the distribution of melt hotspots locally increases surface thinning it cannot compensate overall for the reduction of total ice melting due to the insulation effect of debris cover this implies that the heterogeneous distribution of debris thickness and the resulting melt hotspots accelerate debris covered surface thinning to a certain extent but it is not the dominant cause of the debris cover anomaly in the hpkh region from another aspect our analysis supports the hypothesis that the predominant cause of the debris cover anomaly is the reduction of ice flux into the debris covered area leads to dynamic thinning under thick debris layers as reported previously anderson and anderson 2018 anderson et al 2021 rounce et al 2021 anderson et al 2021 explored four feedbacks of supraglacial debris ice cliffs supraglacial ponds and relief relating glacier thinning to ice melt changes on alaska s kennicott glacier and found that the debris cover anomaly is predominately caused by dynamic thinning rounce et al 2021 estimated that the contribution of accelerated melting due to ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds to the debris cover anomaly varies between 3 and 35 with the remaining 65 97 attributable to the influence of glacial dynamic processes however the complex interactions between the climate debris glacier dynamic system and its spatiotemporal changes result in the complicated cause of the debris cover anomaly due to the complexity of the climate debris glacier dynamic system it is difficult to diagnose the influences of different processes on debris covered glacier responses therefore further studies are required to determine the contributions of supraglacial debris and other processes related to the layer and ice dynamic processes to the debris cover anomaly 5 3 role of the debris cover effect in regional water resources hpkh glaciers markedly modulate the release of freshwater into regional rivers and the dynamic changes in these glaciers are crucial for local people relying on these water resources pritchard 2019 azam et al 2021 in particular the hpkh region contains the greatest debris covered area in high mountain asia kraaijenbrink et al 2017 scherler et al 2018 herreid and pellicciotti 2020 where spatial variation in supraglacial debris has a significant influence on ice melting and its spatial pattern through the surface atmosphere energy water exchange and albedo change benn et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 nicholson et al 2018 therefore accurate determination of the regional spatial distribution of debris thickness and associated impacts is of great significance for understanding regional glacier water resources effect and adaptation to climate change note that the ablation zone of a glacier is not only the main distribution area of debris cover but also the major runoff producing area in the glaciated catchment supraglacial debris cover changes the structure and seasonal evolution of the drainage system on the glacier through altering ice melting processes beneath the debris layer and its spatial pattern thus affecting the formation and variation of runoff in the glaciated catchment mair et al 2002 fujita and sakai 2014 fyffe et al 2019 jones et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 field observations of ablation beneath the debris layer have been carried out on a few debris covered glaciers in the hpkh region table 2 on biafo glacier in the karakoram the debris layer with a thickness of 0 01 m enhances ice melting by up to 19 compared to clean ice surface while the debris layer with a thickness of 0 07 m reduces ice melting by 34 ashraf and khan 2016 in the same region the ice melt rate beneath the debris layer on barpu glacier is reduced by 26 on average compared to clean ice surface ashraf and khan 2017 this phenomenon has also been observed on other debris covered glaciers such as baltoro and hinarche glaciers where the mean melt rates at the debris covered surface are decreased by about 22 and 30 respectively compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface mihalcea et al 2008 mayer et al 2010 muhammad et al 2020 found that clean ice melt rates are faster than the debris covered ice and even a thin debris layer 0 01 m thick does not enhance ice melting in the lower altitudes overall field ablation observations on different glaciers have indicated that the sub debris ice melting process is primarily controlled by the insulation effect of debris cover which is consistent with our findings fig 8 as estimated above the western himalaya and karakoram are dominated by the acceleration effect of debris cover where more than half of the debris covered surface experiences accelerating ice melting fig 8 according to our estimates the meltwater generated from the debris covered surface in the western himalaya and karakoram increases by 18 4 and 15 3 compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface respectively note that glacier meltwater is dominant in river runoff of these two regions and the maximum contribution of glacier meltwater can reach about 85 in the basins lutz et al 2014 2016 more importantly agriculture in the indus basin increasingly depends on meltwater in the present and future periods lutz et al 2022 consequently excess meltwater from the debris covered surface caused by the acceleration effect of debris cover in the western himalaya and karakoram can further regulate the runoff into regional reiver systems mainly the upper indus especially in dry season increasing the importance of meltwater to river runoff in these two regions by contrast the rest of the hpkh region including the pamir hindu kush central and eastern himalaya are dominated by the insulation effect of debris cover except the pamir 52 most of the debris covered surface in the hindu kush central and eastern himalaya inhibit ice melting fig 8 leading to a reduction of ice melting of 33 37 compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface this reduction in ice melting from debris covered surface suppresses further shrinkage of glacier termini and mass loss in the pamir hindu kush central and eastern himalaya in which higher rates of mass loss are observed on glaciers in recent years driven by changes in temperature and precipitation kraaijenbrink et al 2017 bhattacharya et al 2021 miles et al 2021 consequently the insulation effect of debris cover in these regions allows debris covered ice to survive for longer at lower altitudes than neighbouring clean ice glaciers overall the insulation effect of debris cover is dominant in the entire hpkh region fig 8 as a result the amount of ice melting on the entire debris covered glaciers of the region is reduced by 0 44 0 04 m w e yr 1 due to the insulation effect of debris cover which is equivalent to 3 0 2 and 1 5 0 1 of mean annual runoff of the entire indus and ganges rivers respectively thus the presence of debris cover retards glacier shrinkage and mass loss caused by climate warming in the hpkh region which will have a profound impact on the seasonal and interannual variability of river runoff in glacier fed catchments in this region as well as the temporal and spatial patterns and future trends of regional water resources 6 conclusion we present the extent and thickness of supraglacial debris cover on hpkh glaciers by using aster images and rgi 6 0 and quantify the debris cover effect and its spatial heterogeneity by applying a physically based ice melt model of all hpkh glaciers 58 are debris covered glaciers where the debris covered area contributes 14 3 of the total regional glacier area mainly concentrating on glaciers 1 km2 the karakoram contains the greatest debris covered area in the region while the hindu kush has the smallest area approximately 87 of the total debris covered surface is concentrated between altitudes of 3 600 5 500 m and the area below 3 600 m is almost completely covered by supraglacial debris with a debris covered proportion of 72 regional thermal resistance estimates reveal that debris thickness shows considerable spatial variability across the region which decreases gradually from northwest to southeast our analysis of ice melt ratios reveals that 46 of regional debris covered surface enhances ice melting and promotes the formation and development of melt hotspots like ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds supraglacial debris and other processes that occur within the layer may affect the local thinning of debris covered glaciers but it is not the dominant cause overall the insulation effect of debris cover reduces ice melting by 28 compared to climatically equivalent clean ice surface this significantly influences variation in regional glacier meltwater and slows down the regional water shortage and ecological environment risk caused by warming accelerated ice melting our estimates of supraglacial debris improve the capability of the model to capture spatially distributed debris thickness and associated impacts in regional glacier

2666,stepwise reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene pce to trichloroethene tce three dichloroethylene dce isomers 1 1 dce cis 1 2 dce and trans 1 2 dce vinyl chloride vc and ethane eth may proceed under anaerobic conditions however most multispecies transport models for describing the plume migration of a chemical mixture comprising the original chlorinated solvent and its dechlorinated byproducts in the literature are often simplified to a sequential first order reaction network which cannot account for the divergent reactions from tce to the three dce isomers and convergent reactions from the three dce isomers to vc in this study general analytical solutions to multispecies transport equations with a complex reaction network were derived for a combination of semi infinite and finite systems the developed analytical solutions were robustly verified against a semi analytical solution that can consider the same complex reaction network the verification results indicated that the derived analytical solutions were accurate and robust the general solutions derived in the present study were also used to investigate the effects of the outlet boundary conditions on solute transport involving a complex reaction network the results showed that the analytical solution derived for infinite outlet bcs predicted lower concentrations of contaminants near the outlet boundary than those for finite outlet bcs moreover a straight decay chain model may over or under estimate the dce and vc concentrations compared to the multiple branching isomer reaction model the developed analytical solutions with a complex reaction network provide more realistic and efficient tools for assessing the movement of chlorinated solvents and their degradation related byproducts in soil water systems keywords analytical solutions complex reaction network multispecies semi infinite system finite system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination is a major global concern and theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to understand the movement of contaminants in groundwater a large body of prediction tools for describing the behavior of contaminants based on the analytical solutions of the single species advection dispersion equation ade have been derived in the literature e g van genuchten and alves 1982 batu 1989 leij et al 1993 park and zhan 2001 zhan et al 2009 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 chen et al 2011 pérez guerrero et al 2013 chlorinated solvents such as tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce are frequently found as contaminants in groundwater and can produce stepwise degradation compounds which can be more toxic and mobile than the original chlorinated solvents therefore over the past few decades many analytical solutions to a set of coupled ades have been proposed for modeling the plume migration of a chemical mixture comprised of the original chlorinated solvent and its degradation byproducts cho 1971 van genuchten 1985 aziz et al 2000 bauer et al 2001 srinivasan and clement 2008a 2008b pérez guerrero et al 2009a chen et al 2012a chen et al 2012b chen et al 2016 chen et al 2019 suk 2013 2016 liao et al 2021 the most popular analytical models for coupled multispecies transport is the biochlor aziz et al 2000 which was provided by the center for subsurface modeling support csmos of the united states environmental protection agency usepa in the biochlor model a straight reaction network pce tce dichloroethylene dce vinyl chloride vc ethane eth is assumed the primary degradation pathways for pce and tce consist of three dichloroethylene dce isomers cis 1 2 dce trans 1 2 dce and 1 1 dce which have different solubilities in water viscosities organic carbon water partitioning coefficients and degradation rate constants stroo and ward 2010 accordingly a multispecies transport analytical model that reflects the different physical and chemical characteristics of the three dce isomers and accounts for the resulting complex reaction network is required to realistically describe the transport behavior of chlorinated solvents and their degradation byproducts in the soil water system however most multispecies transport analytical models including biochlor consider only a straight decay reaction network rather than a complex reaction network which involves both divergent and convergent reactions to accurately describe the realistic transport behavior of individual dce isomers thus they cannot adequately predict the spatiotemporal concentrations distribution of the three dce isomers and their degradation byproducts sun et al 1999 derived the analytical solutions for multispecies transport coupled with both serial and divergent reactions in a reaction network but neglected convergent reactions from the three dce isomers to vc later lu et al 2003 and sun et al 2004 derived a closed form analytical solution of chlorinated solvent transport with a convergent reaction network all contaminants were assumed to keep the same value of the retardation factor which limited the practical application of the model only a few studies over the past decades have derived analytical solutions for coupled multispecies transport with a complex reaction network that can handle distinct retardation factors mieles and zhan 2012 sudicky et al 2013 wang and neville 2019 recently wang and neville 2019 presented a semi analytical solution in which a complex reaction network was considered a code namely decay written in the fortran language was also developed to facilitate the implementation of the solution computation however most of these recent studies have only provided semi analytical solutions that require numerical inversion of the laplace transform and are limited to accounting for up to four decay levels meaning that the last species eth could not be included furthermore semi analytical solutions may also introduce numerical errors resulting from the numerical inversion of the laplace transform this study aimed to derive new exact analytical solutions of one dimensional multispecies ades coupled with a complex reaction network compared to the limitations of existing multispecies analytical solutions the new analytical solutions developed in this study have three advantages first the general solutions are fully analytical rather than semi analytical which means that the solutions in this study are exact second the derived solutions can simulate the transport of all contaminants including multiple branching isomers with different retardation factors third the derived solutions accommodate semi infinite and finite systems subject to both the first and third type inlet boundary conditions to expand their practical applicability 2 mathematical model this study develops general exact analytical solutions for a set of one dimensional multispecies ades coupled with a complex reaction network to describe a realistic pce degradation pathway as shown in fig 1 the transport and fate processes include advection hydrodynamic dispersion branching degradation reactions from tce to the three dce isomers and linear equilibrium isotherm sorption the governing equations for describing the reactive transport of all contaminants involved in the pce degradation pathway considering

spatial coordinate l t is the time t d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2t 1 v is the average pore water velocity lt 1 μ i is the first order degradation reaction rate constant of the ith contaminant t 1 y i j is the yield coefficient which accounts for the mass conversion rate produced from parent contaminant i to daughter contaminant j and thus y p t y t d y d v y v e are yield coefficients from pce to tce from tce to dce from dce to vc and from vc to eth respectively f ji is the branching ratio of divergent transformation of parent contaminant j to daughter products i and r

is the organic water partitioning coefficient for ith contaminant i m 1l f oc is the organic carbon fraction of the porous medium and θ is the porosity of the aquifer this study considers that the aquifer is free of mass for all contaminants at the initial time 9 c i x t 0 0 i 1 2 7 two different inlet boundary conditions bcs for each contaminant are specified as follows c i x 0 t c i 0 i 1 2 7

the aid of a variety of integral transform techniques van genuchten and alves 1982 chen et al 2011 and the mathematical derivation are provided in detail in the appendices it should be noted that the final expressions of the analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain presented in appendix a have a finite number of terms however the final expressions of the analytical solutions for the finite domain presented in appendix b are in the form of a summation of infinite series expansion where the summation is taken over all eigenvalues because the structures of derived analytical solutions which include many special functions are complicated to develop a computer code for implementing the solution computation by the readers thus we provide the executable file of fortran code and its corresponding input file on the website https camrdaprod ncu edu tw software for readers who are interested in simulating chlorinated solvents transport with a complex reaction network van genuchten and alves 1982 pointed out that the computational efficiency of analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain is better than that of the solutions for the finite domain the great computational efficiency of the analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain renders them very powerful to perform a probabilistic health risk assessment in which a large number of numerical simulations are required to model the transport of chlorinated solvents and their byproducts at contaminated sites subject to several parameter uncertainties 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the derived analytical solutions first the correctness of the developed analytical solutions and computer program are verified the verification example compares our analytical solutions developed for both semi infinite and finite domains against the semi analytical model decay wang and neville 2019 and a corresponding numerical solutions generated based on identical problems defined in eqs 1 13 which are numerically solved using the laplace transform finite difference method the simulated scenario for verification is adapted from an example involving the transport of chlorinated solvents that was previously used by sun et al 2004 to demonstrate the applicability of their derived solutions the reaction network consists of seven species with five decay levels in which the second species tce produces three isomers of dce as shown in fig 1 the inlet source concentrations of contaminants were set to 1 g m3 for pce and 0 for all other degradation byproducts the retardation factor used in the solution of sun et al 2004 should be assigned a single value for all contaminants however the retardation factors for the different contaminants used in this study differed and were calculated using eq 8 with ρ b θ f oc and k oc i adopted from the biochlor manual and wang and neville 2019 as listed in table 1 the transport parameters used for the verification are listed in table 2 the number of terms for summation of infinite series expansions to achieve the accuracy of the numerical evaluation of the derived analytical solutions for the finite domain usually depends on the peclet number pe vl d van genuchten and alves 1982 chen et al 2011 2012a in this example when pe is 40 the required numbers of terms for these seven species to obtain accurate values up to four decimal points are 18 000 10 000 2 000 2 000 2 000 500 and 200 respectively however because the mathematical expression of the derived analytical solution for the semi infinite domain is a combination of exponential and error functions rather than the summation of the infinite series expansion of the solution for the finite domain the derived analytical solution for the semi infinite domain is more computationally efficient than the solution for the finite domain table 3 compares the cpu running time for producing the spatial concentrations profiles consisting of 100 observation points of seven contaminants of the verification example for semi infinite and finite domains as shown in fig 2 on an intel r pentium r cpu n3540 2 16 ghz computer with a microsoft windows 10 operating system the results clearly show that the derived analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain have greater computational efficiency with running times at least 80 times shorter than the solutions derived for the finite domain fig 2 compares the spatial concentration profiles of seven contaminants along the direction at different simulation times t 100 200 and 300 days obtained from the developed analytical solutions for the semi infinite and finite domains a semi analytical solution decay and a numerical solution for the first type bc moreover fig 3 compares the solutions for the third type bc figs 2 and 3 illustrate that the numerical simulations of these solutions closely match among each other which warrant the correctness of the general analytical solutions derived in this study in this example because the inlet concentration is assumed to be zero for all degradation byproducts except the inlet concentration of pce which was set to 1 g m3 the pce concentration decrease over time and the concentrations of other degradation byproducts initially increased to reach peak concentration and then continued to decrease after a period of time in addition vc has high mobility to travel longer distances from the pce source location because its retardation factor value is assigned lower than those of any other species the effect of the outlet bcs on the solute transport of all contaminants is discussed in more detail in section 3 2 3 2 effect of outlet bcs on the multispecies plume migration with a complex reaction network past studies have shown that inlet and outlet bcs can significantly affect the solute concentration near the boundaries chen et al 2019 and liao et al 2021 investigated the effects of inlet bcs on multispecies transport whereas chen et al 2011 2012a investigated the effect of outlet bcs and concluded that the magnitude of the influence of the bcs would be significant depending on the values of pe however most studies investigated either a single species or multiple species with a straight decay reaction network while investigations regarding the effect of outlet bcs on the migration of multispecies plumes with a complex reaction network are still lacking in the present study the derived analytical solutions for semi infinite and finite systems are compared between each other to illustrate how outlet bcs affect multispecies transport with a complex reaction network the simulation conditions and transport parameters are the same as those used in the verification example as shown in table 2 except for the domain length l 30 m and three other dispersion coefficients d 3 m 2 d a y 1 d 1 2 m 2 d a y 1 d 0 3 m 2 d a y 1 corresponding to three different pe values 4 10 and 40 figs 4 6 compare the spatial concentration profiles along the x direction for pce and its degraded contaminants at t 300 days computed from the derived analytical solutions for four different combinations of inlet and outlet bcs for pe 4 10 and 40 respectively for the region near the outlet boundary the simulated concentration profiles of most degraded contaminants between the analytical solutions for semi infinite and finite domains are different for large dispersion coefficients small pe for example the simulated concentrations of the tce three dce isomers vc and eth near the end of the system x 30 m generated from the semi infinite domain solution are markedly lower than those obtained from the finite domain solution for large dispersion coefficients of the 3 m 2 d a y 1 as shown in fig 4 this discrepancy is more pronounced for vc and eth contaminants however the discrepancy in the simulated concentration for all contaminants at the regions near the end of the system x 30 m is smaller when using medium or small dispersion coefficients d 1 2 m 2 d a y 1 d 0 3 m 2 d a y 1 as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively this is because the solute transport in a semi infinite system can move farther than that in a finite system and the contaminants of vc and eth are degradation byproducts of late order which are produced downstream and will be significantly affected by the outlet boundary the above investigation illustrates that the analytical solution derived for the semi infinite domain gives rise to lower concentrations of the seven contaminants near the outlet boundary as compared to the finite domain solution for a large dispersion coefficient however the computational efficiency of the evaluation of the solution in the semi infinite domain outperforms that for the finite domain note that the terms of the summation series required for an accurate solution for the finite domain may increase resulting in slow convergence for problems with large pe values thus the analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain are still useful for producing accurate results and saving considerable computation time particularly for problems with medium to large dispersion coefficients and thus may replace the analytical solution for the finite domain for a wide range of dispersion coefficients 3 3 performance evaluation of branching chain versus straight chain reactions models the branching ratios for the transformation of tce into different dec isomers are crucial parameters to accurately simulate the fate and transport of pce and its degradation byproducts hwang et al 2015 however most analytical solutions for multispecies transport coupled with a straight reaction network in previous research cannot account for the transformation of tce into three dce isomers with different branching ratios thus the derived analytical solutions in the present study are applied for comparison with the solutions that considered a straight reaction network pce tce cis 1 2 dce vc eth in which only cis 1 2 dce is considered but trans 1 2 dce and 1 1 dce are ignored the simulation conditions and transport parameters are identical to those used in the verification example tabulated in table 2 except that the branching ratio is assumed to be 1 for cis 1 2 dce for the solutions with a straight reaction network figs 7 and 8 compare the spatial concentration profiles of pce tce total dce vc and eth along the x direction at different simulation times t 100 and 200 days obtained from our derived analytical solutions for a complex reaction network and the analytical solutions for a straight reaction network subjected to first and third type bcs respectively it is expected that the results of the predicted concentration between the complex reaction network and the straight reaction network match closely with each other when simulating pce and tce because these two compounds are the parent contaminants of the three isomers of dce however when simulating dce the solutions for the straight reaction work that consider only cis 1 2 dce have a lower degradation rate constant μ i 0 02 day 1 for cis 1 2 dce than those for other two dce isomers μ i 0 035 day 1 for trans 1 2 dce and μ i 0 055 day 1for 1 1 dce predict higher total dce concentrations than the derived solutions in the present study for the complex reaction network this overestimation of cis 1 2 dce concentration compared to that predicted by the present study as shown in fig 7 c and 8 c because cis 1 2 dce which has a lower degradation rate constant is considered in the solution for a straight chain reaction it produces lower vc concentrations and causes inaccurate prediction of the concentration of the end byproduct of eth moreover we also investigate the time it will take for the contaminant to achieve the maximum concentration level which is the drinking water standard from the epa for natural attenuation at the downstream location of the plume using our derived analytical solutions this study focuses on the later order of degradation byproduct vc with a maximum concentration level of 0 002 g m 3 set by the usepa stroo and ward 2010 fig 9 compares the breakthrough curve of vc at 130 m downstream from the source obtained from our derived analytical solutions and the analytical solutions for a straight reaction network the results show that the previous straight reaction network model may overestimate the concentration causing it to exceed the standard of 0 002 g m 3 for a longer elapsed time at a longer distance from the source above all the analytical solutions developed in the present study are valuable for simulating the transport of chlorinated solvents using a realistic degradation reaction network 4 conclusions this study presents general analytical solutions of one dimensional multispecies transport equations coupled with a complex reaction network in which the transformation of tce into three dce isomers is included to simulate a real degradation reaction pathway of pce the solutions accommodated both semi infinite and finite domains subject to both the first and third type inlet boundary conditions the solutions are exact without invoking the numerical inversion required for semi analytical solutions the general solutions developed in the present study are free of the limitations of all contaminants should be assigned only a single retardation factor value the developed analytical solutions are verified using a chlorinated solvent example and the results show good agreement with the previous semi analytical solutions and the numerical solution generated using ltfd technique the derived solutions are then used to investigate how the outlet bcs affect multispecies transport with a complex reaction network at the region adjacent to the outlet boundary the results show that the solutions for the semi infinite domain may underestimate the concentration compared with the solution for the finite domain especially for larger dispersion coefficients the derived solutions with the complex reaction network are compared to the previous straight reaction network solutions and the results show that the straight reaction network may overestimate or underestimate the concentrations of dce and vc as compared to those obtained from the complex reaction network solutions due to lack of consideration of different dce isomers the analytical solutions derived in the present study which accommodate a complex reaction network can provide realistic and practical applications for simulating the transport of chlorinated solvents and their degradation

2666,stepwise reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene pce to trichloroethene tce three dichloroethylene dce isomers 1 1 dce cis 1 2 dce and trans 1 2 dce vinyl chloride vc and ethane eth may proceed under anaerobic conditions however most multispecies transport models for describing the plume migration of a chemical mixture comprising the original chlorinated solvent and its dechlorinated byproducts in the literature are often simplified to a sequential first order reaction network which cannot account for the divergent reactions from tce to the three dce isomers and convergent reactions from the three dce isomers to vc in this study general analytical solutions to multispecies transport equations with a complex reaction network were derived for a combination of semi infinite and finite systems the developed analytical solutions were robustly verified against a semi analytical solution that can consider the same complex reaction network the verification results indicated that the derived analytical solutions were accurate and robust the general solutions derived in the present study were also used to investigate the effects of the outlet boundary conditions on solute transport involving a complex reaction network the results showed that the analytical solution derived for infinite outlet bcs predicted lower concentrations of contaminants near the outlet boundary than those for finite outlet bcs moreover a straight decay chain model may over or under estimate the dce and vc concentrations compared to the multiple branching isomer reaction model the developed analytical solutions with a complex reaction network provide more realistic and efficient tools for assessing the movement of chlorinated solvents and their degradation related byproducts in soil water systems keywords analytical solutions complex reaction network multispecies semi infinite system finite system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination is a major global concern and theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to understand the movement of contaminants in groundwater a large body of prediction tools for describing the behavior of contaminants based on the analytical solutions of the single species advection dispersion equation ade have been derived in the literature e g van genuchten and alves 1982 batu 1989 leij et al 1993 park and zhan 2001 zhan et al 2009 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 chen et al 2011 pérez guerrero et al 2013 chlorinated solvents such as tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce are frequently found as contaminants in groundwater and can produce stepwise degradation compounds which can be more toxic and mobile than the original chlorinated solvents therefore over the past few decades many analytical solutions to a set of coupled ades have been proposed for modeling the plume migration of a chemical mixture comprised of the original chlorinated solvent and its degradation byproducts cho 1971 van genuchten 1985 aziz et al 2000 bauer et al 2001 srinivasan and clement 2008a 2008b pérez guerrero et al 2009a chen et al 2012a chen et al 2012b chen et al 2016 chen et al 2019 suk 2013 2016 liao et al 2021 the most popular analytical models for coupled multispecies transport is the biochlor aziz et al 2000 which was provided by the center for subsurface modeling support csmos of the united states environmental protection agency usepa in the biochlor model a straight reaction network pce tce dichloroethylene dce vinyl chloride vc ethane eth is assumed the primary degradation pathways for pce and tce consist of three dichloroethylene dce isomers cis 1 2 dce trans 1 2 dce and 1 1 dce which have different solubilities in water viscosities organic carbon water partitioning coefficients and degradation rate constants stroo and ward 2010 accordingly a multispecies transport analytical model that reflects the different physical and chemical characteristics of the three dce isomers and accounts for the resulting complex reaction network is required to realistically describe the transport behavior of chlorinated solvents and their degradation byproducts in the soil water system however most multispecies transport analytical models including biochlor consider only a straight decay reaction network rather than a complex reaction network which involves both divergent and convergent reactions to accurately describe the realistic transport behavior of individual dce isomers thus they cannot adequately predict the spatiotemporal concentrations distribution of the three dce isomers and their degradation byproducts sun et al 1999 derived the analytical solutions for multispecies transport coupled with both serial and divergent reactions in a reaction network but neglected convergent reactions from the three dce isomers to vc later lu et al 2003 and sun et al 2004 derived a closed form analytical solution of chlorinated solvent transport with a convergent reaction network all contaminants were assumed to keep the same value of the retardation factor which limited the practical application of the model only a few studies over the past decades have derived analytical solutions for coupled multispecies transport with a complex reaction network that can handle distinct retardation factors mieles and zhan 2012 sudicky et al 2013 wang and neville 2019 recently wang and neville 2019 presented a semi analytical solution in which a complex reaction network was considered a code namely decay written in the fortran language was also developed to facilitate the implementation of the solution computation however most of these recent studies have only provided semi analytical solutions that require numerical inversion of the laplace transform and are limited to accounting for up to four decay levels meaning that the last species eth could not be included furthermore semi analytical solutions may also introduce numerical errors resulting from the numerical inversion of the laplace transform this study aimed to derive new exact analytical solutions of one dimensional multispecies ades coupled with a complex reaction network compared to the limitations of existing multispecies analytical solutions the new analytical solutions developed in this study have three advantages first the general solutions are fully analytical rather than semi analytical which means that the solutions in this study are exact second the derived solutions can simulate the transport of all contaminants including multiple branching isomers with different retardation factors third the derived solutions accommodate semi infinite and finite systems subject to both the first and third type inlet boundary conditions to expand their practical applicability 2 mathematical model this study develops general exact analytical solutions for a set of one dimensional multispecies ades coupled with a complex reaction network to describe a realistic pce degradation pathway as shown in fig 1 the transport and fate processes include advection hydrodynamic dispersion branching degradation reactions from tce to the three dce isomers and linear equilibrium isotherm sorption the governing equations for describing the reactive transport of all contaminants involved in the pce degradation pathway considering the three isomers of dce can be mathematically written as follows 1 d 2 c 1 x t x 2 v c 1 x t x μ 1 c 1 x t r 1 c 1 x t t 2 d 2 c 2 x t x 2 v c 2 x t x μ 2 c 2 x t y p t μ 1 c 1 x t r 2 c 2 x t t 3 d

spatial coordinate l t is the time t d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2t 1 v is the average pore water velocity lt 1 μ i is the first order degradation reaction rate constant of the ith contaminant t 1 y i j is the yield coefficient which accounts for the mass conversion rate produced from parent contaminant i to daughter contaminant j and thus y p t y t d y d v y v e are yield coefficients from pce to tce from tce to dce from dce to vc and from vc to eth respectively f ji is the branching ratio of divergent transformation of parent contaminant j to daughter products i and r

is the organic water partitioning coefficient for ith contaminant i m 1l f oc is the organic carbon fraction of the porous medium and θ is the porosity of the aquifer this study considers that the aquifer is free of mass for all contaminants at the initial time 9 c i x t 0 0 i 1 2 7 two different inlet boundary conditions bcs for each contaminant are specified as follows c i x 0 t c i 0 i 1 2 7 10 for the first type bc d c i x 0 t x v c i x 0 t v c i 0 i 1 2 7 for the third type bc where c i 0 is the inlet source concentration of the ith contaminant applied on the inlet boundary the derived solutions can accommodate both semi infinite and finite groundwater systems for a semi infinite system we considered the outlet boundary conditions to be far from the contaminant source as follows 12 c i x t 0 i 1 2 7 for a finite system the outlet boundary condition is characterized with zero gradients as follows 13 c i x l t x 0 i 1 2 7 in this study all analytical solutions are obtained with the aid of a variety of integral transform techniques van genuchten and alves 1982 chen et al 2011 and the mathematical derivation are provided in detail in the appendices it should be noted that the final expressions of the analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain presented in appendix a have a finite number of terms however the final expressions of the analytical solutions for the finite domain presented in appendix b are in the form of a summation of infinite series expansion where the summation is taken over all eigenvalues because the structures of derived analytical solutions which include many special functions are complicated to develop a computer code for implementing the solution computation by the readers thus we provide the executable file of fortran code and its corresponding input file on the website https camrdaprod ncu edu tw software for readers who are interested in simulating chlorinated solvents transport with a complex reaction network van genuchten and alves 1982 pointed out that the computational efficiency of analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain is better than that of the solutions for the finite domain the great computational efficiency of the analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain renders them very powerful to perform a probabilistic health risk assessment in which a large number of numerical simulations are required to model the transport of chlorinated solvents and their byproducts at contaminated sites subject to several parameter uncertainties 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the derived analytical solutions first the correctness of the developed analytical solutions and computer program are verified the verification example compares our analytical solutions developed for both semi infinite and finite domains against the semi analytical model decay wang and neville 2019 and a corresponding numerical solutions generated based on identical problems defined in eqs 1 13 which are numerically solved using the laplace transform finite difference method the simulated scenario for verification is adapted from an example involving the transport of chlorinated solvents that was previously used by sun et al 2004 to demonstrate the applicability of their derived solutions the reaction network consists of seven species with five decay levels in which the second species tce produces three isomers of dce as shown in fig 1 the inlet source concentrations of contaminants were set to 1 g m3 for pce and 0 for all other degradation byproducts the retardation factor used in the solution of sun et al 2004 should be assigned a single value for all contaminants however the retardation factors for the different contaminants used in this study differed and were calculated using eq 8 with ρ b θ f oc and k oc i adopted from the biochlor manual and wang and neville 2019 as listed in table 1 the transport parameters used for the verification are listed in table 2 the number of terms for summation of infinite series expansions to achieve the accuracy of the numerical evaluation of the derived analytical solutions for the finite domain usually depends on the peclet number pe vl d van genuchten and alves 1982 chen et al 2011 2012a in this example when pe is 40 the required numbers of terms for these seven species to obtain accurate values up to four decimal points are 18 000 10 000 2 000 2 000 2 000 500 and 200 respectively however because the mathematical expression of the derived analytical solution for the semi infinite domain is a combination of exponential and error functions rather than the summation of the infinite series expansion of the solution for the finite domain the derived analytical solution for the semi infinite domain is more computationally efficient than the solution for the finite domain table 3 compares the cpu running time for producing the spatial concentrations profiles consisting of 100 observation points of seven contaminants of the verification example for semi infinite and finite domains as shown in fig 2 on an intel r pentium r cpu n3540 2 16 ghz computer with a microsoft windows 10 operating system the results clearly show that the derived analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain have greater computational efficiency with running times at least 80 times shorter than the solutions derived for the finite domain fig 2 compares the spatial concentration profiles of seven contaminants along the direction at different simulation times t 100 200 and 300 days obtained from the developed analytical solutions for the semi infinite and finite domains a semi analytical solution decay and a numerical solution for the first type bc moreover fig 3 compares the solutions for the third type bc figs 2 and 3 illustrate that the numerical simulations of these solutions closely match among each other which warrant the correctness of the general analytical solutions derived in this study in this example because the inlet concentration is assumed to be zero for all degradation byproducts except the inlet concentration of pce which was set to 1 g m3 the pce concentration decrease over time and the concentrations of other degradation byproducts initially increased to reach peak concentration and then continued to decrease after a period of time in addition vc has high mobility to travel longer distances from the pce source location because its retardation factor value is assigned lower than those of any other species the effect of the outlet bcs on the solute transport of all contaminants is discussed in more detail in section 3 2 3 2 effect of outlet bcs on the multispecies plume migration with a complex reaction network past studies have shown that inlet and outlet bcs can significantly affect the solute concentration near the boundaries chen et al 2019 and liao et al 2021 investigated the effects of inlet bcs on multispecies transport whereas chen et al 2011 2012a investigated the effect of outlet bcs and concluded that the magnitude of the influence of the bcs would be significant depending on the values of pe however most studies investigated either a single species or multiple species with a straight decay reaction network while investigations regarding the effect of outlet bcs on the migration of multispecies plumes with a complex reaction network are still lacking in the present study the derived analytical solutions for semi infinite and finite systems are compared between each other to illustrate how outlet bcs affect multispecies transport with a complex reaction network the simulation conditions and transport parameters are the same as those used in the verification example as shown in table 2 except for the domain length l 30 m and three other dispersion coefficients d 3 m 2 d a y 1 d 1 2 m 2 d a y 1 d 0 3 m 2 d a y 1 corresponding to three different pe values 4 10 and 40 figs 4 6 compare the spatial concentration profiles along the x direction for pce and its degraded contaminants at t 300 days computed from the derived analytical solutions for four different combinations of inlet and outlet bcs for pe 4 10 and 40 respectively for the region near the outlet boundary the simulated concentration profiles of most degraded contaminants between the analytical solutions for semi infinite and finite domains are different for large dispersion coefficients small pe for example the simulated concentrations of the tce three dce isomers vc and eth near the end of the system x 30 m generated from the semi infinite domain solution are markedly lower than those obtained from the finite domain solution for large dispersion coefficients of the 3 m 2 d a y 1 as shown in fig 4 this discrepancy is more pronounced for vc and eth contaminants however the discrepancy in the simulated concentration for all contaminants at the regions near the end of the system x 30 m is smaller when using medium or small dispersion coefficients d 1 2 m 2 d a y 1 d 0 3 m 2 d a y 1 as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively this is because the solute transport in a semi infinite system can move farther than that in a finite system and the contaminants of vc and eth are degradation byproducts of late order which are produced downstream and will be significantly affected by the outlet boundary the above investigation illustrates that the analytical solution derived for the semi infinite domain gives rise to lower concentrations of the seven contaminants near the outlet boundary as compared to the finite domain solution for a large dispersion coefficient however the computational efficiency of the evaluation of the solution in the semi infinite domain outperforms that for the finite domain note that the terms of the summation series required for an accurate solution for the finite domain may increase resulting in slow convergence for problems with large pe values thus the analytical solutions for the semi infinite domain are still useful for producing accurate results and saving considerable computation time particularly for problems with medium to large dispersion coefficients and thus may replace the analytical solution for the finite domain for a wide range of dispersion coefficients 3 3 performance evaluation of branching chain versus straight chain reactions models the branching ratios for the transformation of tce into different dec isomers are crucial parameters to accurately simulate the fate and transport of pce and its degradation byproducts hwang et al 2015 however most analytical solutions for multispecies transport coupled with a straight reaction network in previous research cannot account for the transformation of tce into three dce isomers with different branching ratios thus the derived analytical solutions in the present study are applied for comparison with the solutions that considered a straight reaction network pce tce cis 1 2 dce vc eth in which only cis 1 2 dce is considered but trans 1 2 dce and 1 1 dce are ignored the simulation conditions and transport parameters are identical to those used in the verification example tabulated in table 2 except that the branching ratio is assumed to be 1 for cis 1 2 dce for the solutions with a straight reaction network figs 7 and 8 compare the spatial concentration profiles of pce tce total dce vc and eth along the x direction at different simulation times t 100 and 200 days obtained from our derived analytical solutions for a complex reaction network and the analytical solutions for a straight reaction network subjected to first and third type bcs respectively it is expected that the results of the predicted concentration between the complex reaction network and the straight reaction network match closely with each other when simulating pce and tce because these two compounds are the parent contaminants of the three isomers of dce however when simulating dce the solutions for the straight reaction work that consider only cis 1 2 dce have a lower degradation rate constant μ i 0 02 day 1 for cis 1 2 dce than those for other two dce isomers μ i 0 035 day 1 for trans 1 2 dce and μ i 0 055 day 1for 1 1 dce predict higher total dce concentrations than the derived solutions in the present study for the complex reaction network this overestimation of cis 1 2 dce concentration compared to that predicted by the present study as shown in fig 7 c and 8 c because cis 1 2 dce which has a lower degradation rate constant is considered in the solution for a straight chain reaction it produces lower vc concentrations and causes inaccurate prediction of the concentration of the end byproduct of eth moreover we also investigate the time it will take for the contaminant to achieve the maximum concentration level which is the drinking water standard from the epa for natural attenuation at the downstream location of the plume using our derived analytical solutions this study focuses on the later order of degradation byproduct vc with a maximum concentration level of 0 002 g m 3 set by the usepa stroo and ward 2010 fig 9 compares the breakthrough curve of vc at 130 m downstream from the source obtained from our derived analytical solutions and the analytical solutions for a straight reaction network the results show that the previous straight reaction network model may overestimate the concentration causing it to exceed the standard of 0 002 g m 3 for a longer elapsed time at a longer distance from the source above all the analytical solutions developed in the present study are valuable for simulating the transport of chlorinated solvents using a realistic degradation reaction network 4 conclusions this study presents general analytical solutions of one dimensional multispecies transport equations coupled with a complex reaction network in which the transformation of tce into three dce isomers is included to simulate a real degradation reaction pathway of pce the solutions accommodated both semi infinite and finite domains subject to both the first and third type inlet boundary conditions the solutions are exact without invoking the numerical inversion required for semi analytical solutions the general solutions developed in the present study are free of the limitations of all contaminants should be assigned only a single retardation factor value the developed analytical solutions are verified using a chlorinated solvent example and the results show good agreement with the previous semi analytical solutions and the numerical solution generated using ltfd technique the derived solutions are then used to investigate how the outlet bcs affect multispecies transport with a complex reaction network at the region adjacent to the outlet boundary the results show that the solutions for the semi infinite domain may underestimate the concentration compared with the solution for the finite domain especially for larger dispersion coefficients the derived solutions with the complex reaction network are compared to the previous straight reaction network solutions and the results show that the straight reaction network may overestimate or underestimate the concentrations of dce and vc as compared to those obtained from the complex reaction network solutions due to lack of consideration of different dce isomers the analytical solutions derived in the present study which accommodate a complex reaction network can provide realistic and practical applications for simulating the transport of chlorinated solvents and their degradation

boundary condition of eq a6 condition thus b 1 0 is yielded by applying the boundary condition of eq a6 and b 2 can be obtained using the boundary conditions of eq a4 or eq a5 respectively by substituting b 1 and b 2 into the eq a7 we can obtain the following solution a8 c 1 l x s c 1 0 ω 1 x s where a9 ω 1 x s 1 s e ξ 1 s x for the first type inlet bc and a10 ω 1 x s v d ξ 1 s v s e ξ 1 s

derivation of solutions for the finite domain considers eq 1 and auxiliary bcs in eqs 9 11 and 13 the dimensionless variables x d x l t d vt l γ i μ i l v and pe vl d are defined to facilitate the derivation of solutions for the finite domain the laplace transform with respect to dimensionless variable t d which is defined by the following transformation relations b1 c i l x d s l c i x d t d 0 e s t d c i x d t d d t d b2 l c i x d t d t d s l c i x d t d c i x d t d 0 where s denotes the laplace transform parameter and c i l x d s represents the laplace transform of c i x d t d after introducing dimensionless variable and taking the laplace transform eq 1 can be expressed as b3 1 pe d 2 c 1 l x d s d x d 2 d c 1 l x d s d x d r 1 s γ 1 c 1 l x d s 0 the inlet bcs defined in eqs 10

2667,there are urgent needs to evaluate different management techniques to improve groundwater quality to maintain a good quality of groundwater in the miyakonojo river basin mrb japan the nitrate directive plan ndp was implemented in 2004 to assess the efficiency of this plan we performed multivariate times series analyses on 26 years 1996 2021 of groundwater nitrate nitrogen no3 n data from up to 584 groundwater wells results showed that wells with an increasing no3 n trend p 0 05 increased from 5 8 in 1996 to 13 8 in 2009 and thereafter leveled off with time the number of groundwater wells with a decreasing no3 n trend p 0 05 increased from 18 7 in 1996 to 52 5 in 2021 these groundwater wells are primarily distributed in urban and agricultural production areas near rivers however the annual change rate of no3 n content displayed both increasing and decreasing no3 n trend p 0 05 over time but most importantly the number of groundwater wells exceeding the environmental maximum permissive value reduced by 60 from 2004 to 2021 thus there is statistical evidence that ndp has improved the groundwater quality regarding no3 n at the regional basin scale and that nitrogen levels are gradually being reduced keywords groundwater quality nitrate nitrogen soil management trend analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction huge amounts of reactive nitrogen n are being used for human food and energy production according to the nitrogen statistics and information usgs 2022 a total of 144 tg n 1 tg 1012 g were produced in 2018 this amount has doubled the terrestrial biological n fixation 90 130 tg n yr 1 however application of n causes global imbalances that poses a considerable threat to the stability of the earth s environmental ecosystems galloway 1998 hayashi et al 2021 intensive agricultural production is one of the primary sources of environmental n contamination which leads to n losses to the soil water and air environmental issues include air pollution global warming decline in biodiversity mineralization of soil n eutrophication of rivers lakes and coastal waters and groundwater pollution hansen et al 2012 in addition n pollution may affect human health for example high contents of n particles in air may cause respiratory health problems and diseases long term drinking of water with a high concentration of no3 n may lead to infant methemoglobinemia thyroid disease colorectal and bladder cancer van grinsven et al 2010 as a result maximum no3 n content in drinking water has been set to 10 mg l in many countries nakagawa et al 2016 schaider et al 2019 due to this policies regulations and technologies are being developed to reduce n emissions to environmental systems hansen et al 2017 yu et al 2021 solving the above issues in the european union eu has meant to implement new environmental protection policies such as the nitrate directive 1991 676 ec the water framework directive 2000 60 ec the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec the river basin management plans and the marine strategy framework directive 2008 56 ec in eu member states during the last three decades the environmental goal is to meet the requirement of a good chemical and ecological status for all regional water bodies eu 2000 eu 2006 the nitrate directive is regarded as an essential part of reducing water resources pollution caused by the emission of agricultural nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus the implementation of this directive is meant to decrease agricultural n surplus and the no3 n concentration in surface water coastal water and groundwater in the eu member states van grinsven et al 2012 christensen et al 2021 it is noteworthy that the no3 n decrease in groundwater is relatively slow as compared to surface water partly due to gradual groundwater turnover and stored no3 n in the unsaturated zone this process is primarily controlled by hydrometeorological factors hydrogeological systems and geochemical reaction processes at the local scale kim et al 2020 once no3 n contamination of groundwater has occurred it is necessary to identify sources of contaminants develop effective plans and actions to mitigate and control the groundwater pollution hansen et al 2011 nakagawa et al 2017 jia et al 2020 in denmark authorities have significantly reduced n losses and soil surface n surpluses and improved the n use efficiency in agricultural production areas during the past 30 years for example 1 n losses to water bodies and the atmosphere were considerably diminished and n leaching from the field root zone was reduced by 50 2 average soil surface n surpluses was decreased from about 170 to 100 kg n ha 1 yr 1 3 the overall n use efficiency was improved from approximately 20 30 to 40 45 in agricultural areas however to meet the strict requirements of eu directives new approaches strategies and technologies are required to further reduce n losses to environmental systems dalgaard et al 2014 hansen et al 2019 in japan a series of regulations policies and laws have been initiated to meet sustainable water development goals and protect human life and ecosystems these include e g the water pollution prevention law water cycle act and wastewater discharge standards for the conservation of aquatic life ministry of the environment 2020 in addition the nitrate directive plan ndp was implemented in intensive agricultural production areas in 2004 where severe groundwater no3 n pollution has occurred the main environmental goal is to ensure good chemical status of the groundwater a series of specific measures taken in the ndp which are described in table 1 the main contents of the ndp are the reduction of n emissions from livestock industries reducing the discharge of untreated domestic sewage and more efficient application of chemical fertilizers detailed regulations and norms control how animal manure should be managed and stored how untreated wastewater should be discharged in rural regions and how manure and chemical fertilizers can be applied in agricultural areas ndp 2004 based on these regulations and management the local administrative agency and related organizations policymakers advisors residents and farmers try to make a joint effort to maintain sustainable economic development and protect the good chemical status of groundwater resources in other words they try to develop a society of more conservation oriented resource cycling ndp 2004 yu et al 2021 the miyakonojo river basin mrb is an intensive agricultural production area in kyushu island japan fig 1 in 2000 the total n release in domestic and industrial effluents animal husbandry beef dairy cattle and pig and agriculture use of manure and synthetic fertilizers was estimated at about 2 125 12 159 and 18 372 kg n day respectively ndp 2004 as seen from these figures most n are applied in agricultural production the no3 n content in groundwater started to increase in shallow aquifer wells in 1975 occasionally some wells started to exceed the maximum permissible 10 mg l in 1984 in 2000 13 of shallow wells exceeded this limit matsunaga et al 2015a sugimoto et al 2009 several studies have shown that the primary sources of no3 n pollutants are from livestock and domestic wastewater sugimoto and hirata 2006 matsunaga et al 2015 a b hiraoka et al 2018 previous research has tried to assess effects the ndp implementation in 2004 using time series data of groundwater no3 n concentration using 16 years 2001 2016 of data from 75 wells toyomitsu et al 2018 showed that 64 of these wells had no3 n contents 10 mg l they also showed that n supplies between 2000 and 2009 reduced by 16 1 after implementing the ndp toyomitsu et al 2018 yu et al 2021 showed that mean no3 n concentrations in groundwater discharge from agricultural production and city areas are 7 1 to 8 2 mg l and recharge areas in forests about 2 9 mg l they indicated that about 20 of 420 investigated wells displayed a trend reversal from 2000 to 2008 increasing to 2009 2017 decreasing there are however still gaps in the knowledge regarding the efficiency of the ndp for the mrb area the first concerns statistical evidence of groundwater no3 n response related to the management of the soil surface secondly many non parametric statistical tests that have been used for this purpose may contain serial correlation autocorrelation that could affect the results yue and wang 2004 khaliq et al 2009 based on this the influence of serial correlation on the time series analyses of groundwater no3 n data should be investigated this has not yet been investigated for the mrb finally long term and basin wide data are needed to establish results of high statistical significance in view of this we used time series of groundwater no3 n data for 26 years 1996 2021 from up to 584 wells multivariate times series methods were applied to investigate the spatial temporal relationships in the studied catchment the study is innovative since few surveys have been performed to in a detailed manner investigate relationships between surface n management and the resulting changes in groundwater no3 n content the results are important since they can help to guide decision makers and managers to optimize remediation measures of no3 n polluted groundwater basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mrb is situated in the south of kyushu island japan fig 1a and covers an area of about 900 km2 the kirishima mountain delimits the western subbasin and the wanitsuka mountain the eastern subbasin the basin has a general slope from south to north based on these topographic features the main river oyodo river flows from south to north in this basin yu et al 2021 the regional climate is subtropical and humid average annual rainfall and temperature are about 2 500 mm and 16 5 c respectively japan meteorological agency 2021 the geology mrb is characterized by a bedrock of sandstone and mudstone of paleogene andesite lava of neogene period and pyroclastic flow of quaternary and alluvial lacustrine sediments from the bottom to top fig 1b the primary groundwater aquifers are contained in the pyroclastic flow shirasu deposits and alluvial lacustrine sediments with three layers the average thickness of the shallowest aquifer is about 20 m from the ground surface in addition the average depth of the intermediate and deep aquifers is about 20 70 m and 70 m from the soil surface respectively the aquifers are isolated by the pyroclastic flows welded tuff of intercalated layers originating from the eruptive activities of volcanoes in the pleistocene of quaternary these pyroclastic flows are discontinuously distributed at different depths of 20 50 m and 70 80 m in the mrb respectively matsunaga et al 2015b the mean dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp are 7 mg l and 495 mv in the shallow groundwater respectively in the intermediate groundwater aquifer the mean do and orp are 5 2 mg l and 313 mv respectively in the deep groundwater aquifer the mean do and orp are 3 3 mg l and 313 mv respectively denitrification processes may occur in the groundwater of the intermediate and deep groundwater aquifers where do and orp are lower than 2 mg l and 200 mv respectively matsunaga et al 2015a zeng et al 2017 in the shallow groundwater aquifer however no3 n is not involved in denitrification processes the mrb includes one city and eight towns and a total population of about 240 000 water supplies for inhabitants come entirely from groundwater resources agricultural industrial and domestic water the total consumption of domestic water was approximately 21 2 million m3 in 2018 all domestic water originates from deep groundwater wells 100 200 m deep because it has a better quality than the shallow groundwater however no3 n pollution is threatening the deep groundwater where it intersects with shallow groundwater local farmers are still using the shallow groundwater as domestic and agricultural water supply in remote rural areas ndp 2004 sugimoto et al 2009 2 2 data sources and features long term groundwater no3 n data 1996 2021 were used from the local waterworks and sewerage bureau groundwater in the mrb has generally been sampled twice a year february and august since 2000 however some groundwater samples have been collected in march and december before 2000 the water resources manager has periodically sent plastic bottles to residents to collect groundwater samples from private wells all groundwater samples have been analyzed by ion chromatography in total 1 200 wells have been sampled in the area regarding no3 n over the last 26 years however 50 of the sampled data are not continuous in time as well most of these are only from the shallowest groundwater aquifer trend analysis was conducted for the 26 years 1996 2021 of groundwater no3 n data the length of the sampled time series data was set as a minimum to eight years to meet the requirement of time series analysis methods eu 2009 to link the management of the soil surface to the groundwater no3 n response trend analysis was performed by successively increasing the analyzed period year by year starting in 1996 and ending in 2021 in 1996 the analysis contained 584 wells and in 2021 it contained 438 wells a total of 24 342 samples from these wells was used in the analyses of the investigated 26 year period these data were used to analyze effects of the ndp implementation in 2004 the quality of the groundwater no3 n database has been certified by the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare thus the data have been identified as reliable and of high quality hiraoka et al 2018 toyomitsu et al 2018 the r language s open source software package modifiedmk was applied for trend detection 2 3 statistical trend tests most hydrological time series data are non normally distributed e g yue et al 2002a thus non parametric trend tests are commonly applied to detect monotonic trends in time series examples are spearman s rho and mann kendall tests these two tests require the sample data to be serially independent the presence of serial correlation will influence the performance of the test to evaluate the significance of the trend because of this corrections are needed such as the modified mann kendall test pre whitening trend free pre whitening variance correction and block bootstrap kundzewicz and robson 2004 khaliq et al 2009 önöz and bayazit 2012 we used the spearman s rho test mann kendall test and two kinds of modified mann kendall tests to assess the effects of ndp based on long term data of groundwater no3 n content 2 3 1 spearman s rho test the spearman s rho test sr test is a non parametric rank based test for a given time series x i i 1 2 3 n the spearman rank correlation coefficient r is defined as 1 r 1 6 i 1 n d x i i 2 n n 2 1 where n is the total number of sample data d x i is the sequence of ith observation x i the null hypothesis h 0 for sr test against trend exists for all variables x i that are independent and identically distributed yue et al 2002a kahya and kalayci 2004 the alternative hypothesis h 1 is that the variable x i increases or decreases with the time series variable which indicates that trend exists according to these conditions the distribution of r is asymptotically normal with the mean and variance as sneyers 1990 2 e r 0 3 var r 1 n 1 the standardized test statistic z sr is calculated by 4 z sr r var r likewise the statistic z follows a standard normal distribution with z n 0 1 2 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall test mk test is another non parametric rank based test for trend detection mann 1945 kendall 1975 the mk test can evaluate whether a sample data set includes a trend or not using the test statistic s according to 5 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn c j c k therein 6 sgn c j c k 1 if c j c k 0 0 if c j c k 0 1 if c j c k 0 where the c k and c j are the sequential data values n is the length of a sample dataset moreover this formula needs to meet k j n with k j when n 8 meets this condition the test statistic s is normally distributed with mean and variance 7 e s 0 8 var s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 n t k k k 1 2 k 5 18 where t k is the number of ties of extent k and the standardized test statistic z is calculated as yue et al 2002a aguilar et al 2007 9 z mk s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 under these circumstances the standardized mk statistic z satisfies the requirement for standard normal distribution z n 0 1 2 3 3 sen s slope estimator for non normally distributed datasets sen s slope estimator is a robust non parametric approach to assess the trend 10 b sen median c j c k t j t k forl all k j here c k and c j represent the no3 n content of t k and t j times respectively sen s slope is presented using median values theil 1950 sen 1968 2 3 4 modified mann kendall test variance correction time series data are often affected by serial correlation yue and wang 2004 suggested a modified mann kendall test variance correction hereafter called mmk test vc to eliminate the effects of serial correlation in time series data for a given data of time series x i i 1 2 3 n with n number of samples and effective information is included in n number of samples the effective sample size n should be smaller than the original sample size n if positive or negative serial correlation exists the variance of the mk test statistic s increases or decreases this effect can be corrected by estimating the modified variance var s patakamuri et al 2020 11 var s c f var s 12 c f 1 2 k 1 n 1 1 k n r k in these equations cf and r k are correction factor and lag k serial correlation coefficients respectively only lag 1 serial correlation coefficient is applied to calculate cf here 2 3 5 modified mann kendall test trend free pre whitening modified mann kendall test trend free pre whitening hereafter called mmk test tfpw has been proposed to consider the effects of serial correlation in time series data yue et al 2002b for a given time series the slope of a trend is calculated by using sen s slope estimator then under the assumption of a linear trend lag 1 serial correlation from the detrended series is estimated if the lag 1 serial correlation coefficient is significant at the chosen significance level the mk test will recombine the detrended pre whitened series with the estimated trend slope using sen s slope estimator otherwise mk test is applied to the original time series khaliq et al 2009 the p value was evaluated by using the standard normal cumulative distribution tables if p 0 05 the trend is statistically significant alternatively if p 0 05 the trend is statistically insignificant 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term spatiotemporal variation characteristics of groundwater no3 n content changes in the number of groundwater wells 1996 2021 are summarized based on five categories of groundwater no3 n content in fig 2 these were 0 no3 n 2 5 mg l 2 5 no3 n 5 mg l 5 no3 n 7 5 mg l 7 5 no3 n 10 mg l and no3 n 10 mg l respectively meanwhile the number of groundwater wells with varying no3 n content in groundwater is separately described by winter and summer season in fig 2 a and fig 2 b the result indicates that the number of groundwater wells for the three ranks 5 no3 n 7 5 mg l 7 5 no3 n 10 mg l and no3 n 10 mg l is decreasing with time the number of groundwater wells with relatively severe pollution continuously declined after ndp s implementation in 2004 especially the number of groundwater wells that exceeds the maximum acceptable value no3 n 10 mg l was reduced by 60 from 2004 to 2021 the number of groundwater wells of the other two ranks 0 no3 n 2 5 mg l 2 5 no3 n 5 mg l increased probably due to transport properties of the groundwater the spatial distribution of no3 n content is shown in fig 3 for samples taken in february and august 1998 2001 2004 2007 2010 2013 2016 and 2019 high no3 n contents notably mainly occur in urban livestock and crop farming areas groundwater is seriously polluted by no3 n on the western side of the oyodo river primary sources of no3 n pollutants have been found from livestock waste and domestic sewage using isotope analysis matsunaga et al 2015a however groundwater no3 n pollution is comparatively small on the eastern side of the oyodo river the reason is that the extent of groundwater no3 n pollution is primarily affected by the amount of soil surface n loads due to different land use types as well groundwater vulnerability to no3 n is different at different locations depending on spatial variability of soil and transport properties with the ndp implementation in 2004 the no3 n contents with the number of groundwater wells in the three categories 5 no3 n 7 5 mg l 7 5 no3 n 10 mg l and no3 n 10 mg l are clearly decreasing with time as shown in fig 3 3 2 time series trend analysis the time series of no3 n concentration 1996 2021 were analyzed regarding trend using the four approaches mentioned above the results are shown in fig 4 the trend was classified into four types namely a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 insignificant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 and insignificant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 the results of the four statistical methods are similar fig 4 this indicates that the influence of serial correlation is small in any case mmk test vc results were used to evaluate the temporal trend of no3 n content hereafter the number of groundwater wells with a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 increased from 34 wells in 1996 to 72 wells in 2009 and decreased to 32 in 2021 thus it appears that the ndp has resulted in decreasing groundwater no3 n contents in the area interestingly there seems to be a lag effect of about 5 years 2004 2009 between ndp implementation and obvious effects in the groundwater indeed the n transport is a complex physicochemical process from land surface to groundwater this process is primarily influenced by many hydrometeorological and hydrogeological factors such as groundwater recharge groundwater flow velocity thickness of the vadose zone hydraulic conductivity soil media rock media and topography furthermore the n transport process is also affected by groundwater abstraction and irrigation return from human activity therefore the related process of groundwater n movement velocity and n lag time needs further quantitative analyses using numerical analysis techniques min et al 2018 qian et al 2020 wells et al 2021 gao et al 2022 in any case previous studies have indicated that the groundwater residence time in the area is less than ten years for the shallow groundwater aquifer matsunaga et al 2015b the number of groundwater wells with an insignificant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 and an insignificant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 decreased from 1996 to 2021 fig 4 similarly the number of groundwater wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased during the same period fig 4 the number of groundwater wells with a significant downward trend p 0 05 increased from 109 wells in 1996 to 230 wells in 2021 this implies that groundwater wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased by 121 wells after the ndp implementation in 2004 the number of wells with various trends in fig 4 is shown as percentages in fig 5 the percentage of wells with a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 began to increase from 5 8 in 1996 to 13 8 in 2009 this percentage decreased from 13 8 to 7 3 in 2021 the portion of wells with insignificant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 and insignificant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 decreased with time fig 5 on the other hand wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased noteworthy wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased from 18 7 to 52 5 these results indicate that ndp has had a real effect on groundwater no3 n content however denitrification processes may also have helped to decrease groundwater no3 n content 3 3 long term spatiotemporal change of no 3 n content using sen s slope estimator the annual change rate of groundwater no3 n content was calculated for statistically significant samples with both significant upward and downward trends p 0 05 spatial distribution for the annual change rate of wells with significant no3 n upward and downward trend p 0 05 is shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the figures are based on the mmk test vc and can be regarded as rigorous statistical results both figures show results for 1996 2003 1996 2004 1996 2007 1996 2010 1996 2013 1996 2016 1996 2019 and 1996 2021 the results indicate that the magnitude of the annual change rate is decreasing over time groundwater wells with a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 are mainly distributed on the western side of the oyodo river these areas primarily correspond to agricultural production activities livestock and crop farming the groundwater no3 n content in these wells is still increasing with time fig 7 shows wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 these wells are mainly located in the urban and agricultural areas near the river groundwater no3 n response after the ndp implementation is evident in these areas however 109 wells had a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 even before the implementation of ndp this phenomenon can be observed for 1996 2003 in fig 7 and may be explained by attenuation processes these processes are probably controlled by local hydrometeorological conditions and hydrogeological factors such as precipitation types of soil rock permeability thickness of the vadose zone and topography because of this we further analyzed the trend of no3 n content before and after the ndp implementation in 2004 the number of wells and the percentage of wells with four different trends are displayed in fig 8 the number of wells with significant upward trend increased from 34 in 1996 2003 to 54 wells in 2004 2011 then decreased to 22 wells for 2004 2021 the number of wells with both an insignificant upward trend and insignificant downward trend decreased from 1996 to 2003 to 2004 2021 besides the number of wells with a significant downward trend increased from 109 wells in 1996 2003 to 217 wells in 2004 2021 thus fig 8 corroborates the general impression from fig 4 likewise based on the percentage of wells groundwater wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 also increased from 18 7 in 1996 2003 to 54 5 in 2004 2021 mean and median the annual change rates are shown in fig 9 with both a significant upward and downward trend p 0 05 the general trend characteristics of the annual change rates are similar using the four methods the annual change rate is decreasing for both wells with a significant upward and a significant downward trend over time the annual change rate with a significant upward trend p 0 05 is increasing after 2016 and a possible reason for this is that the annual change rate at some sporadic wells is still strongly increasing in other words the soil surface n management is still not effectively implemented in the vicinity of these wells however for most wells both increasing and decreasing rates are slowing down from this we can infer that the n load to soil surface is decreasing and that a new equilibrium is forming in the basin regarding n balances this is also shown for the groundwater wells with a significant downward trend the annual decline rates appear to be slowing down over time this may be due to that the potential n load that is leaching into the groundwater is continuously reduced with time fig 10 corroborates this general assumption by showing the change rate of annual mean and median no3 n content before and after the ndp implementation in 2004 the results indicate that for most wells the annually increasing and decreasing rates are slowing down with time possible reasons for the noticeable effect of the ndp during the last 18 years are summarized in the below first the ndp measures efficiently reduce environmental n loads in a systematic manner second the hydrometeorological and hydrogeological conditions of the mrb are essential elements such as abundant rainwater typhoons and rain seasons shallow unsaturated zone and rapid water circulation that accelerates n transport movement ndp 2004 yu et al 2021 however further studies are necessary regarding the n cycle in the mrb first the time series change features of average soil surface n surpluses need to be assessed with the ndp implementation second the time series change features of n leaching into groundwater need to be further quantitively evaluated for different land use areas ultimately the time series change features of n use efficiency need to be calculated at the regional level dalgaard et al 2014 green et al 2018 these studies are vital for providing a better scientific basis and help to improve decisions for the sustainable protection of groundwater resources 4 conclusions the effects of ndp were assessed in a quantitative manner using time series data of groundwater no3 n content with trend analysis methods the ndp seems to have had positive effects on the reduction of groundwater no3 n content however no3 n content in some wells still exceeds the environmental maximum permissible level and about 7 3 of all wells still have a significant upward no3 n trend p 0 05 hence the ndp regulations need to be further accentuated in these regions ndp appears to have decreased the number of three categories of groundwater wells with 5 no3 n 7 5 mg l 7 5 no3 n 10 mg l and no3 n 10 mg l especially the number of groundwater wells exceeding the environmental maximum permissible value has decreased by 60 from 2004 to 2021 the percentage of a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 increased by 5 8 in 1996 to 13 8 in 2009 this number decreased from 13 8 in 2009 to 7 3 in 2021 the rate of a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased from 21 8 in 2004 to 52 5 in 2021 for groundwater wells with a significant annual no3 n upward trend p 0 05 the growth rate is basically slowing down with time on the other hand for groundwater wells with a no3 n downward trend p 0 05 the annual decline rates are also slowing down with time this seems to be related to establishment of a new equilibrium regarding n balances in the area the different statistical tests for significant trend identification displayed similar results this indicates that the serial correlation in the analyzed time series is of minor importance the results of this study can be used by decision makers and managers to optimize remediation of no3 n polluted groundwater basins credit authorship contribution statement zhi qiang yu

2667,there are urgent needs to evaluate different management techniques to improve groundwater quality to maintain a good quality of groundwater in the miyakonojo river basin mrb japan the nitrate directive plan ndp was implemented in 2004 to assess the efficiency of this plan we performed multivariate times series analyses on 26 years 1996 2021 of groundwater nitrate nitrogen no3 n data from up to 584 groundwater wells results showed that wells with an increasing no3 n trend p 0 05 increased from 5 8 in 1996 to 13 8 in 2009 and thereafter leveled off with time the number of groundwater wells with a decreasing no3 n trend p 0 05 increased from 18 7 in 1996 to 52 5 in 2021 these groundwater wells are primarily distributed in urban and agricultural production areas near rivers however the annual change rate of no3 n content displayed both increasing and decreasing no3 n trend p 0 05 over time but most importantly the number of groundwater wells exceeding the environmental maximum permissive value reduced by 60 from 2004 to 2021 thus there is statistical evidence that ndp has improved the groundwater quality regarding no3 n at the regional basin scale and that nitrogen levels are gradually being reduced keywords groundwater quality nitrate nitrogen soil management trend analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction huge amounts of reactive nitrogen n are being used for human food and energy production according to the nitrogen statistics and information usgs 2022 a total of 144 tg n 1 tg 1012 g were produced in 2018 this amount has doubled the terrestrial biological n fixation 90 130 tg n yr 1 however application of n causes global imbalances that poses a considerable threat to the stability of the earth s environmental ecosystems galloway 1998 hayashi et al 2021 intensive agricultural production is one of the primary sources of environmental n contamination which leads to n losses to the soil water and air environmental issues include air pollution global warming decline in biodiversity mineralization of soil n eutrophication of rivers lakes and coastal waters and groundwater pollution hansen et al 2012 in addition n pollution may affect human health for example high contents of n particles in air may cause respiratory health problems and diseases long term drinking of water with a high concentration of no3 n may lead to infant methemoglobinemia thyroid disease colorectal and bladder cancer van grinsven et al 2010 as a result maximum no3 n content in drinking water has been set to 10 mg l in many countries nakagawa et al 2016 schaider et al 2019 due to this policies regulations and technologies are being developed to reduce n emissions to environmental systems hansen et al 2017 yu et al 2021 solving the above issues in the european union eu has meant to implement new environmental protection policies such as the nitrate directive 1991 676 ec the water framework directive 2000 60 ec the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec the river basin management plans and the marine strategy framework directive 2008 56 ec in eu member states during the last three decades the environmental goal is to meet the requirement of a good chemical and ecological status for all regional water bodies eu 2000 eu 2006 the nitrate directive is regarded as an essential part of reducing water resources pollution caused by the emission of agricultural nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus the implementation of this directive is meant to decrease agricultural n surplus and the no3 n concentration in surface water coastal water and groundwater in the eu member states van grinsven et al 2012 christensen et al 2021 it is noteworthy that the no3 n decrease in groundwater is relatively slow as compared to surface water partly due to gradual groundwater turnover and stored no3 n in the unsaturated zone this process is primarily controlled by hydrometeorological factors hydrogeological systems and geochemical reaction processes at the local scale kim et al 2020 once no3 n contamination of groundwater has occurred it is necessary to identify sources of contaminants develop effective plans and actions to mitigate and control the groundwater pollution hansen et al 2011 nakagawa et al 2017 jia et al 2020 in denmark authorities have significantly reduced n losses and soil surface n surpluses and improved the n use efficiency in agricultural production areas during the past 30 years for example 1 n losses to water bodies and the atmosphere were considerably diminished and n leaching from the field root zone was reduced by 50 2 average soil surface n surpluses was decreased from about 170 to 100 kg n ha 1 yr 1 3 the overall n use efficiency was improved from approximately 20 30 to 40 45 in agricultural areas however to meet the strict requirements of eu directives new approaches strategies and technologies are required to further reduce n losses to environmental systems dalgaard et al 2014 hansen et al 2019 in japan a series of regulations policies and laws have been initiated to meet sustainable water development goals and protect human life and ecosystems these include e g the water pollution prevention law water cycle act and wastewater discharge standards for the conservation of aquatic life ministry of the environment 2020 in addition the nitrate directive plan ndp was implemented in intensive agricultural production areas in 2004 where severe groundwater no3 n pollution has occurred the main environmental goal is to ensure good chemical status of the groundwater a series of specific measures taken in the ndp which are described in table 1 the main contents of the ndp are the reduction of n emissions from livestock industries reducing the discharge of untreated domestic sewage and more efficient application of chemical fertilizers detailed regulations and norms control how animal manure should be managed and stored how untreated wastewater should be discharged in rural regions and how manure and chemical fertilizers can be applied in agricultural areas ndp 2004 based on these regulations and management the local administrative agency and related organizations policymakers advisors residents and farmers try to make a joint effort to maintain sustainable economic development and protect the good chemical status of groundwater resources in other words they try to develop a society of more conservation oriented resource cycling ndp 2004 yu et al 2021 the miyakonojo river basin mrb is an intensive agricultural production area in kyushu island japan fig 1 in 2000 the total n release in domestic and industrial effluents animal husbandry beef dairy cattle and pig and agriculture use of manure and synthetic fertilizers was estimated at about 2 125 12 159 and 18 372 kg n day respectively ndp 2004 as seen from these figures most n are applied in agricultural production the no3 n content in groundwater started to increase in shallow aquifer wells in 1975 occasionally some wells started to exceed the maximum permissible 10 mg l in 1984 in 2000 13 of shallow wells exceeded this limit matsunaga et al 2015a sugimoto et al 2009 several studies have shown that the primary sources of no3 n pollutants are from livestock and domestic wastewater sugimoto and hirata 2006 matsunaga et al 2015 a b hiraoka et al 2018 previous research has tried to assess effects the ndp implementation in 2004 using time series data of groundwater no3 n concentration using 16 years 2001 2016 of data from 75 wells toyomitsu et al 2018 showed that 64 of these wells had no3 n contents 10 mg l they also showed that n supplies between 2000 and 2009 reduced by 16 1 after implementing the ndp toyomitsu et al 2018 yu et al 2021 showed that mean no3 n concentrations in groundwater discharge from agricultural production and city areas are 7 1 to 8 2 mg l and recharge areas in forests about 2 9 mg l they indicated that about 20 of 420 investigated wells displayed a trend reversal from 2000 to 2008 increasing to 2009 2017 decreasing there are however still gaps in the knowledge regarding the efficiency of the ndp for the mrb area the first concerns statistical evidence of groundwater no3 n response related to the management of the soil surface secondly many non parametric statistical tests that have been used for this purpose may contain serial correlation autocorrelation that could affect the results yue and wang 2004 khaliq et al 2009 based on this the influence of serial correlation on the time series analyses of groundwater no3 n data should be investigated this has not yet been investigated for the mrb finally long term and basin wide data are needed to establish results of high statistical significance in view of this we used time series of groundwater no3 n data for 26 years 1996 2021 from up to 584 wells multivariate times series methods were applied to investigate the spatial temporal relationships in the studied catchment the study is innovative since few surveys have been performed to in a detailed manner investigate relationships between surface n management and the resulting changes in groundwater no3 n content the results are important since they can help to guide decision makers and managers to optimize remediation measures of no3 n polluted groundwater basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mrb is situated in the south of kyushu island japan fig 1a and covers an area of about 900 km2 the kirishima mountain delimits the western subbasin and the wanitsuka mountain the eastern subbasin the basin has a general slope from south to north based on these topographic features the main river oyodo river flows from south to north in this basin yu et al 2021 the regional climate is subtropical and humid average annual rainfall and temperature are about 2 500 mm and 16 5 c respectively japan meteorological agency 2021 the geology mrb is characterized by a bedrock of sandstone and mudstone of paleogene andesite lava of neogene period and pyroclastic flow of quaternary and alluvial lacustrine sediments from the bottom to top fig 1b the primary groundwater aquifers are contained in the pyroclastic flow shirasu deposits and alluvial lacustrine sediments with three layers the average thickness of the shallowest aquifer is about 20 m from the ground surface in addition the average depth of the intermediate and deep aquifers is about 20 70 m and 70 m from the soil surface respectively the aquifers are isolated by the pyroclastic flows welded tuff of intercalated layers originating from the eruptive activities of volcanoes in the pleistocene of quaternary these pyroclastic flows are discontinuously distributed at different depths of 20 50 m and 70 80 m in the mrb respectively matsunaga et al 2015b the mean dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp are 7 mg l and 495 mv in the shallow groundwater respectively in the intermediate groundwater aquifer the mean do and orp are 5 2 mg l and 313 mv respectively in the deep groundwater aquifer the mean do and orp are 3 3 mg l and 313 mv respectively denitrification processes may occur in the groundwater of the intermediate and deep groundwater aquifers where do and orp are lower than 2 mg l and 200 mv respectively matsunaga et al 2015a zeng et al 2017 in the shallow groundwater aquifer however no3 n is not involved in denitrification processes the mrb includes one city and eight towns and a total population of about 240 000 water supplies for inhabitants come entirely from groundwater resources agricultural industrial and domestic water the total consumption of domestic water was approximately 21 2 million m3 in 2018 all domestic water originates from deep groundwater wells 100 200 m deep because it has a better quality than the shallow groundwater however no3 n pollution is threatening the deep groundwater where it intersects with shallow groundwater local farmers are still using the shallow groundwater as domestic and agricultural water supply in remote rural areas ndp 2004 sugimoto et al 2009 2 2 data sources and features long term groundwater no3 n data 1996 2021 were used from the local waterworks and sewerage bureau groundwater in the mrb has generally been sampled twice a year february and august since 2000 however some groundwater samples have been collected in march and december before 2000 the water resources manager has periodically sent plastic bottles to residents to collect groundwater samples from private wells all groundwater samples have been analyzed by ion chromatography in total 1 200 wells have been sampled in the area regarding no3 n over the last 26 years however 50 of the sampled data are not continuous in time as well most of these are only from the shallowest groundwater aquifer trend analysis was conducted for the 26 years 1996 2021 of groundwater no3 n data the length of the sampled time series data was set as a minimum to eight years to meet the requirement of time series analysis methods eu 2009 to link the management of the soil surface to the groundwater no3 n response trend analysis was performed by successively increasing the analyzed period year by year starting in 1996 and ending in 2021 in 1996 the analysis contained 584 wells and in 2021 it contained 438 wells a total of 24 342 samples from these wells was used in the analyses of the investigated 26 year period these data were used to analyze effects of the ndp implementation in 2004 the quality of the groundwater no3 n database has been certified by the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare thus the data have been identified as reliable and of high quality hiraoka et al 2018 toyomitsu et al 2018 the r language s open source software package modifiedmk was applied for trend detection 2 3 statistical trend tests most hydrological time series data are non normally distributed e g yue et al 2002a thus non parametric trend tests are commonly applied to detect monotonic trends in time series examples are spearman s rho and mann kendall tests these two tests require the sample data to be serially independent the presence of serial correlation will influence the performance of the test to evaluate the significance of the trend because of this corrections are needed such as the modified mann kendall test pre whitening trend free pre whitening variance correction and block bootstrap kundzewicz and robson 2004 khaliq et al 2009 önöz and bayazit 2012 we used the spearman s rho test mann kendall test and two kinds of modified mann kendall tests to assess the effects of ndp based on long term data of groundwater no3 n content 2 3 1 spearman s rho test the spearman s rho test sr test is a non parametric rank based test for a given time series x i i 1 2 3 n the spearman rank correlation coefficient r is defined as 1 r 1 6 i 1 n d x i i 2 n n 2 1 where n is the total number of sample data d x i is the sequence of ith observation x i the null hypothesis h 0 for sr test against trend exists for all variables x i that are independent and identically distributed yue et al 2002a kahya and kalayci 2004 the alternative hypothesis h 1 is that the variable x i increases or decreases with the time series variable which indicates that trend exists according to these conditions the distribution of r is asymptotically normal with the mean and variance as sneyers 1990 2 e r 0 3 var r 1 n 1 the standardized test statistic z sr is calculated by 4 z sr r var r likewise the statistic z follows a standard normal distribution with z n 0 1 2 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall test mk test is another non parametric rank based test for trend detection mann 1945 kendall 1975 the mk test can evaluate whether a sample data set includes a trend or not using the test statistic s according to 5 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn c j c k therein 6 sgn c j c k 1 if c j c k 0 0 if c j c k 0 1 if c j c k 0 where the c k and c j are the sequential data values n is the length of a sample dataset moreover this formula needs to meet k j n with k j when n 8 meets this condition the test statistic s is normally distributed with mean and variance 7 e s 0 8 var s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 n t k k k 1 2 k 5 18 where t k is the number of ties of extent k and the standardized test statistic z is calculated as yue et al 2002a aguilar et al 2007 9 z mk s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 under these circumstances the standardized mk statistic z satisfies the requirement for standard normal distribution z n 0 1 2 3 3 sen s slope estimator for non normally distributed datasets sen s slope estimator is a robust non parametric approach to assess the trend 10 b sen median c j c k t j t k forl all k j here c k and c j represent the no3 n content of t k and t j times respectively sen s slope is presented using median values theil 1950 sen 1968 2 3 4 modified mann kendall test variance correction time series data are often affected by serial correlation yue and wang 2004 suggested a modified mann kendall test variance correction hereafter called mmk test vc to eliminate the effects of serial correlation in time series data for a given data of time series x i i 1 2 3 n with n number of samples and effective information is included in n number of samples the effective sample size n should be smaller than the original sample size n if positive or negative serial correlation exists the variance of the mk test statistic s increases or decreases this effect can be corrected by estimating the modified variance var s patakamuri et al 2020 11 var s c f var s 12 c f 1 2 k 1 n 1 1 k n r k in these equations cf and r k are correction factor and lag k serial correlation coefficients respectively only lag 1 serial correlation coefficient is applied to calculate cf here 2 3 5 modified mann kendall test trend free pre whitening modified mann kendall test trend free pre whitening hereafter called mmk test tfpw has been proposed to consider the effects of serial correlation in time series data yue et al 2002b for a given time series the slope of a trend is calculated by using sen s slope estimator then under the assumption of a linear trend lag 1 serial correlation from the detrended series is estimated if the lag 1 serial correlation coefficient is significant at the chosen significance level the mk test will recombine the detrended pre whitened series with the estimated trend slope using sen s slope estimator otherwise mk test is applied to the original time series khaliq et al 2009 the p value was evaluated by using the standard normal cumulative distribution tables if p 0 05 the trend is statistically significant alternatively if p 0 05 the trend is statistically insignificant 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term spatiotemporal variation characteristics of groundwater no3 n content changes in the number of groundwater wells 1996 2021 are summarized based on five categories of groundwater no3 n content in fig 2 these were 0 no3 n 2 5 mg l 2 5 no3 n 5 mg l 5 no3 n 7 5 mg l 7 5 no3 n 10 mg l and no3 n 10 mg l respectively meanwhile the number of groundwater wells with varying no3 n content in groundwater is separately described by winter and summer season in fig 2 a and fig 2 b the result indicates that the number of groundwater wells for the three ranks 5 no3 n 7 5 mg l 7 5 no3 n 10 mg l and no3 n 10 mg l is decreasing with time the number of groundwater wells with relatively severe pollution continuously declined after ndp s implementation in 2004 especially the number of groundwater wells that exceeds the maximum acceptable value no3 n 10 mg l was reduced by 60 from 2004 to 2021 the number of groundwater wells of the other two ranks 0 no3 n 2 5 mg l 2 5 no3 n 5 mg l increased probably due to transport properties of the groundwater the spatial distribution of no3 n content is shown in fig 3 for samples taken in february and august 1998 2001 2004 2007 2010 2013 2016 and 2019 high no3 n contents notably mainly occur in urban livestock and crop farming areas groundwater is seriously polluted by no3 n on the western side of the oyodo river primary sources of no3 n pollutants have been found from livestock waste and domestic sewage using isotope analysis matsunaga et al 2015a however groundwater no3 n pollution is comparatively small on the eastern side of the oyodo river the reason is that the extent of groundwater no3 n pollution is primarily affected by the amount of soil surface n loads due to different land use types as well groundwater vulnerability to no3 n is different at different locations depending on spatial variability of soil and transport properties with the ndp implementation in 2004 the no3 n contents with the number of groundwater wells in the three categories 5 no3 n 7 5 mg l 7 5 no3 n 10 mg l and no3 n 10 mg l are clearly decreasing with time as shown in fig 3 3 2 time series trend analysis the time series of no3 n concentration 1996 2021 were analyzed regarding trend using the four approaches mentioned above the results are shown in fig 4 the trend was classified into four types namely a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 insignificant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 and insignificant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 the results of the four statistical methods are similar fig 4 this indicates that the influence of serial correlation is small in any case mmk test vc results were used to evaluate the temporal trend of no3 n content hereafter the number of groundwater wells with a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 increased from 34 wells in 1996 to 72 wells in 2009 and decreased to 32 in 2021 thus it appears that the ndp has resulted in decreasing groundwater no3 n contents in the area interestingly there seems to be a lag effect of about 5 years 2004 2009 between ndp implementation and obvious effects in the groundwater indeed the n transport is a complex physicochemical process from land surface to groundwater this process is primarily influenced by many hydrometeorological and hydrogeological factors such as groundwater recharge groundwater flow velocity thickness of the vadose zone hydraulic conductivity soil media rock media and topography furthermore the n transport process is also affected by groundwater abstraction and irrigation return from human activity therefore the related process of groundwater n movement velocity and n lag time needs further quantitative analyses using numerical analysis techniques min et al 2018 qian et al 2020 wells et al 2021 gao et al 2022 in any case previous studies have indicated that the groundwater residence time in the area is less than ten years for the shallow groundwater aquifer matsunaga et al 2015b the number of groundwater wells with an insignificant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 and an insignificant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 decreased from 1996 to 2021 fig 4 similarly the number of groundwater wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased during the same period fig 4 the number of groundwater wells with a significant downward trend p 0 05 increased from 109 wells in 1996 to 230 wells in 2021 this implies that groundwater wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased by 121 wells after the ndp implementation in 2004 the number of wells with various trends in fig 4 is shown as percentages in fig 5 the percentage of wells with a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 began to increase from 5 8 in 1996 to 13 8 in 2009 this percentage decreased from 13 8 to 7 3 in 2021 the portion of wells with insignificant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 and insignificant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 decreased with time fig 5 on the other hand wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased noteworthy wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased from 18 7 to 52 5 these results indicate that ndp has had a real effect on groundwater no3 n content however denitrification processes may also have helped to decrease groundwater no3 n content 3 3 long term spatiotemporal change of no 3 n content using sen s slope estimator the annual change rate of groundwater no3 n content was calculated for statistically significant samples with both significant upward and downward trends p 0 05 spatial distribution for the annual change rate of wells with significant no3 n upward and downward trend p 0 05 is shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the figures are based on the mmk test vc and can be regarded as rigorous statistical results both figures show results for 1996 2003 1996 2004 1996 2007 1996 2010 1996 2013 1996 2016 1996 2019 and 1996 2021 the results indicate that the magnitude of the annual change rate is decreasing over time groundwater wells with a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 are mainly distributed on the western side of the oyodo river these areas primarily correspond to agricultural production activities livestock and crop farming the groundwater no3 n content in these wells is still increasing with time fig 7 shows wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 these wells are mainly located in the urban and agricultural areas near the river groundwater no3 n response after the ndp implementation is evident in these areas however 109 wells had a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 even before the implementation of ndp this phenomenon can be observed for 1996 2003 in fig 7 and may be explained by attenuation processes these processes are probably controlled by local hydrometeorological conditions and hydrogeological factors such as precipitation types of soil rock permeability thickness of the vadose zone and topography because of this we further analyzed the trend of no3 n content before and after the ndp implementation in 2004 the number of wells and the percentage of wells with four different trends are displayed in fig 8 the number of wells with significant upward trend increased from 34 in 1996 2003 to 54 wells in 2004 2011 then decreased to 22 wells for 2004 2021 the number of wells with both an insignificant upward trend and insignificant downward trend decreased from 1996 to 2003 to 2004 2021 besides the number of wells with a significant downward trend increased from 109 wells in 1996 2003 to 217 wells in 2004 2021 thus fig 8 corroborates the general impression from fig 4 likewise based on the percentage of wells groundwater wells with a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 also increased from 18 7 in 1996 2003 to 54 5 in 2004 2021 mean and median the annual change rates are shown in fig 9 with both a significant upward and downward trend p 0 05 the general trend characteristics of the annual change rates are similar using the four methods the annual change rate is decreasing for both wells with a significant upward and a significant downward trend over time the annual change rate with a significant upward trend p 0 05 is increasing after 2016 and a possible reason for this is that the annual change rate at some sporadic wells is still strongly increasing in other words the soil surface n management is still not effectively implemented in the vicinity of these wells however for most wells both increasing and decreasing rates are slowing down from this we can infer that the n load to soil surface is decreasing and that a new equilibrium is forming in the basin regarding n balances this is also shown for the groundwater wells with a significant downward trend the annual decline rates appear to be slowing down over time this may be due to that the potential n load that is leaching into the groundwater is continuously reduced with time fig 10 corroborates this general assumption by showing the change rate of annual mean and median no3 n content before and after the ndp implementation in 2004 the results indicate that for most wells the annually increasing and decreasing rates are slowing down with time possible reasons for the noticeable effect of the ndp during the last 18 years are summarized in the below first the ndp measures efficiently reduce environmental n loads in a systematic manner second the hydrometeorological and hydrogeological conditions of the mrb are essential elements such as abundant rainwater typhoons and rain seasons shallow unsaturated zone and rapid water circulation that accelerates n transport movement ndp 2004 yu et al 2021 however further studies are necessary regarding the n cycle in the mrb first the time series change features of average soil surface n surpluses need to be assessed with the ndp implementation second the time series change features of n leaching into groundwater need to be further quantitively evaluated for different land use areas ultimately the time series change features of n use efficiency need to be calculated at the regional level dalgaard et al 2014 green et al 2018 these studies are vital for providing a better scientific basis and help to improve decisions for the sustainable protection of groundwater resources 4 conclusions the effects of ndp were assessed in a quantitative manner using time series data of groundwater no3 n content with trend analysis methods the ndp seems to have had positive effects on the reduction of groundwater no3 n content however no3 n content in some wells still exceeds the environmental maximum permissible level and about 7 3 of all wells still have a significant upward no3 n trend p 0 05 hence the ndp regulations need to be further accentuated in these regions ndp appears to have decreased the number of three categories of groundwater wells with 5 no3 n 7 5 mg l 7 5 no3 n 10 mg l and no3 n 10 mg l especially the number of groundwater wells exceeding the environmental maximum permissible value has decreased by 60 from 2004 to 2021 the percentage of a significant no3 n upward trend p 0 05 increased by 5 8 in 1996 to 13 8 in 2009 this number decreased from 13 8 in 2009 to 7 3 in 2021 the rate of a significant no3 n downward trend p 0 05 increased from 21 8 in 2004 to 52 5 in 2021 for groundwater wells with a significant annual no3 n upward trend p 0 05 the growth rate is basically slowing down with time on the other hand for groundwater wells with a no3 n downward trend p 0 05 the annual decline rates are also slowing down with time this seems to be related to establishment of a new equilibrium regarding n balances in the area the different statistical tests for significant trend identification displayed similar results this indicates that the serial correlation in the analyzed time series is of minor importance the results of this study can be used by decision makers and managers to optimize remediation of no3 n polluted groundwater basins credit authorship contribution statement zhi qiang yu

2668,small debris covered and avalanche fed glaciers are widespread in high relief areas of the world however their climatic response is poorly known because they cannot be investigated with traditional techniques like the glaciological mass balance method and long term observations series are very rare this work documents changes in elevation mass balance rate and surface cover in the last century from 1920 to 2020 for the small debris covered and avalanche fed montasio glacier where recent investigations show unusual response to climatic changes but it is unclear whether this response is a short or a long term characteristic glacier response is analysed primarily through digital elevation models reconstructed from different types of data sources maps terrestrial and aerial images point clouds glacier changes are analysed jointly with trends in the most relevant climatic variables the glacier experienced phases of rapid mass loss between 1920 and 1948 0 49 m w e y 1 and between 1982 and 2006 0 36 m w e y 1 smaller imbalance occurred between 1948 and 1982 0 14 m w e y 1 and remarkably between 2006 and 2020 0 03 m w e y 1 whereas the 1948 1982 was a favourable time window for most glaciers in the alps the last fifteen years were characterized by rapid warming and show a clear divergence between the behaviour of the montasio glacier and of the rest of alpine glaciers a century long increase in debris cover now 2 3 m thick in the lower half of the glacier explains largely this divergence snow rich winters in recent years also played a role because the glacier reacts sensitively to changes in solid precipitation even in the case of possible decreased snowfalls and increased melt associated with warming temperatures during the next decades the glacier is not expected to vanish soon because it will likely survive under a thick layer of debris and shadowed by the north walls of the mount jôf di montasio on the other hand the results of this study paired with the current distribution of permafrost in the study area suggest that the montasio glacier will unlikely evolve into a rock glacier or a glacial permafrost composite landform keywords glacier mass balance glacier fluctuations very small glaciers debris covered glaciers climate change geodetic method structure from motion sfm retrospective analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction glaciers are changing very rapidly in response to climate changes ipcc 2013 and their high mass loss rate is considered to have the atmospheric global warming as primary driver marzeion et al 2014 vuille et al 2018 indeed the retreat of worldwide glaciers in the period 1884 1978 was found to be proportional to global warming oerlemans 1994 and a significant increase in glacier mass loss rates has been observed in the last decades in response to accelerated warming zemp et al 2019 zemp et al 2020 very small glaciers 0 5 km2 constitute around 13 of the global glacier area and retain 5 of overall ice volume but they are widespread representing 80 90 of the glaciers in mid and low latitude mountain ranges huss and fischer 2016 paul et al 2004 pfeffer et al 2014 according to a recent inventory of glaciers in the european alps paul et al 2020 in 2015 very small glaciers covered 19 of the total glacierized area and 86 of the total glacier number percentages are similar for the italian alps where these glaciers represent 22 of the total glacierized area and 86 of the total glacier number the amount of very small glaciers is increasing all over the world due to the fragmentation of larger glaciers they act as an important water store and regulate the runoff regime in mountain areas barnett et al 2005 huss 2011 huss and fischer 2016 jost et al 2012 unfortunately there is a lack of knowledge about their climatic response which is highly dependent on individual glacier characteristics and topo climatic controls carturan et al 2020 2013 debeer and sharp 2009 kuhn 1995 this uncertainty impacts negatively on climate adaptation mitigation strategies all around the globe very small glaciers located at the foot of rockwalls are mostly fed by avalanches and generally covered by debris at least in their ablation area helfricht et al 2015 huss and fischer 2016 this type of glacier tend towards a lower mass loss rate compared to the majority of other glaciers where avalanche activity and debris cover are negligible de marco et al 2020 the latter are usually responsive to temperature changes e g gharehchahi et al 2021 while the former ones are more sensitive to precipitation variability colucci et al 2021 de marco et al 2020 pellicciotti et al 2015 and have a tendency to decouple from regional temperature fluctuations the concentration of avalanche snow and debris over receding glaciers represent well know negative feedbacks during deglaciation benn and evans 2010 nicholson and benn 2006 which can affect a large number of ice bodies especially in high relief mountain groups with sub vertical rock walls such as the dolomites eastern italian alps however these processes are quantitatively documented for short periods in recent decades anderson et al 2021 fleischer et al 2021 tielidze et al 2020 whereas long term studies of these dynamics at secular time scales are scarcely available in the literature e g nüsser and schmidt 2021 triglav čekada et al 2014 this is remarkable because they are generally long term processes which require observations of sufficient length to be fully investigated and understood this paper aims to provide a contribution to the knowledge of long term processes occurring on very small and debris covered glaciers with special focus on mass balance behavior and debris accumulation a century long analysis is performed regarding the behavior and climatic response of the occidentale del montasio glacier julian alps north east italy which is fed by avalanches and has the ablation area covered by debris digital elevation models dems were reconstructed from different data sources maps aerial photos terrestrial photos terrestrial laser scanner tls and aerial laser scanner als and the glacier variations from 1920 to 2020 have been assessed in terms of i elevation changes ii geodetic mass balance and iii debris cover and surface characteristics the results have been discussed in relation to air temperature and precipitations trends in the same observation period 2 the montasio glacier the occidentale del montasio glacier montasio glacier hereafter lies on the northern side of the mount jôf di montasio 2754 m a s l italian julian alps eastern european alps between 1860 m and 2050 m a s l median elevation at 1900 m a s l and mean elevation at 1910 m a s l and it is the lowermost italian glacier fig 1 the glacier area is 6 7 ha year 2020 it is mainly nourished by winter avalanches which have their deposition zone over the steep and cone shaped accumulation area while the ablation area is defined by a gently sloped surface entirely covered by a 2 3 m thick debris layer the first information source regarding the montasio glacier is represented by photos taken by austrian soldiers during the first world war wwi 1914 1918 these photos show the glacier covered by abundant snow even during summer and are taken from too far away to enable a quantitative reconstruction of the glacier geometry systematic observations date back to the early 1920s when the glacier was visited and classified as a real glacier for the first time by ardito desio desio 1923 desio performed the first length change measurements between 1920 and 1923 documenting a stationarity of the front whose lower margin was already covered by debris and hard to recognize in september 1920 desio produced the first map of the glacier using a compass desio 1923 in 1923 desio reported surface elevation differences due to differential ablation processes in the lower part of the glacier covered by a debris band after these first observations glacier conditions and length changes have been monitored by different observers from 1938 to 1940 manfredi mazzocca from 1945 to 1947 bruno martinis and dino di colbertaldo from 1951 to 1989 dino and giancarlo di colbertaldo rossana serandrei barbero and carlo phoar and in the 1990s rossana serandrei barbero these observations were sparse and discontinuous the observers reported a progressive shrinking of the glacier front a general thinning of the glacier and an increase in debris coverage as can be appreciated from their photos fig 2 the thickness of the debris cover increased with time making it difficult to recognize the lower margin of the glacier already in the first decades of observations in the 1940s the debris thickness at the front was 0 5 m cgi 1914 1977 cgi 1978 2012 roberto degli uomini built independently a unique series of observations consisting of annual photographs taken at the end of the ablation season from 1987 to 2021 these photos are unpublished and have been made available for this study in the last two decades the glacier has been extensively investigated by universities of udine and padova carturan et al 2013 de marco et al 2020 piermattei et al 2015 these studies analysed the glacier s behaviour applying innovative geodetic techniques and documenting conditions of minor imbalance compared to the majority of other alpine glaciers similar investigations carried out at neighbouring ice bodies confirm this peculiarity which is related to the specific glaciers characteristics and to the climatic setting of this geographic area which benefits from a recent increase in solid precipitations colucci et al 2021 3 materials and methods the behaviour of the montasio glacier in the last century has been investigated and characterised analysing i changes in surface cover type and spatial coverage ii elevation changes iii mass balance across different periods and iv corresponding changes in the most relevant meteorological variables the input data used in this study are summarized in table 1 3 1 glacier change analysis 3 1 1 surface cover analysis changes in the areal extent and surface cover of the montasio glacier have been reconstructed and analysed since 1920 using available aerial photographs and maps with the help of oblique terrestrial images taken mostly from the frontal moraine table 1 and fig 2 the aerial photos have been georeferenced using the qgis georeferencing tool based on the coordinates of stable and recognisable ground control points gcps selected on the glacier surroundings from the 2018 als dem table 1 in addition we used field survey notes qualitative observations and descriptions of morphological changes reported in the glaciological campaigns cgi 1914 1977 cgi 1978 2012 field surveys also report length change measurements which however are affected by a high degree of uncertainty since the beginning of observations in the early 1920s it was increasingly difficult to locate the lower margin of the glacier due to the debris coverage in addition there are uncertainties related to the use of different marks by the different observers which could not be solved unambiguously for this reason we avoided analysing length changes which anyway are of minor importance for this glacier recent geophysical investigations indeed have shown that the current lower edge of the glacier lies just 40 m upstream of the little ice age maximum moraine carturan et al 2013 the glacier extent in 1920 was available from the work of carturan et al 2021 the extent in 1948 1986 2006 and 2020 has been mapped outlining the glacier perimeter in the georeferenced aerial photographs table 1 with a planimetric accuracy of about 10 m the lateral and upper edges of the glacier were easy to identify because the debris cover was absent or thin and they clearly stand out from the surrounding terrain the lower edge was more difficult to map and we drew it using the current edge derived from geophysics and the 1920 edge marked by an evident moraine ridge as constrains we assume negligible frontal advance in the analysed period testified by a lack of moraine ridges between the 1920 and the current front positions and positioned the frontal margin in correspondence of breaks of local slope visible in photographs and hillshaded dems of the corresponding years for the same years of glacier extent the surface cover was classified into five main types snow firn ice shallow debris cover and thick debris cover these surface cover types have been mapped by visual recognition in the photographs and with the help of hillshaded dems snow was relatively easy to distinguish from firn due its lighter colour caused by a lower coverage of dust and debris moreover ice without debris cover was rather easy to distinguish from snow and firn because it clearly shows a finely layered structure thick and shallow few centimeters debris cover were distinguished based on their appearance continuous and dry with a lighter colour the first discontinuous darker and wet looking the second 3 1 2 generation of dems elevation changes and geodetic mass balance have been calculated using all data available for generating dems in the period between 1920 and 2020 five dems with pixel size of 1 1 m year 1920 1948 1982 2006 and 2020 have been reconstructed applying different methods based on the type and quality of input data table 1 dem errors have been calculated in comparison to a common reference dem as detailed at the end of this section the 1920 dem derives from the desio s topographic map desio 1923 the map has been georeferenced digitized and converted to a dem using the arcgis software esri usa details on the workflow are reported in carturan et al 2021 the 1948 dem was obtained from four aerial photographs taken on september 19 1948 by the igm italian military geographic institute the photos were scanned using a photogrammetric hardware to avoid distortions during digitization which could negatively affect the photogrammetric pipeline and increase the error of the derived dem sevara 2016 images were processed with the structure from motion sfm algorithm implemented in the metashape software v 1 6 4 build 10928 agisoft llc st petersburg russia to create a dense point cloud 25 points m 2 which was initially georeferenced and scaled using 13 highly recognisable and stable ground control points gcps located outside the glacier 3d coordinates of the gcps had been obtained from the 2018 als survey residual misalignments in the georeferencing were subsequently minimized by applying the iterative closest point icp algorithm implemented in jrc 3d reconstructor software v 4 3 1 gexcel cagliari italy using the 2018 als survey as reference cloud to compute the roto translation transformation only the stable areas outside the glacier have been used the point cloud was then subsampled using the arcgis esri plugin topcat topographic point cloud analysis tool converted to a tin triangular irregular network model and subsequently rasterized to a 1x1 m grid the only cartographic information regarding the montasio glacier between 1948 and 2006 is a topographic map scale 1 5000 surveyed on june 6 1983 which has been georeferenced digitized and converted to a dem unfortunately this date is far from the end of the ablation season and close to the end of the accumulation season due to the high snow accumulation in this geographic area the surface topography in june is normally several metres higher than the underlying glacier surface hiding the true glacier geometry to overcome this issue and try to account for the snow accumulated in the 1982 83 accumulation season we estimated the 1982 83 winter balance by means of a linear regression between available winter balance measurements in the period from 2011 to 2021 and the winter precipitation data from november 1 to april 30 at the pontebba weather station section 3 2 the obtained winter balance was converted to snow depth using the end of winter mean snow density measured in snow pits the snow depth was finally subtracted from the june 1983 surface topography obtaining the 1982 end of summer surface topography of the glacier as we are aware of the limitations of this approach which does not account for the spatial distribution of snow we only used this topography for geodetic mass balance calculations i e we did not analyse the spatial variability of elevation changes we choose to use the 1983 survey even with these limitations because the early 1980 s represent an important climatic shift section 4 2 two dems derived from als surveys commissioned by the civil protection department of the friuli venezia giulia region were available one for 2006 and another one for 2018 the surveys have been performed by the same private company helica srl in 2006 the flight was performed in september 13 using the optech altm 3100 ea at an average flight altitude of 800 m above ground level a g l with the sensor registering up to 4 echoes for each emitted laser pulse and with a vertical uncertainty 0 15 m up to 1200 m a g l the resulting nominal point density was 4 points m 2 the 2018 survey was done in july 23 using a riegl lms q780 at an average flight altitude of 500 m a g l data were acquired with a full waveform acquisition mode achieving a vertical accuracy of 0 02 m at 250 m a g l and obtaining a nominal point density of 18 points m 2 the 2006 point cloud has been used for mass balance calculations whereas the 2018 point cloud has been employed as a reference for georeferencing all the other surveys and for calculating residual errors the 2020 dem was calculated from an ad hoc sfm survey carried out on october 8 2020 with a dji matrice 210v2 quadcopter equipped with a dji x5s camera 20 8 mp 4 3 17 3x13 mm sensor 15 mm focal length a total of 513 nadir and 209 oblique images were collected and then processed using metashape software gcps positions were measured via gnss on the same day and they were used as georeferencing constraints in the photogrammetric pipeline described in cucchiaro et al 2018 the resulting point cloud had a density of 500 points m 2 both 2006 and 2020 point clouds were co registered to the 2018 als cucchiaro et al 2020 and successively subsampled converted to tin and rasterized to dem as described for the 1948 dem all dem errors have been assessed on stable areas outside the glacier mostly over the moraine and in its proximity computing the elevation difference from the 2018 reference dem estimated errors for single pixels range from 0 09 to 4 95 m table 2 the total uncertainty for glacier wide calculations of elevation and volume change depends on the size of the averaging area and the scale of the spatial correlation of elevation differences among the dems rolstad et al 2009 unfortunately it was impossible to obtain reliable statistics i e the spatial correlation function given the insufficient coverage outside the glacier therefore the errors estimated for single pixels represent an upper limit of the errors in glacier wide calculations for the 1920 dem uncertainty assessments were only possible along the 1920 glacier perimeter because the desio s map reports topographic information only inside the glacier an error of 4 94 m could be estimated for this dem however this has to be considered as a rough estimation the only feasible because paraglacial reworking may have affected the deposits along the 1920 glacier margin 3 1 3 elevation change analysis elevation changes have been calculated for each 1 1 m pixel and for different sub periods subtracting pairs of dems the so called calculation of the dem of differences dods the area of interest for each comparison has been set equal to the merged area between the initial and final extent of the glacier in the analysed period the dods enabled the analysis of the spatial variability of elevation changes and of their annual rates for the 1948 1982 and 1982 2006 sub periods however we only calculated the total elevation difference used in mass balance calculations and did not attempt to map or analyse its spatial distribution due to the limitations of the 1982 dem described in section 3 1 2 3 1 4 mass balance calculation geodetic mass balance for different sub periods have been derived from the calculated dods section 3 1 3 total volume changes calculated over the merged initial final area of the glacier have been converted to water equivalent using a mean density of 850 kg m 3 huss 2013 sapiano et al 1998 to obtain the average annual mass balance rate the obtained value was divided by the mean glacier area half sum of the initial and final area and by the time interval in years the residual errors in dems construction detailed in section 3 1 2 translate to an error in geodetic annual mass balance rates ranging from 0 01 m w e y 1 for the 2006 2020 mass balance period to 0 16 m w e y 1 for the 1982 2006 mass balance period table 3 3 2 analysis of meteorological data meteorological data series of daily air temperature and precipitation from 1927 to 2020 are analysed in this work this analysis enabled us to detect possible long term trends in meteorological conditions and to relate them to the evolution of the montasio glacier in the last century the series analysed in this paper is an extension of the data of the pontebba weather station 568 m a s l 12 km from the glacier presented in de marco et al 2020 which spans the period from 1961 to 2020 this weather station was selected due to its relative proximity to the glacier the high quality of air temperature and precipitation series and the length of meteorological records data prior to 1961 have been taken from baldassi 2010 who performed quality checking homogenization and gap filling to the meteorological data in the period from 1927 to 1961 the temperature series was extrapolated at the montasio glacier mean elevation 1910 m a s l using monthly vertical gradients calculated over the period from 1999 to 2010 between the pontebba and lussari 1760 m a s l weather stations the resulting temperature was used for discriminating between liquid and solid precipitation at the glacier s elevation using a daily threshold temperature of 2 c de marco et al 2020 in this way it was possible to estimate the nivometric coefficient fraction of solid precipitation at the glacier s mean elevation and its variability in the last century we avoided extrapolating precipitation data at the glacier s elevation because the study area is affected by large horizontal and vertical gradients in precipitation which are difficult to calculate due to the lack of reliable precipitation data at high elevation schwarb 2000 for this reason we preferred quality checked precipitation data at low altitude to extrapolations subject to high uncertainty assuming negligible effects from precipitation gradients in long term meteorological trends air temperature precipitation and nivometric coefficients have been analysed separately for the ablation and the accumulation seasons may to october and november to april respectively trends and break points were assessed using non parametric tests for annual and seasonal data of temperature and precipitation solid liquid and total the mann kendall test was used to establish whether a trend exists in the time series afterwards the presence of break points and their positions were assessed using the pettitt s test emmanuel et al 2019 finally the occurrence of multiple break points was verified based on the bic test bayesian information criterion implemented in the strucchange r package r core team 2021 descriptive statistics have been calculated for each meteorological series and for sub periods detected by the break point analysis see chapter 4 2 4 results 4 1 glacier changes analysis 4 1 1 elevation changes and mass balance the montasio glacier underwent a thinning of 27 75 m 5 32 m on average between 1920 and 2020 table 3 forty nine percent of the total thinning occurred before 1948 another 18 by 1982 an additional 31 by 2006 and only 2 after 2006 the available dems show continuous thinning even though short periods of temporary thickening cannot be excluded due to the time distance among dems thinning rates were largest between 1920 and 1948 with an average value of 0 52 m y 1 and a mass balance rate of 0 49 0 13 m w e y 1 in the period between 1948 and 1982 the surface lowered more slowly in comparison with the previous time interval with a mean thinning rate of 0 16 m y 1 and a mass balance of 0 14 0 11 m w e y 1 rates of lowering and mass loss increased substantially afterwards reaching 0 39 m y 1 and 0 36 0 16 m w e y 1 respectively in the period from 1982 to 2006 the last period showed the lowest thinning rates with a mean value of 0 04 m y 1 in the period from 2006 to 2020 and a mass balance of 0 03 0 01 m w e y 1 which was closer to equilibrium the spatial patterns of elevation changes show that the largest cumulated thinning between 1920 and 2020 occurred in the upper part and in the orographic right portions of the glacier locally exceeding 40 m fig 3 in comparison the lower part of the glacier underwent smaller thinning comprised between 10 and 30 m the different behaviour of the upper and lower glacier portions is more evident after 1948 whereas before 1948 the thinning rates of the two parts showed higher similarity after 2006 thickening prevailed in the upper part while the lower part continued thinning with a rate that is comparable to the period between 1948 and 2006 fig 4 4 1 2 changes in surface cover types the surface cover analysis shown in fig 5 highlights a significant increase in debris cover on the montasio glacier during the last century in 1920 as reported by ardito desio 1923 the surface was almost free from debris except for the lower margin and for the top of the glacier where there was a shallow debris cover by 1948 the glacier thinned considerably and became mostly covered by debris as can be appreciated from various terrestrial photos taken by observers in the 1940s these images show the top of the glacier almost free from debris the middle part with discontinuous and shallow debris cover over stratified glacier ice fig 2a and b and the lower part covered by thick debris and with a complex surface morphology due to differential ablation similar to hummocky moraine terrain unfortunately the 1948 aerial photo only shows the lowermost part of the glacier due to a widespread snow cover terrestrial photos taken in the 1950s and 1960s and field reports from the 1970s document the existence of several layers of snow and firn from different years covering most of the glacier the new firn layers covered a large fraction of the debris covered area whose spatial extent decreased significantly and was limited to the lower portion the surface cover analysis for 1986 fig 5 depicts the glacier at the end of this period which was rather favorable for glacier preservation as can be seen in 1986 the glacier surface was still covered by snow firn and stratified glacier ice in the middle and upper areas whereas the debris cover was confined to the lower part crevasses were clearly visible in the upper area until the 1980s by 2000 the glacier was completely buried under a thick debris mantle except for the top of the avalanche cone where very small patches of snow firn and glacier ice were still visible during the 1990s and the early 2000s the glacier has been repeatedly affected by flooding events some of which were of large magnitude chiarle et al 2007 which left clear traces of glacial fluvial reworking debris flows on the glacier surface and surrounding deposits fig 2h and i in the last years the most significant changes occurred in the upper part with the alternation of periods with snow and firn cover expansion 2009 2011 2013 2014 and periods of rapid snow and firn depletion 2012 2015 2019 leading to a new rapid increase in the debris cover after the 1980 s only few transverse crevasses were visible and were limited to the top of the glacier nevertheless recent investigations have shown that the glacier still preserves surface dynamics and has mean displacement rates of 0 2 m y 1 in the lower part de marco et al 2020 geophysical investigations carried out in 2010 showed that the thickness of the debris cover in the lower half of the glacier is of 2 3 m carturan et al 2013 the hummocky moraine morphology observed in the 1940 s in this area has been completely replaced by glacial fluvial reworking debris flows although some hollows typical of hummocky terrain are still present carturan et al 2013 4 2 change in climatic conditions the breakpoint analysis applied to the meteorological data series available from 1927 to 2020 revealed significant breakpoints for air temperature and consequently in some cases for nivometric coefficient nc and solid precipitations fig 6 no breakpoints were detected in the time series of total precipitation for the accumulation and ablation seasons total annual precipitation and solid precipitation in the accumulation season linear trends were also non existent or without statistical significance for these variables temperature breakpoints occurred for both accumulation and ablation seasons in the 1980 s fig 6a in the accumulation season one break point was identified in 1987 that separates a first subperiod without trend followed by another subperiod with a positive and significant trend 0 052 c y 1 p 0 05 a break point in the ablation season temperature series was detected 6 years earlier in 1981 preceded by a slightly negative trend 0 012 c y 1 p 0 05 and followed by a positive trend 0 040 c y 1 p 0 001 the air temperature in the accumulation season averaged 4 62 0 89 c before 1987 and 2 66 0 92 c afterwards in the ablation season it increased from a mean value of 5 72 0 75 c before 1981 to 7 62 0 69 c afterwards before 1970 the nc in the accumulation season did not show a significant trend while after 1970 the nc started to decrease decreasing fraction of solid precipitation with a rate of 0 35 y 1 p 0 001 after 1995 the nc in the accumulation season consistently deviated from 100 highlighting an increasing fraction of liquid precipitation regarding the ablation season no significant trends were found before and after the break point in 1984 but the two subperiods were characterised by different mean values 32 12 and 17 9 respectively which highlight a substantial halving of solid precipitation during summer indeed the analysis of solid precipitation in the ablation season detected a decrease in mean values from 328 128 mm before a break point in 1987 to 171 98 mm after it fig 7 plots time series of air temperature and total precipitation anomalies compared to the 1927 2020 means in the first period of highly negative mass balance between 1920 and 1948 the most relevant anomaly was for total precipitation in the accumulation season which shows a long period from 1937 to 1947 with low snow accumulation this is the driest decade in the entire series temperature anomalies were of lower significance although the dry period was associated with increasing air temperature in the period of slightly negative mass balance between 1948 and 1982 there was an evident decrease in air temperature especially in the ablation season total precipitation in the accumulation season came back to average or slightly above average values with smaller inter annual variability and a small tendency to increase between the late 1950 s and the 1980 s after a dry period in the first half of the 1950 s starting in the 1980 s there was a visible warming which is still going on the precipitation in the accumulation season was mostly below average from the late 1980 s to the early 2000 s with increasing inter annual variability accumulation came back to the long term average after 2008 with snow rich winters in 2009 2014 and 2020 overall the average annual balance in the four subperiods looks strongly correlated with winter precipitation anomalies in the same periods inset scatterplots in fig 7 these results confirm at the secular timescale the findings obtained for the last two decades de marco et al 2020 which highlight a far higher sensitivity of this glacier to snow accumulation compared to summer air temperature 5 discussion 5 1 peculiarities of the montasio glacier the peculiar behaviour and climatic response of the montasio glacier has been analysed in detail by recent investigations carturan et al 2013 de marco et al 2020 whose main results highlight i a low response to regional air temperature variability ii a high response to regional snow accumulation variability iii a normal relationship between mass balance and elevation in years with positive mass balance i e net accumulation in the upper part and net ablation in the lower part iv inverted mass balance gradient in years with negative mass balance i e lower mass balance in the upper part free from debris v high mass balance sensitivity after years with positive mass balance expansion of the firn area which is free from debris vi low mass balance sensitivity after years with negative mass balance expansion of the debris covered area these dynamics have been investigated with a quantitative approach and high spatial and time resolution for the most recent years whereas longer term effects were only hypothesized in this work we report major variations in the surface conditions and climatic response of the glacier across a much longer period the integrated analysis of mass balance surface cover and meteorological data enabled a good description of glacier variations and dynamics in the last century 1920 2020 this analysis shows an overall trend towards decreasing imbalance and decreasing mass balance sensitivity for the montasio glacier although snowy winters can explain some positive mass balances in recent years fig 7 the current behaviour of this glacier is mostly associated with debris cover dynamics over multi decadal time scales fig 5 debris supply is ensured by the continuous action of cryo clastism avalanches and rock falls and is abundant in comparison to glacier transportation efficiency due to the high ratio between the area of debris providing rock walls and the glacier area haeberli 1986 zemp et al 2005 debris evacuation by glacier transport outside the lia and 1920 s moraines has become negligible since the first decades of the 20th century and these moraines have a damming effect on debris transported by glaciofluvial processes the resulting increase in area and thickness of the debris mantle is an important negative feedback that is contributing to the preservation of the montasio glacier 5 2 mass balance evolution and morphological changes in the last century the mass balance of the glacier has been characterized by four major phases rapid mass loss until the 1940 s conditions close to balanced budget until the 1980 s rapid mass loss but slower than in the 1930 s and 1940 s in the 1990 s and early 2000 s and balanced budget conditions afterwards this behaviour is similar to most alpine glaciers until the 1980 s however it tends to diverge from the majority of alpine glaciers starting in the 1990 s showing decreased imbalance and mass balance sensitivity the fig 8 compares the cumulated geodetic mass balance of the montasio glacier with the mean of all glaciers in the european alps that have geodetic balance measurements in the same period wgms 2021 the two series and their cumulated difference fig 8b and 8c clearly highlight a higher balance sensitivity of the montasio glacier between the 1920 s and the 1940 s and a transition to a lower climatic sensitivity afterwards the cumulated difference line reverses its slope after 1948 and becomes much steeper after 2006 suggesting a further decrease in the climatic sensitivity of the montasio glacier compared to other monitored glaciers in the alps the mass loss of montasio glacier is not associated with active retreat which is the response of glaciers that keep their uppermost part and loose lower portions of the ablation area indeed the montasio glacier experienced small areal changes in the last decades and its front lies in close proximity to the lia moraines carturan et al 2013 this behaviour might suggest a sort of stationary thinning or downwasting bolch et al 2008 pellicciotti et al 2015 however montasio does not experience the positive feedbacks elevation feedback due to surface lowering decreased cooling effect and increasing thermal emission from the surrounding deglaciated terrain over disintegrating glaciers that speed up deglaciation in other cases carturan et al 2020 paul et al 2007 pelto 2010 indeed the montasio glacier did not separate into smaller ice bodies and it underwent only 28 m average thinning which translates into only 0 2 c of warming considering an average temperature lapse rate of 0 65 c 100 m the stationary thinning of the montasio glacier is instead associated to negative feedbacks brought by i increasing debris cover extent and thickness ii avalanche snow concentration over a smaller glacier and iii increasing shadowing by the surrounding terrain due to the glacier retreat and the lowering of its surface figure 12 in carturan et al 2013 the first process is dominant in the lower half of the glacier whereas in the upper part there is a prevalence of effects from avalanche concentration and increased shadowing this glacier shows substantial differences in comparison with larger valley type debris covered glaciers which are more often studied in spite of their widespread debris cover which should limit melt valley type debris covered glaciers often display elevation change rates similar to debris free glaciers gardelle et al 2013 this phenomenon is referred to as the debris cover anomaly pellicciotti et al 2015 and can be explained largely by glacier dynamics low emergence velocities over stagnant ablation tongues associated with local enhancing of melt due to the formation of ice cliffs and water ponds rounce et al 2021 the different behaviour of the montasio glacier can be explained by the thickness of its debris cover which is 2 3 m compared to a mean debris thickness estimate of 0 35 m for valley glaciers rounce et al 2021 the thick debris mantle of the montasio glacier prevents the formation of ice cliffs and significant emergence velocities likely persist in the ablation area due to the steepness and proximity of the accumulation area useful comparisons can be made also with glaciers of similar size but lacking debris coverage the mean annual balance of all very small glaciers measured in central europe according to the latest world glacier monitoring service database wgms 2021 passed from 0 78 m w e y 1 between 1982 and 2006 to 1 11 m w e y 1 between 2006 and 2020 these results confirm the specific behaviour of the montasio glacier which passed from 0 36 m w e y 1 to 0 03 m w e y 1 in the same periods the high mass loss of montasio glacier in the period from 1920 to 1948 represents 49 of the total mass loss in a century and can be explained by very low snow accumulation in the decade after 1936 based on meteorological data series moreover the debris coverage was still limited to the lower ablation area and was relatively thin up to 50 cm at the lower margin of the glacier the spatial pattern of surface lowering fig 3 is clearly related to the spatial extent and thickness of debris cover as visible in the photos of the above mentioned period indeed the highest losses occurred in the upper part and in the eastern ablation area where the debris cover was absent or thin and discontinuous the middle and western ablation areas were already covered by thick debris as can be assessed by differential ablation phenomena reported by observers and visible in the photos which protected the underlying ice from ablation the eastern ablation area was and remains the most active of the glacier due to a depression in the bedrock carturan et al 2013 favourable meteorological conditions in the following decades especially between the 1960 s and early 1980 s led to a preservation of the glacier associated with an expansion of the debris free area and a contraction of the debris covered area this however set up conditions of higher vulnerability when meteorological conditions become unfavourable starting in the late 1980 s because the debris free area is prone to rapid mass loss in periods with low snow accumulation and or high summer temperature de marco et al 2020 after a period of rapid mass loss however the areal extent and thickness of the debris cover become so large that it gradually offset a potential increase of ablation due to rising temperatures currently the glacier behaves as a nearly stagnant ice mass covered by a thick mantle of debris which reactivates following snowy winters probably the active part of the glacier has to be considered its upper and steeper half which completely rebuilds after snow rich winters and undergoes rapid thinning and burial by debris in periods with scarce snowfalls fig 2 this part for example underwent negligible change in thickness between the 1940 s and the 1980 s fig 2a 2e 2f rapidly collapsed in the 1990 s fig 2f and 2 h and quickly rebuilt with the increase in winter accumulation after 2008 fig 2h and 2 l a comparison is possible with other ice bodies in the julian alps especially with the canin east glacieret which are located within 10 km from the montasio glacier several works highlight similar behaviours with positive mass balance in recent years and even mass rebuilt influenced mainly by winter precipitations colucci et al 2021 colucci and guglielmin 2015 the climatic causes are the same recent snowy winters however montasio and canin glaciers are very different the latter is indeed without debris cover and therefore it is expected to have higher climatic sensitivity and to disappear completely without abundant snowfalls 5 3 expected glacier evolution based on collected evidence and current trends in meteorological variables it is possible to outline a plausible evolution for the montasio glacier and other similar ice bodies in the next few decades the increasing temperature is leading to a decrease in the solid fraction of precipitation not only in the ablation season but also in the accumulation season section 4 2 fig 6b the latter tends to become shorter whereas the former tends to expand warmer temperature causes also permafrost degradation and this could be linked with an increase in rock fall activity from the rock walls above the glacier where the permafrost map published by boeckli et al 2012 indicates the possible presence of permafrost above 2400 m a s l thanks to a likely increase in the coverage and thickness of the debris cover the montasio glacier is not expected to disappear soon even with a decrease in snow accumulation however it is expected to become progressively less active if the warming continues a transition to a rock glacier or a glacial permafrost composite landforms seppi et al 2019 seppi et al 2015 cannot be completely ruled out nevertheless in our opinion this occurrence is unlikely in the near future because in the glacier area the conditions are unfavourable for permafrost the boeckli et al 2012 map plots permafrost only in very favourable conditions there considering the low elevation of the glacier almost entirely below 2000 m only open work deposits could enable the presence or formation of sporadic permafrost and a possible shift from glacial towards periglacial conditioning the current grain size distribution with considerable infill of fine debris between blocks and the surface morphology of the debris covered area and proglacial deposits complete lack of morphological features typical of active rock glaciers lead us to exclude the presence of permafrost in the glacier area and the impending transition to permafrost related landforms geophysical investigations carried out in late summer of 2010 highlighted massive glacier ice under the debris cover but no frozen sediments carturan et al 2013 the sediment budget is currently positive thanks to the damming effect of moraine deposits in front of the glacier further thinning from ice melt is expected to increase the maximum volume of debris that can accumulate upstream of these deposits only fluvial or glacio fluvial processes can erode substantial amounts of debris recent investigations have shown that high magnitude flooding events can rework and even erode large amounts of debris from the glacier area through the lateral breaches of the lia moraine chiarle et al 2007 in case of increased frequency of these extreme events sediment dynamics will possibly change in the future and lead to a more efficient removal of debris from the glacier area with adverse consequences for the preservation of the residual ice body 6 conclusions this work presents a reconstruction of the behaviour of the montasio glacier during the last 100 years the reconstruction is based on a comprehensive collection of data which have been processed to derive series of elevation change geodetic balance rate and surface cover change from 1920 to 2020 the results show a consistency with the behaviour of most alpine glaciers until the 1990 s and a clear decoupling in the 2000 s in fact most of the mass losses occurred between 1920 and 1948 49 of the total mass loss followed by nearly balance budget condition until the 1980 s 18 of the total mass loss the high melt rate observed in the first decades was associated with negative anomalies in snow accumulation in particular between the late 1930 s and the early 1940 s while relatively favourable conditions characterised the period between 1960 s and 1980 s a new phase of rapid mass loss occurred between the 1980 s and the 1990 s when temperature started increasing sharply however in the last two decades the glacier entered a new phase close to balanced budget conditions in spite of sustained atmospheric warming this behaviour is clearly decoupled from the regional temperature fluctuations and from the behaviour of alpine glaciers with similar monitoring series even if the glacier experienced recent winters with abundant snow accumulation the main causes of this progressive decrease in climatic sensitivity have to be looked for in negative feedbacks which offset potential increased melt due to warmer temperature in particular starting in the 1940 s the glacier became increasingly covered by a thick layer of debris in the ablation area which strongly limits ablation the role of the thick debris cover was already acknowledged by previous investigations on this glacier but this work documents for the first time the debris cover dynamics in the long term in addition the glacier has a lower sensitivity to air temperature fluctuations compared to precipitation variability because it is mainly fed by avalanches for these reasons it is important to avoid generalizations on regional glacier balance and inferences on climatic trends when analysing the behaviour of glaciers with characteristics similar to the montasio glacier these glaciers are common in high relief mountain areas of the world but may have singular climatic response governed by specific negative feedbacks as demonstrated by this work in case of further atmospheric warming the accumulation seasons are expected to become shorter and less snowy on the montasio glacier with concomitant longer and warmer ablation seasons this could also lead to permafrost degradation in the surrounding rock walls potentially increasing rock fall activity and debris supply for these reasons a further increase in the spatial coverage and thickness of debris is likely and therefore the glacier will not disappear in the near future unlike other similar ice bodies in the alps however the montasio glacier is not expected to evolve into a rock glacier or a glacial permafrost composite landform due to the low elevation and lack of conditions favourable to permafrost funding this study was carried

2668,small debris covered and avalanche fed glaciers are widespread in high relief areas of the world however their climatic response is poorly known because they cannot be investigated with traditional techniques like the glaciological mass balance method and long term observations series are very rare this work documents changes in elevation mass balance rate and surface cover in the last century from 1920 to 2020 for the small debris covered and avalanche fed montasio glacier where recent investigations show unusual response to climatic changes but it is unclear whether this response is a short or a long term characteristic glacier response is analysed primarily through digital elevation models reconstructed from different types of data sources maps terrestrial and aerial images point clouds glacier changes are analysed jointly with trends in the most relevant climatic variables the glacier experienced phases of rapid mass loss between 1920 and 1948 0 49 m w e y 1 and between 1982 and 2006 0 36 m w e y 1 smaller imbalance occurred between 1948 and 1982 0 14 m w e y 1 and remarkably between 2006 and 2020 0 03 m w e y 1 whereas the 1948 1982 was a favourable time window for most glaciers in the alps the last fifteen years were characterized by rapid warming and show a clear divergence between the behaviour of the montasio glacier and of the rest of alpine glaciers a century long increase in debris cover now 2 3 m thick in the lower half of the glacier explains largely this divergence snow rich winters in recent years also played a role because the glacier reacts sensitively to changes in solid precipitation even in the case of possible decreased snowfalls and increased melt associated with warming temperatures during the next decades the glacier is not expected to vanish soon because it will likely survive under a thick layer of debris and shadowed by the north walls of the mount jôf di montasio on the other hand the results of this study paired with the current distribution of permafrost in the study area suggest that the montasio glacier will unlikely evolve into a rock glacier or a glacial permafrost composite landform

warming as primary driver marzeion et al 2014 vuille et al 2018 indeed the retreat of worldwide glaciers in the period 1884 1978 was found to be proportional to global warming oerlemans 1994 and a significant increase in glacier mass loss rates has been observed in the last decades in response to accelerated warming zemp et al 2019 zemp et al 2020 very small glaciers 0 5 km2 constitute around 13 of the global glacier area and retain 5 of overall ice volume but they are widespread representing 80 90 of the glaciers in mid and low latitude mountain ranges huss and fischer 2016 paul et al 2004 pfeffer et al 2014 according to a recent inventory of glaciers in the european alps paul et al 2020 in 2015 very small glaciers covered 19 of the total glacierized area and 86 of the total glacier number percentages are similar for the italian alps where these glaciers represent 22 of the total glacierized area and 86 of the total glacier number the amount of very small glaciers is increasing all over the world due to the fragmentation of larger glaciers they act as an important water store and regulate the runoff regime in mountain areas barnett et al 2005 huss 2011 huss and fischer 2016 jost et al 2012 unfortunately there is a lack of knowledge about their climatic response which is highly dependent on individual glacier characteristics and topo climatic controls carturan et al 2020 2013 debeer and sharp 2009 kuhn 1995 this uncertainty impacts negatively on climate adaptation mitigation strategies all around the globe very small glaciers located at the foot of rockwalls are mostly fed by avalanches and generally covered by debris at least in their ablation area helfricht et al 2015 huss and fischer 2016 this type of glacier tend towards a lower mass loss rate compared to the majority of other glaciers where avalanche activity and debris cover are negligible de marco et al 2020 the latter are usually responsive to temperature changes e g gharehchahi et al 2021 while the former ones are more sensitive to precipitation variability colucci et al 2021 de marco et al 2020 pellicciotti et al 2015 and have a tendency to decouple from regional temperature fluctuations the concentration of avalanche snow and debris over receding glaciers represent well know negative feedbacks during deglaciation benn and evans 2010 nicholson and benn 2006 which can affect a large number of ice bodies especially in high relief mountain groups with sub vertical rock walls such as the dolomites eastern italian alps however these processes are quantitatively documented for short periods in recent decades anderson et al 2021 fleischer et al 2021 tielidze et al 2020 whereas long term studies of these dynamics at secular time scales are scarcely available in the literature e g nüsser and schmidt 2021 triglav čekada et al 2014 this is remarkable because they are generally long term processes which require observations of sufficient length to be fully investigated and understood this paper aims to provide a contribution to the knowledge of long term processes occurring on very small and debris covered glaciers with special focus on mass balance

hereafter lies on the northern side of the mount jôf di montasio 2754 m a s l italian julian alps eastern european alps between 1860 m and 2050 m a s l median elevation at 1900 m a s l and mean elevation at 1910 m a s l and it is the lowermost italian glacier fig 1 the glacier area is 6 7 ha year 2020 it is mainly nourished by winter avalanches which have their deposition zone over the steep and cone shaped accumulation area while the ablation area is defined by a gently sloped surface entirely covered by a 2 3 m thick debris layer the first information source regarding the montasio glacier is represented by photos taken by austrian soldiers during the first world war wwi 1914 1918 these photos show the glacier covered by abundant snow even during summer and are taken from too far away to enable a quantitative reconstruction of the glacier geometry systematic observations date back to the early 1920s when the glacier was visited and classified as a real glacier for the first time by ardito desio desio 1923 desio performed the first length change measurements between 1920 and 1923 documenting a stationarity of the front whose lower margin was already covered by debris and hard to recognize in september 1920 desio produced the first map of the glacier using a compass desio 1923 in 1923 desio reported surface elevation differences due to differential ablation processes in the lower part of the glacier covered by a debris band after these first observations glacier conditions and length changes have been monitored by different observers from 1938 to 1940

serandrei barbero these observations were sparse and discontinuous the observers reported a progressive shrinking of the glacier front a general thinning of the glacier and an increase in debris coverage as can be appreciated from their photos fig 2 the thickness of the debris cover increased with time making it difficult to recognize the lower margin of the glacier already in the first decades of observations in the 1940s the debris thickness at the front was 0 5 m cgi 1914 1977 cgi 1978 2012 roberto degli uomini built independently a unique series of observations consisting of annual photographs taken at the end of the ablation season from 1987 to 2021 these photos are unpublished and have been made available for this study in the last two decades the glacier has been extensively investigated by universities of udine and padova carturan et al 2013 de marco et al 2020 piermattei et al 2015 these studies analysed the glacier s behaviour applying innovative geodetic techniques and documenting conditions of minor imbalance compared to the majority of other alpine glaciers similar investigations carried out at neighbouring ice bodies confirm this peculiarity which is related to the specific glaciers characteristics and to the climatic setting of this geographic area which benefits from a recent increase in solid precipitations colucci et al 2021 3 materials and

balance across different periods and iv corresponding changes in the most relevant meteorological variables the input data used in this study are summarized in table 1 3 1 glacier change analysis 3 1 1 surface cover analysis changes in the areal extent and surface cover of the montasio glacier have been reconstructed and analysed since 1920 using available aerial photographs and maps with the help of oblique terrestrial images taken mostly from the frontal moraine table 1 and fig 2 the aerial photos have been georeferenced using the qgis georeferencing tool based on the coordinates of stable and recognisable ground control points gcps selected on the glacier surroundings from the 2018 als dem table 1 in addition we used field survey notes qualitative observations and descriptions of morphological changes reported in the glaciological campaigns cgi 1914 1977 cgi 1978 2012 field surveys also report length change measurements which however are affected by a high degree of uncertainty since the beginning of observations in the early 1920s it was increasingly difficult to locate the lower margin of the glacier due to the debris coverage in addition there are uncertainties related to the use of different marks by the different observers which could not be solved unambiguously for this reason we avoided analysing length changes which anyway are of minor importance for this glacier recent geophysical investigations indeed have shown that the current lower edge of the glacier lies just 40 m upstream of the little ice age maximum moraine carturan et al 2013 the glacier extent in 1920 was available from the work of carturan et al 2021 the extent in 1948 1986 2006 and 2020 has been mapped outlining the glacier perimeter in the georeferenced aerial photographs table 1 with a planimetric accuracy of about 10 m the lateral and upper edges of the glacier were easy to identify because the debris cover was absent or thin and they clearly stand out from the surrounding terrain the lower edge was more difficult to map and we drew it using the current edge derived from geophysics and the 1920 edge marked by an evident moraine ridge as constrains we assume negligible frontal advance in the analysed period testified by a lack of moraine ridges between the 1920 and the current front positions and positioned the frontal margin in correspondence of breaks of local slope visible in photographs and hillshaded dems of the corresponding years for the same years of glacier extent the surface cover was classified into five main types snow firn ice shallow debris cover and thick debris cover these surface cover types have been mapped by visual recognition in the photographs and with the help of hillshaded dems snow was relatively easy to distinguish from firn due its lighter colour caused by a lower coverage of dust and debris moreover ice without debris cover was rather easy to distinguish from snow and firn because it clearly shows a finely layered structure thick and shallow few centimeters debris cover were distinguished based on their appearance continuous and dry with a lighter colour the first discontinuous darker and wet looking the second 3 1 2 generation of dems elevation changes and geodetic mass balance have been calculated using all data available for generating dems in the period between 1920 and 2020 five dems with pixel size of 1 1 m year 1920 1948 1982 2006 and 2020 have been reconstructed applying different methods based on the type and quality of input data table 1 dem errors have been calculated in comparison to a common reference dem as detailed at the end of this section the 1920 dem derives from the desio s topographic map desio 1923 the map has been georeferenced digitized and converted to a dem using the arcgis software esri usa details on the workflow are reported in carturan et al 2021 the 1948 dem was obtained from four aerial photographs taken on september 19 1948 by the igm italian military geographic institute the photos were scanned using a photogrammetric hardware to avoid distortions during digitization which could negatively affect the photogrammetric pipeline and increase the error of the derived dem sevara 2016 images were processed with the structure from motion sfm algorithm implemented in the metashape software v 1 6 4 build 10928 agisoft llc st petersburg russia to create a dense point cloud 25 points m 2 which was initially georeferenced and scaled using 13 highly recognisable and stable ground control points gcps located outside the glacier 3d coordinates of the gcps had been obtained from the 2018 als survey residual misalignments in the georeferencing were subsequently minimized by applying the iterative closest point icp algorithm implemented in jrc 3d reconstructor software v 4 3 1 gexcel cagliari italy using the 2018 als survey as reference cloud to compute the roto translation transformation only the stable areas outside the glacier have been used the point cloud was then subsampled using the arcgis esri plugin topcat topographic point cloud analysis tool converted to a tin triangular irregular network model and subsequently rasterized to a 1x1 m grid the only cartographic information regarding the montasio glacier between 1948 and 2006 is a topographic map scale 1 5000 surveyed on june 6 1983 which has been georeferenced digitized and converted to a dem unfortunately this date is far from the end of the ablation season and close to the end of the accumulation season due to the high snow accumulation in this geographic area the surface topography in june is normally several metres higher than the underlying glacier surface hiding the true glacier geometry to overcome this issue and try to account for the snow accumulated in the 1982 83 accumulation season we estimated the 1982 83 winter balance by means of a linear regression between available winter balance measurements in the period from 2011 to 2021 and the winter precipitation data from november 1 to april 30 at the pontebba weather station section 3 2 the obtained winter balance was converted to snow depth using the end of winter mean snow density measured in snow pits the snow depth was finally subtracted from the june 1983 surface topography obtaining the 1982 end of summer surface topography of the glacier as we are aware of the limitations of this approach which does not account for the spatial distribution of snow we only used this topography for geodetic mass balance calculations i e we did not analyse the spatial variability of elevation changes we choose to use the 1983 survey even with these limitations because the early 1980 s represent an important climatic shift section 4 2 two dems derived from als surveys commissioned by the civil protection department of the friuli venezia giulia region were available one for 2006 and another one for 2018 the surveys have been performed by the same private company helica srl in 2006 the flight was performed in september 13 using the optech altm 3100 ea at an average flight altitude of 800 m above ground level a g l with the sensor registering up to 4 echoes for each emitted laser pulse and with a vertical uncertainty 0 15 m up to 1200 m a g l the resulting nominal point density was 4 points m 2 the 2018 survey was done in july 23 using a riegl lms q780 at an average flight altitude of 500 m a g l data were acquired with a full waveform acquisition mode achieving a vertical accuracy of 0 02 m at 250 m a g l and obtaining a nominal point density of 18 points m 2 the 2006 point cloud has been used for mass balance calculations whereas the 2018 point cloud has been employed as a reference for georeferencing all the other surveys and for calculating residual errors the 2020 dem was calculated from an ad hoc sfm survey carried out on october 8 2020 with a dji matrice 210v2 quadcopter equipped with a dji x5s camera 20 8 mp 4 3 17 3x13 mm sensor 15 mm focal length a total of 513 nadir and 209 oblique images were collected and then processed using metashape software gcps positions were measured via gnss on the same day and they were used as georeferencing constraints in the photogrammetric pipeline described in cucchiaro et al 2018 the resulting point cloud had a density of 500 points m 2 both 2006 and 2020 point clouds were co registered to the 2018 als cucchiaro et al 2020 and successively subsampled converted to tin and rasterized to dem as described for the 1948 dem all dem errors have been assessed on stable areas outside the glacier mostly over the moraine and in its proximity computing the elevation difference from the 2018 reference dem estimated errors for single pixels range from 0 09 to 4 95 m table 2 the total uncertainty for glacier wide calculations of elevation and volume change depends on the size of the averaging area and the scale of the spatial correlation of elevation differences among the dems rolstad et al 2009 unfortunately it was impossible to obtain reliable statistics i e the spatial correlation function given the insufficient coverage outside the glacier therefore the errors estimated for single pixels represent an upper limit of the errors in glacier wide calculations for the 1920 dem uncertainty assessments were only possible along the 1920 glacier perimeter because the desio s map reports topographic information only inside the glacier an error of 4 94 m could be estimated for this dem however this has to be considered as a rough estimation the only feasible because paraglacial reworking may have affected the deposits along the 1920 glacier margin 3 1 3 elevation change analysis elevation changes have been calculated for each 1 1 m pixel and for different sub periods subtracting pairs of dems the so called calculation of the dem of differences dods the area of interest for each comparison has been set equal to the merged area between the initial and final extent of the glacier in the analysed period the dods enabled the analysis of the spatial variability of elevation changes and of their annual rates for the 1948 1982 and 1982 2006 sub periods however we only calculated the total elevation difference used in mass balance calculations and did not attempt to map or analyse its spatial distribution due to the limitations of the 1982 dem described in section 3 1 2 3 1 4 mass balance calculation geodetic mass balance for different sub periods have been derived from the calculated dods section 3 1 3 total volume changes calculated over the merged initial final area of the glacier have been converted to water equivalent using a mean density of 850 kg m 3 huss 2013 sapiano et al 1998 to obtain the average annual mass balance rate the obtained value was divided by the mean glacier area half sum of the initial and final area and by the time interval in years the residual errors in dems construction detailed in section 3 1 2 translate to an error in geodetic annual mass balance rates ranging from 0 01 m w e y 1 for the 2006 2020 mass balance period to 0 16 m w e y 1 for the 1982 2006 mass balance period table 3 3 2 analysis of meteorological data meteorological data series of daily air temperature and precipitation from 1927 to 2020 are analysed in this work this analysis enabled us to detect possible long term trends in meteorological conditions and to relate them to the evolution of the montasio glacier in the last century the series analysed in this paper is an extension of the data of the pontebba weather station 568 m a s l 12 km from the glacier presented in de marco et al 2020 which spans the period from 1961 to 2020 this weather station was selected due to its relative proximity to the glacier the high quality of air temperature and precipitation series and the length of meteorological records data prior to 1961 have been taken from baldassi 2010 who performed quality checking homogenization and gap filling to the meteorological data in the period from 1927 to 1961 the temperature series was extrapolated at the montasio glacier mean elevation 1910 m a s l using monthly vertical gradients calculated over the period from 1999 to 2010 between the pontebba and lussari 1760 m a s l weather stations the resulting temperature was used for discriminating between liquid and solid precipitation at the glacier s elevation using a daily threshold temperature of 2 c de marco et al 2020 in this way it was possible to estimate the nivometric coefficient fraction of solid precipitation at the glacier s mean elevation and its variability in the last century we avoided extrapolating precipitation data at the glacier s elevation because the study area is affected by large horizontal and vertical gradients in precipitation which are difficult to calculate due to the lack of reliable precipitation data at high elevation schwarb 2000 for this reason we preferred quality checked precipitation data at low altitude to extrapolations subject to high uncertainty assuming negligible effects from precipitation gradients in long term meteorological trends air temperature precipitation and nivometric coefficients have been analysed separately for the ablation and the accumulation seasons may to october and november to april respectively trends and break points were assessed using non parametric tests for annual and seasonal data of temperature and precipitation solid liquid and total the mann kendall test was used to establish whether a trend exists in the time series afterwards the presence of break points and their positions were assessed using the pettitt s test emmanuel et al 2019 finally the occurrence of multiple break points was verified based on the bic test bayesian information criterion implemented in the strucchange r package r core team 2021 descriptive statistics have been calculated for each meteorological series and for sub periods detected by the break point analysis see chapter 4 2 4 results 4 1 glacier changes analysis 4 1 1 elevation changes and mass balance the montasio glacier underwent a thinning of 27 75 m 5 32 m on average between 1920 and 2020 table 3 forty nine percent of the total thinning occurred before 1948 another 18 by 1982 an additional 31 by 2006 and only 2 after 2006 the available dems show continuous thinning even though short periods of temporary thickening cannot be excluded due to the time distance among dems thinning rates were largest between 1920 and 1948 with an average value of 0 52 m y 1 and a mass balance rate of 0 49 0 13 m w e y 1 in the period between 1948 and 1982 the surface lowered more slowly in comparison with the previous time interval with a mean thinning rate of 0 16 m y 1 and a mass balance of 0 14 0 11 m w e y 1 rates of lowering and mass loss increased substantially afterwards reaching 0 39 m y 1 and 0 36 0 16 m w e y 1 respectively in the period from 1982 to 2006 the last period showed the lowest thinning rates with a mean value of 0 04 m y 1 in the period from 2006 to 2020 and a mass balance of 0 03 0 01 m w e y 1 which was closer to equilibrium the spatial patterns of elevation changes show that the largest cumulated thinning between 1920 and 2020 occurred in the upper part and in the orographic right portions of the glacier locally exceeding 40 m fig 3 in comparison the lower part of the glacier underwent smaller thinning comprised between 10 and 30 m the different behaviour of the upper and lower glacier portions is more evident after 1948 whereas before 1948 the thinning rates of the two parts showed higher similarity after 2006 thickening prevailed in the upper part while the lower part continued thinning with a rate that is comparable to the period between 1948 and 2006 fig 4 4 1 2 changes in surface cover types the surface cover analysis shown in fig 5 highlights a significant increase in debris cover on the montasio glacier during the last century in 1920 as reported by ardito desio 1923 the surface was almost free from debris except for the lower margin and for the top of the glacier where there was a shallow debris cover by 1948 the glacier thinned considerably and became mostly covered by debris as can be appreciated from various terrestrial photos taken by observers in the 1940s these images show the top of the glacier almost free from debris the middle part with discontinuous and shallow debris cover over stratified glacier ice fig 2a and b and the lower part covered by thick debris and with a complex surface morphology due to differential ablation similar to hummocky moraine terrain unfortunately the 1948 aerial photo only shows the lowermost part of the glacier due to a widespread snow cover terrestrial photos taken in the 1950s and 1960s and field reports from the 1970s document the existence of several layers of snow and firn from different years covering most of the glacier the new firn layers covered a large fraction of the debris covered area whose spatial extent decreased significantly and was limited to the lower portion the surface cover analysis for 1986 fig 5 depicts the glacier at the end of this period which was rather favorable for glacier preservation as can be seen in 1986 the glacier surface was still covered by snow firn and stratified glacier ice in the middle and upper areas whereas the debris cover was confined to the lower part crevasses were clearly visible in the upper area until the 1980s by 2000 the glacier was completely buried under a thick debris mantle except for the top of the avalanche cone where very small patches of snow firn and glacier ice were still visible during the 1990s and the early 2000s the glacier has been repeatedly affected by flooding events some of which were of large magnitude chiarle et al 2007 which left clear traces of glacial fluvial reworking debris flows on the glacier surface and surrounding deposits fig 2h and i in the last years the most significant changes occurred in the upper part with the alternation of periods with snow and firn cover expansion 2009 2011 2013 2014 and periods of rapid snow and firn depletion 2012 2015 2019 leading to a new rapid increase in the debris cover after the 1980 s only few transverse crevasses were visible and were limited to the top of the glacier nevertheless recent investigations have shown that the glacier still preserves surface dynamics and has mean displacement rates of 0 2 m y 1 in the lower part de marco et al 2020 geophysical investigations carried out in 2010 showed that the thickness of the debris cover in the lower half of the glacier is of 2 3 m carturan et al 2013 the hummocky moraine morphology observed in the 1940 s in this area has been completely replaced by glacial fluvial reworking debris flows although some hollows typical of hummocky terrain are still present carturan et al 2013 4 2 change in climatic conditions the breakpoint analysis applied to the meteorological data series available from 1927 to 2020 revealed significant breakpoints for air temperature and consequently in some cases for nivometric coefficient nc and solid precipitations fig 6 no breakpoints were detected in the time series of total precipitation for the accumulation and ablation seasons total annual precipitation and solid precipitation in the accumulation season linear trends were also non existent or without statistical significance for these variables temperature breakpoints occurred for both accumulation and ablation seasons in the 1980 s fig 6a in the accumulation season one break point was identified in 1987 that separates a first subperiod without trend followed by another subperiod with a positive and significant trend 0 052 c y 1 p 0 05 a break point in the ablation season temperature series was detected 6 years earlier in 1981 preceded by a slightly negative trend 0 012 c y 1 p 0 05 and followed by a positive trend 0 040 c y 1 p 0 001 the air temperature in the accumulation season averaged 4 62 0 89 c before 1987 and 2 66 0 92 c afterwards in the ablation season it increased from a mean value of 5 72 0 75 c before 1981 to 7 62 0 69 c afterwards before 1970 the nc in the accumulation season did not show a significant trend while after 1970 the nc started to decrease decreasing fraction of solid precipitation with a rate of 0 35 y 1 p 0 001 after 1995 the nc in the accumulation season consistently deviated from 100 highlighting an increasing fraction of liquid precipitation regarding the ablation season no significant trends were found before and after the break point in 1984 but the two subperiods were characterised by different mean values 32 12 and 17 9 respectively which highlight a substantial halving of solid precipitation during summer indeed the analysis of solid precipitation in the ablation season detected a decrease in mean values from 328 128 mm before a break point in 1987 to 171 98 mm after it fig 7 plots time series of air temperature and total precipitation anomalies compared to the 1927 2020 means in the first period of highly negative mass balance between 1920 and 1948 the most relevant anomaly was for total precipitation in the accumulation season which shows a long period from 1937 to 1947 with low snow accumulation this is the driest decade in the entire series temperature anomalies were of lower significance although the dry period was associated with increasing air temperature in the period of slightly negative mass balance between 1948 and 1982 there was an evident decrease in air temperature especially in the ablation season total precipitation in the accumulation season came back to average or slightly above average values with smaller inter annual variability and a small tendency to increase between the late 1950 s and the 1980 s after a dry period in the first half of the 1950 s starting in the 1980 s there was a visible warming which is still going on the precipitation in the accumulation season was mostly below average from the late 1980 s to the early 2000 s with increasing inter annual variability accumulation came back to the long term average after 2008 with snow rich winters in 2009 2014 and 2020 overall the average annual balance in the four subperiods looks strongly correlated with winter precipitation anomalies in the same periods inset scatterplots in fig 7 these results confirm at the secular timescale the findings obtained for the last two decades de marco et al 2020 which highlight a far higher sensitivity of this glacier to snow accumulation compared to summer air temperature 5 discussion 5 1 peculiarities of the montasio glacier the peculiar behaviour and climatic response of the montasio glacier has been analysed in detail by recent investigations carturan et al 2013 de marco et al 2020 whose main results highlight i a low response to regional air temperature variability ii a high response to regional snow accumulation variability iii a normal relationship between mass balance and elevation in years with positive mass balance i e net accumulation in the upper part and net ablation in the lower part iv inverted mass balance gradient in years with negative mass balance i e lower mass balance in the upper part free from debris v high mass balance sensitivity after years with positive mass balance expansion of the firn area which is free from debris vi low mass balance sensitivity after years with negative mass balance expansion of the debris covered area these dynamics have been investigated with a quantitative approach and high spatial and time resolution for the most recent years whereas longer term effects were only hypothesized in this work we report major variations in the surface conditions and climatic response of the glacier across a much longer period the integrated analysis of mass balance surface cover and meteorological data enabled a good description of glacier variations and dynamics in the last century 1920 2020 this analysis shows an overall trend towards decreasing imbalance and decreasing mass balance sensitivity for the montasio glacier although snowy winters can explain some positive mass balances in recent years fig 7 the current behaviour of this glacier is mostly associated with debris cover dynamics over multi decadal time scales fig 5 debris supply is ensured by the continuous action of cryo clastism avalanches and rock falls and is abundant in comparison to glacier transportation efficiency due to the high ratio between the area of debris providing rock walls and the glacier area haeberli 1986 zemp et al 2005 debris evacuation by glacier transport outside the lia and 1920 s moraines has become negligible since the first decades of the 20th century and these moraines have a damming effect on debris transported by glaciofluvial processes the resulting increase in area and thickness of the debris mantle is an important negative feedback that is contributing to the preservation of the montasio glacier 5 2 mass balance evolution and morphological changes in the last century the mass balance of the glacier has been characterized by four major phases rapid mass loss until the 1940 s conditions close to balanced budget until the 1980 s rapid mass loss but slower than in the 1930 s and 1940 s in the 1990 s and early 2000 s and balanced budget conditions afterwards this behaviour is similar to most alpine glaciers until the 1980 s however it tends to diverge from the majority of alpine glaciers starting in the 1990 s showing decreased imbalance and mass balance sensitivity the fig 8 compares the cumulated geodetic mass balance of the montasio glacier with the mean of all glaciers in the european alps that have geodetic balance measurements in the same period wgms 2021 the two series and their cumulated difference fig 8b and 8c clearly highlight a higher balance sensitivity of the montasio glacier between the 1920 s and the 1940 s and a transition to a lower climatic sensitivity afterwards the cumulated difference line reverses its slope after 1948 and becomes much steeper after 2006 suggesting a further decrease in the climatic sensitivity of the montasio glacier compared to other monitored glaciers in the alps the mass loss of montasio glacier is not associated with active retreat which is the response of glaciers that keep their uppermost part and loose lower portions of the ablation area indeed the montasio glacier experienced small areal changes in the last decades and its front lies in close proximity to the lia moraines carturan et al 2013 this behaviour might suggest a sort of stationary thinning or downwasting bolch et al 2008 pellicciotti et al 2015 however montasio does not experience the positive feedbacks elevation feedback due to surface lowering decreased cooling effect and increasing thermal emission from the surrounding deglaciated terrain over disintegrating glaciers that speed up deglaciation in other cases carturan et al 2020 paul et al 2007 pelto 2010 indeed the montasio glacier did not separate into smaller ice bodies and it underwent only 28 m average thinning which translates into only 0 2 c of warming considering an average temperature lapse rate of 0 65 c 100 m the stationary thinning of the montasio glacier is instead associated to negative feedbacks brought by i increasing debris cover extent and thickness ii avalanche snow concentration over a smaller glacier and iii increasing shadowing by the surrounding terrain due to the glacier retreat and the lowering of its surface figure 12 in carturan et al 2013 the first process is dominant in the lower half of the glacier whereas in the upper part there is a prevalence of effects from avalanche concentration and increased shadowing this glacier shows substantial differences in comparison with larger valley type debris covered glaciers which are more often studied in spite of their widespread debris cover which should limit melt valley type debris covered glaciers often display elevation change rates similar to debris free glaciers gardelle et al 2013 this phenomenon is referred to as the debris cover anomaly pellicciotti et al 2015 and can be explained largely by glacier dynamics low emergence velocities over stagnant ablation tongues associated with local enhancing of melt due to the formation of ice cliffs and water ponds rounce et al 2021 the different behaviour of the montasio glacier can be explained by the thickness of its debris cover which is 2 3 m compared to a mean debris thickness estimate of 0 35 m for valley glaciers rounce et al 2021 the thick debris mantle of the montasio glacier prevents the formation of ice cliffs and significant emergence velocities likely persist in the ablation area due to the steepness and proximity of the accumulation area useful comparisons can be made also with glaciers of similar size but lacking debris coverage the mean annual balance of all very small glaciers measured in central europe according to the latest world glacier monitoring service database wgms 2021 passed from 0 78 m w e y 1 between 1982 and 2006 to 1 11 m w e y 1 between 2006 and 2020 these results confirm the specific behaviour of the montasio glacier which passed from 0 36 m w e y 1 to 0 03 m w e y 1 in the same periods the high mass loss of montasio glacier in the period from 1920 to 1948 represents 49 of the total mass loss in a century and can be explained by very low snow accumulation in the decade after 1936 based on meteorological data series moreover the debris coverage was still limited to the lower ablation area and was relatively thin up to 50 cm at the lower margin of the glacier the spatial pattern of surface lowering fig 3 is clearly related to the spatial extent and thickness of debris cover as visible in the photos of the above mentioned period indeed the highest losses occurred in the upper part and in the eastern ablation area where the debris cover was absent or thin and discontinuous the middle and western ablation areas were already covered by thick debris as can be assessed by differential ablation phenomena reported by observers and visible in the photos which protected the underlying ice from ablation the eastern ablation area was and remains the most active of the glacier due to a depression in the bedrock carturan et al 2013 favourable meteorological conditions in the following decades especially between the 1960 s and early 1980 s led to a preservation of the glacier associated with an expansion of the debris free area and a contraction of the debris covered area this however set up conditions of higher vulnerability when meteorological conditions become unfavourable starting in the late 1980 s because the debris free area is prone to rapid mass loss in periods with low snow accumulation and or high summer temperature de marco et al 2020 after a period of rapid mass loss however the areal extent and thickness of the debris cover become so large that it gradually offset a potential increase of ablation due to rising temperatures currently the glacier behaves as a nearly stagnant ice mass covered by a thick mantle of debris which reactivates following snowy winters probably the active part of the glacier has to be considered its upper and steeper half which completely rebuilds after snow rich winters and undergoes rapid thinning and burial by debris in periods with scarce snowfalls fig 2 this part for example underwent negligible change in thickness between the 1940 s and the 1980 s fig 2a 2e 2f rapidly collapsed in the 1990 s fig 2f and 2 h and quickly rebuilt with the increase in winter accumulation after 2008 fig 2h and 2 l a comparison is possible with other ice bodies in the julian alps especially with the canin east glacieret which are located within 10 km from the montasio glacier several works highlight similar behaviours with positive mass balance in recent years and even mass rebuilt influenced mainly by winter precipitations colucci et al 2021 colucci and guglielmin 2015 the climatic causes are the same recent snowy winters however montasio and canin glaciers are very different the latter is indeed without debris cover and therefore it is expected to have higher climatic sensitivity and to disappear completely without abundant snowfalls 5 3 expected glacier evolution based on collected evidence and current trends in meteorological variables it is possible to outline a plausible evolution for the montasio glacier and other similar ice bodies in the next few decades the increasing temperature is leading to a decrease in the solid fraction of precipitation not only in the ablation season but also in the accumulation season section 4 2 fig 6b the latter tends to become shorter whereas the former tends to expand warmer temperature causes also permafrost degradation and this could be linked with an increase in rock fall activity from the rock walls above the glacier where the permafrost map published by boeckli et al 2012 indicates the possible presence of permafrost above 2400 m a s l thanks to a likely increase in the coverage and thickness of the debris cover the montasio glacier is not expected to disappear soon even with a decrease in snow accumulation however it is expected to become progressively less active if the warming continues a transition to a rock glacier or a glacial permafrost composite landforms seppi et al 2019 seppi et al 2015 cannot be completely ruled out nevertheless in our opinion this occurrence is unlikely in the near future because in the glacier area the conditions are unfavourable for permafrost the boeckli et al 2012 map plots permafrost only in very favourable conditions there considering the low elevation of the glacier almost entirely below 2000 m only open work deposits could enable the presence or formation of sporadic permafrost and a possible shift from glacial towards periglacial conditioning the current grain size distribution with considerable infill of fine debris between blocks and the surface morphology of the debris covered area and proglacial deposits complete lack of morphological features typical of active rock glaciers lead us to exclude the presence of permafrost in the glacier area and the impending transition to permafrost related landforms geophysical investigations carried out in late summer of 2010 highlighted massive glacier ice under the debris cover but no frozen sediments carturan et al 2013 the sediment budget is currently positive thanks to the damming effect of moraine deposits in front of the glacier further thinning from ice melt is expected to increase the maximum volume of debris that can accumulate upstream of these deposits only fluvial or glacio fluvial processes can erode substantial amounts of debris recent investigations have shown that high magnitude flooding events can rework and even erode large amounts of debris from the glacier area through the lateral breaches of the lia moraine chiarle et al 2007 in case of increased frequency of these extreme events sediment dynamics will possibly change in the future and lead to a more efficient removal of debris from the glacier area with adverse consequences for the preservation of the residual ice body 6 conclusions this work presents a reconstruction of the behaviour of the montasio glacier during the last 100 years the reconstruction is based on a comprehensive collection of data which have been processed to derive series of elevation change geodetic balance rate and surface cover change from 1920 to 2020 the results show a consistency with the behaviour of most alpine glaciers until the 1990 s and a clear decoupling in the 2000 s in fact most of the mass losses occurred between 1920 and 1948 49 of the total mass loss followed by nearly balance budget condition until the 1980 s 18 of the total mass loss the high melt rate observed in the first decades was associated with negative anomalies in snow accumulation in particular between the late 1930 s and the early 1940 s while relatively favourable conditions characterised the period between 1960 s and 1980 s a new phase of rapid mass loss occurred between the 1980 s and the 1990 s when temperature started increasing sharply however in the last two decades the glacier entered a new phase close to balanced budget conditions in spite of sustained atmospheric warming this behaviour is clearly decoupled from the regional temperature fluctuations and from the behaviour of alpine glaciers with similar monitoring series even if the glacier experienced recent winters with abundant snow accumulation the main causes of this progressive decrease in climatic sensitivity have to be looked for in negative feedbacks which offset potential increased melt due to warmer temperature in particular starting in the 1940 s the glacier became increasingly covered by a thick layer of debris in the ablation area which strongly limits ablation the role of the thick debris cover was already acknowledged by previous investigations on this glacier but this work documents for the first time the debris cover dynamics in the long term in addition the glacier has a lower sensitivity to air temperature fluctuations compared to precipitation variability because it is mainly fed by avalanches for these reasons it is important to avoid generalizations on regional glacier balance and inferences on climatic trends when analysing the behaviour of glaciers with characteristics similar to the montasio glacier these glaciers are common in high relief mountain areas of the world but may have singular climatic response governed by specific negative feedbacks as demonstrated by this work in case of further atmospheric warming the accumulation seasons are expected to become shorter and less snowy on the montasio glacier with concomitant longer and warmer ablation seasons this could also lead to permafrost degradation in the surrounding rock walls potentially increasing rock fall activity and debris supply for these reasons a further increase in the spatial coverage and thickness of debris is likely and therefore the glacier will not disappear in the near future unlike other similar ice bodies in the alps however the montasio glacier is not expected to evolve into a rock glacier or a glacial permafrost composite landform due to the low elevation and lack of conditions favourable to permafrost funding this study was carried

2669,damming alters the biogeochemical cycling of carbon along river systems however the effects of river damming on the fate and transport of particulate and dissolved inorganic carbon pic and dic remain unclear here we use dual isotope 13c and 14c compositions water chemistry and electron microscopy to unravel the processes controlling the in reservoir cycling of inorganic carbon in a river reservoir system of a karst region of southwest china from the reservoir s fluvial to lentic zone δ13cpic decreases from 2 2 to 7 6 whereas the pic radiocarbon age drops from 11 512 to 2 027 years b p electron microscopy images and water chemistry provide further evidence of in reservoir photosynthesis induced carbonate precipitation of autochthonous pic in the water column although part of pic is dissolved into dic in the reservoir s hypolimnion the contribution of carbonate minerals allochthonous pic accounted for 41 of pic based on an isotopic mass balance model this indicates that the precipitation rate of autochthonous pic was greater part of carbon cycle in the reservoir moreover the autochthonous pic accounted for 61 of the pic and its dissolution accounted for 50 of the dic and the high co2 efflux in the water discharging from the reservoir the results shed light on the important role of autochthonous pic in carbon cycling in karst river reservoir systems with continued dam construction in karst areas the role of in reservoir pic production and dissolution on the riverine carbon cycle deserves more attention keywords river damming karst reservoir inorganic carbon carbon isotopes δ14c carbon cycle data availability we have shared in the supplemental information 1 introduction rivers are important conduits connecting terrestrial and aquatic systems they are estimated to transport 1 pg carbon to the ocean each year with around 60 in the form of inorganic carbon bauer et al 2013 meybeck 1982 more often than not they also emit co2 to the atmosphere due to degassing of dissolved inorganic carbon dic butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 more than 70 of the world s large rivers have been dammed grill et al 2019 which has severely fragmented river systems and modified their hydrology and biogeochemical functions maavara et al 2020b tranvik et al 2009 zarfl et al 2015 by damming a river the hydraulic retention time hrt increases and a portion of the upstream natural riverine system with continuous flow and a low hrt turns into a river reservoir ecosystem abril et al 2003 philippe and taylor 2016 st louis et al 2000 zeng et al 2022 river reservoir systems often exhibit three longitudinal zones with from upstream to downstream the fluvial intermediate and lentic zone each with distinct biogeochemical and hydrological characteristics soares et al 2012 thornton et al 1990 as water flow rates decrease from the fluvial zone to the intermediate lentic zone suspended particles settle out hence enhancing water transparency the reservoir gradually develops into a more lentic environment where the longer hrt further promotes sediment deposition and algal growth grumbine and pandit 2013 maavara et al 2020a xu et al 2018 karst areas account for 10 15 of the global continental surface area ford and williams 2007 karst areas represent an atmospheric co2 sink due to carbonate rock weathering gaillardet et al 2019 however rivers in karst regions may reduce the weathering co2 sink by instream inorganic carbon ic cycling for example by releasing co2 during the precipitation of autochthonous particulate inorganic carbon pic minerals and the degassing of co2 from oversaturated river water curl 2012 liu et al 2018 there have been a number of recent studies on carbon cycling in karst river reservoir systems which have identified that the primary controls on dic particle organic carbon poc and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations are primary production i e photosynthesis organic matter om mineralization and co2 degassing crawford et al 2016 han et al 2017 li et al 2018 pu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however few studies have measured pic distributions in river reservoir systems to determine the in reservoir cycling between dic and pic and the impact on riverine carbon fluxes and speciation as pic dic poc doc as well as implications for co2 exchanges with the atmosphere in a recent study pic dissolution was estimated to be responsible for 17 6 of the dic measured in the changjiang yangtze river wang et al 2016 most studies found karst rivers to be net sources of co2 to the atmosphere because their co2 partial pressure pco2 values exceed atmospheric pco2 liu and han 2020 ulloacedamanos et al 2020 van geldern et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 although the co2 effluxes from karst rivers may be lower than from rivers draining other lithologies khadka et al 2014 in general the alteration of inorganic carbon cycling along karst rivers by damming remains poorly characterized stable carbon isotope values δ13c have been widely used in studies of river reservoir and lake systems to delineate the sources that control inorganic carbon concentrations in aquatic systems de montety et al 2011 maberly et al 2012 morales williams et al 2020 qin et al 2019 the main dic sources that are typically identified with isotope mixing models are atmospheric co2 dissolution production by om mineralization and production by carbonate or silicate rock weathering wang et al 2016 however the ability of δ13c to trace carbon transformation reactions and transport processes is limited by the uncertainties associated with the selection of the end member isotope compositions in part because these isotope compositions tend to overlap and because of the variations in the isotope fractionations of processes such as photosynthesis and co2 degassing campeau et al 2017 ishikawa et al 2016 yi et al 2021 radiocarbon 14c measurements offer a complimentary tool for estimating carbon sources because they are not affected by fractionation marwick et al 2015 mayorga et al 2005 by combining stable and radiocarbon isotopes the mixing of end member sources can be more accurately estimated in inland waters raymond et al 2004 zeng et al 2011 zhong et al 2021 the wujiang river is located in the center of the southeast asia karst region the largest karst area in the world han et al 2010 the physical and chemical weathering of the karst contributes high pic and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations to the rivers draining them qin et al 2019 qin et al 2022 over the last half century at least 1086 dams have been built in the watershed of the wujiang river yang et al 2019 and as a result sediment transport along the river decreased by 92 from 1956 to 2017 due to sediment accumulation behind the dams cwrc 2017 however the impact of river damming on carbon especially ic cycling in karst rivers is still not fully understood in particular the changes in carbon speciation and fluxes and the processes contributing to these changes through the large river reservoir system has been poorly explored so far this is not conducive to assessing the effect of damming on the regional and global carbon cycle here we assess the biogeochemical processes controlling the spatial trends of pic and dic concentrations and by extension those of the partial pressure and efflux of co2 throughout a karst river reservoir system combining dual carbon isotopes δ14c δ13c electron microscopy observations and geochemical and biophysical measurements at the first time the hypothesis driving this work is that compared to the natural river corridor damming intensifies the impact of inorganic carbon reaction processes because of the increased hrt in the reservoir in particular we compare the geochemical differences between the fluvial intermediate and lentic zones of the reservoir system and for the lentic zone also the differences between the surface and deeper waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling procedure the wujiang river forms part of the southern tributary system of the changjiang river it is located in the center of the largest karst area in the world fig 1 hongjiadu reservoir is the main reservoir in the upper reach of the wujiang river and exhibits seasonal stratification wang et al 2020 to stabilize power generation by the downstream cascade reservoirs hongjiadu reservoir operates on an anti seasonal flow regulation that is the water level behind the dam is highest during the winter dry season and lowest during the summer wet season the reservoir water storage levels and discharge fluctuations over a year are illustrated in fig s1 the ten sampling sites along the reservoir are shown in fig 1 sites w1 and w2 are in the reservoir s fluvial zone sites w3 and w4 experience periodic stratification and are considered representative on the intermediate zone wang et al 2021 sites w6 to w9 are in the lentic zone

same time dic decreased from 155 1 to 96 4 mg l 37 8 ca2 from 63 9 to 43 4 mg l 32 1 tds from 256 5 to 213 6 mg l 16 7 pco2 from 1945 5 to 754 9 μatm 61 2 and f co2 from 147 8 to 32 5 mmol m2 d 78 fig 2 most surface water geochemical variables showed relatively little change between the intermediate and lentic zones by contrast significant differences were observed as a function of depth in the lentic zone of the reservoir with increasing depth wt decreased from 27 7 to 11 5 58 the concentrations of pic 33 2 10 2 µg l chl a 1 0 0 9 μg l do 9 2 1 5 mg l and ph 8 2 0 1 were highest in the epilimnion 0 5 5 m while the concentrations of dic 146 5 9 5 mg l and ca2 64 4 3 1 mg l were highest in the hypolimnion 45 80 m fig 3 the water chemistry of the water downstream of the dam w10 was similar to that of the hypolimnion although the pic 11 7 μg l and do 5 4 mg l concentrations were markedly higher the f co2 value at site w10 477 0 mmol m2 d was higher than estimated anywhere else along the hongjiadu reservoir 3 2 δ13c and δ14c of inorganic carbon spatial trends from the fluvial to the lentic zones surface water δ13cpic decreased from 2 1 to 4 4 and δ13cdic increased from 9 7 to 3 1 fig 2 and table s1 the highest δ13cdic 0 7 was observed at site w4 in the intermediate zone thus the transition from the fluvial to intermediate zone was accompanied by an increase of δ13cdic by 9 site w4 also exhibited the lowest measured δ13cpic value 6 1 the δ14cpic 789 and δ14cdic 205 values were lowest in the fluvial zone fig 3 from the fluvial to the intermediate zone surface water δ14cpic increased from 789 to 151 423 and δ14cdic from 205 to 132 55 fig 2 and table s1 in the lentic zone δ13cpic δ14cpic δ13cdic and δ14cdic all decreased with increasing water depth fig 3 the depth trends however showed clear differences after an initial sharp drop in the upper part of the thermocline the δ13cdic values stabilized at 9 4 0 2 below 15 m fig 3 by contrast the δ14cdic and δ14cpic values decreased throughout the depth profile reaching values at the deepest water depth of 188 and 233 respectively the pic in the top sediment 0 2 cm of the lentic zone sediment had a δ14c value of 490 while this value was lower than those measured in the overlying water it was still significantly higher than for pic in the fluvial zone 789 to 730 table s1 the δ13cpic 4 6 and δ13cdic 9 2 values of water below the dam were close to those found in the thermocline and hypolimnion of the lentic zone however the δ14cpic 309 and δ14cdic 191 were markedly lower 3 3 scanning electron microscopy the sem images of pic particles show distinct morphological changes during the transitions from the fluvial to intermediate to lentic zone in the fluvial zone relatively large rhombohedral crystals could be observed indicative of karst derived material produced by physical weathering fig s2a the pic particles collected from the surface waters of the intermediate and lentic zones showed platelets and bundles likely representative of in situ precipitation fig s2b with increasing water depth in the lentic zone as well as in the water collected downstream of the dam the crystal surfaces showed evidence of corrosion features fig s2c e 3 4 pls modeling the pls analysis implied that ph and wt were the two most important parameters i e with variable importance in projection vip 1 controlling dic and ca2 concentrations table s2 when the ca2 ph ratio is plotted versus dic t where t is wt in degrees a strong non linear logarithmic relationship emerged fig s3c r2 0 94 a trend also observed when considering data from other karst rivers and reservoirs fig s3d r2 0 72 thus as dic t increases ca2 ph decreases pls analysis suggests that the plot of ca2 ph vs dic t can help to decipher the processes of carbon transport and transformation across the river reservoir system however it should be noted that there is no chemical stoichiometric interpretation of the plot of ca2 ph vs dic t 3 5 isotope mass balance modeling according to the mass balance model text s3 and table s3 atmospheric co2 carbonate rock weathering and organic matter om mineralization contributed 61 14 and 25 to the isotopic composition of dic in the fluvial zone respectively the relative contributions of atmospheric co2 to the surface water dic isotope composition were higher in the intermediate and lentic zones 69 and 71 respectively the relative contribution of karst carbonate minerals allochthonous pic accounted for 55 and 9 of pic in the intermediate and lentic zones respectively compared to 100 in the fluvial zone in the lentic zone surface water most of the pic originated from in situ precipitation in the lentic zone s hypolimnion the pic isotope composition was a mixture of 85 of pic originating from the epilimnion i e the autochthonous pic and 15 from the allochthonous pic the dic isotope composition in the lentic zone s hypolimnion could be accounted for by autochthonous pic dissolution 49 om respiration 19 and atmospheric co2 24 in dam outflow water the relative contributions of autochthonous pic precipitation and dissolution to the pic and dic isotope compositions were 67 and 49 respectively the carbon isotope fractionation may influence our computational results campeau et al 2017 zhong et al 2021 to avoid this kind of error the calculation for the contribution of each potential pic source we only used δ14c text s3 for the source calculation of dic we also only used δ14c in the epilimnion of the intermediate and lentic area which there are many significant biological processes in these areas 4 discussion 4 1 photosynthesis induced pic precipitation in hongjiadu reservoir the ratio of photosynthetic primary production to ecosystem respiration typically increases as water velocity decreases and water temperature wt increases in reservoirs philippe and taylor 2016 ran et al 2012 the geochemical changes observed in the hongjiadu river reservoir system are consistent with an increase from the fluvial to the lentic zone of the relative contribution of photosynthesis induced calcium carbonate mineral precipitation liu et al 2018 sironić et al 2017 this is most obvious in the trends of ph chl a dic ca2 and δ13cdic to better evaluate the potential sources of pic and dic in the hongjiadu river reservoir system we plot 13c vs 14c for the pic and dic samples fig 4 the preferential fixation of the 12c isotope during photosynthesis enriches the water in the heavier isotope as seen by the sharp increase δ13cdic δ14cdic and δ14cpic between the fluvial and intermediate zones fig 4 increased activity of phytoplankton is further evidenced by the higher chl a concentrations in the intermediate and lentic surface waters de montety et al 2011 hodell et al 1998 wang et al 2020 the removal of dic as co2 aq and hco3 from the surface water by photosynthesis consumes h and raises the ph the high ph 8 5 creates conditions favorable to the precipitation of calcium carbonate which explains the decrease of the aqueous ca2 concentrations from the fluvial to lentic zone as well as the strong linear correlation of the differences in dic δdic and ca2 concentrations δca2 of surface water samples from the intermediate and lentic zones relative to the dic and ca2 concentrations in the fluvial zone fig s3a r2 0 97 the fact that the pls regression analysis identifies wt and ph as the main variables explaining the variations in pic and dic concentrations table s2 further support active in reservoir pic formation temperature and ph are key parameters controlling the thermodynamics and kinetics of calcium carbonate precipitation from solution morse et al 2007 as temperature increases the solubility of calcite decreases hence making precipitation more favorable and responsible for the low dic pic ratio along the water column fig 5 the removal of co2 and concomitant increase of ph by photosynthesis similarly promotes the precipitation of caco3 by increasing the abundance of co3 2 in the dissolved carbonate pool liu et al 2018 pu et al 2020 sironić et al 2017 wolthers et al 2012 it should be noted that temperature also influences other processes affecting inorganic carbon cycling in aquatic systems including the rates of photosynthesis mineral dissolution and other abiotic and microbial processes de montety et al 2011 gaillardet et al 2019 lauerwald et al 2013 sironić et al 2017 overall the major geochemical trends along the reservoir are captured by the following two reactions liu et al 2018 rupp and adams 1981 1 caco3 h2o co2 ca2 2hco3 2 ca2 2hco3 x co2 h2o caco3 1 x ch2o o2 where ch2o is a simplified representation of algal biomass produced during photosynthesis reaction 1 illustrates the chemical weathering of calcium carbonate minerals that in karst regions delivers high amounts of aqueous ca2 and dic to the river network reaction 2 illustrates the removal of ca2 and dic from the epilimnion of the receiving reservoir as a result of photosynthesis and the concomitant production of autochthonous caco3 because of isotopic equilibration between surface water dic and atmospheric co2 the in reservoir carbonate mineral precipitation adds young autochthonous caco3 to the background of old karst derived allochthonous pic fig 4 this then explains the large drop in the pic radiocarbon age in the lentic and intermediate zones compared to the fluvial zone fig 2 it also explains the morphological differences in pic observed by sem including the close association between caco3 precipitates and cell like structures in the surface water samples of the reservoir fig s2 moreover the relative contribution of autochthonous pic accounted for 91 85 and 41 of pic in the lentic epilimnion hypolimnion and surface sediments respectively the results suggest that the precipitation rate of autochthonous pic was greater than its dissolution rate in the intermediate and lentic zones of the hongjiadu reservoir our results hint that there is potential large carbon sink contributed by dic pic transformation processes in the karst river reservoir system which will need to be considered in global carbon models 4 2 below the epilimnion of the lentic zone om degradation and pic dissolution at the time of sampling the lentic zone exhibited a stable thermal stratification fig 3a which in reservoirs is facilitated by the longer hrt and greater water depth compared to the upstream free flowing rivers elçi 2008 han et al 2017 the very different geochemical environment of the hypolimnion compared to that of the surface waters leads to further biogeochemical carbon processing three different processes account for the depth dependent changes in the water chemistry and carbon isotopic compositions in the lentic zone 1 net aerobic respiration of om below the epilimnion 2 dissolution of pic both allochthonous pic and that supplied through sedimentation of newly produced pic i e autochthonous pic from the epilimnion and 3 gravitational circulation where colder inflowing river water dives under the warmer less dense and surface water of the reservoir below we analyze these three possibilities the do profile of the lentic zone also shows that while the water column remains oxygenated at all depths the do levels are lower in the thermocline and hypolimnion compared to the epilimnion fig 3b the latter supports o2 consumption by aerobic degradation of om settling from the epilimnion organic matter mineralization during aerobic respiration releases co2 which should increase the pco2 and the concentration of dic but lower the concentrations of om the observed depth profiles of pco2 dic and chl a are consistent with the expected changes accompanying aerobic respiration of photosynthates from the epilimnion fig 3b the increase in pco2 should further cause a decrease in ph which is indeed observed the mineralization of isotopically light organic matter is also consistent with the drop in δ13cdic values below the epilimnion a closer examination of the depth profiles in fig 3 reveals that the steepest depth gradients in the variables discussed above all occur between the sampling depths of 5 and 15 m with the extreme maximum or minimum values of do pco2 ph and δ13cdic recorded in the samples collected at 15 m water depth thus the data imply that the most intense aerobic respiration activity occurs in the upper part of the thermocline previous studies in karst reservoirs have emphasized the role of om when interpreting the increase in dic concentrations and the more negative δ13cdic values with increasing depth han et al 2017 yang et al 2022 the evidence presented here suggests that pic dissolution also contributes to the chemical changes along the water column of the lentic zone because of the lower temperature and ph of the hypolimnion the geochemical characteristics of pic showed obvious corrosion characteristics fig s2 from the epilimnion to hypolimnion δ14cpic 132 to 188 δ14cdic 151 to 233 pic concentrations 43 9 μg c l to 5 0 μg c l and sic 0 5 to 0 2 decreased markedly table s1 in contrast the opposite trend was observed for the concentrations of dic and ca2 dic t and ca2 ph in the profile fig s3 moreover the concentrations of doc 1 6 mg l to 0 8 mg l and poc 0 4 mg l to 0 1 mg l decreased from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion table s1 the data described above suggest that both the processes of pic dissolution and oc degradation are affecting the ic cycling in the hypolimnion fig 3 previous studies have focused their discussions about the increase in dic concentrations and the more negative δ13cdic values with increasing depth in karst reservoirs on the contribution of om degradation and waters from inflowing rivers in the hypolimnion to these trends and have thus neglected to consider the contribution by pic dissolution cui et al 2017 han et al 2017 wang et al 2020 in this study the isotope mass balance model indicates that pic dissolution in the lentic zone hypolimnion contributes to 57 of the dic with autochthonous pic dissolution accounting for 49 of the total 57 fig 6 the above calculation results indicate that autochthonous pic dissolution also have a more significant complementary effect on dic than the degradation of oc previous studies have shown that the lacustrine oc recycling process tends to remain stable or slow down under the pressure of stable thermal stratification in the lake and river reservoir system sun et al 2019 yi et al 2021 in this study due to the aerobic degradation of oc in the epilimnion do rich zone the concentrations of poc 0 1 0 mg l and doc 0 9 0 1 mg l remain stable in the hypolimnion table s1 furthermore although phytoplankton photosynthesis provides massive amounts of fresh poc maavara et al 2017 yi et al 2021 reservoir eutrophication often results in an anoxic environment in the hypolimnion preventing further oxidative degradation of the oc moller and sand jensen 2011 in the anoxic environment of the lentic sediment methanogenic oc degradation mainly produce ch4 instead of co2 conrad et al 2011 further hindering oc from being recycled into the dic pool accordingly the above representations also support our calculations and interpretation that pic dissolution is an important contributor to the chemical changes along the water column in the lentic zone 4 3 implications for reservoir co2 exchange with the atmosphere the above hydrochemical computational and characterization data can only give an indication about the potential processes controlling carbon cycling in the reservoir the 13c and 14c values can not only be used to trace the multiple processes on carbon in different zones of the river reservoir system but also to delineate the contributions of different sources to the pic and dic isotope compositons and by extension concentrations marwick et al 2015 yi et al 2021 accordingly we used both 13c and 14c to analyze these processes transforming ic in the hongjiadu river reservoir system figs 3 and 4 from the fluvial to the intermediate and lentic epilimnion δ14cpic 789 to 151 and δ14cdic 204 to 132 increased markedly fig 2 the isotope mass balance model also indicates that the atmospheric co2 contributes to dic increase from 61 to 71 moreover the proportion of autochthonous pic in the epilimnion and hypolimnion are 91 and 85 respectively 0 in the river area fig 6 the above presented results suggest that the damming induced formation of a lentic zone and increase in photosynthetic primary productivity removed dic and atmospheric co2 increasing ph and encouraging in situ pic precipitation increasing autochthonous pic concentration in this study the lowest pco2 125 8 μatm the partial pressure of atmospheric co2 is about 407 μatm calculated from https www esrl noaa gov gmd ccgg and f co2 6 4 mmol m2 d are shown in the reservoir epilimnion our previous studies wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and other studies li et al 2018 maavara et al 2020b pu et al 2020 have also shown that there was an obvious carbon sink effect at reservoirs air water interface in the lentic zones with longer hrt it suggests that atmospheric co2 has been directly involved in the reservoir ic cycle and supports the isotope mass balance model results in short the original hydrological regime has been seriously altered by the dam which resulted in the development of limnology and affects the ic cycling by the processes of dic removal phytoplankton photosynthesize and in situ pic precipitation fig 7 ph is a key variable controlling reservoir ic cycling the predominance of pic dissolution in the hypolimnion is caused by the lower ph in the hypolimnion ph 7 3 relative to the epilimnion ph 8 1 with the decrease in ph being caused by om mineralization in the hypolimnion sediments which produces dissolved co2 i e carbonic acid and lowers ph anderson et al 1986 tranvik et al 2009 wang et al 2021 because most of this dissolution of pic occurs in the hypolimnion and sediments the pco2 is higher in the hypolimnion and the outlet water which drains the hypolimnion than in other sections of the reservoir where dic is mainly being produced by carbonate weathering fig 3 because the ph of the outlet water is similar to the hypolimnion the pic dissolution contribution to dic is further increased to 58 and autochthonous pic dissolution is the dominant process contributing to dic production this indicates that autochthonous pic dissolution continues to contribute to ic cycling in the discharging water thus the pco2 5016 5 μatm and f co2 477 0 mmol m2 d in the released water are much higher than that in the other zones of the river reservoir system in short damming lowers the pco2 so that the river acts as a sink of atmospheric co2 in the intermediate and lentic zones but damming also suddenly increases the pco2 in the lentic zone hypolimnion so that the river becomes a co2 source in the outlet water fig 7 previous studies have reported high co2 effluxes at the outlet and downstream of karst reservoirs having long hrts li et al 2018 pu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 eutrophication is hypothesized to increase the ratio of photosynthetic primary production to ecosystem respiration in aquatic ecosystems balmer and downing 2011 morales williams et al 2020 and we would thus predict that eutrophication driven increases in photosynthesis would accelerate both autochthonous pic precipitation and its dissolution effect in the reservoirs lentic zone fig 5 there is no doubt that there will be more reservoirs built in karst rivers in the future grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2020b and most hydroelectric dams already under construction or planned rely on passing water from the reservoir hypolimnion through their turbines zarfl et al 2015 therefore to better understand the river damming effect on carbon budget the potential carbon sink for photosynthesis induced pic precipitation and its dissolution effect in the river reservoir system require additional attentions from researchers and management 5 conclusions chemical and physical carbonate rock weathering in karst regions supply large quantities of pic and dic to rivers and ultimately to the ocean the growing number of dams in karst regions however is altering the riverine transport of pic and dic by enhancing the in reservoir biogeochemical cycling of inorganic carbon here for the first time we demonstrate the combined application of stable δ13c and radioactive δ14c carbon isotope measurements to delineate the biogeochemical processes controlling the distributions of pic and dic in a karst river reservoir system of southwest china the isotope mass balances together with electron microscope imaging show that the conditions in the surface waters of the intermediate and lentic portions of the reservoir cause the photosynthesis induced in situ precipitation of autochthonous pic in turn this lowers the dic pic ratio and pco2 of the surface waters and reduces the co2 efflux to the atmosphere a large fraction of the autochthonous pic dissolves in the hypolimnion of the lentic zone however which results in high co2 emission rates upon discharge through the dam with the ongoing rapid dam construction in many karst areas of the world the precipitation and dissolution of autochthonous pic in reservoirs and their impact on regional carbon budgets deserve further attention the results reveal that pic needs to be considered in estimating carbon sink at the reservoirs and its role in balancing riverine carbon budget this study provides new perspectives on the important role of pic for regulation of the carbon cycle in river reservoir

2669,damming alters the biogeochemical cycling of carbon along river systems however the effects of river damming on the fate and transport of particulate and dissolved inorganic carbon pic and dic remain unclear here we use dual isotope 13c and 14c compositions water chemistry and electron microscopy to unravel the processes controlling the in reservoir cycling of inorganic carbon in a river reservoir system of a karst region of southwest china from the reservoir s fluvial to lentic zone δ13cpic decreases from 2 2 to 7 6 whereas the pic radiocarbon age drops from 11 512 to 2 027 years b p electron microscopy images and water chemistry provide further evidence of in reservoir photosynthesis induced carbonate precipitation of autochthonous pic in the water column although part of pic is dissolved into dic in the reservoir s hypolimnion the contribution of carbonate minerals allochthonous pic accounted for 41 of pic based on an isotopic mass balance model this indicates that the precipitation rate of autochthonous pic was greater part of carbon cycle in the reservoir moreover the autochthonous pic accounted for 61 of the pic and its dissolution accounted for 50 of the dic and the high co2 efflux in the water discharging from the reservoir the results shed light on the important role of autochthonous pic in carbon cycling in karst river reservoir systems with continued dam construction in karst areas the role of in reservoir pic production and dissolution on the riverine carbon cycle deserves more attention keywords river damming karst reservoir inorganic carbon carbon isotopes δ14c carbon cycle data availability we have shared in the supplemental information 1 introduction rivers are important conduits connecting terrestrial and aquatic systems they are estimated to transport 1 pg carbon to the ocean each year with around 60 in the form of inorganic carbon bauer et al 2013 meybeck 1982 more often than not they also emit co2 to the atmosphere due to degassing of dissolved inorganic carbon dic butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 more than 70 of the world s large rivers have been dammed grill et al 2019 which has severely fragmented river systems and modified their hydrology and biogeochemical functions maavara et al 2020b tranvik et al 2009 zarfl et al 2015 by damming a river the hydraulic retention time hrt increases and a portion of the upstream natural riverine system with continuous flow and a low hrt turns into a river reservoir ecosystem abril et al 2003 philippe and taylor 2016 st louis et al 2000 zeng et al 2022 river reservoir systems often exhibit three longitudinal zones with from upstream to downstream the fluvial intermediate and lentic zone each with distinct biogeochemical and hydrological characteristics soares et al 2012 thornton et al 1990 as water flow rates decrease from the fluvial zone to the intermediate lentic zone suspended particles settle out hence enhancing water transparency the reservoir gradually develops into a more lentic environment where the longer hrt further promotes sediment deposition and algal growth grumbine and pandit 2013 maavara et al 2020a xu et al 2018 karst areas account for 10 15 of the global continental surface area ford and williams 2007 karst areas represent an atmospheric co2 sink due to carbonate rock weathering gaillardet et al 2019 however rivers in karst regions may reduce the weathering co2 sink by instream inorganic carbon ic cycling for example by releasing co2 during the precipitation of autochthonous particulate inorganic carbon pic minerals and the degassing of co2 from oversaturated river water curl 2012 liu et al 2018 there have been a number of recent studies on carbon cycling in karst river reservoir systems which have identified that the primary controls on dic particle organic carbon poc and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations are primary production i e photosynthesis organic matter om mineralization and co2 degassing crawford et al 2016 han et al 2017 li et al 2018 pu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however few studies have measured pic distributions in river reservoir systems to determine the in reservoir cycling between dic and pic and the impact on riverine carbon fluxes and speciation as pic dic poc doc as well as implications for co2 exchanges with the atmosphere in a recent study pic dissolution was estimated to be responsible for 17 6 of the dic measured in the changjiang yangtze river wang et al 2016 most studies found karst rivers to be net sources of co2 to the atmosphere because their co2 partial pressure pco2 values exceed atmospheric pco2 liu and han 2020 ulloacedamanos et al 2020 van geldern et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 although the co2 effluxes from karst rivers may be lower than from rivers draining other lithologies khadka et al 2014 in general the alteration of inorganic carbon cycling along karst rivers by damming remains poorly characterized stable carbon isotope values δ13c have been widely used in studies of river reservoir and lake systems to delineate the sources that control inorganic carbon concentrations in aquatic systems de montety et al 2011 maberly et al 2012 morales williams et al 2020 qin et al 2019 the main dic sources that are typically identified with isotope mixing models are atmospheric co2 dissolution production by om mineralization and production by carbonate or silicate rock weathering wang et al 2016 however the ability of δ13c to trace carbon transformation reactions and transport processes is limited by the uncertainties associated with the selection of the end member isotope compositions in part because these isotope compositions tend to overlap and because of the variations in the isotope fractionations of processes such as photosynthesis and co2 degassing campeau et al 2017 ishikawa et al 2016 yi et al 2021 radiocarbon 14c measurements offer a complimentary tool for estimating carbon sources because they are not affected by fractionation marwick et al 2015 mayorga et al 2005 by combining stable and radiocarbon isotopes the mixing of end member sources can be more accurately estimated in inland waters raymond et al 2004 zeng et al 2011 zhong et al 2021 the wujiang river is located in the center of the southeast asia karst region the largest karst area in the world han et al 2010 the physical and chemical weathering of the karst contributes high pic and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations to the rivers draining them qin et al 2019 qin et al 2022 over the last half century at least 1086 dams have been built in the watershed of the wujiang river yang et al 2019 and as a result sediment transport along the river decreased by 92 from 1956 to 2017 due to sediment accumulation behind the dams cwrc 2017 however the impact of river damming on carbon especially ic cycling in karst rivers is still not fully understood in particular the changes in carbon speciation and fluxes and the processes contributing to these changes through the large river reservoir system has been poorly explored so far this is not conducive to assessing the effect of damming on the regional and global carbon cycle here we assess the biogeochemical processes controlling the spatial trends of pic and dic concentrations and by extension those of the partial pressure and efflux of co2 throughout a karst river reservoir system combining dual carbon isotopes δ14c δ13c electron microscopy observations and geochemical and biophysical measurements at the first time the hypothesis driving this work is that compared to the natural river corridor damming intensifies the impact of inorganic carbon reaction processes because of the increased hrt in the reservoir in particular we compare the geochemical differences between the fluvial intermediate and lentic zones of the reservoir system and for the lentic zone also the differences between the surface and deeper waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling procedure the wujiang river forms part of the southern tributary system of the changjiang river it is located in the center of the largest karst area in the world fig 1 hongjiadu reservoir is the main reservoir in the upper reach of the wujiang river and exhibits seasonal stratification wang et al 2020 to stabilize power generation by the downstream cascade reservoirs hongjiadu reservoir operates on an anti seasonal flow regulation that is the water level behind the dam is highest during the winter dry season and lowest during the summer wet season the reservoir water storage levels and discharge fluctuations over a year are illustrated in fig s1 the ten sampling sites along the reservoir are shown in fig 1 sites w1 and w2 are in the reservoir s fluvial zone sites w3 and w4 experience periodic stratification and are considered representative on the intermediate zone wang et al 2021 sites w6 to w9 are in the lentic zone

same time dic decreased from 155 1 to 96 4 mg l 37 8 ca2 from 63 9 to 43 4 mg l 32 1 tds from 256 5 to 213 6 mg l 16 7 pco2 from 1945 5 to 754 9 μatm 61 2 and f co2 from 147 8 to 32 5 mmol m2 d 78 fig 2 most surface water geochemical variables showed relatively little change between the intermediate and lentic zones by contrast significant differences were observed as a function of depth in the lentic zone of the reservoir with increasing depth wt decreased from 27 7 to 11 5 58 the concentrations of pic 33 2 10 2 µg l chl a 1 0 0 9 μg l do 9 2 1 5 mg l and ph 8 2 0 1 were highest in the epilimnion 0 5 5 m while the concentrations of dic 146 5 9 5 mg l and ca2 64 4 3 1 mg l were highest in the hypolimnion 45 80 m fig 3 the water chemistry of the water downstream of the dam w10 was similar to that of the hypolimnion although the pic 11 7 μg l and do 5 4 mg l concentrations were markedly higher the f co2 value at site w10 477 0 mmol m2 d was higher than estimated anywhere else along the hongjiadu reservoir 3 2 δ13c and δ14c of inorganic carbon spatial trends from the fluvial to the lentic zones surface water δ13cpic decreased from 2 1 to 4 4 and δ13cdic increased from 9 7 to 3 1 fig 2 and table s1 the highest δ13cdic 0 7 was observed at site w4 in the intermediate zone thus the transition from the fluvial to intermediate zone was accompanied by an increase of δ13cdic by 9 site w4 also exhibited the lowest measured δ13cpic value 6 1 the δ14cpic 789 and δ14cdic 205 values were lowest in the fluvial zone fig 3 from the fluvial to the intermediate zone surface water δ14cpic increased from 789 to 151 423 and δ14cdic from 205 to 132 55 fig 2 and table s1 in the lentic zone δ13cpic δ14cpic δ13cdic and δ14cdic all decreased with increasing water depth fig 3 the depth trends however showed clear differences after an initial sharp drop in the upper part of the thermocline the δ13cdic values stabilized at 9 4 0 2 below 15 m fig 3 by contrast the δ14cdic and δ14cpic values decreased throughout the depth profile reaching values at the deepest water depth of 188 and 233 respectively the pic in the top sediment 0 2 cm of the lentic zone sediment had a δ14c value of 490 while this value was lower than those measured in the overlying water it was still significantly higher than for pic in the fluvial zone 789 to 730 table s1 the δ13cpic 4 6 and δ13cdic 9 2 values of water below the dam were close to those found in the thermocline and hypolimnion of the lentic zone however the δ14cpic 309 and δ14cdic 191 were markedly lower 3 3 scanning electron microscopy the sem images of pic particles show distinct morphological changes during the transitions from the fluvial to intermediate to lentic zone in the fluvial zone relatively large rhombohedral crystals could be observed indicative of karst derived material produced by physical weathering fig s2a the pic particles collected from the surface waters of the intermediate and lentic zones showed platelets and bundles likely representative of in situ precipitation fig s2b with increasing water depth in the lentic zone as well as in the water collected downstream of the dam the crystal surfaces showed evidence of corrosion features fig s2c e 3 4 pls modeling the pls analysis implied that ph and wt were the two most important parameters i e with variable importance in projection vip 1 controlling dic and ca2 concentrations table s2 when the ca2 ph ratio is plotted versus dic t where t is wt in degrees a strong non linear logarithmic relationship emerged fig s3c r2 0 94 a trend also observed when considering data from other karst rivers and reservoirs fig s3d r2 0 72 thus as dic t increases ca2 ph decreases pls analysis suggests that the plot of ca2 ph vs dic t can help to decipher the processes of carbon transport and transformation across the river reservoir system however it should be noted that there is no chemical stoichiometric interpretation of the plot of ca2 ph vs dic t 3 5 isotope mass balance modeling according to the mass balance model text s3 and table s3 atmospheric co2 carbonate rock weathering and organic matter om mineralization contributed 61 14 and 25 to the isotopic composition of dic in the fluvial zone respectively the relative contributions of atmospheric co2 to the surface water dic isotope composition were higher in the intermediate and lentic zones 69 and 71 respectively the relative contribution of karst carbonate minerals allochthonous pic accounted for 55 and 9 of pic in the intermediate and lentic zones respectively compared to 100 in the fluvial zone in the lentic zone surface water most of the pic originated from in situ precipitation in the lentic zone s hypolimnion the pic isotope composition was a mixture of 85 of pic originating from the epilimnion i e the autochthonous pic and 15 from the allochthonous pic the dic isotope composition in the lentic zone s hypolimnion could be accounted for by autochthonous pic dissolution 49 om respiration 19 and atmospheric co2 24 in dam outflow water the relative contributions of autochthonous pic precipitation and dissolution to the pic and dic isotope compositions were 67 and 49 respectively the carbon isotope fractionation may influence our computational results campeau et al 2017 zhong et al 2021 to avoid this kind of error the calculation for the contribution of each potential pic source we only used δ14c text s3 for the source calculation of dic we also only used δ14c in the epilimnion of the intermediate and lentic area which there are many significant biological processes in these areas 4 discussion 4 1 photosynthesis induced pic precipitation in hongjiadu reservoir the ratio of photosynthetic primary production to ecosystem respiration typically increases as water velocity decreases and water temperature wt increases in reservoirs philippe and taylor 2016 ran et al 2012 the geochemical changes observed in the hongjiadu river reservoir system are consistent with an increase from the fluvial to the lentic zone of the relative contribution of photosynthesis induced calcium carbonate mineral precipitation liu et al 2018 sironić et al 2017 this is most obvious in the trends of ph chl a dic ca2 and δ13cdic to better evaluate the potential sources of pic and dic in the hongjiadu river reservoir system we plot 13c vs 14c for the pic and dic samples fig 4 the preferential fixation of the 12c isotope during photosynthesis enriches the water in the heavier isotope as seen by the sharp increase δ13cdic δ14cdic and δ14cpic between the fluvial and intermediate zones fig 4 increased activity of phytoplankton is further evidenced by the higher chl a concentrations in the intermediate and lentic surface waters de montety et al 2011 hodell et al 1998 wang et al 2020 the removal of dic as co2 aq and hco3 from the surface water by photosynthesis consumes h and raises the ph the high ph 8 5 creates conditions favorable to the precipitation of calcium carbonate which explains the decrease of the aqueous ca2 concentrations from the fluvial to lentic zone as well as the strong linear correlation of the differences in dic δdic and ca2 concentrations δca2 of surface water samples from the intermediate and lentic zones relative to the dic and ca2 concentrations in the fluvial zone fig s3a r2 0 97 the fact that the pls regression analysis identifies wt and ph as the main variables explaining the variations in pic and dic concentrations table s2 further support active in reservoir pic formation temperature and ph are key parameters controlling the thermodynamics and kinetics of calcium carbonate precipitation from solution morse et al 2007 as temperature increases the solubility of calcite decreases hence making precipitation more favorable and responsible for the low dic pic ratio along the water column fig 5 the removal of co2 and concomitant increase of ph by photosynthesis similarly promotes the precipitation of caco3 by increasing the abundance of co3 2 in the dissolved carbonate pool liu et al 2018 pu et al 2020 sironić et al 2017 wolthers et al 2012 it should be noted that temperature also influences other processes affecting inorganic carbon cycling in aquatic systems including the rates of photosynthesis mineral dissolution and other abiotic and microbial processes de montety et al 2011 gaillardet et al 2019 lauerwald et al 2013 sironić et al 2017 overall the major geochemical trends along the reservoir are captured by the following two reactions liu et al 2018 rupp and adams 1981 1 caco3 h2o co2 ca2 2hco3 2 ca2 2hco3 x co2 h2o caco3 1 x ch2o o2 where ch2o is a simplified representation of algal biomass produced during photosynthesis reaction 1 illustrates the chemical weathering of calcium carbonate minerals that in karst regions delivers high amounts of aqueous ca2 and dic to the river network reaction 2 illustrates the removal of ca2 and dic from the epilimnion of the receiving reservoir as a result of photosynthesis and the concomitant production of autochthonous caco3 because of isotopic equilibration between surface water dic and atmospheric co2 the in reservoir carbonate mineral precipitation adds young autochthonous caco3 to the background of old karst derived allochthonous pic fig 4 this then explains the large drop in the pic radiocarbon age in the lentic and intermediate zones compared to the fluvial zone fig 2 it also explains the morphological differences in pic observed by sem including the close association between caco3 precipitates and cell like structures in the surface water samples of the reservoir fig s2 moreover the relative contribution of autochthonous pic accounted for 91 85 and 41 of pic in the lentic epilimnion hypolimnion and surface sediments respectively the results suggest that the precipitation rate of autochthonous pic was greater than its dissolution rate in the intermediate and lentic zones of the hongjiadu reservoir our results hint that there is potential large carbon sink contributed by dic pic transformation processes in the karst river reservoir system which will need to be considered in global carbon models 4 2 below the epilimnion of the lentic zone om degradation and pic dissolution at the time of sampling the lentic zone exhibited a stable thermal stratification fig 3a which in reservoirs is facilitated by the longer hrt and greater water depth compared to the upstream free flowing rivers elçi 2008 han et al 2017 the very different geochemical environment of the hypolimnion compared to that of the surface waters leads to further biogeochemical carbon processing three different processes account for the depth dependent changes in the water chemistry and carbon isotopic compositions in the lentic zone 1 net aerobic respiration of om below the epilimnion 2 dissolution of pic both allochthonous pic and that supplied through sedimentation of newly produced pic i e autochthonous pic from the epilimnion and 3 gravitational circulation where colder inflowing river water dives under the warmer less dense and surface water of the reservoir below we analyze these three possibilities the do profile of the lentic zone also shows that while the water column remains oxygenated at all depths the do levels are lower in the thermocline and hypolimnion compared to the epilimnion fig 3b the latter supports o2 consumption by aerobic degradation of om settling from the epilimnion organic matter mineralization during aerobic respiration releases co2 which should increase the pco2 and the concentration of dic but lower the concentrations of om the observed depth profiles of pco2 dic and chl a are consistent with the expected changes accompanying aerobic respiration of photosynthates from the epilimnion fig 3b the increase in pco2 should further cause a decrease in ph which is indeed observed the mineralization of isotopically light organic matter is also consistent with the drop in δ13cdic values below the epilimnion a closer examination of the depth profiles in fig 3 reveals that the steepest depth gradients in the variables discussed above all occur between the sampling depths of 5 and 15 m with the extreme maximum or minimum values of do pco2 ph and δ13cdic recorded in the samples collected at 15 m water depth thus the data imply that the most intense aerobic respiration activity occurs in the upper part of the thermocline previous studies in karst reservoirs have emphasized the role of om when interpreting the increase in dic concentrations and the more negative δ13cdic values with increasing depth han et al 2017 yang et al 2022 the evidence presented here suggests that pic dissolution also contributes to the chemical changes along the water column of the lentic zone because of the lower temperature and ph of the hypolimnion the geochemical characteristics of pic showed obvious corrosion characteristics fig s2 from the epilimnion to hypolimnion δ14cpic 132 to 188 δ14cdic 151 to 233 pic concentrations 43 9 μg c l to 5 0 μg c l and sic 0 5 to 0 2 decreased markedly table s1 in contrast the opposite trend was observed for the concentrations of dic and ca2 dic t and ca2 ph in the profile fig s3 moreover the concentrations of doc 1 6 mg l to 0 8 mg l and poc 0 4 mg l to 0 1 mg l decreased from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion table s1 the data described above suggest that both the processes of pic dissolution and oc degradation are affecting the ic cycling in the hypolimnion fig 3 previous studies have focused their discussions about the increase in dic concentrations and the more negative δ13cdic values with increasing depth in karst reservoirs on the contribution of om degradation and waters from inflowing rivers in the hypolimnion to these trends and have thus neglected to consider the contribution by pic dissolution cui et al 2017 han et al 2017 wang et al 2020 in this study the isotope mass balance model indicates that pic dissolution in the lentic zone hypolimnion contributes to 57 of the dic with autochthonous pic dissolution accounting for 49 of the total 57 fig 6 the above calculation results indicate that autochthonous pic dissolution also have a more significant complementary effect on dic than the degradation of oc previous studies have shown that the lacustrine oc recycling process tends to remain stable or slow down under the pressure of stable thermal stratification in the lake and river reservoir system sun et al 2019 yi et al 2021 in this study due to the aerobic degradation of oc in the epilimnion do rich zone the concentrations of poc 0 1 0 mg l and doc 0 9 0 1 mg l remain stable in the hypolimnion table s1 furthermore although phytoplankton photosynthesis provides massive amounts of fresh poc maavara et al 2017 yi et al 2021 reservoir eutrophication often results in an anoxic environment in the hypolimnion preventing further oxidative degradation of the oc moller and sand jensen 2011 in the anoxic environment of the lentic sediment methanogenic oc degradation mainly produce ch4 instead of co2 conrad et al 2011 further hindering oc from being recycled into the dic pool accordingly the above representations also support our calculations and interpretation that pic dissolution is an important contributor to the chemical changes along the water column in the lentic zone 4 3 implications for reservoir co2 exchange with the atmosphere the above hydrochemical computational and characterization data can only give an indication about the potential processes controlling carbon cycling in the reservoir the 13c and 14c values can not only be used to trace the multiple processes on carbon in different zones of the river reservoir system but also to delineate the contributions of different sources to the pic and dic isotope compositons and by extension concentrations marwick et al 2015 yi et al 2021 accordingly we used both 13c and 14c to analyze these processes transforming ic in the hongjiadu river reservoir system figs 3 and 4 from the fluvial to the intermediate and lentic epilimnion δ14cpic 789 to 151 and δ14cdic 204 to 132 increased markedly fig 2 the isotope mass balance model also indicates that the atmospheric co2 contributes to dic increase from 61 to 71 moreover the proportion of autochthonous pic in the epilimnion and hypolimnion are 91 and 85 respectively 0 in the river area fig 6 the above presented results suggest that the damming induced formation of a lentic zone and increase in photosynthetic primary productivity removed dic and atmospheric co2 increasing ph and encouraging in situ pic precipitation increasing autochthonous pic concentration in this study the lowest pco2 125 8 μatm the partial pressure of atmospheric co2 is about 407 μatm calculated from https www esrl noaa gov gmd ccgg and f co2 6 4 mmol m2 d are shown in the reservoir epilimnion our previous studies wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and other studies li et al 2018 maavara et al 2020b pu et al 2020 have also shown that there was an obvious carbon sink effect at reservoirs air water interface in the lentic zones with longer hrt it suggests that atmospheric co2 has been directly involved in the reservoir ic cycle and supports the isotope mass balance model results in short the original hydrological regime has been seriously altered by the dam which resulted in the development of limnology and affects the ic cycling by the processes of dic removal phytoplankton photosynthesize and in situ pic precipitation fig 7 ph is a key variable controlling reservoir ic cycling the predominance of pic dissolution in the hypolimnion is caused by the lower ph in the hypolimnion ph 7 3 relative to the epilimnion ph 8 1 with the decrease in ph being caused by om mineralization in the hypolimnion sediments which produces dissolved co2 i e carbonic acid and lowers ph anderson et al 1986 tranvik et al 2009 wang et al 2021 because most of this dissolution of pic occurs in the hypolimnion and sediments the pco2 is higher in the hypolimnion and the outlet water which drains the hypolimnion than in other sections of the reservoir where dic is mainly being produced by carbonate weathering fig 3 because the ph of the outlet water is similar to the hypolimnion the pic dissolution contribution to dic is further increased to 58 and autochthonous pic dissolution is the dominant process contributing to dic production this indicates that autochthonous pic dissolution continues to contribute to ic cycling in the discharging water thus the pco2 5016 5 μatm and f co2 477 0 mmol m2 d in the released water are much higher than that in the other zones of the river reservoir system in short damming lowers the pco2 so that the river acts as a sink of atmospheric co2 in the intermediate and lentic zones but damming also suddenly increases the pco2 in the lentic zone hypolimnion so that the river becomes a co2 source in the outlet water fig 7 previous studies have reported high co2 effluxes at the outlet and downstream of karst reservoirs having long hrts li et al 2018 pu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 eutrophication is hypothesized to increase the ratio of photosynthetic primary production to ecosystem respiration in aquatic ecosystems balmer and downing 2011 morales williams et al 2020 and we would thus predict that eutrophication driven increases in photosynthesis would accelerate both autochthonous pic precipitation and its dissolution effect in the reservoirs lentic zone fig 5 there is no doubt that there will be more reservoirs built in karst rivers in the future grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2020b and most hydroelectric dams already under construction or planned rely on passing water from the reservoir hypolimnion through their turbines zarfl et al 2015 therefore to better understand the river damming effect on carbon budget the potential carbon sink for photosynthesis induced pic precipitation and its dissolution effect in the river reservoir system require additional attentions from researchers and management 5 conclusions chemical and physical carbonate rock weathering in karst regions supply large quantities of pic and dic to rivers and ultimately to the ocean the growing number of dams in karst regions however is altering the riverine transport of pic and dic by enhancing the in reservoir biogeochemical cycling of inorganic carbon here for the first time we demonstrate the combined application of stable δ13c and radioactive δ14c carbon isotope measurements to delineate the biogeochemical processes controlling the distributions of pic and dic in a karst river reservoir system of southwest china the isotope mass balances together with electron microscope imaging show that the conditions in the surface waters of the intermediate and lentic portions of the reservoir cause the photosynthesis induced in situ precipitation of autochthonous pic in turn this lowers the dic pic ratio and pco2 of the surface waters and reduces the co2 efflux to the atmosphere a large fraction of the autochthonous pic dissolves in the hypolimnion of the lentic zone however which results in high co2 emission rates upon discharge through the dam with the ongoing rapid dam construction in many karst areas of the world the precipitation and dissolution of autochthonous pic in reservoirs and their impact on regional carbon budgets deserve further attention the results reveal that pic needs to be considered in estimating carbon sink at the reservoirs and its role in balancing riverine carbon budget this study provides new perspectives on the important role of pic for regulation of the carbon cycle in river reservoir
