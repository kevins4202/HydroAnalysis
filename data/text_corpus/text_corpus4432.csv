22160,cavitation is of great practical interest because unsteady flow features can induce negative effects such as mechanical erosion and noise air injection is an important way to adjust the instability of the cavitation flow field in the present study we numerically simulate a naca66 hydrofoil with a particular emphasis on understanding the effects of ventilation on cavitation characteristics such as cavity dynamics vortex structure and the wake field cavitation is modeled by using the schnerr sauer cavitation model and the large eddy simulation les method is used to calculate the unsteady natural and ventilated cavitation flow the results of the numerical simulation are in good agreement with experiment which verifies the effectiveness of the numerical method the evolution of cavity dynamics and vortex structure are analyzed to clarify how multi scale vortex structures evolve in the flow field the results show that the shedding speed of the ventilated cloud cavity is faster than the natural cavitation in addition ventilation improves the pressure pulsation on the cavitation hydrofoil surface the rotational effect in ventilated cavitation is more significant furthermore ventilation causes strong large scale pulsating eddy currents to rotate into small scale eddies an analysis of the vorticity transfer equation shows that the gas injection increases the velocity gradient and enhances the conversion of the two gas liquid phases the results in the wake of the hydrofoil show that ventilation can effectively reduce the turbulence intensity and turbulence integral scale which indicates that ventilation can improve the velocity pulsation and instability interestingly increasing the ventilation rate helps to improve the pressure peak on the hydrofoil surface and increases the lift and drag coefficient moreover gas injection is responsible for cavity pulsation and the re entrant jet enhances the fluctuation intensity keywords

drops below the local saturated vapor pressure cavities are generated at the internal or liquid solid interface of the liquid this phenomenon is called cavitation batchelor and batchelor 2000 sun et al 2019a b c peng et al 2019 cavitation flow is a complex flow of multi scale cavities accompanied by phase transitions turbulence and unsteady features and occurs in various fluidic machines such as liquid rocket engines turbines marine propellers and hydrofoils sun et al 2019a b c knapp et al 1970 brennen 2005 passandideh fard and roohi 2008 cavitation can cause serious problems in fluid machinery for example a drastic drop in efficiency noise vibration and corrosion cavitation is very difficult to eliminate and remains an open problem therefore seeking effective ways to improve the control of cavitation remains an urgent scientific issue controlling cavitation requires a detailed understanding of the cavitation dynamics especially the unstable flow characteristics sun et al 2016 knapp 1955 observed and analyzed cloud cavitation flow pointing out that the re entrant flow starting from the closed position of the cavitation caused the cloud cavitation to break off ganesh et al 2016 studied experimentally how sheet cavitation evolved into cloud cavitation by using a wedge shaped geometric model they found two types of cavity shedding mechanisms in the cavitation flow field the re entrant jet mechanism and the shock wave mechanism cheng et al 2019 captured unsteady tip leakage cavitating flow by using a large eddy simulation method and found that the spatial evolution of the tip leakage cavitating flow can be divided into three stages their results provide insight into how cavitation influences vorticity and turbulence cavitation generation and collapse are periodic and this periodic pressure shock changes the dynamic characteristics of the flow field while also causing strong vibrations and noise moreover the re entrant jet and shock waves formed during cavitation collapse lead to high pulsating pressure on the material surface arndt 2002 yuan et al 2019 sedlar et al 2016 philipp and lauterborn 1998 reisman et al 1998 studied cloud like cavitation flow around an oscillating hydrofoil by using high speed video and a synchronous pressure sensor measurement they discussed how a changing cavity shape generates a transient pressure pulse on the hydrofoil surface kolahan et al 2019 investigated wavelet analysis of cavitating flow around a sphere and excellent unsteady and dynamic behaviors of cavitation were obtained they found that the flow fluctuations was enhanced by increasing the cavitation number and the low frequency fluctuations played a leading role in the cavitation flow arabnejad et al 2019 studied the cavitation shedding mechanisms from the leading edge of hydrofoils and focused in particular on the onset of erosion their results indicate that the secondary shedding mechanisms result in multiple collapse events in a single primary shedding cycle a no ncondensable gas injected into the cavity will significantly increase the void ratio in the cavity slow down the rate of cavitation collapse and increase the minimum cavitation volume thereby changing the pressure load as cavitation evolves paik et al 2011 brennen 2014 shao et al 2018 arndt et al 1995 used an air injection experiment to evaluate cavitation erosion and found that air injection is effective for minimizing erosion reisman et al 1997 investigated how continuous and pulsed air injection affects sheet cloud cavitation of an oscillating foil they concluded that air injection can reduce cavitation noise and that pulsed air can reduce cavitation noise much more than continuous air injection at the same volumetric flow rate pham et al 1999 studied the mechanism of unsteady plate cavitation and cloud cavitation and found that for a certain range of ventilation gas flow rate cavitation flow is suppressed karn et al 2015 investigated experimentally the turbulent bubbly wake of a ventilated hydrofoil and found that larger bubbles remain close to the injection slot of the hydrofoil because of their greater inertia mäkiharju et al 2017 used the wedge model to study how noncondensable gases affect the evolution of cloud cavitation and found that cavitation and periodic oscillations are suppressed by gas injection liu et al 2017 studied four relatively stable states of a ventilated cavity to determine how froude number and gas entrainment affect the pattern of cavitation flow unsteady cavitation flow involves turbulent flow with phase transitions and multiscale vortex motion in the turbulent state fluid micelles in the flow field undergo irregular random pulsating motion in time and space that involves multiscale vortex bearing unsteady flow arndt et al 1991 kim and lee 2015 long et al 2017 used two typical examples of cavitation shedding dynamics flow in liquid hydrogen to study thermodynamic effects and found that the baroclinic torque is the main cause of vorticity gradients along the detached cavity surface and that vorticity dilatation is mainly responsible for modulating vorticity inside a large scale cavity in addition the effect of ventilation amplifies the complexity of unsteady cavitation flow pendar and roohi 2018 used large eddy simulation to address the turbulent kinetic energy tke and vorticity features the fruitful results showed that high density of tke was found at the cavity interface separated shear layer and re entrant jet interaction with the cavity interface meanwhile the vorticity dilatation was found to be a major parameter in affecting the vorticity in the wake of the multi phase flow wang et al 2018 combined experimental and numerical methods to study the vortex shedding dynamics of ventilated cavitating flow and found that ventilated cavitation strongly affects the vorticity distribution causing higher levels of vorticity to appear around the cavity boundary and large scale counterclockwise and clockwise vertical structures to appear in the wake in cavitation flow simulations the turbulence model plays an important role in predicting unstable cavitation flow and many numerical results depend largely on the turbulence model coutier delgosha et al 2003 wu et al 2005 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 cavitation typically results in the formation of large scale eddy currents involving complex cavity structures most previous simulations have used the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method for cavitation calculations because of its good stability reasonable computational cost and acceptable accuracy sun et al 2016 sun et al 2017 although the rans method is very popular in practical engineering it overestimates the turbulent eddy viscosity huang et al 2013a b roohi et al 2013 rahami et al 2014 with the rapid development of computer technology large eddy simulations less are being increasingly applied to simulate cavitation flow zahiri and roohi 2018 cheng et al 2019 the les method can predict the unstable nature of the flow providing insight into the flow details therefore the cavitation flow les model was used to predict multiscale turbulent vortex characteristics sun et al 2019a b c wu et al 2016 long et al 2018 pendar and roohi 2016 compared the applicability of the rans and les methods to cavitation simulation with a novel approach the cavitation morphology pressure changes and eddy currents under different cavitation numbers were studied the results showed that the combination of les and cavitation model will affect the calculation results the gradual application of the les method to the cavitation problem highlights its advantage over the rans model although natural cavitation vortex structures have been studied extensively by using less wang and ostoja starzewski 2007 bensow and barkimplicit 2010 chen et al 2017 studies of vortex structures under conditions of ventilated cavitation are very limited the periodic shedding of cavitation not only significantly changes the local flow structure but also inevitably changes the downstream wake region which causes strong velocity and pressure pulsations kumar et al 2017 gopalan and kate 2000 used piv technology to study cavitation and found that cavity shedding produces a vortex structure similar to a hairpin and that cavity collapse changes the turbulence characteristics arndt et al 2006 used tr piv to measure the cavitation wake structure of a hydrofoil and found that cavitation can significantly change the flow field structure producing a large number of three dimensional vortices in the wake huang et al 2013a b used dpiv to study the wake field structure around a hydrofoil the results show that during cavitation cloud shedding the local vortex structure changes and the vorticity increases by an order of magnitude although much encouraging work has been done on ventilated cavitation further research is needed the mechanism by which ventilation improves cavitation is not well understood especially pressure pulsation vortex evolution and wake fields the paper reports our numerical study of unsteady natural and ventilated cavitation flow over a naca66 hydrofoil section 2 presents the numerical framework which includes the basic governing equations cavitation models turbulence models and validation of the numerical method section 3 discusses and analyzes how ventilation affects cavity evolution pressure fluctuation vortex structure and the wake field in addition the influence of ventilation rate on cavity dynamics and the cavity pulsation patterns are analyzed finally section 4 summarizes the work and presents the main conclusions 2 mathematical formulations and numerical methods 2 1 governing

simplifying and appropriately correcting the rayleigh plesset cavity dynamics equation rayleigh 1917 plesset 1949 the evaporation and condensation processes are implemented by inserting a source term

scale of fine flow fields the les model is used to calculate turbulent eddies and time averaged flows the les model uses a filtering function to divide the vortices in a turbulent flow into large scale vortices and small scale vortices large scale eddy structures are solved by direct numerical calculations whereas small scale vortices are calculated by establishing relationships with large scale vortices the les governing equations are 9 ρ t ρ μ j x j 0 10 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ τ i j x j where τ i j is the nonlinear sub grid scale sgs stress tensor which is defined as 11 τ i j ρ u i u j u i u j based on the boussinesq hypothesis the tensor is described by using a product of the fluid strain rate s i j and an assumed sub grid viscosity υ s g s 12 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 υ s g s s i j in the present study the turbulent eddy viscosity υ s g s is computed by the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 the wale model produces almost no eddy viscosity in wall bounded laminar flows and is better to reproduce the laminar to turbulent transition compared to the smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 in addition although the dynamic smagorinsky can overcome the ability of model coefficient to adjust the flow field type it needs to consume more computing resources germano et al 1991 hence the wale model is significant for the revealing of the turbulence cavitation interactions in wall bounded flows over a hydrofoil in this paper the turbulent eddy viscosity υ s g s is given as 13 υ s g s ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s

l s min k d c s v 1 3 where k is von karman s constant d is the distance to the closest wall v is the cell volume and c s 1 2 is a model coefficient 2 4 setup of numerical simulation model we use a naca66 hydrofoil in this work with a chord length c 0 15 m the span s h 0 192 m the angle of attack of the hydrofoil is 8 the hydrofoil geometry model and computational domain are consistent with the experimental test by leroux et al 2005 fig 1 shows the computational domain the inlet of the computational domain is 2c from the leading edge of the hydrofoil the outlet is 5c from the trailing edge of the hydrofoil and the upper wall is 1 28c from the lower wall to address ventilated cavitation flow a narrow slot 5 mm downstream from the leading edge of the hydrofoil is defined to inject air into the flow field near the leading edge as shown in fig 2 the ventilation slot is 0 192 m long and the ventilation slot is 0 5 mm wide the boundary of the inlet is the velocity inlet and the velocity v 5 33 m s with reynolds number r e 0 8 10 6 the outlet is the pressure outlet which allows the flow field cavitation to be controlled by the outlet pressure the cavitation number is σ p p v 0 5 ρ l v 2 which has a value of 1 25 in this work the flow field temperature is set to 20 c and the saturated vapor pressure of water is p v 2367 pa the surface of the hydrofoil and the other surfaces of the computational domain are treated as non slip walls the air entrant coefficient c q 3 10 3 is used for the ventilated cavitation where c q is defined as c q q v c s h and q is the volume flow rate of gas injection to study the turbulence features in the wake of the hydrofoil see fig 3 a a monitoring surface is set 1 5c downstream from the trailing edge of the hydrofoil as shown in fig 3 b the monitoring surface is a circular area composed of 13 concentric circles with radial increments of r 13 each concentric circle contains 90 detection points angularly separated from each other by 4 for a more intuitive analysis of the wake field the monitoring surface is divided into eight regions angularly separated by 45 because the research object is symmetrical the division of the monitoring surface is also symmetrical as shown in fig 3 c fig 4 shows the three dimensional mesh of the computational domain to capture the details of the unsteady flow a prismatic layer is created around the hydrofoil and the hydrofoil leading edge trailing edge and ventilation region are encrypted the calculated y 1 the total number of mesh elements is 1 4 107 to analyze the results of the numerical calculation four pressure monitoring points are set on the hydrofoil surface the monitoring points are located on the mid span cross section of the hydrofoil as shown in fig 5 in the present study the time step is set by 5 10 5 s to ensure a maximum courant number to be less than unity everywhere in the computational domain the present numerical solution is based on the finite volume method fvm the volume of fluid vof model is solved by a second order implicit scheme the governing equations are discretized by a second order upwind scheme in space the convection term is discretized by abounded central difference form and the convergence speed is accelerated by the algebraic multi grid amg method meanwhile the segregated flow solver based on the simple algorithm is employed to solve the velocity and pressure coupling problem 2 5 numerical method validation fig 6 compares the transient cavity patterns of the numerical and experimental results leroux et al 2005 the evolution of the cavity structure can be divided into four phases 1 from t 0 0 ms to t 0 7 ms the attached cavity grows slowly and forms a smooth cloud cavity at t 0 7 ms the sheet cavity grows to a maximum the flow moves upstream and the re entrant jet is generated near the closure of the cavity 2 from t 0 7 ms to t 0 21 ms the side wall causes the re entrant jet to form in the middle of the hydrofoil and extend to the side wall the driving of the main stream causes the re entrant jet to develop downstream of the hydrofoil which eventually causes the attached sheet cavity to break up into a u shape 3 at t 0 28 ms the attached sheet cavity completely breaks to form a large scale cavity cloud from t 0 28 ms to t 0 42 ms the large scale cloud cavity sheds and moves downstream and a new attached sheet cavity grows in the low pressure region near the leading edge of the hydrofoil 4 from t 0 42 ms to t 0 49 ms the large scale cavity cloud is transported downstream from the high pressure region and the large scale cavity cloud acquires a u shape and begins to collapse because of the difference in internal and external pressure the resolution of these stages indicates that the evolution of the unsteady cavity evolution is well captured by the numerical simulation during the cavity shedding process the dynamic cavitation flow causes the surface pressure of the hydrofoil to vary significantly thus the dynamic pressure is hard to predict the numerical predictions of pressure fluctuations at point p1 and p2 are plotted in fig 7 left along with the results of experimental measurements comparing the pressure distributions at these points with experimental data shows that the pressure evolution are well predicted despite some noticeable differences the numerical predictions for the pressure spectral content i e the power spectral density or psd at points p1 and p2 are plotted in fig 7 right along with the results of experimental measurements the main frequency of cavitation shedding predicted by numerical simulation is f 19 46 hz whereas the main frequency of cavitation shedding as determined experimentally is f 18 hz the error of the simulation is thus 8 1 and such accuracy is fully acceptable due to the complexity of the cavitating flow thus the periodicity of cloud cavitation flow is well captured which indicates that the proposed numerical method adequately predicts the cavitation dynamics 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of transient cavitation and pressure fig 8 shows the transient cavity patterns at eight typical times for natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation from t 0 0 ms to t 0 21 ms the form of natural cavitation is similar to that of shedding of ventilated cavitation at t 0 7 ms the re entrant jet begins to break up the sheet cavity the natural cavitation breaks off upstream of the hydrofoil under the ventilated cavitation the presence of leading edge air impedes the forward movement of the re entrant jet which moves the sheet cavitation break off position downstream thereby decreasing the volume of the cavity cloud this is one cause of the shortening of the cycle under ventilated cavitation from t 0 28 ms to t 0 49 ms the sheet cavity formed under the ventilated cavitation by the leading edge is longer the shedding cloud cavity is smaller and collapses in advance thus gas injection in the leading edge of the hydrofoil accelerates the evolution of unsteady cavitating flow fig 9 shows the distribution of vapor phase and air phase for natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation on three monitoring sections at three typical moments where the three sections along the span wise direction are defined in fig 9 a it can be seen that the air content near the leading edge is high under the condition of ventilated cavitation it indicates that air injection suppresses natural cavitation and leads to a reduction in vapor cavity content over the hydrofoil moreover it is can also be observed that the vapor cavity is enclosed by air cavity in ventilated cavitating flow and characterized by smaller size the phase content in fig 9 further supports gas injection as one of the causes shortening the cycle under ventilated cavitation and also helps to explain the changes in pulsating pressure in the following discussion to study how air injection affects pressure fluctuations the dynamic pressure data acquired from points p3 and p4 for natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation are shown in fig 10 interestingly the pressure peak for ventilated cavitation is smaller than that for natural cavitation which indicates that ventilation can improve the pressure pulsation on the cavitation hydrofoil surface combined with the volume fraction distribution in fig 9 the water vapor distribution for natural cavitation in the cavitation flow field changes under ventilated cavitation a large air cavity encloses the small vapor cavity and the collapse of the vapor cavity generates a buffering effect and weakens the pressure fluctuations to better illustrate the pressure fluctuations the psd of ventilated cavitation and natural cavitation at points p3 and p4 are plotted in fig 10 right the main frequency of natural cavitation is f 19 46 hz the main frequency of ventilated cavitation shedding is f 23 35 hz thus the dominant shedding frequency increases under ventilated cavitation 3 2 vortex structures for natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation the unsteady characteristics of the cavitation flow field are closely related to the vortex structures the q criterion is an important way to study vortices in cavitation flows the q criterion was proposed by haller 2005 as follows 17 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where q is the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor ω is the vorticity tensor and s is the rate of strain tensor when q 0 it can be used to identify vortex regions where the magnitude of vorticity prevails over the strain rate magnitude at this time the rotation effect dominates when q 0 it can be used to identify vortex regions where the strain rate magnitude prevails over the vorticity magnitude at which point the shear effect dominates fig 11 shows the q distribution on the cavity iso surface for natural and ventilated cavitation overall the evolution of vortices for natural cavitation is similar to that for ventilated cavitation under natural cavitation in the initial phase t 0 0 ms to t 0 7 ms the q value at the leading edge of the hydrofoil is negative whereas it is substantially positive downstream of the attachment cavity this result indicates that the rotation effect dominates in the detached cavity regions when the cavity near the hydrofoil grows to reach the trailing edge t 0 14 ms to t 0 21 ms the higher q value area increases downstream of the hydrofoil at the same time an area of negative q appears near the closed position of the attached cavity and then the shearing effect becomes more significant which indicates that the positive and negative q regions alternate during the development of the attachment cavity and the downstream cavity cloud therefore the rotation effect and the shear effect together dominate the cavitation flow from t 0 28 ms to t 0 49 ms the q distribution near the trailing edge becomes complicated on the surface of the shedding cavity the dominant region of rotation and the dominant region of shearing appear simultaneously and the cavitation flow field becomes very unstable thus in the cavitation flow around the hydrofoil rotation and shear jointly dominate the cavity growth break off and shedding during the unsteady cavitation flow moreover for ventilated cavitation q is positive at the leading edge of the hydrofoil when the cavity is detached the rotational effect of ventilated cavitation is more significant compared with natural cavitation the high q small q areas for ventilated cavitation are larger smaller which shows that rotation dominates in ventilated cavitation therefore ventilation changes the evolution of vortices to address the flow mechanism the detailed vortex structure around the hydrofoil at t 0 0 ms is shown in fig 12 the vortex structure around the hydrofoil surface and wake is shown by the iso surface of q 20 000 s 2 the q iso surface is color coded to facilitate identification of the velocity the laminar layer near the leading edge of the hydrofoil rapidly transitions into a turbulent state through the transition region and the induced motion of the vortex curvature increases the size of the hairpin vortices until they form a typical coherent structure of hairpin vortices fig 13 shows the vortex structure around the hydrofoil over a typical period under natural cavitation the laminar flow front near the leading edge of the hydrofoil quickly becomes unstable moves to the transition zone and then becomes turbulent which indicates that ventilation alters the laminar transition and turbulence distribution features moreover the large scale vortex becomes small scale due to gas injection near the leading edge of the hydrofoil thus ventilation clearly influences the vortex structure of the flow field fig 14 shows vortex structures and wake vortices because the period of ventilated cavitation differs from that of natural cavitation we select a typical case where the wake vortex reaches the same position under the two conditions the main concern is the characteristics of the wake field vortex an interesting discovery is that the large scale vortex at the wake becomes a small scale vortex under ventilated cavitation the wake field will be analyzed in section 3 4 3 3 vorticity dynamics of natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation to identify which vorticity generation mechanism is responsible for natural and ventilated cavitation the vorticity over the hydrofoil is compared and analyzed in detail by using the vorticity transport equation 18 d ω d t ω v ω v ρ m p ρ m 2 ν m ν t 2 ω where ω is the vorticity the first term ω v on the right hand side of the equation is the vortex stretching term which describes the expansion and contraction of the vortex due to the velocity gradient of the flow field which changes the magnitude and direction of the vorticity the second term ω v is the vortex dilatation term which indicates that the volume change causes the vorticity to change the third term ρ m p ρ m 2 is the vortex baroclinic term which describes how the baroclinic moment affects the vorticity due to the nonparallel pressure gradient and density gradient the fourth term ν m ν t 2 ω is the vortex viscosity term which describes the change in vorticity caused by viscous dissipation fig 15 a d show the distribution of total vorticity vorticity x vorticity y and vorticity z respectively of the cavity surface at two typical stages the absolute value of vorticity z is significantly larger than the vortex distribution in the x and y directions interestingly the distribution of the vorticity z is consistent with the distribution of the total vorticity therefore the analysis based on the vorticity transport equation focuses on the z component in the discussion that follows fig 16 shows the distribution on the cavity surface of vorticity z for a typical cycle for natural cavitation flow the vorticity z on the cavity is mostly negative with positive values occurring where the cavity breaks and at the position of the cloud cavity the generation of the re entrant jet reduces the tangential velocity and as the re entrant jet flows backward the negative region of the vorticity component increases for the ventilated cavitation flow in fig 16 the area of small values of negative vorticity z increases and an area of positive values of vorticity z clearly appears at the leading edge of the hydrofoil thus ventilation leads to a more complicated interaction of cavitation flow near the leading edge of the hydrofoil the vortex stretch term is related to the velocity gradient and its evolution shows strong unsteady characteristics the cavitation phenomenon significantly changes the velocity gradient in the flow field which changes the absolute value of the vorticity fig 17 shows that in the initial stage of hydrofoil cavitation t 0 0 ms only a small range of large vortex stretching is obvious during this time cavitation is in the development stage so the re entrant jet forms gradually and the velocity gradient changes little the re entrant jet transmit kinetic energy outward which only drives the fluid movement in a small area and the area where speed exerts an influence is not sufficiently large with the development of cavitation the area where this item exerts an influence gradually expands and the distribution becomes more complicated this is because in this stage t 0 7 ms to t 0 21 ms the re entrant jet form and move along the hydrofoil suction toward the leading edge of the hydrofoil resulting in a large change in the velocity gradient near the suction side of the hydrofoil until the cavity breaks to form a cloud cavity at t 0 28 ms the vortex stretching term grows slowly during this period the vortex tensile strength of the cavity region upstream of the hydrofoil gradually decreases during the stage t 0 28 ms to t 0 49 ms this is due to the slow growth of the cavity and the decreased velocity gradient in this region so vortex stretching is not obvious vortex stretching during cloud cavitation at the trailing edge of the hydrofoil also occurs vortex stretching is intense at the initial stage of cloud cavitation and gradually disappears with the collapse of cavitation under the condition of ventilation the vortex stretching term clearly increases especially at the leading edge of the hydrofoil this is due to the injection of air which increases the gas content and produces a larger change in the velocity gradient the vortex expansion term affects the vortex motion mainly through fluid volume because of cavitation the rate of change of the cavitation area inside the flow field changes causing the vorticity to change fig 18 shows the distribution of the vortex expansion term corresponds to the distribution of the cavitation in addition because of the complicated flow caused by cavitation the fluid volume expansion and the compression area merge together from t 0 0 ms to t 0 21 ms the cavity gradually moves in the positive direction which is due to the gradual development of the attached cavity the gas phase gradually increases in the region and the rate of change of the volume increases the negative rate of change of the volume at the break of the cavity indicates the generation of cloud cavity at the stage from t 0 28 ms to t 0 48 ms cloud cavitation exhibits an elongation shortening pattern and the vortex expansion term alternately takes on positive and negative values this latter result is attributed to mass exchange in different components inside the cavity the region of negative vortex expansion gradually becomes dominant indicating the collapse of the cloud cavity under ventilation a large area of negative values appears at the leading edge of the hydrofoil which is due to the air cavity the injection of air affects the mass exchange of the different components at the leading edge of the hydrofoil the vortex baroclinic term is related to the nonparallel pressure gradient and density gradient for a barotropic fluid whose density is a function only of pressure density and pressure have the same gradient which is zero however in the cavitation flow field the pressure and density gradients are not always parallel especially in the cavity interface and in the closed region which changes the vorticity fig 19 shows the vortex baroclinic term mainly exists where the cavity is generated i e the leading edge of the hydrofoil and the cavity closure region this is because the transfer of the two gas liquid phases changes the gradient of the flow field density but the change is negligible in the attached cavity the generation of cavitation is the main factor changing the generation of flow field vorticity although the magnitude of the vortex baroclinic moment is small compared with the vortex tensile term and the expansion term the vortex baroclinic term is very important for the generation of vortices ji et al 2015 under ventilation the vortex baroclinic moment becomes more complicated especially at the leading edge of the hydrofoil the last term describes the effect of viscosity fig 20 shows the range of viscous dissipation effects is smaller than the range of the other three terms since the viscous diffusion is much smaller than the other terms the vortex viscosity term is generally ignored 3 4 improvement of turbulence in downstream wake to address the hydrofoil wake field we established a velocity monitoring surface see fig 3 the vortex shedding of the hydrofoil strongly influences the wake region of the hydrofoil and the turbulence characteristics in the wake field are important for understanding the system in this work the turbulence characteristics are based on the assumption of random stationary turbulence the axial velocity time series in the long time t is taken to obtain the time average the axial pulsation velocity of the corresponding point can be expressed as 19 u x t j u x t j u x where u x is the velocity in the x direction and t is time the calculation of other characteristic turbulence parameters is based on the pulsation velocity the turbulence intensity is a comprehensive index reflecting the pulsation intensity of the flow field the turbulence is random and arbitrary and its intensity can be calculated from its statistical average the turbulence intensity is expressed as 20 ε x 1 n 1 j 1 n δ u x 2 t j 1 2 u r e f where u r e f is the infinity flow speed and ε x is the turbulence intensity in the x direction fig 21 shows the two dimensional turbulence intensity on the flow field monitoring surface the turbulence is mainly concentrated at the side walls and in the middle at the rear of the hydrofoil and an area with the largest turbulence intensity appears this flow phenomenon is due to the effect of the side walls which cause the large vortex to concentrate in the middle region and the small vortex to concentrate at the side wall note that the flow field pulsation is suppressed under the function of ventilation and the turbulence intensity is reduced as can be seen from fig 8 the cloud cavity formed by cavitation is concentrated in the middle of the hydrofoil the volume of the cloud cavity under ventilation is reduced and the effect on the velocity pulsation of the wake field is weakened as can be seen from fig 14 the side wall at the rear of the hydrofoil forms a vortex wake and a large scale vortex exists in the middle of the wake the vortex becomes smaller under ventilation which weakens the velocity pulsation thus ventilation can effectively reduce the turbulence intensity of the hydrofoil wake field which means that ventilation can improve the velocity pulsation and instability of the hydrofoil wake field fig 22 shows the three dimensional turbulence intensity at the flow field detection surface ventilation clearly improves the turbulence intensity under natural cavitation the maximum turbulence intensity was 0 248 and under ventilated cavitation the maximum turbulence intensity was 0 196 a reduction of 20 9 fig 23 shows the axial average velocity turbulence intensity of a region with different angular ranges the angle interval is shown in fig 3 the improvement in turbulence intensity differs for different angular ranges the improvement in turbulence intensity mainly occurs at the upper part of the monitoring surface 0 90 area the turbulence intensity hardly improves in the lower part of the monitoring surface 90 180 area the region with the greatest improvement in turbulence intensity is in the 0 45 region as can be seen from fig 21 the peak turbulence intensity is in the 0 45 region this region contains a sharp pulsation of velocity and an obvious improvement happens in this region the turbulence flow field contains a series of vortices of different sizes the turbulent integral scale refers to the measure of the largest scale of vertex structure in the flow field which is the scale of the large eddy the axial turbulence integral scale λ is the integral of the axial velocity correlation coefficient r s τ the calculation is 21 r s τ lim n 1 n j 1 n δ u x t j δ u x t j τ 22 λ u x r s 0 0 r s τ d τ fig 24 and fig 25 show the turbulent integral scale on the monitoring surface of the hydrofoil wake region in two dimensions and three dimensions respectively it can be seen that the turbulent integral scale becomes smaller under ventilated cavitation which further demonstrates that ventilation helps to convert large scale vortices into small scale vortices therefore ventilation helps to improve the turbulence characteristics of cavitation flow field in the wake region of the hydrofoil 3 5 influence of ventilation rate on cavity dynamics fig 26 shows the transient cavity patterns at eight typical times for ventilated cavitation under different air entrant coefficient where the air entrant coefficient are c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 respectively it can be seen that the air entrant coefficient has significant impact on the cavity shape and evolution as the air entrant coefficient increases the length of the attached cavity becomes larger typical cavitation flow characteristics such as break off shedding collapse etc can be seen in both cases however it should be noted that there are more scales in cavities and the cavitation evolution become more unstable for the c q 0 009 case the re entrant jet is the dominant factor that causes the cavitation flow around the hydrofoil to shedding therefore we speculate that the large ventilation leads to a more intense interaction between the mainstream and the re entrant jet and subsequently affect the ventilated cavity evolution to address the effect of ventilation rate on dynamic pressure the time history of pressure fluctuations on the suction side of the hydrofoil and the corresponding power spectral density psd for c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 are shown in fig 27 it can be seen that the ventilation rate has significant impact on the pressure evolution as the air entrant coefficient increases the peak pressure becomes smaller in cavitating flow around hydrofoil cavity break up and collapse occurs near the cavity closure region which is responsible for the generation of high pressure as can be seen from fig 26 small scale cavity appears near the cavity closure region for c q 0 009 as a result the larger ventilation rate presents an improved pressure pulsation performance on the surface of hydrofoil moreover to better analyze the pressure fluctuations the power spectral density for different ventilation rate at points p3 and p4 is also shown in fig 27 the main frequency for c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 obtained from the signals are f 19 46 hz and f 23 35 hz respectively combining the cavity evolution characteristics in fig 26 it indicates that the wall pressure is directly related to the cavity behavior and multi scale cavities induce higher frequency pressure pulsations fig 28 shows the time history of the lift coefficient c l lift 0 5 ρ l v 2 c s h and drag coefficient c d drag 0 5 ρ l v 2 c s h for c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 it can be seen that both the lift coefficient and the drag coefficient vary periodically with time but the dynamics of each cycle are still different the average of lift and drag coefficient for c q 0 003 are c l 0 996 c d 0 0673 respectively meanwhile the average of lift and drag coefficient for c q 0 009 are c l 0 109 c d 0 0912 respectively the results reveal that the unsteady hydrodynamic forces under large ventilation rate conditions exhibit an increase compared to these parameters under small ventilation rate conditions therefore one important aspect is to determine the ability of the ventilation to control the hydrodynamic efficiency and simultaneously to adjust the cavity evolution in other words the pressure pulsation on the suction side and the flow in the wake region of the hydrofoil cause the change in the lift coefficient and the drag coefficient 3 6 cavity pulsation patterns of ventilated cavitation based on the above analysis the unsteady cavitation evolution is closely related to the gas injection silberman and song 1961 conducted an experimental study on unsteady ventilated cavitating flow they found that when the ventilation rate was small the pressure inside the cavity increased linearly and the ventilated cavitation number linearly decreased with the increase of ventilation rate however when the critical cavitation number is reached the cavitation will begin to pulsate and there will no longer be a case where the cavitation number decreases linearly with the ventilation rate paryshev 2002 2006 studied the dynamic processes of supercavity and developed the linear theory of cavity stability and oscillations for main cavity types to address the oscillation characteristics of the cavity over hydrofoil the volume fraction of air and vapor on section ii middle section of hydrofoil for c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 are illustrated in fig 29 it can be observed that the cavity interface appears to fluctuate due to the action of gas injection near the leading edge and propagates downstream meanwhile as the increase of ventilation rate the interaction between water gas and vapor becomes more complicated which leads to higher intensity fluctuations in the cavity interface in order to further reveal the cavity pulsation patterns over hydrofoil scheme of the patterns of paryshev s supercavity pulsation and present ventilated cavity pulsation over a hydrofoil are shown in fig 30 for the axisymmetric supercavity flows paryshev found that the generic property of ventilated cavities under various conditions is their oscillatory instability and the gas loss from the cavity is a damping factor for the cavity oscillations recently kinzel et al 2017 found that as jet momentum flux and the axial flow increases interfacial instabilities appear to develop to cavity pulsation however for the cavitating flow over hydrofoil the results by fujii 2007 show that the cavity oscillation is independent of the hydrofoil shape and re entrant jet is not a dominant factor as shown in fig 30 b an interesting cavity pulsation pattern is that the gas injection near the leading edge of the hydrofoil is the dominant factor and re entrant jet promotes the cavitation pulsation intensity 4 conclusion the present study undertakes a numerical simulation of the unsteady cavitating flow around a naca66 hydrofoil by using the les method coupled with the schnerr sauer cavitation model the effects of ventilation on cavity evolution pressure pulsation vortex structures and turbulence features are evaluated in detail the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 ventilation at the leading edge of the hydrofoil alters the evolution of cavitation and improves pressure pulsation on the suction side of the hydrofoil the main shedding frequency of ventilated cavitation is higher than that of natural cavitation and the corresponding cavity growth break off shedding and collapse are accelerated due to gas ventilation for ventilated cavitation the large air cavity encloses the small vapor cavity creating a buffer effect that reduces pressure peak on the suction side of the hydrofoil 2 under the condition of ventilation the vortex structure of the hydrofoil changes significantly when the cavity breaks off the rotational effect of ventilated cavitation is more significant the laminar transition and turbulent flows at the leading edge of the hydrofoil are disturbed due to the gas injection and the larger vortex is replaced by a smaller vortex the injection of gas increases the velocity gradient which increases the vortex stretching term the injection of gas enhances the conversion of the two gas liquid phases which changes the vortex expansion term and the vortex baroclinic term 3 ventilation can improve the velocity pulsation and instability in the wake of the hydrofoil interestingly ventilation can effectively reduce the velocity pulsation in the wake of the hydrofoil and as a result improve the status of turbulence intensity moreover ventilation reduces the turbulence integral scale of the wake field in other words ventilation transforms large scale eddies into small scale vortices 4 ventilation affects the hydrodynamic performance and cavity pulsation patterns large ventilation rate leads to the formation of complex multi scale and more unstable cavities meanwhile when the ventilation rate is increased the pressure peak on the wall of hydrofoil is improved and the pressure pulsation frequency is increased and the lift coefficient and drag coefficient become lager cavity interface pulsation pattern is that the gas injection near the leading edge of the hydrofoil is the dominant factor and re entrant jet promotes the cavitation pulsation intensity author contributions original tiezhi sun conceived and carried out the numerical

22160,cavitation is of great practical interest because unsteady flow features can induce negative effects such as mechanical erosion and noise air injection is an important way to adjust the instability of the cavitation flow field in the present study we numerically simulate a naca66 hydrofoil with a particular emphasis on understanding the effects of ventilation on cavitation characteristics such as cavity dynamics vortex structure and the wake field cavitation is modeled by using the schnerr sauer cavitation model and the large eddy simulation les method is used to calculate the unsteady natural and ventilated cavitation flow the results of the numerical simulation are in good agreement with experiment which verifies the effectiveness of the numerical method the evolution of cavity dynamics and vortex structure are analyzed to clarify how multi scale vortex structures evolve in the flow field the results show that the shedding speed of the ventilated cloud cavity is faster than the natural cavitation in addition ventilation improves the pressure pulsation on the cavitation hydrofoil surface the rotational effect in ventilated cavitation is more significant furthermore ventilation causes strong large scale pulsating eddy currents to rotate into small scale eddies an analysis of the vorticity transfer equation shows that the gas injection increases the velocity gradient and enhances the conversion of the two gas liquid phases the results in the wake of the hydrofoil show that ventilation can effectively reduce the turbulence intensity and turbulence integral scale which indicates that ventilation can improve the velocity pulsation and instability interestingly increasing the ventilation rate helps to improve the pressure peak on the hydrofoil surface and increases the lift and drag coefficient moreover gas injection is responsible for cavity pulsation and the re entrant jet enhances the fluctuation intensity keywords

drops below the local saturated vapor pressure cavities are generated at the internal or liquid solid interface of the liquid this phenomenon is called cavitation batchelor and batchelor 2000 sun et al 2019a b c peng et al 2019 cavitation flow is a complex flow of multi scale cavities accompanied by phase transitions turbulence and unsteady features and occurs in various fluidic machines such as liquid rocket engines turbines marine propellers and hydrofoils sun et al 2019a b c knapp et al 1970 brennen 2005 passandideh fard and roohi 2008 cavitation can cause serious problems in fluid machinery for example a drastic drop in efficiency noise vibration and corrosion cavitation is very difficult to eliminate and remains an open problem therefore seeking effective ways to improve the control of cavitation remains an urgent scientific issue controlling cavitation requires a detailed understanding of the cavitation dynamics especially the unstable flow characteristics sun et al 2016 knapp 1955 observed and analyzed cloud cavitation flow pointing out that the re entrant flow starting from the closed position of the cavitation caused the cloud cavitation to break off ganesh et al 2016 studied experimentally how sheet cavitation evolved into cloud cavitation by using a wedge shaped geometric model they found two types of cavity shedding mechanisms in the cavitation flow field the re entrant jet mechanism and the shock wave mechanism cheng et al 2019 captured unsteady tip leakage cavitating flow by using a large eddy simulation method and found that the spatial evolution of the tip leakage cavitating flow can be divided into three stages their results provide insight into how cavitation influences vorticity and turbulence cavitation generation and collapse are periodic and this periodic pressure shock changes the dynamic characteristics of the flow field while also causing strong vibrations and noise moreover the re entrant jet and shock waves formed during cavitation collapse lead to high pulsating pressure on the material surface arndt 2002 yuan et al 2019 sedlar et al 2016 philipp and lauterborn 1998 reisman et al 1998 studied cloud like cavitation flow around an oscillating hydrofoil by using high speed video and a synchronous pressure sensor measurement they discussed how a changing cavity shape generates a transient pressure pulse on the hydrofoil surface kolahan et al 2019 investigated wavelet analysis of cavitating flow around a sphere and excellent unsteady and dynamic behaviors of cavitation were obtained they found that the flow fluctuations was enhanced by increasing the cavitation number and the low frequency fluctuations played a leading role in the cavitation flow arabnejad et al 2019 studied the cavitation shedding mechanisms from the leading edge of hydrofoils and focused in particular on the onset of erosion their results indicate that the secondary shedding mechanisms result in multiple collapse events in a single primary shedding cycle a no ncondensable gas injected into the cavity will significantly increase the void ratio in the cavity slow down the rate of cavitation collapse and increase the minimum cavitation volume thereby changing the pressure load as cavitation evolves paik et al 2011 brennen 2014 shao et al 2018 arndt et al 1995 used an air injection experiment to evaluate cavitation erosion and found that air injection is effective for minimizing erosion reisman et al 1997 investigated how continuous and pulsed air injection affects sheet cloud cavitation of an oscillating foil they concluded that air injection can reduce cavitation noise and that pulsed air can reduce cavitation noise much more than continuous air injection at the same volumetric flow rate pham et al 1999 studied the mechanism of unsteady plate cavitation and cloud cavitation and found that for a certain range of ventilation gas flow rate cavitation flow is suppressed karn et al 2015 investigated experimentally the turbulent bubbly wake of a ventilated hydrofoil and found that larger bubbles remain close to the injection slot of the hydrofoil because of their greater inertia mäkiharju et al 2017 used the wedge model to study how noncondensable gases affect the evolution of cloud cavitation and found that cavitation and periodic oscillations are suppressed by gas injection liu et al 2017 studied four relatively stable states of a ventilated cavity to determine how froude number and gas entrainment affect the pattern of cavitation flow unsteady cavitation flow involves turbulent flow with phase transitions and multiscale vortex motion in the turbulent state fluid micelles in the flow field undergo irregular random pulsating motion in time and space that involves multiscale vortex bearing unsteady flow arndt et al 1991 kim and lee 2015 long et al 2017 used two typical examples of cavitation shedding dynamics flow in liquid hydrogen to study thermodynamic effects and found that the baroclinic torque is the main cause of vorticity gradients along the detached cavity surface and that vorticity dilatation is mainly responsible for modulating vorticity inside a large scale cavity in addition the effect of ventilation amplifies the complexity of unsteady cavitation flow pendar and roohi 2018 used large eddy simulation to address the turbulent kinetic energy tke and vorticity features the fruitful results showed that high density of tke was found at the cavity interface separated shear layer and re entrant jet interaction with the cavity interface meanwhile the vorticity dilatation was found to be a major parameter in affecting the vorticity in the wake of the multi phase flow wang et al 2018 combined experimental and numerical methods to study the vortex shedding dynamics of ventilated cavitating flow and found that ventilated cavitation strongly affects the vorticity distribution causing higher levels of vorticity to appear around the cavity boundary and large scale counterclockwise and clockwise vertical structures to appear in the wake in cavitation flow simulations the turbulence model plays an important role in predicting unstable cavitation flow and many numerical results depend largely on the turbulence model coutier delgosha et al 2003 wu et al 2005 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 cavitation typically results in the formation of large scale eddy currents involving complex cavity structures most previous simulations have used the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method for cavitation calculations because of its good stability reasonable computational cost and acceptable accuracy sun et al 2016 sun et al 2017 although the rans method is very popular in practical engineering it overestimates the turbulent eddy viscosity huang et al 2013a b roohi et al 2013 rahami et al 2014 with the rapid development of computer technology large eddy simulations less are being increasingly applied to simulate cavitation flow zahiri and roohi 2018 cheng et al 2019 the les method can predict the unstable nature of the flow providing insight into the flow details therefore the cavitation flow les model was used to predict multiscale turbulent vortex characteristics sun et al 2019a b c wu et al 2016 long et al 2018 pendar and roohi 2016 compared the applicability of the rans and les methods to cavitation simulation with a novel approach the cavitation morphology pressure changes and eddy currents under different cavitation numbers were studied the results showed that the combination of les and cavitation model will affect the calculation results the gradual application of the les method to the cavitation problem highlights its advantage over the rans model although natural cavitation vortex structures have been studied extensively by using less wang and ostoja starzewski 2007 bensow and barkimplicit 2010 chen et al 2017 studies of vortex structures under conditions of ventilated cavitation are very limited the periodic shedding of cavitation not only significantly changes the local flow structure but also inevitably changes the downstream wake region which causes strong velocity and pressure pulsations kumar et al 2017 gopalan and kate 2000 used piv technology to study cavitation and found that cavity shedding produces a vortex structure similar to a hairpin and that cavity collapse changes the turbulence characteristics arndt et al 2006 used tr piv to measure the cavitation wake structure of a hydrofoil and found that cavitation can significantly change the flow field structure producing a large number of three dimensional vortices in the wake huang et al 2013a b used dpiv to study the wake field structure around a hydrofoil the results show that during cavitation cloud shedding the local vortex structure changes and the vorticity increases by an order of magnitude although much encouraging work has been done on ventilated cavitation further research is needed the mechanism by which ventilation improves cavitation is not well understood especially pressure pulsation vortex evolution and wake fields the paper reports our numerical study of unsteady natural and ventilated cavitation flow over a naca66 hydrofoil section 2 presents the numerical framework which includes the basic governing equations cavitation models turbulence models and validation of the numerical method section 3 discusses and analyzes how ventilation affects cavity evolution pressure fluctuation vortex structure and the wake field in addition the influence of ventilation rate on cavity dynamics and the cavity pulsation patterns are analyzed finally section 4 summarizes the work and presents the main conclusions 2 mathematical formulations and numerical methods 2 1 governing

simplifying and appropriately correcting the rayleigh plesset cavity dynamics equation rayleigh 1917 plesset 1949 the evaporation and condensation processes are implemented by inserting a source term

scale of fine flow fields the les model is used to calculate turbulent eddies and time averaged flows the les model uses a filtering function to divide the vortices in a turbulent flow into large scale vortices and small scale vortices large scale eddy structures are solved by direct numerical calculations whereas small scale vortices are calculated by establishing relationships with large scale vortices the les governing equations are 9 ρ t ρ μ j x j 0 10 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ τ i j x j where τ i j is the nonlinear sub grid scale sgs stress tensor which is defined

δ i j 2 υ s g s s i j in the present study the turbulent eddy viscosity υ s g s is computed by the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 the wale model produces almost no eddy viscosity in wall bounded laminar flows and is better to reproduce the laminar to turbulent transition compared to the smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 in addition although the dynamic smagorinsky can overcome the ability of model coefficient to adjust the flow field type it needs to consume more computing resources germano et al 1991 hence the wale model is significant for the revealing of the turbulence cavitation interactions in wall bounded flows over a hydrofoil in this paper the turbulent eddy viscosity υ s g s is given as 13 υ s g s ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s

l s min k d c s v 1 3 where k is von karman s constant d is the distance to the closest wall v is the cell volume and c s 1 2 is a model coefficient 2 4 setup of numerical simulation model we use a naca66 hydrofoil in this work with a chord length c 0 15 m the span s h 0 192 m the angle of attack of the hydrofoil is 8 the hydrofoil geometry model and computational domain are consistent with the experimental test by leroux et al 2005 fig 1 shows the computational domain the inlet of the computational domain is 2c from the leading edge of the hydrofoil the outlet is 5c from the trailing edge of the hydrofoil and the upper wall is 1 28c from the lower wall to address ventilated cavitation flow a narrow slot 5 mm downstream from the leading edge of the hydrofoil is defined to inject air into the flow field near the leading edge as shown in fig 2 the ventilation slot is 0 192 m long and the ventilation slot is 0 5 mm wide the boundary of the inlet is the velocity inlet and the velocity v 5 33 m s with reynolds number r e 0 8 10 6 the outlet is the pressure outlet which allows the flow field cavitation to be controlled by the outlet pressure the cavitation number is σ p p v 0 5 ρ l v 2 which has a value of 1 25 in this work the flow field temperature is set to 20 c and the saturated vapor pressure of water is p v 2367 pa the surface of the hydrofoil and the other surfaces of the computational domain are treated as non slip walls the air entrant coefficient c q 3 10 3 is used for the ventilated cavitation where c q is defined as c q q v c s h and q is the volume flow rate of gas injection to study the turbulence features in the wake of the hydrofoil see fig 3 a a monitoring surface is set 1 5c downstream from the trailing edge of the hydrofoil as shown in fig 3 b the monitoring surface is a circular area composed of 13 concentric circles with radial increments of r 13 each concentric circle contains 90 detection points angularly separated from each other by 4 for a more intuitive analysis of the wake field the monitoring surface is divided into eight regions angularly separated by 45 because the research object is symmetrical the division of the monitoring surface is also symmetrical as shown in fig 3 c fig 4 shows the three dimensional mesh of the computational domain to capture the details of the unsteady flow a prismatic layer is created around the hydrofoil and the hydrofoil leading edge trailing edge and ventilation region are encrypted the calculated y 1 the total number of mesh elements is 1 4 107 to analyze the results of the numerical calculation four pressure monitoring points are set on the hydrofoil surface the monitoring points are located on the mid span cross section of the hydrofoil as shown in fig 5 in the present study the time step is set by 5 10 5 s to ensure a maximum courant number to be less than unity everywhere in the computational domain the present numerical solution is based on the finite volume method fvm the volume of fluid vof model is solved by a second order implicit scheme the governing equations are discretized by a second order upwind scheme in space the convection term is discretized by abounded central difference form and the convergence speed is accelerated by the algebraic multi grid amg method meanwhile the segregated flow solver based on the simple algorithm is employed to solve the velocity and pressure coupling problem 2 5 numerical method validation fig 6 compares the transient cavity patterns of the numerical and experimental results leroux et al 2005 the evolution of the cavity structure can be divided into four phases 1 from t 0 0 ms to t 0 7 ms the attached cavity grows slowly and forms a smooth cloud cavity at t 0 7 ms the sheet cavity grows to a maximum the flow moves upstream and the re entrant jet is generated near the closure of the cavity 2 from t 0 7 ms to t 0 21 ms the side wall causes the re entrant jet to form in the middle of the hydrofoil and extend to the side wall the driving of the main stream causes the re entrant jet to develop downstream of the hydrofoil which eventually causes the attached sheet cavity to break up into a u shape 3 at t 0 28 ms the attached sheet cavity completely breaks to form a large scale cavity cloud from t 0 28 ms to t 0 42 ms the large scale cloud cavity sheds and moves downstream and a new attached sheet cavity grows in the low pressure region near the leading edge of the hydrofoil 4 from t 0 42 ms to t 0 49 ms the large scale cavity cloud is transported downstream from the high pressure region and the large scale cavity cloud acquires a u shape and begins to collapse because of the difference in internal and external pressure the resolution of these stages indicates that the evolution of the unsteady cavity evolution is well captured by the numerical simulation during the cavity shedding process the dynamic cavitation flow causes the surface pressure of the hydrofoil to vary significantly thus the dynamic pressure is hard to predict the numerical predictions of pressure fluctuations at point p1 and p2 are plotted in fig 7 left along with the results of experimental measurements comparing the pressure distributions at these points with experimental data shows that the pressure evolution are well predicted despite some noticeable differences the numerical predictions for the pressure spectral content i e the power spectral density or psd at points p1 and p2 are plotted in fig 7 right along with the results of experimental measurements the main frequency of cavitation shedding predicted by numerical simulation is f 19 46 hz whereas the main frequency of cavitation shedding as determined experimentally is f 18 hz the error of the simulation is thus 8 1 and such accuracy is fully acceptable due to the complexity of the cavitating flow thus the periodicity of cloud cavitation flow is well captured which indicates that the proposed numerical method adequately predicts the cavitation dynamics 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of transient cavitation and pressure fig 8 shows the transient cavity patterns at eight typical times for natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation from t 0 0 ms to t 0 21 ms the form of natural cavitation is similar to that of shedding of ventilated cavitation at t 0 7 ms the re entrant jet begins to break up the sheet cavity the natural cavitation breaks off upstream of the hydrofoil under the ventilated cavitation the presence of leading edge air impedes the forward movement of the re entrant jet which moves the sheet cavitation break off position downstream thereby decreasing the volume of the cavity cloud this is one cause of the shortening of the cycle under ventilated cavitation from t 0 28 ms to t 0 49 ms the sheet cavity formed under the ventilated cavitation by the leading edge is longer the shedding cloud cavity is smaller and collapses in advance thus gas injection in the leading edge of the hydrofoil accelerates the evolution of unsteady cavitating flow fig 9 shows the distribution of vapor phase and air phase for natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation on three monitoring sections at three typical moments where the three sections along the span wise direction are defined in fig 9 a it can be seen that the air content near the leading edge is high under the condition of ventilated cavitation it indicates that air injection suppresses natural cavitation and leads to a reduction in vapor cavity content over the hydrofoil moreover it is can also be observed that the vapor cavity is enclosed by air cavity in ventilated cavitating flow and characterized by smaller size the phase content in fig 9 further supports gas injection as one of the causes shortening the cycle under ventilated cavitation and also helps to explain the changes in pulsating pressure in the following discussion to study how air injection affects pressure fluctuations the dynamic pressure data acquired from points p3 and p4 for natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation are shown in fig 10 interestingly the pressure peak for ventilated cavitation is smaller than that for natural cavitation which indicates that ventilation can improve the pressure pulsation on the cavitation hydrofoil surface combined with the volume fraction distribution in fig 9 the water vapor distribution for natural cavitation in the cavitation flow field changes under ventilated cavitation a large air cavity encloses the small vapor cavity and the collapse of the vapor cavity generates a buffering effect and weakens the pressure fluctuations to better illustrate the pressure fluctuations the psd of ventilated cavitation and natural cavitation at points p3 and p4 are plotted in fig 10 right the main frequency of natural cavitation is f 19 46 hz the main frequency of ventilated cavitation shedding is f 23 35 hz thus the dominant shedding frequency increases under ventilated cavitation 3 2 vortex structures for natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation the unsteady characteristics of the cavitation flow field are closely related to the vortex structures the q criterion is an important way to study vortices in cavitation flows the q criterion was proposed by haller 2005 as follows 17 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where q is the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor ω is the vorticity tensor and s is the rate of strain tensor when q 0 it can be used to identify vortex regions where the magnitude of vorticity prevails over the strain rate magnitude at this time the rotation effect dominates when q 0 it can be used to identify vortex regions where the strain rate magnitude prevails over the vorticity magnitude at which point the shear effect dominates fig 11 shows the q distribution on the cavity iso surface for natural and ventilated cavitation overall the evolution of vortices for natural cavitation is similar to that for ventilated cavitation under natural cavitation in the initial phase t 0 0 ms to t 0 7 ms the q value at the leading edge of the hydrofoil is negative whereas it is substantially positive downstream of the attachment cavity this result indicates that the rotation effect dominates in the detached cavity regions when the cavity near the hydrofoil grows to reach the trailing edge t 0 14 ms to t 0 21 ms the higher q value area increases downstream of the hydrofoil at the same time an area of negative q appears near the closed position of the attached cavity and then the shearing effect becomes more significant which indicates that the positive and negative q regions alternate during the development of the attachment cavity and the downstream cavity cloud therefore the rotation effect and the shear effect together dominate the cavitation flow from t 0 28 ms to t 0 49 ms the q distribution near the trailing edge becomes complicated on the surface of the shedding cavity the dominant region of rotation and the dominant region of shearing appear simultaneously and the cavitation flow field becomes very unstable thus in the cavitation flow around the hydrofoil rotation and shear jointly dominate the cavity growth break off and shedding during the unsteady cavitation flow moreover for ventilated cavitation q is positive at the leading edge of the hydrofoil when the cavity is detached the rotational effect of ventilated cavitation is more significant compared with natural cavitation the high q small q areas for ventilated cavitation are larger smaller which shows that rotation dominates in ventilated cavitation therefore ventilation changes the evolution of vortices to address the flow mechanism the detailed vortex structure around the hydrofoil at t 0 0 ms is shown in fig 12 the vortex structure around the hydrofoil surface and wake is shown by the iso surface of q 20 000 s 2 the q iso surface is color coded to facilitate identification of the velocity the laminar layer near the leading edge of the hydrofoil rapidly transitions into a turbulent state through the transition region and the induced motion of the vortex curvature increases the size of the hairpin vortices until they form a typical coherent structure of hairpin vortices fig 13 shows the vortex structure around the hydrofoil over a typical period under natural cavitation the laminar flow front near the leading edge of the hydrofoil quickly becomes unstable moves to the transition zone and then becomes turbulent which indicates that ventilation alters the laminar transition and turbulence distribution features moreover the large scale vortex becomes small scale due to gas injection near the leading edge of the hydrofoil thus ventilation clearly influences the vortex structure of the flow field fig 14 shows vortex structures and wake vortices because the period of ventilated cavitation differs from that of natural cavitation we select a typical case where the wake vortex reaches the same position under the two conditions the main concern is the characteristics of the wake field vortex an interesting discovery is that the large scale vortex at the wake becomes a small scale vortex under ventilated cavitation the wake field will be analyzed in section 3 4 3 3 vorticity dynamics of natural cavitation and ventilated cavitation to identify which vorticity generation mechanism is responsible for natural and ventilated cavitation the vorticity over the hydrofoil is compared and analyzed in detail by using the vorticity transport equation 18 d ω d t ω v ω v ρ m p ρ m 2 ν m ν t 2 ω where ω is the vorticity the first term ω v on the right hand side of the equation is the vortex stretching term which describes the expansion and contraction of the vortex due to the velocity gradient of the flow field which changes the magnitude and direction of the vorticity the second term ω v is the vortex dilatation term which indicates that the volume change causes the vorticity to change the third term ρ m p ρ m 2 is the vortex baroclinic term which describes how the baroclinic moment affects the vorticity due to the nonparallel pressure gradient and density gradient the fourth term ν m ν t 2 ω is the vortex viscosity term which describes the change in vorticity caused by viscous dissipation fig 15 a d show the distribution of total vorticity vorticity x vorticity y and vorticity z respectively of the cavity surface at two typical stages the absolute value of vorticity z is significantly larger than the vortex distribution in the x and y directions interestingly the distribution of the vorticity z is consistent with the distribution of the total vorticity therefore the analysis based on the vorticity transport equation focuses on the z component in the discussion that follows fig 16 shows the distribution on the cavity surface of vorticity z for a typical cycle for natural cavitation flow the vorticity z on the cavity is mostly negative with positive values occurring where the cavity breaks and at the position of the cloud cavity the generation of the re entrant jet reduces the tangential velocity and as the re entrant jet flows backward the negative region of the vorticity component increases for the ventilated cavitation flow in fig 16 the area of small values of negative vorticity z increases and an area of positive values of vorticity z clearly appears at the leading edge of the hydrofoil thus ventilation leads to a more complicated interaction of cavitation flow near the leading edge of the hydrofoil the vortex stretch term is related to the velocity gradient and its evolution shows strong unsteady characteristics the cavitation phenomenon significantly changes the velocity gradient in the flow field which changes the absolute value of the vorticity fig 17 shows that in the initial stage of hydrofoil cavitation t 0 0 ms only a small range of large vortex stretching is obvious during this time cavitation is in the development stage so the re entrant jet forms gradually and the velocity gradient changes little the re entrant jet transmit kinetic energy outward which only drives the fluid movement in a small area and the area where speed exerts an influence is not sufficiently large with the development of cavitation the area where this item exerts an influence gradually expands and the distribution becomes more complicated this is because in this stage t 0 7 ms to t 0 21 ms the re entrant jet form and move along the hydrofoil suction toward the leading edge of the hydrofoil resulting in a large change in the velocity gradient near the suction side of the hydrofoil until the cavity breaks to form a cloud cavity at t 0 28 ms the vortex stretching term grows slowly during this period the vortex tensile strength of the cavity region upstream of the hydrofoil gradually decreases during the stage t 0 28 ms to t 0 49 ms this is due to the slow growth of the cavity and the decreased velocity gradient in this region so vortex stretching is not obvious vortex stretching during cloud cavitation at the trailing edge of the hydrofoil also occurs vortex stretching is intense at the initial stage of cloud cavitation and gradually disappears with the collapse of cavitation under the condition of ventilation the vortex stretching term clearly increases especially at the leading edge of the hydrofoil this is due to the injection of air which increases the gas content and produces a larger change in the velocity gradient the vortex expansion term affects the vortex motion mainly through fluid volume because of cavitation the rate of change of the cavitation area inside the flow field changes causing the vorticity to change fig 18 shows the distribution of the vortex expansion term corresponds to the distribution of the cavitation in addition because of the complicated flow caused by cavitation the fluid volume expansion and the compression area merge together from t 0 0 ms to t 0 21 ms the cavity gradually moves in the positive direction which is due to the gradual development of the attached cavity the gas phase gradually increases in the region and the rate of change of the volume increases the negative rate of change of the volume at the break of the cavity indicates the generation of cloud cavity at the stage from t 0 28 ms to t 0 48 ms cloud cavitation exhibits an elongation shortening pattern and the vortex expansion term alternately takes on positive and negative values this latter result is attributed to mass exchange in different components inside the cavity the region of negative vortex expansion gradually becomes dominant indicating the collapse of the cloud cavity under ventilation a large area of negative values appears at the leading edge of the hydrofoil which is due to the air cavity the injection of air affects the mass exchange of the different components at the leading edge of the hydrofoil the vortex baroclinic term is related to the nonparallel pressure gradient and density gradient for a barotropic fluid whose density is a function only of pressure density and pressure have the same gradient which is zero however in the cavitation flow field the pressure and density gradients are not always parallel especially in the cavity interface and in the closed region which changes the vorticity fig 19 shows the vortex baroclinic term mainly exists where the cavity is generated i e the leading edge of the hydrofoil and the cavity closure region this is because the transfer of the two gas liquid phases changes the gradient of the flow field density but the change is negligible in the attached cavity the generation of cavitation is the main factor changing the generation of flow field vorticity although the magnitude of the vortex baroclinic moment is small compared with the vortex tensile term and the expansion term the vortex baroclinic term is very important for the generation of vortices ji et al 2015 under ventilation the vortex baroclinic moment becomes more complicated especially at the leading edge of the hydrofoil the last term describes the effect of viscosity fig 20 shows the range of viscous dissipation effects is smaller than the range of the other three terms since the viscous diffusion is much smaller than the other terms the vortex viscosity term is generally ignored 3 4 improvement of turbulence in downstream wake to address the hydrofoil wake field we established a velocity monitoring surface see fig 3 the vortex shedding of the hydrofoil strongly influences the wake region of the hydrofoil and the turbulence characteristics in the wake field are important for understanding the system in this work the turbulence characteristics are based on the assumption of random stationary turbulence the axial velocity time series in the long time t is taken to obtain the time average the axial pulsation velocity of the corresponding point can be expressed as 19 u x t j u x t j u x where u x is the velocity in the x direction and t is time the calculation of other characteristic turbulence parameters is based on the pulsation velocity the turbulence intensity is a comprehensive index reflecting the pulsation intensity of the flow field the turbulence is random and arbitrary and its intensity can be calculated from its statistical average the turbulence intensity is expressed as 20 ε x 1 n 1 j 1 n δ u x 2 t j 1 2 u r e f where u r e f is the infinity flow speed and ε x is the turbulence intensity in the x direction fig 21 shows the two dimensional turbulence intensity on the flow field monitoring surface the turbulence is mainly concentrated at the side walls and in the middle at the rear of the hydrofoil and an area with the largest turbulence intensity appears this flow phenomenon is due to the effect of the side walls which cause the large vortex to concentrate in the middle region and the small vortex to concentrate at the side wall note that the flow field pulsation is suppressed under the function of ventilation and the turbulence intensity is reduced as can be seen from fig 8 the cloud cavity formed by cavitation is concentrated in the middle of the hydrofoil the volume of the cloud cavity under ventilation is reduced and the effect on the velocity pulsation of the wake field is weakened as can be seen from fig 14 the side wall at the rear of the hydrofoil forms a vortex wake and a large scale vortex exists in the middle of the wake the vortex becomes smaller under ventilation which weakens the velocity pulsation thus ventilation can effectively reduce the turbulence intensity of the hydrofoil wake field which means that ventilation can improve the velocity pulsation and instability of the hydrofoil wake field fig 22 shows the three dimensional turbulence intensity at the flow field detection surface ventilation clearly improves the turbulence intensity under natural cavitation the maximum turbulence intensity was 0 248 and under ventilated cavitation the maximum turbulence intensity was 0 196 a reduction of 20 9 fig 23 shows the axial average velocity turbulence intensity of a region with different angular ranges the angle interval is shown in fig 3 the improvement in turbulence intensity differs for different angular ranges the improvement in turbulence intensity mainly occurs at the upper part of the monitoring surface 0 90 area the turbulence intensity hardly improves in the lower part of the monitoring surface 90 180 area the region with the greatest improvement in turbulence intensity is in the 0 45 region as can be seen from fig 21 the peak turbulence intensity is in the 0 45 region this region contains a sharp pulsation of velocity and an obvious improvement happens in this region the turbulence flow field contains a series of vortices of different sizes the turbulent integral scale refers to the measure of the largest scale of vertex structure in the flow field which is the scale of the large eddy the axial turbulence integral scale λ is the integral of the axial velocity correlation coefficient r s τ the calculation is 21 r s τ lim n 1 n j 1 n δ u x t j δ u x t j τ 22 λ u x r s 0 0 r s τ d τ fig 24 and fig 25 show the turbulent integral scale on the monitoring surface of the hydrofoil wake region in two dimensions and three dimensions respectively it can be seen that the turbulent integral scale becomes smaller under ventilated cavitation which further demonstrates that ventilation helps to convert large scale vortices into small scale vortices therefore ventilation helps to improve the turbulence characteristics of cavitation flow field in the wake region of the hydrofoil 3 5 influence of ventilation rate on cavity dynamics fig 26 shows the transient cavity patterns at eight typical times for ventilated cavitation under different air entrant coefficient where the air entrant coefficient are c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 respectively it can be seen that the air entrant coefficient has significant impact on the cavity shape and evolution as the air entrant coefficient increases the length of the attached cavity becomes larger typical cavitation flow characteristics such as break off shedding collapse etc can be seen in both cases however it should be noted that there are more scales in cavities and the cavitation evolution become more unstable for the c q 0 009 case the re entrant jet is the dominant factor that causes the cavitation flow around the hydrofoil to shedding therefore we speculate that the large ventilation leads to a more intense interaction between the mainstream and the re entrant jet and subsequently affect the ventilated cavity evolution to address the effect of ventilation rate on dynamic pressure the time history of pressure fluctuations on the suction side of the hydrofoil and the corresponding power spectral density psd for c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 are shown in fig 27 it can be seen that the ventilation rate has significant impact on the pressure evolution as the air entrant coefficient increases the peak pressure becomes smaller in cavitating flow around hydrofoil cavity break up and collapse occurs near the cavity closure region which is responsible for the generation of high pressure as can be seen from fig 26 small scale cavity appears near the cavity closure region for c q 0 009 as a result the larger ventilation rate presents an improved pressure pulsation performance on the surface of hydrofoil moreover to better analyze the pressure fluctuations the power spectral density for different ventilation rate at points p3 and p4 is also shown in fig 27 the main frequency for c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 obtained from the signals are f 19 46 hz and f 23 35 hz respectively combining the cavity evolution characteristics in fig 26 it indicates that the wall pressure is directly related to the cavity behavior and multi scale cavities induce higher frequency pressure pulsations fig 28 shows the time history of the lift coefficient c l lift 0 5 ρ l v 2 c s h and drag coefficient c d drag 0 5 ρ l v 2 c s h for c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 it can be seen that both the lift coefficient and the drag coefficient vary periodically with time but the dynamics of each cycle are still different the average of lift and drag coefficient for c q 0 003 are c l 0 996 c d 0 0673 respectively meanwhile the average of lift and drag coefficient for c q 0 009 are c l 0 109 c d 0 0912 respectively the results reveal that the unsteady hydrodynamic forces under large ventilation rate conditions exhibit an increase compared to these parameters under small ventilation rate conditions therefore one important aspect is to determine the ability of the ventilation to control the hydrodynamic efficiency and simultaneously to adjust the cavity evolution in other words the pressure pulsation on the suction side and the flow in the wake region of the hydrofoil cause the change in the lift coefficient and the drag coefficient 3 6 cavity pulsation patterns of ventilated cavitation based on the above analysis the unsteady cavitation evolution is closely related to the gas injection silberman and song 1961 conducted an experimental study on unsteady ventilated cavitating flow they found that when the ventilation rate was small the pressure inside the cavity increased linearly and the ventilated cavitation number linearly decreased with the increase of ventilation rate however when the critical cavitation number is reached the cavitation will begin to pulsate and there will no longer be a case where the cavitation number decreases linearly with the ventilation rate paryshev 2002 2006 studied the dynamic processes of supercavity and developed the linear theory of cavity stability and oscillations for main cavity types to address the oscillation characteristics of the cavity over hydrofoil the volume fraction of air and vapor on section ii middle section of hydrofoil for c q 0 003 and c q 0 009 are illustrated in fig 29 it can be observed that the cavity interface appears to fluctuate due to the action of gas injection near the leading edge and propagates downstream meanwhile as the increase of ventilation rate the interaction between water gas and vapor becomes more complicated which leads to higher intensity fluctuations in the cavity interface in order to further reveal the cavity pulsation patterns over hydrofoil scheme of the patterns of paryshev s supercavity pulsation and present ventilated cavity pulsation over a hydrofoil are shown in fig 30 for the axisymmetric supercavity flows paryshev found that the generic property of ventilated cavities under various conditions is their oscillatory instability and the gas loss from the cavity is a damping factor for the cavity oscillations recently kinzel et al 2017 found that as jet momentum flux and the axial flow increases interfacial instabilities appear to develop to cavity pulsation however for the cavitating flow over hydrofoil the results by fujii 2007 show that the cavity oscillation is independent of the hydrofoil shape and re entrant jet is not a dominant factor as shown in fig 30 b an interesting cavity pulsation pattern is that the gas injection near the leading edge of the hydrofoil is the dominant factor and re entrant jet promotes the cavitation pulsation intensity 4 conclusion the present study undertakes a numerical simulation of the unsteady cavitating flow around a naca66 hydrofoil by using the les method coupled with the schnerr sauer cavitation model the effects of ventilation on cavity evolution pressure pulsation vortex structures and turbulence features are evaluated in detail the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 ventilation at the leading edge of the hydrofoil alters the evolution of cavitation and improves pressure pulsation on the suction side of the hydrofoil the main shedding frequency of ventilated cavitation is higher than that of natural cavitation and the corresponding cavity growth break off shedding and collapse are accelerated due to gas ventilation for ventilated cavitation the large air cavity encloses the small vapor cavity creating a buffer effect that reduces pressure peak on the suction side of the hydrofoil 2 under the condition of ventilation the vortex structure of the hydrofoil changes significantly when the cavity breaks off the rotational effect of ventilated cavitation is more significant the laminar transition and turbulent flows at the leading edge of the hydrofoil are disturbed due to the gas injection and the larger vortex is replaced by a smaller vortex the injection of gas increases the velocity gradient which increases the vortex stretching term the injection of gas enhances the conversion of the two gas liquid phases which changes the vortex expansion term and the vortex baroclinic term 3 ventilation can improve the velocity pulsation and instability in the wake of the hydrofoil interestingly ventilation can effectively reduce the velocity pulsation in the wake of the hydrofoil and as a result improve the status of turbulence intensity moreover ventilation reduces the turbulence integral scale of the wake field in other words ventilation transforms large scale eddies into small scale vortices 4 ventilation affects the hydrodynamic performance and cavity pulsation patterns large ventilation rate leads to the formation of complex multi scale and more unstable cavities meanwhile when the ventilation rate is increased the pressure peak on the wall of hydrofoil is improved and the pressure pulsation frequency is increased and the lift coefficient and drag coefficient become lager cavity interface pulsation pattern is that the gas injection near the leading edge of the hydrofoil is the dominant factor and re entrant jet promotes the cavitation pulsation intensity author contributions original tiezhi sun conceived and carried out the numerical

22161,a precise evaluation of propeller cavitation inception is imperative in prediction of ship s underwater radiated noise performance in addition to a simple indication on whether the cavitation has occurred or not it would be much more valuable if the location of cavitation occurrence can be identified for a further confirmation hence this work concentrates on establishing an efficient acoustic localization for incipient cavitation using the compressive sensing cs theory rather than the convex minimization approach the greedy type orthogonal matching pursuit omp algorithm is chosen for solving the cs localization problem due to a low computational complexity making it suitable for online applications it is also proposed to employ the singular value decomposition svd based rank estimation for a provision of user input parameter that is essential for initializing the greedy algorithm the suggested localization procedure is validated through the propeller cavitation data

singular value decomposition tvc tip vortex cavitation urn underwater radiated noise 1 introduction propeller cavitation generated by the seagoing vessel is treated as one of important factors in the underwater radiated noise urn once the cavitation takes place beyond the inception the sound spectrum level experiences a significant increment across whole frequency band in turn shadowing other contributing noise sources such as the main engine auxiliary machines and etc as detailed in southall et al 2008 the growth of broadband shipping noise potentially cause a negative impact on the marine life the same applies to the naval ships in order to meet the demand on utmost silence for their underwater surveillance and survivability han et al 2018 a low noise propeller with less cavitating characteristic is definitely desirable in either case which can be facilitated upon a precise knowledge of the cavitation inception lee et al 2012 tani et al 2016 in other words specifying the onset of cavitation is crucial for the prediction and improvement of ship s urn performance in normal practice the inception is evaluated with single channel acoustic investigations monitoring the radiated noise along the ship speed to compare with a cavitation free situation or occasionally performing demon analysis namely the envelope method for a faulty bearing analysis to extract diagnostic information related with the propeller revolution han et al 2018 lee and seo 2013 they only provide a primitive indication on whether the cavitation has occurred but no more convincing evidence of where it occurred even though visual observations using a high speed camera is a possible alternative general applicability is limited to the model test only the full scale ships do not typically approve an installation of the transparent window which is indispensable for an optical access at an incipient stage of cavitation it is well known that the acoustic radiation takes precedence over the visual appearance then another choice would be to exploit acoustic localization techniques with array sensors as they are anticipated to designate the location of cavitation occurrence there is a relatively small body of literature concerning with this topic park et al 2009 adopted the matched field processing mfp a generalization of the beamforming method to find the location of underwater noise source in mfp a resemblance between measurement and replica response prediction on the receiving array vector is calculated for the interested spatial domain so that a high value of correlation indicates the most probable source location among other candidates being considered however such a common technique was hindered by a poor spatial resolution yielding an ambiguity in discriminating the acoustic source map matched field inversion with an optimization algorithm was attempted in kim et al 2015 the objective function defined using the bartlett processor was designed to determine one major source only is therefore not suitable for multiple source distribution moreover non convexity of the objective function is prone to stimulate not only a slow convergence but also non optimality of the result it was soon after that the hyperbolic localization using well estimated time difference of arrival tdoa has been elaborated in author s previous work lee et al 2018 without calculation of the replica vectors the source location is unveiled by intersecting hyperbolic curves computational loads could be alleviated still the intersection based localization was detrimental for resolving the source amplitude and for multi source environment recently introduced from the information theory to solve the underdetermined linear system compressive sensing cs candès and tao 2005 donoho 2006 is firmly granted to overcome aforementioned limitations as far as the solution is sparse enough cs is capable of reconstructing the solution from a few noisy measurements by the use of convex minimization technique the sparsity fits into the class of localization problem because sound sources occupy little extent within the domain of interest applicability of cs in the field of ocean acoustics could be attracted by estimating the direction of arrival doa of planar sources edelmann and gaumond 2011 malioutov et al 2005 xenaki et al 2014 utilization to the propeller cavitation is found in choo and seong 2016 who modified the constraint function to promote the sparsity and consequently to improve the acoustic image however the convex minimization employed in the previous studies is in need of a preset value known as the regularization parameter setting this value is much more difficult and critical as discussed later in this work the localization is carried out with a greedy type orthogonal matching pursuit omp method that is another way of solving the cs problem eldar and kutyniok 2012 foucart and rauhut 2013 as the name greedy suggests the algorithm always makes a hard decision that seems to be the best at each step compared to the convex minimization the greedy method has a number of advantages in terms of speed storage requirement ease of implementation and etc yet the number of sources contributing to the actual acoustic field is also necessary for initialization of the algorithm in a similar fashion to the convex minimization method the author adopts the singular value decomposition svd based method which can be applied effectively for the task at hand thus current investigation has a distinct contribution in that an easy to implement localization for the incipient cavitation of the marine propeller has been established theoretical details will be covered in the subsequent section experimental verifications are continued in section 3 wherein the propeller cavitation data of reference kim et al 2015 is used finally conclusions are made in section 4 2 theory 2 1 overview of acoustic localization with compressive sensing acoustic response for the incipient propeller cavitation is assumed to be described by a collection of equivalent monopole type sources generating sound radiating in all directions fig 1 shows these monopoles with unknown complex strengths x n n 1 n uniformly distributed in a three dimensional space the previous works kim et al 2015 justifies that the direct path components of the cavitation noise is dominant over those from other paths then the pressure measurement at m th hydrophone y m m 1 m for a specific frequency f is written in terms of the free field green function 1 y m n 1 n e j k r m n 4 π r m n x n e m where r mn r m r n is the distance between the m th sensor and n th potential source k 2πf c is the wavenumber with c 1502 m s for water being the speed of sound and e m is the additive noise accounting for not only the measurement noise but also the errors in the assumed model by representing vectors with bold lower case letters and matrices with bold uppercase letters a standard matrix vector expression for equation 1 is 2 y a x e n 1 n a n x n e where y and e m is the measurement and noise vector respectively a m n is the measurement or sensing matrix whose element is given by a mn exp jkr mn 4πr mn and finally x n is the unknown vector of the complex source strength actual cavitation noise sources contributing to the pressure field appear as non zero elements in x whose corresponding coordinates designate their positions that we aim to find in the localization problem the number of potential source candidates n far exceeds the number of measurements m m n besides the sparsity can be postulated on the solution vector x so that it contains only a few large s n values with the other n s values being zero for such a severely ill posed linear system cs is successfully able to reconstruct the solution by using either of two approaches the convex minimization method and the greedy type method eldar and kutyniok 2012 foucart and rauhut 2013 known as basis pursuit bp the former minimizes the convex l 1 norm x 1 n 1 n x n with a constraint asserting that error between the reconstruction and the measurement is less than the upper limit of noise norm this is the so called convex l 1 minimization in the following 3 p 1 min x 1 subject to y a x 2 e 2 where x 2 n 1 n x n 2 1 2 is the euclidean norm the convexity of l 1 norm allows the minimization problem to be treated in the generic linear programming as already realized in open source codes such as cvx grant and boyd 2019 l 1 magic candès 2019 and so on moreover a convergence to the global minimum is guaranteed by the convexity basically cs problem in the above is solved per a single frequency but the measurement error provokes the solution to be appeared with nonzero components at other than the actual source location a practical remedy is to solve repeatedly for interested frequency points and to average them producing a final output it is noteworthy that the acoustic signature of propeller cavitation is characterized by an amplitude modulated impulsive noise lee and seo 2013 this encourages to specify the proper averaging bandwidth with the spectral kurtosis sk antoni 2006 lee et al 2018 a useful tool for indicating the frequency range of periodically repeated impulses drawback of the convex minimization is to tune the upper limit of noise norm e 2 playing the role of the regularization parameter in the optimization theory like the way of lagrange multiplier it controls a balance between the solution sparsity and residual too high setting leads underfitting that the solution does not fit the measurement data faithfully whereas the opposite is likely to cause overfitting or a lack of generalization unfortunately specifying the proper value of e 2 is not easy unless noise variance is known we encounter the same question in many inverse acoustic problems whose output strongly depends on this value kim and nelson 2004 in addition the convex minimization technique pays the price of losing the speed this becomes critical especially when the minimization routine is repeated over the interested frequency band an alternative to the sparse approximation is the latter any algorithm that chooses a local optimum at each stage with the hope of reaching the global minimum at last there are variety of greedy method depending on how the approximation of x in each iteration is made as mentioned the present effort employs orthogonal matching pursuit omp that is recognized as a common and fast greedy algorithm omp updates the support set of the solution iteratively and approximates the solution until a prescribed stopping criterion see appendix for details the constraint in equation 3 can be a candidate for the criterion as long as we are familiar with the measurement noise to provide e 2 instead it was proved in the reference foucart and rauhut 2013 that the success of s sparse vector recovery can be achieved at most s iterations of the omp in other words perceiving that x is s sparse vector allows to iterate omp algorithm for s times only the target sparsity s designating the number of sources is definitely unknown in most cases analogous to the former approach sparsity estimation for the solution vector x is a prerequisite that applies to the greedy algorithms universally 2 2 sparsity the number of sources estimation using the singular value decomposition the cavitation even in an inception stage involves the collapse of numerous bubbles so there may be many cavitation noise sources some of which are coherent in that situation it is extremely difficult to accurately specify the number of sources contributing the response but if incoherency of these sources is plausible we can extend the scope of singular value decomposition svd that is a numerically stable and efficient method it has been widely engaged in various application such as subspace estimation spectral analysis system identification denoising and more besides the following explains that one useful usage of svd is for determining the effective rank of a matrix equivalently the sparsity let x s s be the vector obtained by collecting independent sources from x that is x s x supp x where supp x is the index set of non zero entries of x i e supp x n x n 0 for noiseless case equation 2 is rewritten as 4 y a s x s where the submatrix a s m s is with column indices supp x in a post multiplying by y h h hermitian transpose and taking expectation of both sides gives bendat and piersol 2010 5 g y y a s g x s x s a s h where g yy m m is the output cross spectral density matrix osdm 6 g y y e y 1 y 2 y m y 1 y 2 y m g y 1 y 1 g y 1 y 2 g y 1 y m g y 2 y 1 g y 2 y 2 g y 2 y m g y m y 1 g y m y 2 g y m y m and g x s x s s s is the input

conjugate the isdm g x s x s is full rank i e rank g x s x s s as it is derived from s independent input sources the rank of submatrix a s is also s provided that the sensors are in different physical location and that the number of measurements is larger than that of the sources m s from the matrix theory the following property rank ab min rank a rank b is valid for any two matrices a and b strang 2006 where the equality condition holds when either a or b is non singular applying these to equation 5 yields an important relation 8 r a n k g y y s pointing out that the number of sources or the sparsity can be determined by simply investigating the rank of osdm carrying out svd on g yy produces 9 g y y u σ v h where u and v are m m unitary matrices and σ is m m diagonal matrix with the diagonal element σ i being the singular values note that osdm is a hermitian matrix namely g yy g y y h so the svd is simplified to the eigenvalue decomposition the singular values or the eigenvalues are automatically arranged in decreasing order and satisfy σ 1 σ 2 σ s 0 for a noiseless case hence the number of non zero singular values corresponds to the rank of osdm the existence of noise actually regularizes osdm making a greater rank than it really should be or usually a full rank as a result zero singular values do not exist anymore but deviate to insignificant values such that 10 σ i ε i 1 s σ i ε i s 1 m where ε is the threshold counting the singular values whose magnitude is greater than the measurement error or a certain threshold would indicate the effective rank of osdm to this end the sequence of singular values is plotted as a function of frequency the effective rank i e the number of sources is specified by choosing a point where a sudden decrement takes place in the sequence of course it might be no longer possible in a presence of high noise level a further offset in the threshold makes it obscure to distinguish the point of a sudden change as experimentally confirmed in the next section signal to noise ratio snr of the cavitation response is fair enough so that the above selection scheme can be adhered 3 application to propeller cavitation experiment 3 1 measurement set up in order for a verification of the localization method a model scale experiment was carried out in the water tunnel of the samsung ship model basin ssmb fig 2 schematically shows a model ship installed in a test section with the dimension of 12 m length 3 m width 1 4 m height a water tight dynamometer inside the model ship drives the model propeller while measuring its thrust torque and the rotational speed the four bladed model propeller with diameter of 0 238 m rotates clockwise when seen from the behind acoustic signals by the cavitation were received by the miniature hydrophone model b k 8103 possessing a flat frequency response over the range of 0 1 hz 180 khz as shown in the right part of fig 2 six hydrophones m 6 were distributed on the outer hull surface above the propeller the array geometry falls into the category of random rather than regular this makes the measurement matrix a random beneficial for an improved performance of the greedy algorithm foucart and rauhut 2013 the hydrophone signals were amplified by the signal conditioner model b k 2690 and recorded into the computer based measurement system with a sufficiently high sampling frequency of 256 khz the cavitation test was performed by adjusting the three parameters water flow speed in the tunnel v t m s revolution rate of propeller n s hz and finally pressure in the tunnel p t n m2 the first two parameters were kept constant to maintain the propeller loading while the tunnel pressure was subjected to a variation to develop the cavitation along its decrement beginning from a high tunnel pressure which assured no cavity on the propeller blade acoustic measurements at four conditions were conducted by lowering the tunnel pressure the test conditions are summarized in table 1 optical inspection for the cavity was simultaneously made using a high speed camera model photoron sa 5 the localization output is verified by comparison with camera images more details on the test procedure can be found in section 3 of kim et al 2015 3 2 estimation for the number of sources in fig 3 the growth of power spectral density along the depressurization is noticed for several frequency bands in comparison with non cavitating condition concretely the spectrum of test case 2 exhibit slight increments 3 db in the two frequency bands 1 4 khz and over 20 khz this suggests to regard test case 2 as a sub visual inception even though no cavitation event was observable in the optical images for test case 3 designated as the visual inception condition a tip vortex cavitation tvc at the top of 12 o clock position weakly blinks with a degree enough to be caught on the camera see fig 4 a relevant spectral changes confined in the high frequency band over 20 khz is similar to the acoustic signature of pop type noise chang and ceccio 2011 being characterized by a sharp broadband peak or impact like signal the pop sound offers a strong evidence for the onset of cavitation for the most severe condition test case 4 the elongated tvc shown in fig 4 b develops well along the propeller slipstream the volumetric oscillation of elongated tvc is known to produce not only the pop sound but also chirp a tonal bursting with much longer in duration than a pop with frequencies on the order of a few kilohertz chang and ceccio 2011 those two factors are regarded to contribute the enlargement of spectrum for entire frequency range above statement is manifested by the spectral kurtosis sk antoni 2006 fig 5 illustrates that the maximum of sk is found for several tens of kilohertz rather than for low frequency band since sk takes high values in the frequency band where the impulsiveness of signal concerns we confirm diagnostic information for the cavitation inception i e the pop sound is contained in the high frequency band what also follows is that the localization of incipient cavitation needs to be conducted within aforementioned frequencies for determination of the number of sources i e the sparsity s 6 6 osdm was formed with the following spectral estimation parameters hanning window 2048 data points fft and an ensemble average of 1000 times with 75 overlapping fig 6 represent a plot for the singular values of osdm as a function of frequency the sensitivity of the result was checked for several combinations of processing parameters but there was no significant variation than shown for the non cavitating case in fig 6 a it is difficult to identify the singular values much larger than the base level this is not the cases for both sub visual fig 6 b and visual inception fig 6 c one significant singular value is observable particularly accentuated in the vicinity of frequency ranges where the value of sk becomes large marked by shaded area in the figure in order to highlight this more explicitly the forward difference of singular value is computed as follows 11 d i σ i σ i 1 i 1 2 m 1 which characterizes the rate of change between two adjacent singular values if the variation is significant at the n th singular value the sequence of d i would have a sharp peak at d n evaluations of these sequences at f 41 khz are shown in fig 7 where a substantial drop from d 1 to d 2 is easily noticed for test cases 2 3 in other words the maximum sudden change in the singular values occurs at the first coordinate we thus can estimate the rank of osdm as unity or correspondingly one incoherent source s 1 within the interested frequencies fig 6 d reveals that the transition to test case 4 pushes all singular values to a higher level in addition no existence of the sudden change point brings a difficulty for the estimation of s this is confirmed again by fig 7 where the sequence d i displays a monotonic decrement see the curve for test case 4 therein developed cavitation far beyond the inception comprises numerous individual air bubbles many of which eventually turn into individual acoustic sources then the number of sources contributing to acoustic field for this case would be greater than those in the incipient situation as far as the matured cavitation is concerned hence the source number estimation using the svd is inappropriate without additional measurements it does not mean a breakdown of the localization however as demonstrated in the next section 3 3 localization results the scan zone in fig 2 is with dimension of 0 15 m length 0 3 m width 0 3 m height and was chosen to include a possible area where the incipient tvc is likely to occur the box was uniformly discretized with a spatial resolution of 0 01 m so that the number of unknowns n becomes 15376 16 31 31 despite being suffered from a computational burden a finer resolution may alleviate the basis mismatch phenomenon xenaki et al 2014 that occurs when the location of actual source does not coincide with the point on the selected grid due to inadequate discretization however this adversely increases the mutual coherency of the measurement matrix a thus deterioration in the localization quality is followed by the above resolution was selected from its parametric variation that examines the raised trade off relationship we in fig 8 firstly demonstrate localization of the invisible cavity witnessed in test case 2 for a comparison purpose the cs problem p 1 in equation 3 is solved with the omp algorithm in appendix and with the convex minimization scheme using cvx toolbox grant boyd 2019 separately note that incoherent average for the concerned frequency band 32 8 43 7 khz was applied for both ways to emphasize the actual source while suppressing false spurious alarms because the noise level is priorly unknown two trial values were considered in the convex minimization as representative cases for under fitting e 2 10 1 and over fitting e 2 10 5 they produce the acoustic source maps in fig 8 a and b respectively where the result is shown for the dynamic range of 6 db high strength values appear around the upper and downstream region of the propeller which is regarded as possible locations of the incipient tvc but the distribution along z direction cause an ambiguity exaggerated more for a small regularization parameter setting such a range dependent resolution issue is associated with the array arrangement in a planar shape the regularization parameter larger than 10 1 would probably enhance the sparsity of the solution leaving it less ambiguous however an approach other than the trial and error is anticipated to have an appropriate user parameter for example the automatic selection method in malioutov et al 2005 for reference the convex minimization method was also troubled by a relatively high computing cost consuming about 10 20 s on the personal computer with intel i7 class processor and 32 mb memory in fig 8 c omp with letting s 1 impressively finds the source at one specific point cpu time was merely about 2 3 s in spite of repetitive solving for the frequency averaging indeed the single point localization at the same location was obtainable for most concerned frequencies this could be not possible without the prior determination of the sparsity additional investigation assumes a case where the number of sources is incorrectly estimated as s 4 fig 8 d delivers an ambiguity again around the top of 12 o clock position appealing that the greedy algorithm is lack of robustness against the error in estimating the number of sources and that the proposed source counting method can be effectively employed fig 9 represents the source maps for the visual inception case test case 3 with the same setting in fig 8 the tendency does not greatly differ from the previous case based on comparison with fig 4 a omp with s 1 fig 9 c is still considered as the best among other trials the final task is to localize the developed tvc which is very challenging due to existence of many sources in fig 10 a and b the convex minimization discloses two main colonies along the propeller slip stream these locations are considered to possess a fairly reasonable correlation with the appearance of stretched tvc shown in fig 4 b however ambiguity arisen by the range resolution issue is severely pronounced over the acoustic map although the source number estimation for this test case was not possible as we have seen in fig 6 d the localization via omp was done by assuming s deliberately with letting s 1 the greedy algorithm remains two major sources one of which is falsely located outside the propeller disc fig 10 c meanwhile fig 10 d displays that setting s as 4 places the sources in more realistic locations near the propeller tip in consistent with the prior inference from svd analysis the improvement asserts that developed cavitation encompasses at least four acoustic sources a natural way to confirm this is to allow more sources in the solution however the value of s could be increased only up to 6 since its further increase violates the requirement for the number of minimal measurements i e m s small increment of s was not adequate to make any noticeable change from fig 10 d as mentioned additional sensors are necessary to determine the number of sources and consequently to attain a refined source map this was not attempted however because our practical concern is laid in the incipient cavitation not in the developed 4 concluding remark the aim of the present study was to propose a method for localizing the incipient cavitation in a marine propeller the conventional greedy method one of the popular algorithms in the compressive sensing theory was mainly utilized yet bottleneck was a prerequisite for the number of sources applied as a stopping criterion in order to tackle the raised matter the singular value decomposition svd based method was adhered in more detail the key strategy for estimating the number of sources was to estimate the effective rank of the output cross spectral matrix osdm by counting its dominant singular values the proposed method has a distinct advantage in that the localization can be accomplished much more efficiently than the convex minimization method through the measurement data in a water cavitation tunnel it was demonstrated that the suggested localization scheme works well for the incipient tip vortex cavitation nevertheless this was not the case for a developed cavitation far beyond the incipient either measurements with additional sensors or a further investigation into other processing algorithm is expected for the unresolved item which deserves to be

22161,a precise evaluation of propeller cavitation inception is imperative in prediction of ship s underwater radiated noise performance in addition to a simple indication on whether the cavitation has occurred or not it would be much more valuable if the location of cavitation occurrence can be identified for a further confirmation hence this work concentrates on establishing an efficient acoustic localization for incipient cavitation using the compressive sensing cs theory rather than the convex minimization approach the greedy type orthogonal matching pursuit omp algorithm is chosen for solving the cs localization problem due to a low computational complexity making it suitable for online applications it is also proposed to employ the singular value decomposition svd based rank estimation for a provision of user input parameter that is essential for initializing the greedy algorithm the suggested localization procedure is validated through the propeller cavitation data

singular value decomposition tvc tip vortex cavitation urn underwater radiated noise 1 introduction propeller cavitation generated by the seagoing vessel is treated as one of important factors in the underwater radiated noise urn once the cavitation takes place beyond the inception the sound spectrum level experiences a significant increment across whole frequency band in turn shadowing other contributing noise sources such as the main engine auxiliary machines and etc as detailed in southall et al 2008 the growth of broadband shipping noise potentially cause a negative impact on the marine life the same applies to the naval ships in order to meet the demand on utmost silence for their underwater surveillance and survivability han et al 2018 a low noise propeller with less cavitating characteristic is definitely desirable in either case which can be facilitated upon a precise knowledge of the cavitation inception lee et al 2012 tani et al 2016 in other words specifying the onset of cavitation is crucial for the prediction and improvement of ship s urn performance in normal practice the inception is evaluated with single channel acoustic investigations monitoring the radiated noise along the ship speed to compare with a cavitation free situation or occasionally performing demon analysis namely the envelope method for a faulty bearing analysis to extract diagnostic information related with the propeller revolution han et al 2018 lee and seo 2013 they only provide a primitive indication on whether the cavitation has occurred but no more convincing evidence of where it occurred even though visual observations using a high speed camera is a possible alternative general applicability is limited to the model test only the full scale ships do not typically approve an installation of the transparent window which is indispensable for an optical access at an incipient stage of cavitation it is well known that the acoustic radiation takes precedence over the visual appearance then another choice would be to exploit acoustic localization techniques with array sensors as they are anticipated to designate the location of cavitation occurrence there is a relatively small body of literature concerning with this topic park et al 2009 adopted the matched field processing mfp a generalization of the beamforming method to find the location of underwater noise source in mfp a resemblance between measurement and replica response prediction on the receiving array vector is calculated for the interested spatial domain so that a high value of correlation indicates the most probable source location among other candidates being considered however such a common technique was hindered by a poor spatial resolution yielding an ambiguity in discriminating the acoustic source map matched field inversion with an optimization algorithm was attempted in kim et al 2015 the objective function defined using the bartlett processor was designed to determine one major source only is therefore not suitable for multiple source distribution moreover non convexity of the objective function is prone to stimulate not only a slow convergence but also non optimality of the result it was soon after that the hyperbolic localization using well estimated time difference of arrival tdoa has been elaborated in author s previous work lee et al 2018 without calculation of the replica vectors the source location is unveiled by intersecting hyperbolic curves computational loads could be alleviated still the intersection based localization was detrimental for resolving the source amplitude and for multi source environment recently introduced from the information theory to solve the underdetermined linear system compressive sensing cs candès and tao 2005 donoho 2006 is firmly granted to overcome aforementioned limitations as far as the solution is sparse enough cs is capable of reconstructing the solution from a few noisy measurements by the use of convex minimization technique the sparsity fits into the class of localization problem because sound sources occupy little extent within the domain of interest applicability of cs in the field of ocean acoustics could be attracted by estimating the direction of arrival doa of planar sources edelmann and gaumond 2011 malioutov et al 2005 xenaki et al 2014 utilization to the propeller cavitation is found in choo and seong 2016 who modified the constraint function to promote the sparsity and consequently to improve the acoustic image however the convex minimization employed in the previous studies is in need of a preset value known as the regularization parameter setting this value is much more difficult and critical as discussed later in this work the localization is carried out with a greedy type orthogonal matching pursuit omp method that is another way of solving the cs problem eldar and kutyniok 2012 foucart and rauhut 2013 as the name greedy suggests the algorithm always makes a hard decision that seems to be the best at each step compared to the convex minimization the greedy method has a number of advantages in terms of speed storage requirement ease of implementation and etc yet the number of sources contributing to the actual acoustic field is also necessary for initialization of the algorithm in a similar fashion to the convex minimization method the author adopts the singular value decomposition svd based method which can be applied effectively for the task at hand thus current investigation has a distinct contribution in that an easy to implement localization for the incipient cavitation of the marine propeller has been established theoretical details will be covered in the subsequent section experimental verifications are continued in section 3 wherein the propeller cavitation data of reference kim et al 2015 is used finally conclusions are made in section 4 2 theory 2 1 overview of acoustic localization with compressive sensing acoustic response for the incipient propeller cavitation is assumed to be described by a collection of equivalent monopole type sources generating sound radiating in all directions fig 1 shows these monopoles with unknown complex strengths x n n 1 n uniformly distributed in a three dimensional space the previous works kim et al 2015 justifies that the direct path components of the cavitation noise is dominant over those from other paths then the pressure measurement at m th hydrophone y m m 1 m for a specific frequency f is written in terms of the free field green function 1 y m n 1 n e j k r m n 4 π r m n x n e m where r mn r m r n is the distance between the m th sensor and n th potential source k 2πf c is the wavenumber with c 1502 m s for water being the speed of sound and e m is the additive noise accounting for not only the measurement noise but also the errors in the assumed model by representing vectors with bold lower case letters and matrices with bold uppercase letters a standard matrix vector expression for equation 1 is 2 y a x e n 1 n a n x n e where y and e m is the measurement and noise vector respectively a m n is the measurement or sensing matrix whose element is given by a mn exp jkr mn 4πr mn and finally x n is the unknown vector of the complex source strength actual cavitation noise sources contributing to the pressure field appear as non zero elements in x whose corresponding coordinates designate their positions that we aim to find in the localization problem the number of potential source candidates n far exceeds the number of measurements m m n besides the sparsity can be postulated on the solution vector x so that it contains only a few large s n values with the other n s values being zero for such a severely ill posed linear system cs is successfully able to reconstruct the solution by using either of two approaches the convex minimization method and the greedy type method eldar and kutyniok 2012 foucart and rauhut 2013 known as basis pursuit bp the former minimizes the convex l 1 norm x 1 n 1 n x n with a constraint asserting that error between the reconstruction and the measurement is less than the upper limit of noise norm this is the so called convex l 1 minimization in the following 3 p 1 min x 1 subject to y a x 2 e 2 where x 2 n 1 n x n 2 1 2 is the euclidean norm the convexity of l 1 norm allows the minimization problem to be treated in the generic linear programming as already realized in open source codes such as cvx grant and boyd 2019 l 1 magic candès 2019 and so on moreover a convergence to the global minimum is guaranteed by the convexity basically cs problem in the above is solved per a single frequency but the measurement error provokes the solution to be appeared with nonzero components at other than the actual source location a practical remedy is to solve repeatedly for interested frequency points and to average them producing a final output it is noteworthy that the acoustic signature of propeller cavitation is characterized by an amplitude modulated impulsive noise lee and seo 2013 this encourages to specify the proper averaging bandwidth with the spectral kurtosis sk antoni 2006 lee et al 2018 a useful tool for indicating the frequency range of periodically repeated impulses drawback of the convex minimization is to tune the upper limit of noise norm e 2 playing the role of the regularization parameter in the optimization theory like the way of lagrange multiplier it controls a balance between the solution sparsity and residual too high setting leads underfitting that the solution does not fit the measurement data faithfully whereas the opposite is likely to cause overfitting or a lack of generalization unfortunately specifying the proper value of e 2 is not easy unless noise variance is known we encounter the same question in many inverse acoustic problems whose output strongly depends on this value kim and nelson 2004 in addition the convex minimization technique pays the price of losing the speed this becomes critical especially when the minimization routine is repeated over the interested frequency band an alternative to the sparse approximation is the latter any algorithm that chooses a local optimum at each stage with the hope of reaching the global minimum at last there are variety of greedy method depending on how the approximation of x in each iteration is made as mentioned the present effort employs orthogonal matching pursuit omp that is recognized as a common and fast greedy algorithm omp updates the support set of the solution iteratively and approximates the solution until a prescribed stopping criterion see appendix for details the constraint in equation 3 can be a candidate for the criterion as long as we are familiar with the measurement noise to provide e 2 instead it was proved in the reference foucart and rauhut 2013 that the success of s sparse vector recovery can be achieved at most s iterations of the omp in other words perceiving that x is s sparse vector allows to iterate omp algorithm for s times only the target sparsity s designating the number of sources is definitely unknown in most cases analogous to the former approach sparsity estimation for the solution vector x is a prerequisite that applies to the greedy algorithms universally 2 2 sparsity the number of sources estimation using the singular value decomposition the cavitation even in an inception stage involves the collapse of numerous bubbles so there may be many cavitation noise sources some of which are coherent in that situation it is extremely difficult to accurately specify the number of sources contributing the response but if incoherency of these sources is plausible we can extend the scope of singular value decomposition svd that is a numerically stable and efficient method it has been widely engaged in various application such as subspace estimation spectral analysis system identification denoising and more besides the following explains that one useful usage of svd is for determining the effective rank of a matrix equivalently the sparsity let x s s be the vector obtained by collecting independent sources from x that is x s x supp x where supp x is the index set of non zero entries of x i e supp x n x n 0 for noiseless case equation 2 is rewritten as 4 y a s x s where the submatrix a s m s is with column indices supp x in a post multiplying by y h h hermitian transpose and taking expectation of both sides gives bendat and piersol 2010 5 g y y a s g x s x s a s h where g yy m m is the output cross spectral density matrix osdm 6 g y y e y 1 y 2 y m y 1 y 2 y m g y 1 y 1 g y 1 y 2 g y 1 y m g y 2 y 1 g y 2 y 2 g y 2 y m g y m y 1 g y m y 2 g y m y m and g x s x s s s is the input

conjugate the isdm g x s x s is full rank i e rank g x s x s s as it is derived from s independent input sources the rank of submatrix a s is also s provided that the sensors are in different physical location and that the number of measurements is larger than that of the sources m s from the matrix theory the following property rank ab min rank a rank b is valid for any two matrices a and b strang 2006 where the equality condition holds when either a or b is non singular applying these to equation 5 yields an important relation 8 r a n k g y y s pointing out that the number of sources or the sparsity can be determined by simply investigating the rank of osdm carrying out svd on g yy produces 9 g y y u σ v h where u and v are m m unitary matrices and σ is m m diagonal matrix with the diagonal element σ i being the singular values note that osdm is a hermitian matrix namely g yy g y y h so the svd is simplified to the eigenvalue decomposition the singular values or the eigenvalues are automatically arranged in decreasing order and satisfy σ 1 σ 2 σ s 0 for a noiseless case hence the number of non zero singular values corresponds to the rank of osdm the existence of noise actually regularizes osdm making a greater rank than it really should be or usually a full rank as a result zero singular values do not exist anymore but deviate to insignificant values such that 10 σ i ε i 1 s σ i ε i s 1 m where ε is the threshold counting the singular values whose magnitude is greater than the measurement error or a certain threshold would indicate the effective rank of osdm to this end the sequence of singular values is plotted as a function of frequency the effective rank i e the number of sources is specified by choosing a point where a sudden decrement takes place in the sequence of course it might be no longer possible in a presence of high noise level a further offset in the threshold makes it obscure to distinguish the point of a sudden change as experimentally confirmed in the next section signal to noise ratio snr of the cavitation response is fair enough so that the above selection scheme can be adhered 3 application to propeller cavitation experiment 3 1

2 10 1 and over fitting e 2 10 5 they produce the acoustic source maps in fig 8 a and b respectively where the result is shown for the dynamic range of 6 db high strength values appear around the upper and downstream region of the propeller which is regarded as possible locations of the incipient tvc but the distribution along z direction cause an ambiguity exaggerated more for a small regularization parameter setting such a range dependent resolution issue is associated with the array arrangement in a planar shape the regularization parameter larger than 10 1 would probably enhance the sparsity of the solution leaving it less ambiguous however an approach other than the trial and error is anticipated to have an appropriate user parameter for example the automatic selection method in malioutov et al 2005 for reference the convex minimization method was also troubled by a relatively high computing cost consuming about 10 20 s on the personal computer with intel i7 class processor and 32 mb memory in fig 8 c omp with letting s 1 impressively finds the source at one specific point cpu time was merely about 2 3 s in spite of repetitive solving for the frequency averaging indeed the single point localization at the same location was obtainable for most concerned frequencies this could be not possible without the prior determination of the sparsity additional investigation assumes a case where the number of sources is incorrectly estimated as s 4 fig 8 d delivers an ambiguity again around the top of 12 o clock position appealing that the greedy algorithm is lack of robustness against the error in estimating the number of sources and that the proposed source counting method can be effectively employed fig 9 represents the source maps for the visual inception case test case 3 with the same setting in fig 8 the tendency does not greatly differ from the previous case based on comparison with fig 4 a omp with s 1 fig 9 c is still considered as the best among other trials the final task is to localize the developed tvc which is very challenging due to existence of many sources in fig 10 a and b the convex minimization discloses two main colonies along the propeller slip stream these locations are considered to possess a fairly reasonable correlation with the appearance of stretched tvc shown in fig 4 b however ambiguity arisen by the range resolution issue is severely pronounced over the acoustic map although the source number estimation for this test case was not possible as we have seen in fig 6 d the localization via omp was done by assuming s deliberately with letting s 1 the greedy algorithm remains two major sources one of which is falsely located outside the propeller disc fig 10 c meanwhile fig 10 d displays that setting s as 4 places the sources in more realistic locations near the propeller tip in consistent with the prior inference from svd analysis the improvement asserts that developed cavitation encompasses at least four acoustic sources a natural way to confirm this is to allow more sources in the solution however the value of s could be increased only up to 6 since its further increase violates the requirement for the number of minimal measurements i e m s small increment of s was not adequate to make any noticeable change from fig 10 d as mentioned additional sensors are necessary to determine the number of sources and consequently to attain a refined source map this was not attempted however because our practical concern is laid in the incipient cavitation not in the developed 4 concluding remark the aim of the present study was to propose a method for localizing the incipient cavitation in a marine propeller the conventional greedy method one of the popular algorithms in the compressive sensing theory was mainly utilized yet bottleneck was a prerequisite for the number of sources applied as a stopping criterion in order to tackle the raised matter the singular value decomposition svd based method was adhered in more detail the key strategy for estimating the number of sources was to estimate the effective rank of the output cross spectral matrix osdm by counting its dominant singular values the proposed method has a distinct advantage in that the localization can be accomplished much more efficiently than the convex minimization method through the measurement data in a water cavitation tunnel it was demonstrated that the suggested localization scheme works well for the incipient tip vortex cavitation nevertheless this was not the case for a developed cavitation far beyond the incipient either measurements with additional sensors or a further investigation into other processing algorithm is expected for the unresolved item which deserves to be

the favored type of these breakwaters is the semi circular caisson breakwater this type of the breakwater has been used in practical engineering because of the following merits xie 1999 high stability against sliding almost zero overturning moment on the caisson as the hydrodynamic pressure on the structure surface passes through the circle center light deadweight which is suitable for a soft foundation and easy for construction and removal details on the hydrodynamic performance of these rigid semi circular structures can be found in the studies of cooker et al 1990 tanimoto and takahashi 1994 sundar and ragu 1998 yuan and tao 2003 zhang et al 2005 liu and li 2012 2013 and koley and sahoo 2017a on the other hand membranes have been used as expendable temporary floating submerged breakwaters for the strategic protection of coastal and offshore operations during complicated weather compared with traditional massive systems membrane systems have the following merits koley and sahoo 2017b environmentally friendly in the ocean deployable in different configurations easily recycled and constructed at lower cost moreover these membrane flexible breakwaters may provide better sheltering lower transmission coefficients compared with the corresponding rigid ones e g cho and kim 1998 2000 phadke and cheung 1999 lan and lee 2010 lee and chen 2010 based on preceding studies this study will investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater without any elastic rigidity which is expected to combine the merits of rigid semi circular structure and membrane structures we are motivated to learn about the difference of the sheltering function between the submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater and the rigid one and then we will present valuable guidance for engineering application in fact experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on the hydrodynamic performance of various fluid filled membrane structures hawthorne 1961 conducted an early experimental test on dracone flexible barges for the transportation of liquids and detailed the calculation methods for the static cross sectional shape of a floating bag filled with liquids frederiksen 1971 performed experimental tests on the effectiveness of a fluid filled membrane as a submerged breakwater broderick and jenkins 1993 conducted an experimental investigation for the reflection and transmission coefficients of a horizontal membrane cylinder filled with water and indicated that the membrane cylinder breakwater might be more effective than the corresponding rigid one under some wave conditions stamos et al 2003 compared the reflection and transmission coefficients between submerged semi circular and rectangular membrane breakwaters filled with water by experimental tests in addition to the above experimental works interactions between waves and fluid filled membrane structures have been studied numerically zhao 1995 developed a linear solution for wave interaction with a floating liquid filled membrane structure on the basis of the equilibrium of tension and pressure difference between both sides of the membrane zhao and aarsnes 1998 studied the effect of the rigidity on the hydrodynamic quantities of the floating liquid filled membrane through numerical calculations and experimental tests ohyama et al 1989 used a series of linear springs to model a submerged water filled membrane breakwater and then proposed a two dimensional linear numerical model for wave interaction with the membrane ohyama et al 1989 also used experimental data to verify their numerical solution for the reflection and transmission coefficients of the membrane breakwater phadke and cheung 1999 developed a linear model for submerged fluid filled membrane based on the membrane theory of cylindrical shells in donnell 1976 and focused their study on the effect of the fluid density inside the membrane on the hydrodynamic quantities subsequently phadke and cheung 2003 further considered the effect of the nonlinearity of the fluid filled membrane motion on the hydrodynamic performance of the structure das and cheung 2009 used a coupled boundary element method and finite element method to develop a three dimensional numerical solution to water wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled membrane recently liu and huang 2019 simulated the nonlinear wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater based on a mixed eulerian lagrangian method and potential flow theory the aforementioned studies have given valuable results for the engineering design and application of fluid filled membrane breakwaters however to the best of the authors knowledge no analytical solutions to water wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater have been reported as is known an analytical solution can provide a good understanding of the hydrodynamic performance of membrane structures which is precisely the objective of this study we will use the multipole expansion method e g havelock 1955 wu and eatock taylor 1990 linton and mciver 2001 das and mandal 2007 linton 2011 liu et al 2016 to develop an analytical solution for wave interaction with the submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater in addition to the analytical solution a numerical solution based on the multi domain boundary element method bem e g mallaychari and sundar 1994 cho and kim 2008 liu and li 2017 will be developed for validation of the analytical solution in the numerical solution the submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater with a general circular arc shape will be considered in the following section the boundary value problem for wave interaction with the

comparisons between the present analytical and numerical solutions are also performed calculation examples are presented to examine the hydrodynamic quantities of the fluid filled membrane breakwater finally the main conclusions of this study are presented 2 mathematical formulation for a submerged fluid filled membrane an additional internal static pressure p s is imposed on the membrane to ensure the desired shape under the assumption of zero mass of the membrane hawthorne 1961 zhao 1995 and phadke and cheung 1999 have detailed the formulation for the static shape of a fluid filled membrane phadke and cheung 1999 have indicated that when the densities of the external and internal fluids are consistent the static shape absence of waves of the submerged fluid filled membrane is exactly a circular arc in this study the per unit length gravity ρ s gd ρ s and d are the density and thickness of the membrane respectively and g is the gravitational acceleration of the membrane is assumed to be very small therefore it can be ignored in comparisons with the additional internal pressure p s then the static shape of the present submerged fluid filled membrane which is a semi circular arc can be approximatively formulated through the method of phadke and cheung 1999 fig 1 is the sketch of water wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater the water depth and the breakwater radius are h and a a h respectively a cartesian coordinate system with the origin located at the still water level and with the z axis extending vertically upwards and the x axis pointing to the right is used for the mathematical description as shown in fig 1 the circle center is located at x z 0 h the polar coordinate system is defined with r sin θ x and r cos θ z h the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and its motion is irrotational when the incident wave with angular frequency ω propagates from the negative infinity of the x axis a velocity potential φ x z t is used to describe the fluid motion the wave surface elevation is denoted by ζ x t after separating the time factor the velocity potential and the wave surface elevation respectively can be written as 1 φ x z t re i g h 2 ω ϕ x z e i ω t 2 ζ x t re i g h 2 ω η x e i ω t where re denotes the real part of the function i 1 h is the incident wave height ϕ x z is the reduced spatial velocity potential η x is the reduced wave surface elevation and t is the time the spatial velocity potential ϕ x z satisfies the laplace equation 3 2 ϕ 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 for the linear problem the velocity potential satisfies the free surface condition 4 ϕ z k ϕ k ω 2 g z 0 the impermeable bottom condition 5 ϕ z 0 z h and the far field condition 6 lim x x i k ϕ ϕ 0 0 where k is the incident wave number and satisfies 7 k k tanh k h and ϕ 0 is the velocity potential of incident wave given by 8 ϕ 0 e i k x z 0 z in which z 0 z cosh k z h cosh k h moreover the velocity potential at the far fields is written as 9 ϕ e i k x r e i k x z 0 z x t e i k x z 0 z x where r and t are the unknown complex coefficients related to the reflected and transmitted waves respectively the values of r and t can be determined by matching the boundary condition on the surface of the semi circular membrane breakwater for convenience of study the whole fluid domain is divided into two regions region 1 the external domain of the semi circular membrane breakwater r a and region 2 the internal domain of the breakwater r a according to the study of phadke and cheung 1999 the governing equation for the deflection w θ t of the semi circular membrane can be written as 10 2 w θ 2 w a 2 n 0 m s 2 w t 2 ρ φ 2 t φ 1 t r a where n 0 is the static hoop stress of the membrane m s ρ s d is per unit length mass of the membrane ρ is the fluid density and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote variables in regions 1 and 2 respectively in eq 10 we have used the linear bernoulli equation p r θ t ρ φ t g z 0 where p r θ t is the pressure at the point r θ of the fluid region to develop an analytical solution to the present hydroelastic interaction problem the effect of the membrane s inertial force on the membrane s deflection is considered as shown in the right hand side of eq 10 according to the formulation of the membrane s static shape in phadke and cheung 1999 eq 10 the static hoop stress n 0 equals p s a for the present semi circular membrane when the membrane makes harmonic motion with a small amplitude the membrane deflection w θ t is further written as 11 w θ t re i g h 2 ω ξ θ e i ω t where ξ θ is the reduced complex deflection substituting eqs 1 and 11 into eq 10 and removing the time factor e iωt yields 12 d 2 ξ d θ 2 λ 2 ξ i β ω ϕ 2 ϕ 1 r a where λ 1 m s ω 2 a 2 n 0 1 2 and β ω 2 ρ a 2 n 0 because the two ends of the membrane are fixed the absence of the deflection at the edges yields 13 ξ θ 0 θ π 2 and 3 π 2 assuming that the membrane and fluid are not separated the velocity potentials satisfy the boundary condition on the surface of the semi circular membrane 14 ϕ 1 r ϕ 2 r i ω ξ r a 3 analytical solution by multipole expansions the derivation of the multipoles

substituting eqs 22 and 23 into the first equal sign of eq 14 multiplying both sides of the new equation by cos 2 m θ and sin 2 m 1 θ respectively then integrating the results with respect to θ from π

value of α n in eq 27 will be singular at n 1 for this reason a very small value of m 0 m s ρ h 10 6 is used in the following calculations eqs 23 and 27 are substituted into the second equal sign in eq 14 and then a similar algebraic operation is perforated as was used in the first equal sign in eq 14 which yields the following 28a c 0 n 1 b n a 0 n a 2 n λ 2 π i 1 2 d i π 2 3 π 2 f i θ d θ 1 28b

coordinate system is defined as that used in fig 1 the center of the corresponding polar coordinate system is located at the circle s center we set two vertical boundaries at x l straight lines sl and sr which are both far from the fluid filled membrane the whole fluid domain is divided into four regions region 1 the external domain of the membrane breakwater enclosed by the curves sl sd1 sb sr and sf region 2 the internal domain of the breakwater enclosed by the curves sd2 and sb the seaside outer domain 3 x l and the leeside outer domain 4 x l applying the second green theorem the solutions of the laplace equation in regions 1 and 2 can be transformed into the boundary integral equations 36 1 2 ϕ 1 q s l s b s r s d 1 s f ϕ 1 p g p q n 1 g p q ϕ 1 p n 1 d s 37 1 2 ϕ 2 q s b s d 2 ϕ 2 p g p

38 g p q 1 2 π ln p q in the outer regions 3 and 4 the evanescent models in velocity potentials are ignored as the distances between the vertical boundaries sl and sr and the membrane breakwater are large enough therefore according to eq 9 the expressions of the velocity potentials in the outer regions 3 and 4 are written as 39 ϕ 3 e i k x l r e i k x l z 0 z 40 ϕ 4 t e i k x l z 0 z where r and t are the unknown complex coefficients the physical meanings of r and t are the same as that in eq 9 on the vertical boundaries sl and sr the velocity potentials and the horizontal fluid velocities must be continuous 41 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 1 r z 0 z on s l 42 ϕ 1 n 1 ϕ 3 x i k r 1 z 0 z on s l 43 ϕ 1 ϕ 4 t z 0 z on s r 44 ϕ 1 n 1 ϕ 4 x i k t z 0 z on s r multiplying both sides of eqs 41 and 43 by z 0 z and integrating the results with respect to z along the whole water depth respectively yields 45 r cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z 1 on s l 46 t cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z on s r substituting eqs 45 and 46 into eqs 42 and 44 respectively yields 47 ϕ 1 n 1 i k z 0 z cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z 2 on s l 48 ϕ 1 n 1 i k z 0 z cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z on s r on the boundaries sd1 sd2 and sf we have 49 ϕ 1 n 1 0 on s d 1 50 ϕ 2 n 2 0 on s d 2 51 ϕ 1 n 1 k ϕ 1 on s f the membrane deflection ξ θ still satisfies eq 12 with n 0 p s c 2 b 2 2 b the zero displacement at two ends of the membrane gives 52 ξ θ 0 θ θ 1 and θ 2 where θ 1 π arcsin 2 b c b 2 c 2 and θ 2 π arcsin 2 b c b 2 c 2 before applying the boundary condition on the surface of the membrane we first construct a green function g τ θ satisfying 53 g τ τ λ 2 g δ τ θ g τ θ 0 τ θ 1 and θ 2 g τ θ is continuous on τ θ g τ τ θ 0 g τ τ θ 0 1 where δ x is the dirac function solving eq 53 gives the green function g τ θ 54 g τ θ sin λ θ 2 λ θ sin λ τ λ θ 1 λ sin λ θ 2 λ θ 1 θ 1 τ θ sin λ θ λ θ 1 sin λ θ 2 λ τ λ sin λ θ 2 λ θ 1 θ τ θ 2 then the solution of eq 12 for a circular arc membrane can be written as 55 ξ θ i β ω θ 1 θ 2 g τ θ ϕ 2 a τ ϕ 1 a τ d τ substituting eq 55 into eq 14 yields the boundary condition on the surface of the circular arc membrane 56 ϕ 1 n 1 ϕ 2 n 2 β θ 1 θ 2 g τ θ ϕ 2 a τ ϕ 1 a τ d τ on s b note that for the semi circular membrane breakwater the values of θ 1 and θ 2 are equal π 2 and 3π 2 respectively at this time the green function g τ θ is singular if the membrane is assumed to be totally massless λ 1 however g τ θ is always nonsingular for the membrane breakwater with a general circular arc shape therefore a very small membrane mass is still considered in the calculations for the semi circular breakwater whereas the membrane can be massless in the calculations for the general circular arc breakwater discretizing the boundary curves sl sb sr sd1 sd2 and sf into sufficient elements and incorporating eq 47 51 and 56 into eqs 36 and 37 we can determine the velocity potential and its normal derivation on each boundary element liu et al 2012 the values of r and t are determined by eqs 45 and 46 respectively the reflection and transmission coefficients of the membrane breakwater are calculated respectively by 57 k r r cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z 1 on s l 58 k t t cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z on s r for the submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater with a circular arc shape the energy conservation relation is still given by eq 33 5 results and discussions in the following calculation examples the additional internal static pressure p s is normalized as p 0 p s ρgh which has been adopted by ohyama et al 1989 and phadke and cheung 1999 the value of p 0 refers to the studies of ohyama et al 1989 and phadke and cheung 1999 in addition a very small value of m 0 m s ρh 10 6 is used in the analytical and numerical calculations unless otherwise noted the other physical parameters are ρ 1025 kg m3 and g 9 807 m s2 5 1 convergence examination of the present analytical solution the value of the reflection coefficient k r calculated by

tables 1 3 the convergence of the present analytical solution is rapid and the calculation results of four figure accuracy are obtained using the truncated value of n 10 thus n 10 will be used in the following calculation examples we also note from these tables that the convergence of the present analytical solution for long waves small wave number is faster than that for short waves large wave number 5 2 validation of the present numerical solution phadke and cheung 1999 performed a numerical analysis for water wave reflection and transmission by a submerged fluid filled circular arc membrane to verify the present numerical solution fig 3 shows comparison of the transmission coefficient k t between the present bem solution and the numerical results of phadke and cheung 1999 fig 7 the value of k t is plotted as a function of the relative width of the membrane breakwater 2c l where l denotes the incident wavelength in fig 3 three values of p 0 0 07 0 1 and 0 15 are considered and the relative membrane width and height are 2c h 3 0 and b h 0 5 respectively in the present calculation the value of m 0 0 is used which is in line with the assumption of the massless membrane in the study of phadke and cheung 1999 it is observed from fig 3 that the agreement between the present numerical results and the numerical results of phadke and cheung 1999 is good ohyama et al 1989 carried out experimental tests for examining the hydrodynamic performance of the submerged fluid filled circular arc membrane with 2c h 2 0 they indicated that the additional internal static pressure p 0 p s ρgh and the membrane height b had considerable effects on the wave propagation in their experiments three cases b h 0 537 and p 0 0 065 b h 0 542 and p 0 0 116 and b h 0 556 and p 0 0 208 were considered figs 4 6 show the comparisons of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t between the present bem solution and the experimental results of ohyama et al 1989 fig 4 note that except for the regions near the sharply changed k r and k t the overall agreement between the present numerical results and the experimental data is reasonable 5 3 comparison between the present analytical and numerical solutions in the present multi domain bem solution section 4 when the height of the fluid filled membrane is equal to half of its width i e b c the static shape of the membrane breakwater becomes semi circular then the calculation results of the present analytical solution and the multi domain bem solution are compared for cross checking as shown in fig 7 in the calculation of multi domain bem solution the boundaries sl sr sd1 sd2 and sf see fig 2 are divided into 50 50 150 100 and 200 elements respectively and the boundary on the surface of the semi circular membrane sb is divided into 150 elements two cases a h 0 6 and p 0 0 2 a h 0 9 and p 0 0 3 are examined the lines and dots in fig 7 denote the analytical solution and the multi domain bem solution respectively as shown in the figure the two different solutions show excellent agreement in addition the energy conservation relation in eq 33 is accurately satisfied by the calculation results of the present analytical solution and multi domain bem solution 5 4 calculation examples with discussions we first consider a fluid filled membrane with a general circular arc shape based on the multi domain bem solution the effects of the membrane s height and width on k r and k t are shown in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 gives the variations of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t with wave number kh at p 0 0 3 c h 0 7 and different b h here four values of b h from 0 4 to 0 7 are considered notably the value of b h 0 7 denotes that the membrane is semi circular and its relative radius is a h 0 7 it is observed from fig 8 that the value of k r increases when the value of b h increases at kh 2 0 and the bandwidth corresponding to the situation that k t is lower than 0 5 increases fig 9 shows the variations of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t with wave number kh at b h 0 7 p 0 0 3 and different c h note that when c h 0 7 the membrane breakwater is semi circular and the relative radius is a h 0 7 as shown in fig 9 the bandwidth corresponding to the value of k t below 0 5 is smaller for a larger value of c h overall at the incident wave frequencies with high engineering interest the sheltering performance of the semi circular membrane breakwater is better for a fixed width or height of the structure therefore the semi circular membrane breakwater may be preferred as a practical engineering design therefore we only consider the submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater in the following calculations which are based on the analytical solution for the semi circular membrane breakwater fig 10 presents the variations of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t against wave number kh at different a h the value of p 0 0 3 is used in this figure as observed from fig 10 for a given value of a h the reflection coefficient increases sharply and the transmission coefficient decreases sharply near a particular frequency which is called the resonant frequency a similar phenomenon of wave resonant reflection has been observed in previous studies on different membrane structures e g kim and kee 1996 phadke and cheung 1999 das and cheung 2009 when the resonance motion of the present membrane breakwater occurs the scattered waves have almost the same amplitude as the incident wave in that case the incident waves and scattered waves propagate in the opposite direction and yield a system of standing waves in the seaside region however the incident waves and scattered waves propagate in the same direction with a 180 phase difference in the leeside region and thus they are eliminated by each other and finally the transmitted wave height tends to approach zero we note from fig 10 that when kh 1 2 the breakwater with a larger radius can provide better sheltering function lower transmission coefficients in addition the bandwidth corresponding to the value of k t below 0 5 increases with the increasing value of a h in general the present membrane breakwater with a larger radius can provide better protection for the leeside region in terms of practical interest which is in line with the practical physics fig 11 shows the variations of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t against wave number kh at different p 0 here the calculation conditions are a h 0 7 and p 0 0 1 0 2 0 4 1 0 and infinity at p 0 infinity the present breakwater actually becomes a rigid one liu and li 2012 we note from fig 11 that the effects of p 0 on k r and k t are significant and complicated and the number of the resonant frequency decreases with increasing value of p 0 the sheltering function of the present membrane breakwater with a proper value of p 0 may be very effective to further examine the effects of p 0 on k r and k t we plot k r and k t as functions of p 0 at a h 0 7 and different kh in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 due to the existence of the resonant frequency the values of k r and k t fluctuates with the increasing value of p 0 however they both tend to reach constant values finally when the value of p 0 further increases we also note from figs 11 and 12 that compared with a rigid semi circular breakwater the flexible membrane one may have a lower transmission coefficient that is to say the sheltering function of a flexible semi circular membrane breakwater may be more effective than that of the corresponding rigid one moreover although discussions for only one value of a h 0 7 have been included here similar results also have been obtained for other values of a h the dimensionless deflection k h of the semi circular membrane at different parameters are examined in figs 13 and 14 in fig 13 the value of k h as the function of kh and θ π are plotted at a h 0 7 two values of p 0 0 1 and 0 3 are considered it is observed from fig 13 that the value of k h is non symmetric about θ π this is due to the non symmetric dynamic pressure jump across the membrane which can be concluded from eq 26 actually the non symmetric results of k h can be directly observed from eq 35 i e the value of the third term in the right hand side of eq 35 is antisymmetric about θ π as shown in fig 13 the effect of wave number kh on the value of k h for p 0 0 1 is more remarkable when compared with that for p 0 0 3 multiple peaks of k h can be observed from fig 13 and the peak on the leeside surface 0 5 θ π 1 0 is generally larger than that on the seaside surface in fig 14 the value of k h as the function of p 0 and θ π at a h 0 7 are plotted two values of kh 0 5 and 3 0 are examined in the case of kh 0 5 long wave only two peaks of k h along the whole membrane appear for all p 0 and the value of k h decreases with the increasing value of p 0 as shown in fig 14 a in the case of kh 3 0 short wave three peaks of k h appear on the membrane surface for 0 1 p 0 0 3 in figs 10 14 we have only shown the reflection and transmission coefficients of the semi circular membrane breakwater as well as the amplitude of the membrane deflection fig 15 gives the instantaneous wave surface elevation ζ and the instantaneous shape of the membrane breakwater at different time t the calculation conditions are a h 0 7 p 0 0 3 kh 1 0 and h l 0 02 the results cover one half of a wave period t in fig 15 the value of the instantaneous wave surface elevation is normalized by water depth h it is observed from fig 15 that except for the case of t 0 25t the change of the wave surface elevation in the seaside region is more dramatic compared with that in the leeside region according to the instantaneous wave surface elevation the membrane breakwater can provide noticeable protection for the leeside region 6 conclusions this study has developed an analytical solution to water wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater based on linear potential theory the multipole expansion method has been applied in the analytical solution also a numerical solution using the multi domain bem has been developed for the interaction between water waves and a submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater with a circular arc shape the reflection and transmission coefficients of the membrane breakwater and the membrane s deflection have been evaluated the calculation results have shown that the convergence of the newly developed analytical solution was rapid and the reflection and transmission coefficients with four figure accuracy were obtained using a few truncated numbers the agreement between the present numerical results multi bem solution and the numerical results in literature was rather good the agreement between the present numerical results and the experimental results in literature was also reasonable except for in the vicinity of the wave resonant frequency the calculation results by the present analytical solution agreed well with the numerical results by the present multi domain bem solution typical calculation examples have been presented to examine the hydrodynamic performance of the submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater we have found that for the membrane breakwater with a fixed relative width or height the one with semi circular arc shape usually has a better sheltering function compared with the one having a general circular arc shape results have also shown that a strong resonant wave reflection may occur at a special incident wave frequency and thus the corresponding sheltering function of the membrane breakwater was considerably improved the present fluid filled membrane breakwater with a suitable internal static pressure may have a better sheltering function compared with the corresponding rigid one in addition the membrane deflections on the seaside and leeside surfaces are not symmetric due to non symmetry of the dynamic pressure jump across the membrane multiple peak values of the membrane deflection appear on the surface of the semi circular membrane and the peak on the leeside surface is generally larger author contributions ai jun li was responsible for deriving the mathematical

the favored type of these breakwaters is the semi circular caisson breakwater this type of the breakwater has been used in practical engineering because of the following merits xie 1999 high stability against sliding almost zero overturning moment on the caisson as the hydrodynamic pressure on the structure surface passes through the circle center light deadweight which is suitable for a soft foundation and easy for construction and removal details on the hydrodynamic performance of these rigid semi circular structures can be found in the studies of cooker et al 1990 tanimoto and takahashi 1994 sundar and ragu 1998 yuan and tao 2003 zhang et al 2005 liu and li 2012 2013 and koley and sahoo 2017a on the other hand membranes have been used as expendable temporary floating submerged breakwaters for the strategic protection of coastal and offshore operations during complicated weather compared with traditional massive systems membrane systems have the following merits koley and sahoo 2017b environmentally friendly in the ocean deployable in different configurations easily recycled and constructed at lower cost moreover these membrane flexible breakwaters may provide better sheltering lower transmission coefficients compared with the corresponding rigid ones e g cho and kim 1998 2000 phadke and cheung 1999 lan and lee 2010 lee and chen 2010 based on preceding studies this study will investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater without any elastic rigidity which is expected to combine the merits of rigid semi circular structure and membrane structures we are motivated to learn about the difference of the sheltering function between the submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater and the rigid one and then we will present valuable guidance for engineering application in fact experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on the hydrodynamic performance of various fluid filled membrane structures hawthorne 1961 conducted an early experimental test on dracone flexible barges for the transportation of liquids and detailed the calculation methods for the static cross sectional shape of a floating bag filled with liquids frederiksen 1971 performed experimental tests on the effectiveness of a fluid filled membrane as a submerged breakwater broderick and jenkins 1993 conducted an experimental investigation for the reflection and transmission coefficients of a horizontal membrane cylinder filled with water and indicated that the membrane cylinder breakwater might be more effective than the corresponding rigid one under some wave conditions stamos et al 2003 compared the reflection and transmission coefficients between submerged semi circular and rectangular membrane breakwaters filled with water by experimental tests in addition to the above experimental works interactions between waves and fluid filled membrane structures have been studied numerically zhao 1995

zhao and aarsnes 1998 studied the effect of the rigidity on the hydrodynamic quantities of the floating liquid filled membrane through numerical calculations and experimental tests ohyama et al 1989 used a series of linear springs to model a submerged water filled membrane breakwater and then proposed a two dimensional linear numerical model for wave interaction with the membrane ohyama et al 1989 also used experimental data to verify their numerical solution for the reflection and transmission coefficients of the membrane breakwater phadke and cheung 1999 developed a linear model for submerged fluid filled membrane based on the membrane theory of cylindrical shells in donnell 1976 and focused their study on the effect of the fluid density inside the membrane on the hydrodynamic quantities subsequently phadke and cheung 2003 further considered the effect of the nonlinearity of the fluid filled membrane motion on the hydrodynamic performance of the structure das and cheung 2009 used a coupled boundary element method and finite element method to develop a three dimensional numerical solution to water wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled membrane recently liu and huang 2019 simulated the nonlinear wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater based on a mixed eulerian lagrangian method and potential flow theory the aforementioned studies have given valuable results for the engineering design and application of fluid filled membrane breakwaters however to the best of the authors knowledge no analytical solutions to water wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater have been reported as is known an analytical solution can provide a good understanding of the hydrodynamic performance of membrane structures which is precisely the objective of this study we will use the multipole expansion method e g havelock 1955 wu and eatock taylor 1990 linton and mciver 2001 das and mandal 2007 linton 2011 liu et al 2016 to develop an analytical solution for wave interaction with the submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater in addition to the analytical solution a numerical solution based on the multi domain boundary element method bem e g mallaychari and sundar 1994 cho and kim 2008 liu and li 2017 will be developed for validation of the analytical solution in the numerical solution the submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater with a general circular arc shape will be considered in the following section the boundary value problem for wave interaction with the

examination of the convergence of the present analytical solution is conducted the present numerical solution is validated using the known numerical and experimental results from literature comparisons between the present analytical and numerical solutions are also performed calculation examples are presented to examine the hydrodynamic quantities of the fluid filled membrane breakwater finally the main conclusions of this study are presented 2 mathematical formulation for a submerged fluid filled membrane an additional internal static pressure p s is imposed on the membrane to ensure the desired shape under the assumption of zero mass of the membrane hawthorne 1961 zhao 1995 and phadke and cheung 1999 have detailed the formulation for the static shape of a fluid filled membrane phadke and cheung 1999 have indicated that when the densities of the external and internal fluids are consistent the static shape absence of waves of the submerged fluid filled membrane is exactly a circular arc in this study the per unit length gravity ρ s gd ρ s and d are the density and thickness of the membrane respectively and g is the gravitational acceleration of the membrane is assumed to be very small therefore it can be ignored in comparisons with the additional internal pressure p s then the static shape of the present submerged fluid filled membrane which is a semi circular arc can be approximatively formulated through the method of phadke and cheung 1999 fig 1 is the sketch of water wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater the water depth and the breakwater radius are h and a a h respectively a cartesian coordinate system with the origin located at the still water level and with the z axis extending vertically upwards and the x axis pointing to the right is used for the mathematical description as shown in fig 1 the circle center is located at x z 0 h the polar coordinate system is defined with r sin θ x and r cos θ z h the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and its motion is irrotational when the incident wave with angular frequency ω propagates from the negative infinity of the x axis a velocity potential φ x z t is used to describe the fluid motion the wave surface elevation is denoted by ζ x t after separating the time factor the velocity potential and the wave surface elevation respectively can be written as 1 φ x z t re i g h 2 ω ϕ x z e i ω t 2 ζ x t re i g h 2 ω η x e i ω t where re denotes the real part of the function i 1 h is the incident wave height ϕ x z is the reduced spatial velocity potential η x is the reduced wave surface elevation and t is the time the spatial velocity potential ϕ x z satisfies the laplace equation 3 2 ϕ 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 for the linear problem the velocity potential satisfies the free surface condition 4 ϕ z k ϕ k ω 2 g z 0 the impermeable bottom condition 5 ϕ z 0 z h and the far field condition 6 lim x x i k ϕ ϕ 0 0 where k is the incident wave number and satisfies 7 k k tanh k h and ϕ 0 is the velocity potential of incident wave given by 8 ϕ 0 e i k x z 0 z in which z 0 z cosh k z h cosh k h moreover the velocity potential at the far fields is written as 9 ϕ e i k x r e i k x z 0 z x t e i k x z 0 z x where r and t are the unknown complex coefficients related to the reflected and transmitted waves respectively the values of r and t can be determined by matching the boundary condition on the surface of the semi circular membrane breakwater for convenience of study the whole fluid domain is divided into two regions region 1 the external domain of the semi circular membrane breakwater r a and region 2 the internal domain of the breakwater r a according to the study of phadke and cheung 1999 the governing equation for the deflection w θ t of the semi circular membrane can be written as 10 2 w θ 2 w a 2 n 0 m s 2 w t 2 ρ φ 2 t φ 1 t r a where n 0 is the static hoop stress of the membrane m s ρ s d is per unit length mass of the membrane ρ is the fluid density and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote variables in regions 1 and 2 respectively in eq 10 we have used the linear bernoulli equation p r θ t ρ φ t g z 0 where p r θ t is the pressure at the point r θ of the fluid region to develop an analytical solution to the present hydroelastic interaction problem the effect of the membrane s inertial force on the membrane s deflection is considered as shown in the right hand side of eq 10 according to the formulation of the membrane s static shape in phadke and cheung 1999 eq 10 the static hoop stress n 0 equals p s a for the present semi circular membrane when the membrane makes harmonic motion with a small amplitude the membrane deflection w θ t is further written as 11 w θ t re i g h 2 ω ξ θ e i ω t where ξ θ is the reduced complex deflection substituting eqs 1 and 11 into eq 10 and removing the time factor e iωt yields 12 d 2 ξ d θ 2 λ 2 ξ i β ω ϕ 2 ϕ 1 r a where λ 1 m s ω 2 a 2 n 0 1 2 and β ω 2 ρ a 2 n 0 because the two ends of the membrane are fixed the absence of the deflection at the edges yields 13 ξ θ 0 θ π 2 and 3 π 2 assuming that the membrane and fluid are not separated the velocity potentials satisfy the boundary condition on the surface of the semi circular membrane 14 ϕ 1 r ϕ 2 r i ω ξ r a 3 analytical solution by multipole expansions the derivation of the multipoles

substituting eqs 22 and 23 into the first equal sign of eq 14 multiplying both sides of the new equation by cos 2 m θ and sin 2 m 1 θ respectively then integrating the results with respect to θ from π

38 g p q 1 2 π ln p q in the outer regions 3 and 4 the evanescent models in velocity potentials are ignored as the distances between the vertical boundaries sl and sr and the membrane breakwater are large enough therefore according to eq 9 the expressions of the velocity potentials in the outer regions 3 and 4 are written as 39 ϕ 3 e i k x l r e i k x l z 0 z 40 ϕ 4 t e i k x l z 0 z where r and t are the unknown complex coefficients the physical meanings of r and t are the same as that in eq 9 on the vertical boundaries sl and sr the velocity potentials and the horizontal fluid velocities must be continuous 41 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 1 r z 0 z on s l 42 ϕ 1 n 1 ϕ 3 x i k r 1 z 0 z on s l 43 ϕ 1 ϕ 4 t z 0 z on s r 44 ϕ 1 n 1 ϕ 4 x i k t z 0 z on s r multiplying both sides of eqs 41 and 43 by z 0 z and

eqs 45 and 46 into eqs 42 and 44 respectively yields 47 ϕ 1 n 1 i k z 0 z cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z 2 on s l 48 ϕ 1 n 1 i k z 0 z cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z on s r on the boundaries sd1 sd2 and sf we have 49 ϕ 1 n 1 0 on s d 1 50 ϕ 2 n 2 0 on s d 2 51 ϕ 1 n 1 k ϕ 1 on s f the membrane deflection ξ θ still satisfies eq 12 with n 0 p s c 2 b 2 2 b the zero displacement at two ends of the membrane gives 52 ξ θ 0 θ θ 1 and θ 2 where θ 1 π arcsin 2 b c b 2 c 2 and θ 2 π arcsin 2 b c b 2 c 2 before applying the boundary condition on the surface of the membrane we first construct a green function g τ θ satisfying 53 g τ τ λ 2 g δ τ θ g τ θ 0 τ θ 1 and θ 2 g τ θ is continuous on τ θ g τ τ θ 0 g τ τ θ 0 1 where δ x is the dirac function solving eq 53 gives the green function g τ θ

b note that for the semi circular membrane breakwater the values of θ 1 and θ 2 are equal π 2 and 3π 2 respectively at this time the green function g τ θ is singular if the membrane is assumed to be totally massless λ 1 however g τ θ is always nonsingular for the membrane breakwater with a general circular arc shape therefore a very small membrane mass is still considered in the calculations for the semi circular breakwater whereas the membrane can be massless in the calculations for the general circular arc breakwater discretizing the boundary curves sl sb sr sd1 sd2 and sf into sufficient elements and incorporating eq 47 51 and 56 into eqs 36 and 37 we can determine the velocity potential and its normal derivation on each boundary element liu et al 2012 the values of r and t are determined by eqs 45 and 46 respectively the reflection and transmission coefficients of the membrane breakwater are calculated respectively by 57 k r r cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z 1 on s l 58 k t t cosh 2 k h h ω 0 h 0 ϕ 1 z 0 z d z on s r for the submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater with a circular arc shape the energy conservation relation is still given by eq 33 5 results and discussions in the following calculation examples the additional internal static pressure p s is normalized as p 0 p s ρgh which has been adopted by ohyama et al 1989 and phadke and cheung 1999 the value of p 0 refers to the studies of ohyama et al 1989 and phadke and cheung 1999 in addition a very small value of m 0 m s ρh 10 6 is used in the analytical and numerical calculations unless otherwise noted the other physical parameters are ρ 1025 kg m3 and g 9 807 m s2 5 1 convergence examination of the present analytical solution the value of the reflection coefficient k r calculated by the present analytical solution at different truncated numbers n are listed in tables 1 3 three cases p 0 0 2 and a h 0 5 p 0 0 1 and a h 0 8 and p 0 0 3 and a h 0 9 are examined here as shown in tables 1 3 the convergence of the present analytical solution is rapid and the calculation results of four figure accuracy are obtained using the truncated value of n 10 thus n 10 will be used in the following calculation examples we also note from these tables that the convergence of the present analytical solution for long waves small wave number is faster than that for short waves large wave number 5 2 validation of the present numerical solution phadke and cheung 1999 performed a numerical analysis for water wave reflection and transmission by a submerged fluid filled circular arc membrane to verify the present numerical solution fig 3 shows comparison of the transmission coefficient k t between the present bem solution and the numerical results of phadke and cheung 1999 fig 7 the value of k t is plotted as a function of the relative width of the membrane breakwater 2c l where l denotes the incident wavelength in fig 3 three values of p 0 0 07 0 1 and 0 15 are considered and the relative membrane width and height are 2c h 3 0 and b h 0 5 respectively in the present calculation the value of m 0 0 is used which is in line with the assumption of the massless membrane in the study of phadke and cheung 1999 it is observed from fig 3 that the agreement between the present numerical results and the numerical results of phadke and cheung 1999 is good ohyama et al 1989 carried out experimental tests for examining the hydrodynamic performance of the submerged fluid filled circular arc membrane with 2c h 2 0 they indicated that the additional internal static pressure p 0 p s ρgh and the membrane height b had considerable effects on the wave propagation in their experiments three cases b h 0 537 and p 0 0 065 b h 0 542 and p 0 0 116 and b h 0 556 and p 0 0 208 were considered figs 4 6 show the comparisons of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t between the present bem solution and the experimental results of ohyama et al 1989 fig 4 note that except for the regions near the sharply changed k r and k t the overall agreement between the present numerical results and the experimental data is reasonable 5 3 comparison between the present analytical and numerical solutions in the present multi domain bem solution section 4 when the height of the fluid filled membrane is equal to half of its width i e b c the static shape of the membrane breakwater becomes semi circular then the calculation results of the present analytical solution and the multi domain bem solution are compared for cross checking as shown in fig 7 in the calculation of multi domain bem solution the boundaries sl sr sd1 sd2 and sf see fig 2 are divided into 50 50 150 100 and 200 elements respectively and the boundary on the surface of the semi circular membrane sb is divided into 150 elements two cases a h 0 6 and p 0 0 2 a h 0 9 and p 0 0 3 are examined the lines and dots in fig 7 denote the analytical solution and the multi domain bem solution respectively as shown in the figure the two different solutions show excellent agreement in addition the energy conservation relation in eq 33 is accurately satisfied by the calculation results of the present analytical solution and multi domain bem solution 5 4 calculation examples with discussions we first consider a fluid filled membrane with a general circular arc shape based on the multi domain bem solution the effects of the membrane s height and width on k r and k t are shown in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 gives the variations of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t with wave number kh at p 0 0 3 c h 0 7 and different b h here four values of b h from 0 4 to 0 7 are considered notably the value of b h 0 7 denotes that the membrane is semi circular and its relative radius is a h 0 7 it is observed from fig 8 that the value of k r increases when the value of b h increases at kh 2 0 and the bandwidth corresponding to the situation that k t is lower than 0 5 increases fig 9 shows the variations of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t with wave number kh at b h 0 7 p 0 0 3 and different c h note that when c h 0 7 the membrane breakwater is semi circular and the relative radius is a h 0 7 as shown in fig 9 the bandwidth corresponding to the value of k t below 0 5 is smaller for a larger value of c h overall at the incident wave frequencies with high engineering interest the sheltering performance of the semi circular membrane breakwater is better for a fixed width or height of the structure therefore the semi circular membrane breakwater may be preferred as a practical engineering design therefore we only consider the submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater in the following calculations which are based on the analytical solution for the semi circular membrane breakwater fig 10 presents the variations of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t against wave number kh at different a h the value of p 0 0 3 is used in this figure as observed from fig 10 for a given value of a h the reflection coefficient increases sharply and the transmission coefficient decreases sharply near a particular frequency which is called the resonant frequency a similar phenomenon of wave resonant reflection has been observed in previous studies on different membrane structures e g kim and kee 1996 phadke and cheung 1999 das and cheung 2009 when the resonance motion of the present membrane breakwater occurs the scattered waves have almost the same amplitude as the incident wave in that case the incident waves and scattered waves propagate in the opposite direction and yield a system of standing waves in the seaside region however the incident waves and scattered waves propagate in the same direction with a 180 phase difference in the leeside region and thus they are eliminated by each other and finally the transmitted wave height tends to approach zero we note from fig 10 that when kh 1 2 the breakwater with a larger radius can provide better sheltering function lower transmission coefficients in addition the bandwidth corresponding to the value of k t below 0 5 increases with the increasing value of a h in general the present membrane breakwater with a larger radius can provide better protection for the leeside region in terms of practical interest which is in line with the practical physics fig 11 shows the variations of the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t against wave number kh at different p 0 here the calculation conditions are a h 0 7 and p 0 0 1 0 2 0 4 1 0 and infinity at p 0 infinity the present breakwater actually becomes a rigid one liu and li 2012 we note from fig 11 that the effects of p 0 on k r and k t are significant and complicated and the number of the resonant frequency decreases with increasing value of p 0 the sheltering function of the present membrane breakwater with a proper value of p 0 may be very effective to further examine the effects of p 0 on k r and k t we plot k r and k t as functions of p 0 at a h 0 7 and different kh in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 due to the existence of the resonant frequency the values of k r and k t fluctuates with the increasing value of p 0 however they both tend to reach constant values finally when the value of p 0 further increases we also note from figs 11 and 12 that compared with a rigid semi circular breakwater the flexible membrane one may have a lower transmission coefficient that is to say the sheltering function of a flexible semi circular membrane breakwater may be more effective than that of the corresponding rigid one moreover although discussions for only one value of a h 0 7 have been included here similar results also have been obtained for other values of a h the dimensionless deflection k h of the semi circular membrane at different parameters are examined in figs 13 and 14 in fig 13 the value of k h as the function of kh and θ π are plotted at a h 0 7 two values of p 0 0 1 and 0 3 are considered it is observed from fig 13 that the value of k h is non symmetric about θ π this is due to the non symmetric dynamic pressure jump across the membrane which can be concluded from eq 26 actually the non symmetric results of k h can be directly observed from eq 35 i e the value of the third term in the right hand side of eq 35 is antisymmetric about θ π as shown in fig 13 the effect of wave number kh on the value of k h for p 0 0 1 is more remarkable when compared with that for p 0 0 3 multiple peaks of k h can be observed from fig 13 and the peak on the leeside surface 0 5 θ π 1 0 is generally larger than that on the seaside surface in fig 14 the value of k h as the function of p 0 and θ π at a h 0 7 are plotted two values of kh 0 5 and 3 0 are examined in the case of kh 0 5 long wave only two peaks of k h along the whole membrane appear for all p 0 and the value of k h decreases with the increasing value of p 0 as shown in fig 14 a in the case of kh 3 0 short wave three peaks of k h appear on the membrane surface for 0 1 p 0 0 3 in figs 10 14 we have only shown the reflection and transmission coefficients of the semi circular membrane breakwater as well as the amplitude of the membrane deflection fig 15 gives the instantaneous wave surface elevation ζ and the instantaneous shape of the membrane breakwater at different time t the calculation conditions are a h 0 7 p 0 0 3 kh 1 0 and h l 0 02 the results cover one half of a wave period t in fig 15 the value of the instantaneous wave surface elevation is normalized by water depth h it is observed from fig 15 that except for the case of t 0 25t the change of the wave surface elevation in the seaside region is more dramatic compared with that in the leeside region according to the instantaneous wave surface elevation the membrane breakwater can provide noticeable protection for the leeside region 6 conclusions this study has developed an analytical solution to water wave interaction with a submerged fluid filled semi circular membrane breakwater based on linear potential theory the multipole expansion method has been applied in the analytical solution also a numerical solution using the multi domain bem has been developed for the interaction between water waves and a submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater with a circular arc shape the reflection and transmission coefficients of the membrane breakwater and the membrane s deflection have been evaluated the calculation results have shown that the convergence of the newly developed analytical solution was rapid and the reflection and transmission coefficients with four figure accuracy were obtained using a few truncated numbers the agreement between the present numerical results multi bem solution and the numerical results in literature was rather good the agreement between the present numerical results and the experimental results in literature was also reasonable except for in the vicinity of the wave resonant frequency the calculation results by the present analytical solution agreed well with the numerical results by the present multi domain bem solution typical calculation examples have been presented to examine the hydrodynamic performance of the submerged fluid filled membrane breakwater we have found that for the membrane breakwater with a fixed relative width or height the one with semi circular arc shape usually has a better sheltering function compared with the one having a general circular arc shape results have also shown that a strong resonant wave reflection may occur at a special incident wave frequency and thus the corresponding sheltering function of the membrane breakwater was considerably improved the present fluid filled membrane breakwater with a suitable internal static pressure may have a better sheltering function compared with the corresponding rigid one in addition the membrane deflections on the seaside and leeside surfaces are not symmetric due to non symmetry of the dynamic pressure jump across the membrane multiple peak values of the membrane deflection appear on the surface of the semi circular membrane and the peak on the leeside surface is generally larger author contributions ai jun li was responsible for deriving the mathematical

22163,in this paper a numerical simulation of a micro linear turbine cascade is presented the upstream stay vane and downstream guide vane were surrounded by incompressible flow and the guide vane was modeled with forced pitching motions the implicit immersed boundary method was used as the moving boundary flow solver to seek a better understanding of the influence of the motion parameters on hydrodynamic characteristics and input power of the oscillating guide vane the forced motion of a non sinusoidal oscillating guide vane was first investigated for different reduced frequencies and profile parameters second the instantaneous hydrodynamic behavior was simulated for different motion combinations and reynolds numbers the results showed that the reduced frequencies and profile parameters of the pitch movement had a large influence on the input power and the peak of the input power at f 0 22 was nearly 9 41 times that at f 0 074 but the input power was not sensitive to the motion combination and reynolds number however the reynolds number had a large influence on the drag and the maximum drag coefficient for re 6 65 105 was 4 566 however it was only 0 5912 for re 6 65 104 keywords micro linear turbine cascade moving boundary non sinusoidal oscillating profile immersed boundary method hydrodynamic characteristics input power 1 introduction it is a global trend to utilize renewable energy to fulfill the current energy demand edenhofer et al 2011 hydropower has been considered to be one of the most flexible and consistent renewable energy sources capable of supplying both base and peak demand energy demand is increasing rapidly and this is accompanied by the development of energy sources however most of the hydropower especially micro hydropower in developing regions is in the development stage prior to developing new projects identification of existing problems their severity and a suitable research approach to mitigate these problems is an important task gleick 1993 in hydraulic machinery for power output there are often turbine cascades in the distributor zone for instance a pump turbine often transfers between the pump case and turbine case with the operation of a guide vane which can lead to vibrations of the guide vane blade or resonance in the distributor channels nicolet et al 2006 zobeiri et al 2006 the flow induced vibrations of the guide vane excited by periodic vortex shedding wang et al 2010 can also lead to premature cracks vortex shedding occurs along the vane surface and enters the blade passage region which can induce pressure fluctuations leading to runner unit vibrations wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 furthermore when the hydro turbine transitions from one operating point to another during the transient processes runaway or emergency turbine shutdown it is often controlled by the guide vane and valves or wicket gates opening upstream however none of the previous studies have examined the true operational parametric range for a turbine cascade and the characteristics of the input power thus there is strong interest in the study of the forced oscillating behaviors of the turbine cascade in order to design safe and reliable turbines for river and ocean energy utilization in recent years many studies have concentrated on the flow characteristics in the turbine cascade as these turbulent wakes result in the loss of hydraulic energy for example antonsen 2007 performed a numerical and experimental study on the unsteady flow in the turbine cascade qian 2008 performed particle image velocimetry piv experiments for the measurement of unsteady flows at the stator of the francis turbine in their study in the turbine cascade small recirculation was found the flow at the exit of the stator was strongly non uniform with a higher velocity fluctuation under partial load conditions trivedi et al 2013 found that this did not allow operation at the best efficiency point and resulted in the formation of secondary vortices when opening or closing the guide vane thapa et al 2016 studied the flow characteristics using piv in asymmetric naca profiles for high head francis turbines the tip clearance characteristics and spatial temporal evolution leakage vortex in a mixed flow pump have been investigated in detail liu and tan 2018a b hao and tan 2018 liu and tan 2019 in addition some studies concentrated on fully active flapping hydrofoils used to output energy including studies of the foil geometry kinematics and flow effects john et al 2014 wang et al 2018a b li et al 2018 lu et al 2014 xiao et al 2012 xiao et al 2012 liu and tan 2018a b liu e al 2019 other studies used direct numerical simulations large eddy simulations and experiments to examine turbine blade cascades such as for low pressure turbines michalek and straka 2013 macisaac et al 2012 sideridis et al 2011 and hydro kinematic turbine wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b song et al 2019 to design a better operating strategy however the instantaneous hydrodynamic behavior and power input characteristics of the guide vane itself are very important but there has been little research on this topic especially for microturbine guide vane cascades numerical simulations considering large movements for complex geometries like hydraulic turbines are extremely time consuming using either classical or integrated methods based on re meshing technology therefore fixed mesh technologies in the last two decades have been proposed one of which is the immersed boundary method ibm based on the representation of the fluid structure interfaces the ibm can be classified as a diffuse interface method wang et al 2017 and a sharp interface method jiang et al 2018 in the diffuse interface method the immersed boundaries are smeared by distributing the singular forces to the surrounding background grid nodes using smooth functions or penalization methods diffuse interface methods can be further classified as classic ibms hou and shi 2008 ceniceros et al 2009 wang et al 2017 direct forcing ibms falun et al 2000 uhlmann 2005 kempe and frohlich 2012 ji et al 2012 wang et al 2018a b and penalization methods liu and vasilyev 2007 wang and zhang 2011 depending on the method for calculating the fictitious forces representing the effects of the immersed solid an inherent feature of the diffuse interface ibm is that the immersed boundaries are not sharp but are rather smeared across several grid nodes due to the use of the discrete delta function or a smoothing function the direct forcing ibm has been used successfully by many researchers in a variety of applications for example ji et al 2012 introduced an improved body force distribution function that transferred the body force in the discrete volume of ib points to the surrounding cartesian grids and performed a comparison of the computational results between the full distribution forcing strategy and the half distribution forcing strategy wang et al 2017 developed a simple and efficient implicit direct forcing immersed boundary model for the simulation of complex flows wang et al 2018a b presented an improved minimum least square approximation to combine with the implicit ib lbm method to improve the order of interpolation to motivate these successful applications of the ibm in this paper an implicit direct forcing ibm falun et al 2000 vikhansky 2003 chiu et al 2010 wu and shu 2009 ren et al 2012 wang et al 2017 is proposed to simulate an oscillating guide vane in a turbine cascade and the effects of different pitching motions on the energy input performance of a micro linear turbine cascade are investigated the rest of this paper is organized as follows the ib method is introduced in section 2 the numerical test and validation are described in section 3 the effects of the non sinusoidal pitching motion on the energy input performance are discussed in section 4 and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations in the ib method the action of the solid on the fluid is represented by forces as moment sources therefore the governing equations can be expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i f i where u i and p are the velocity and pressure respectively ρ is the fluid density and μ is the effective viscosity the momentum source term f i can be expressed as 3 f i x t v t f i x s t δ x x s t d v where x and x represent the eulerian coordinates of the fluid field and ib points on the immersed solid boundary respectively f i is the solid boundary force density and δ x x s t is the smooth delta function it is assumed that an arbitrary smooth region v t moves to δ x x s t at time t where 4 v t δ x x s t d x 1 i f x s t v t 0 o t h e r δ x x s t is expressed as 5 δ h x 1 h 2 ϕ x h ϕ y h where ϕ r can be written as 6 ϕ r 1 8 3 2 r 1 4 r 4 r 2 0 r 1 1 8 5 2 r 7 12 r 4 r 2 1 r 2 0 2 r where h is the local eulerian grid scale 2 2 immersed boundary framework with implicit direct forcing the generic conservation equation given by equation 2 which can be expressed as 7 φ t μ f where φ represents a conserved quantity such as ρ u or ρ v and μ is a flux function which can be expressed as 8 μ ρ u φ i p γ φ where γ is a generalized diffusive term and i is the unit tensor when the boundary body force density term f is omitted eq 7 can be expressed as 9 φ t μ 0 eq 9 can be discretized in time from step t n to t n 1 with time step size δ t t n 1 t n by a fractional step method and can be solved with a pressure poisson equation 27 an intermediate velocity u can be obtained and the source term f can be recovered eq 2 is discretized in time and eq 9 is subtracted yielding the following 10 u n 1 u δ t δ u δ t f the immersed solid boundary is represented by a set of ib points x i b i i 1 2 m and the fluid field is discretized on a fixed uniform cartesian mesh x j j 1 2 n with mesh spacing δ x δ y δ z furthermore two functions c j i and d i j which represent the interpolation and distribution functions are defined respectively as follows 11 c j i c x i b i x j 1 δ x δ y δ z ϕ x i b i x j δ x ϕ y i b i y j δ y ϕ z i b i z j δ z 12 d i j d x j x i b i 1 δ x δ y δ z ϕ x j x i b i δ x ϕ y j y i b i δ y ϕ z j z i b i δ z the distribution function c j i maps the physical field from the ib points to the cartesian grids however the interpolation function d i j projects the physical field from the cartesian grid back to the ib points the momentum source term f in eq 3 at the eulerian points is distributed from the boundary force f through the dirac delta function interpolation eq 3 can be written in the discrete form as 13 f x j t i c j i f x i b i t δ v i i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where δ v i is the ith segment boundary discrete volume these volumes are from a thin shell with a thickness equal to one mesh width around each ib point substituting eq 13 into eq 10 yields 14 δ u x j t i c j i f x i b i t δ v i δ t i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the only unknown in eq 14 is the solid boundary force density to satisfy the no slip boundary condition the velocity at the ib point interpolated from the corrected fluid velocity field via the smooth delta function d i j must be equal to the boundary natural velocity u x i b i t at the same position i e 15 u x i b i t j d i j u n 1 x j t δ x δ y j 1 2 n i 1 2 m u n 1 x j t is the corrected velocity at the jth eulerian grid point expressed as the sum of the predicted velocity u x j t and the velocity correction δ u x j t i e 16 u n 1 x j t u x j t δ u x j t substituting eqs 16 and 14 into eq 15 gives 17 u x i b i t j u x j t d i j δ x δ y j i d i j δ v i c j i f x i b i t δ t δ x δ y i 1 2 m j 1 2 n thus the equation system for the boundary force is formed this can be solved by direct or iterative methods and the unknown boundary force f x i b i t at all ib points are obtained simultaneously these are then substituted into eqs 14 and 16 to calculate the velocity correction δ u x j t and the corrected velocity u n 1 x j t in this study an immersed boundary lattice boltzmann flux solver was used to solve the governing equations of the fluid further details can be found elsewhere wang et al 2017 2 3 validation of numerical method 2 3 1 flow over stationary circular cylinder the flow over a circular cylinder is a typical example used to validate a numerical method in this work flow over a stationary circular cylinder was also used to validate the proposed method according to the definition of the function of ϕ r we only need to solve eq 6 in a reduced fluid domain as shown in fig 1 with dotted blue lines the solid is represented by a circular cylinder with diameter d d 4 δ x l d 6 δ x and d 4 δ y w d 6 δ y are the length and width of the reduced domain respectively the fluid density was taken as ρ f the free stream velocity was u the space mesh size was δ x δ y the time step was δ t and d 60 was the circular cylinder diameter the cylinder boundary was represented by 185 discrete points with uniform segmented boundary length δ s i for the simulations the computational domain was 20 d 15 d with an overall mesh size of 1200 900 the center of the cylinder was located at 7 5 d 7 5 d the reynolds number was based on ρ f u d and dynamic viscosity of the fluid fig 2 shows the streamlines when the flow reaches a steady state for reynolds numbers of 1 20 30 and 40 as well as the streamlines at an instantaneous state for reynolds numbers of 80 and 200 in general when the reynolds number was smaller than 40 a pair of symmetrical vortices was generated behind the circular cylinder and the recirculation length was incremented as the reynolds number increased when the reynolds number was greater than 40 the vortex was not symmetric and periodic eddy shedding occurred the streamlines obtained by the present method did not penetrate the cylinder surface which showed that the no slip boundary condition was satisfied next we define the relative recirculation length l w l d where l is the distance between the backmost point of the cylinder and the back stationary point of the vortex as shown in table 1 we compared the recirculation length l w for three cases with other references takami and keller 1969 dennis and chang 2006 ren et al 2012 wu et al 2012 the present recirculation length was close to those previously reported 2 3 2 in line oscillations of circular cylinder the problem of an in line oscillating circular cylinder in a static fluid is one classical case for moving boundary problems which has been studied using experiments imamura et al 2004 and numerical simulations dütsch et al 1998 wang et al 2009 yang and balaras 2006 the two key parameters for this flow are the reynolds

frequency of the oscillation the in line motion of the cylinder is described by a simple harmonic oscillation 18 x t a s i n 2 π f t where a is the maximum displacement of the cylinder and a d was imposed the simulation was implemented on a rectangular domain 20d 15d with a uniform mesh size of 1200 900 the circular cylinder surface was represented by 150 discrete equidistant lagrangian points

a b c and d represent the phase angles 2 π f t of 0 96 192 and 288 respectively in periodic vortex shedding as the oscillating cylinder moved in the forward direction the separating flow along the cylinder s upper and lower surfaces produced two counter rotating vortices with apparently the same strengths and vortex shapes when the cylinder started its backward motion it created the same vortex formation on the other side of the cylinder i e in the new wake of the cylinder flow this phenomenon and the vortex shape agreed well with the results of wang et al 2009 and yang and balaras 2006 the flow force acting on the circular cylinder was computed as follows 19 f i f x i b i t δ x δ s i ρ f v b α b where δ s i is the i t h boundary length δ x is grid scale for the fluid v b π d 2 4 and α b

results agreed well with those of wang et al 2009 and dütsch et al 1998 2 3 3 pitching and plunging oscillating hydrofoil at intermediate reynolds numbers in this section the flow around a naca0015 hydrofoil was tested at intermediate reynolds numbers the chord length c was 1 0 the motions of the foil are given by a combination of a pitching motion θ t θ 0 s i n 2 π f t and a heaving motion y t y 0 s i n 2 π f t 0 5 π y 0 c is the heaving amplitude θ 0 60 o is the pitching amplitude and f f c u 0 14 is a reduced frequency where u 1 0 is the inlet velocity the dimensionless coefficients for the thrust and lift and the reynold numbers are defined as c x f x 0 5 ρ u 2 c c y f y 0 5 ρ u 2 c and r e ρ f u c μ 5 10 5 respectively where f x is the horizontal hydrodynamic force and f y is the vertical hydrodynamic force the time histories of c x and c y have been compared with the results of kinsey and are shown in fig 5 the evolution c x and c y was consistent with that of kinsey which verified the validity of the present simulation strategy the vortex distribution around the hydrofoil at different times between a period are also shown in fig 6 which shows the generation and evolution of the leading edge vortex and tip vortex along the hydrofoil surface and the tail vortex movement 3 set up as shown in fig 7 a a linear turbine cascade was located in a channel which included stay vanes and guide vanes the upstream contains row stay vanes while the downstream contains row guide vanes five guide vanes in the middle were rotating while the others were static the channel inlet was a velocity inlet boundary condition the channel outlet used outflow boundary condition and the channel wall and vane surfaces were all no slip walls a two dimensional hydrofoil of the guide vane is shown in fig 7 b the chord length of the hydrofoil is denoted as a the pivoting point was located at the centerline of the hydrofoil with a distance b from the leading edge the angle of attack is denoted as θ which is the angle between the chord line and the y axis the upstream flow velocity at the inlet is denoted as u the flow reynolds number re ρ f u a μ the simulation was implemented on a rectangular domain for the rotating zone of the guide vane with a uniform fluid mesh size of 0 012 a and the rotating guide vane surface was represented by 169 discrete lagrangian points along a circumference with equal spacings of 0 012 a for the non sinusoidal pitching motion the instantaneous angle of attack θ is expressed as follows 20 θ θ 0 sin 1 2 β ω t 0 t π β ω θ 0 π β ω t π ω 2 1 β θ 0 sin 1 2 β ω t π 1 β π ω 2 1 β t 2 π ω where θ 0 is the pitching amplitude the angular flapping frequency ω 2 π f and f fa u is the reduced frequency when β 1 the foil pitches sinusoidally when β the pitching profile tends to be trapezoidal and the time variations of the pitching profile θ t for some typical values of β are shown in fig 8 dimensionless coefficients for lift drag and torque are respectfully defined as follows 21 c l t f l t 1 2 ρ f u 2 a c d t f d t 1 2 ρ f u 2 a c m t m t 1 2 ρ f u 2 a 3 where the velocity u is 0 055 m s for all the results the lift force drag force and torque were respectively computed from the viscous stress and pressure along the guide vane surface as 22 f l t γ f x t d s f d t γ f y t d s m t γ f r d s where f x t is the instantaneous x component of the solid boundary force f y t is the instantaneous y component of the solid boundary force and r is the distance between the ib points of the guide vane surface and pivoting point the instantaneous power input actuating the pitching motion of the guide vane can be calculated by p t m t θ t where m t is the torque about the pivoting point and θ t is the angular velocity of the guide vane the mean power input is defined as follows 23 p i t 1 3 t t 0 t 0 3 t p i t d t where t 2π ω is the period of the system three periods were used to calculate the mean input power 4 results 4 1 statistical results tables 2 4 show the lift drag and moment coefficients of the guide vane for three different reduced frequencies the time averaged lift and moment coefficients decreased with the decrease in reduced frequency and the amplitude of the moment and lift coefficients also declined with the increase in the reduced frequency the time averaged drag coefficient grew slightly with decreasing reduced frequency but the amplitude of the drag coefficient decreased with the decrease in the reduced frequency we concluded that the reduced frequency influences the hydrodynamic force and the more rapid the pitch movement the larger the lift drag and moment of the guide vane tables 5 7 show the lift drag and moment coefficients of guide vane 3 for different values of the shape parameter β the time averaged lift and drag coefficients all increased slightly with increasing β however the time averaged moment coefficient decreased with increasing β it is also shown that the amplitude of the lift drag and moment coefficients all increased with the increase in β thus the shape parameter β influenced the hydrodynamic force and the larger β the larger the lift drag and moment of the guide vane table 8 shows the mean input power of guide vane 3 for different β values at different reynolds numbers the mean input power of guide vane 3 increased with the increase in β however the reynolds number had a little influence on the mean input power fig 9 shows the mean input power of guide vane 3 versus β and f the mean input power of guide vane 3 increased almost linearly with increasing β when β ranged from 1 0 to 3 0 the mean input power of guide vane 3 sharply increased with the increase in f thus β and f have large effects on the mean input power for the pitch movement of the guide vane in a linear turbine cascade 4 2 unsteady results 4 2 1 effects of asynchronous pitch movement simulations were implemented for four different cases including case 1 five guide vanes underwent synchronous pitch movement case 2 only guide vanes 1 3 and 5 underwent synchronous pitch movement while the others were fixed case 3 only guide vanes 2 and 4 underwent synchronous pitch movement while the others were fixed and case 4 only guide vane 3 underwent pitch movement while the others were fixed fig 10 shows the input power for different cases at f 0 11 and re 6 65 103 comparing fig 10 a and b the asynchronous pitch movement had little affect on the input power of guide vane 3 comparing fig 10 b and d the input power was nearly the same for guide vanes 1 3 and 5 furthermore the position of the guide vane in the linear turbine cascade had little influence on the input power for the pitch movement of the guide vane we also determined that β had a significant effect on the input power supplied to the guide vane but the effect was the same for each guide at different positions fig 10 e f show the input powers of guide vanes 2 3 and 4 in different cases there was little influence on the input power curve for asynchronous pitch movement thus the asynchronous pitch movement had nearly no influence on the input power curve for each guide vane 4 2 2 effects of non sinusoidal pitching profile shape fig 11 shows the instantaneous lift drag moment coefficients and the input power versus β over three periods when f 0 11 and re 6 65 103 the following results were obtained 1 the computational results were excellent over the three periods which indirectly validated the computational method 2 the peaks of the lift drag and moment coefficients and the input power all increased and appeared earlier as β increased because a larger value of β yielded a larger rotating velocity of the pitch movement in the initial stage and 3 the time averaged lift was approximately 0 00188 and the drag was 0 04468 the peak of the lift at β 3 0 was 2 85 times that at β 1 0 the peak of the drag at β 3 0 was nearly 2 25 times that at β 1 0 the peak of the moment at β 3 0 was 3 0 times that at β 1 0 and the peak of the input power at β 3 0 was nearly 8 98 times that at β 1 0 thus it can be concluded that the pitch movement parameter β had large influence on the input power and hydrodynamic force 4 2 3 effects of reduced frequency fig 12 shows the instantaneous lift coefficient drag coefficient moment coefficient and input power versus f over three periods when β 2 0 and re 6 65 103 we found the following 1 the peak of lift coefficient drag coefficient moment coefficient and power input all increased with the increase in f because the larger f was the larger the average rotating velocity of the pitch movement was and the larger the required energy input was for example the peak of the input power at f 0 22 was nearly 9 41 times that at f 0 074 thus the pitch movement frequency had a large influence on the input power and hydrodynamic characteristics 4 2 4 effects of reynolds number in this section we selected four different reynolds numbers to implement the computation i e re 6 65 102 6 65 103 6 65 104 and 6 65 105 the instantaneous lift coefficient drag coefficient moment coefficient and the input power are illustrated in figs 13 16 respectively for three periods with different values of β the maximum instantaneous value of the lift coefficient increased with increasing β thus the maximum instantaneous value of the lift drag fig 14 and moment fig 15 as well as the input power coefficient fig 16 were all achieved at β 3 0 the maximum lift coefficient was achieved at a near zero angle of attack which corresponded to the minimum drag coefficient fig 14 moreover there was a corresponding peak of the moment and input power coefficient figs 15 and 16 which suggested that a peak of the moment and input power coefficient was achieved at a large ratio of the lift to the drag the peak value of the lift coefficient of a foil over one period is related to the traveling status of leading edge vortex along the upper surface of the foil moreover the leading edge vortex traveling along the surface of the foil is related to the flow velocity i e the reynolds number for re 6 65 105 the leading edge vortex was more intense and had little chance to reattach at the foil surface thus a sudden increase in the time averaged value of the lift and drag coefficients could occur at higher reynolds numbers fig 13 shows the instantaneous lift coefficient for different reynolds numbers at f 0 11 the amplitude of the lift was almost no different for the four reynolds numbers and the time averaged lift was nearly equal to zero for re 6 65 102 6 65 103 and 6 65 104 however the time averaged lift was 0 04364 for re 6 65 105 which is significantly larger than that of the other three cases overall the reynolds number had little influence on the lift fig 14 shows the drag coefficient for four different reynolds numbers the time averaged drag increased with increasing reynolds number and the amplitude also sharply increased the maximum drag coefficient for re 6 65 105 was 4 566 and was far larger than that for re 6 65 104 which was only 0 5912 the reason was that the higher flow rate led to a larger pressure gap between the pressure surface and the suction surface of the foil the symmetry of the curve of the drag coefficient over a periodic was broken as the reynolds number increased which suggested that the vortex shedding was entirely different between the process of the guide vane rotating from 0 to the maximum attack angle and that of the guide vane rotating back from the maximum attack angle to 0 figs 15 and 16 show the moment and input power at different reynolds numbers respectively both were nearly equal for the four reynolds numbers and retained symmetry over a period from 0 to the maximum attack angle and rotating back from the maximum attack angle to 0 this suggested that the reynolds number variation from 6 65 102 to 6 65 105 had no influence on the moment and input power which meant that a high flow velocity was not required to add input energy for the guide vane to undergo forced pitch movement it was only required to add force to resist the lateral movement 5 conclusions in this paper the effects of non sinusoidal pitching motion on the hydrodynamic load and input power performance of a full active pitching guide vane in a linear turbine cascade were studied the incompressible navier stokes equations with an added momentum source were solved using a finite volume method based on the fractional time step method with the ib method the influence of the key factors on the hydrodynamic characteristics and input power of the guide vane were investigated first the effects of different pitching motions on the hydrodynamic and power input performance were investigated the statistical results showed that β and f had large effects on the drag lift and moment mean coefficients and the input power for the pitch movement of the guide vane in a linear turbine cascade the larger the values of β and f the larger the lift drag moment and input power of the guide vane we also found that the reynolds number and the asynchronous pitch movement had nearly no influence on the input power curve for each guide vane second the time dependence of the drag lift and moment coefficients as well as the input power for different values of β were examined and f and the reynolds number for three rotating periods were also investigated the pitch frequency had a larger influence on the maximum input power compared to β and the effect of the reynolds number was slight finally the current study reinforces the notion that a better control strategy design requires future studies over wider ranges of the parameters of β and f credit author

22163,in this paper a numerical simulation of a micro linear turbine cascade is presented the upstream stay vane and downstream guide vane were surrounded by incompressible flow and the guide vane was modeled with forced pitching motions the implicit immersed boundary method was used as the moving boundary flow solver to seek a better understanding of the influence of the motion parameters on hydrodynamic characteristics and input power of the oscillating guide vane the forced motion of a non sinusoidal oscillating guide vane was first investigated for different reduced frequencies and profile parameters second the instantaneous hydrodynamic behavior was simulated for different motion combinations and reynolds numbers the results showed that the reduced frequencies and profile parameters of the pitch movement had a large influence on the input power and the peak of the input power at f 0 22 was nearly 9 41 times that at f 0 074 but the input power was not sensitive to the motion combination and reynolds number however the reynolds number had a large influence on the drag and the maximum drag coefficient for re 6 65 105 was 4 566 however it was only 0 5912 for re 6 65 104 keywords micro linear turbine cascade moving boundary non sinusoidal oscillating profile immersed boundary method hydrodynamic characteristics input power 1 introduction it is a global trend to utilize renewable energy to fulfill the current energy demand edenhofer et al 2011 hydropower has been considered to be one of the most flexible and consistent renewable energy sources capable of supplying both base and peak demand energy demand is increasing rapidly and this is accompanied by the development of energy sources however most of the hydropower especially micro hydropower in developing regions is in the development stage prior to developing new projects identification of existing problems their severity and a suitable research approach to mitigate these problems is an important task gleick 1993 in hydraulic machinery for power output there are often turbine cascades in the distributor zone for instance a pump turbine often transfers between the pump case and turbine case with the operation of a guide vane which can lead to vibrations of the guide vane blade or resonance in the distributor channels nicolet et al 2006 zobeiri et al 2006 the flow induced vibrations of the guide vane excited by periodic vortex shedding wang et al 2010 can also lead to premature cracks vortex shedding occurs along the vane surface and enters the blade passage region which can induce pressure fluctuations leading to runner unit vibrations wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 furthermore when the hydro turbine transitions from one operating point to another during the transient processes runaway or emergency turbine shutdown it is often controlled by the guide vane and valves or wicket gates opening upstream however none of the previous studies have examined the true operational parametric range for a turbine cascade and the characteristics of the input power thus there is strong interest in the study of the forced oscillating behaviors of the turbine cascade in order to design safe and reliable turbines for river and ocean energy utilization in recent years many studies have concentrated on the flow characteristics in the turbine cascade as these turbulent wakes result in the loss of hydraulic energy for example antonsen 2007 performed a numerical and experimental study on the unsteady flow in the turbine cascade qian 2008 performed particle image velocimetry piv experiments for the measurement of unsteady flows at the stator of the francis turbine in their study in the turbine cascade small recirculation was found the flow at the exit of the stator was strongly non uniform with a higher velocity fluctuation under partial load conditions trivedi et al 2013 found that this did not allow operation at the best efficiency point and resulted in the formation of secondary vortices when opening or closing the guide vane thapa et al 2016 studied the flow characteristics using piv in asymmetric naca profiles for high head francis turbines the tip clearance characteristics and spatial temporal evolution leakage vortex in a mixed flow pump have been investigated in detail liu and tan 2018a b hao and tan 2018 liu and tan 2019 in addition some studies concentrated on fully active flapping hydrofoils used to output energy including studies of the foil geometry kinematics and flow effects john et al 2014 wang et al 2018a b li et al 2018 lu et al 2014 xiao et al 2012 xiao et al 2012 liu and tan 2018a b liu e al 2019 other studies used direct numerical simulations large eddy simulations and experiments to examine turbine blade cascades such as for low pressure turbines michalek and straka 2013 macisaac et al 2012 sideridis et al 2011 and hydro kinematic turbine wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b song et al 2019 to design a better operating strategy however the instantaneous hydrodynamic behavior and power input characteristics of the guide vane itself are very important but there has been little research on this topic especially for microturbine guide vane cascades numerical simulations considering large movements for complex geometries like hydraulic turbines are extremely time consuming using either classical or integrated methods based on re meshing technology therefore fixed mesh technologies in the last two decades have been proposed one of which is the immersed boundary method ibm based on the representation of the fluid structure interfaces the ibm can be classified as a diffuse interface method wang et al 2017 and a sharp interface method jiang et al 2018 in the diffuse interface method the immersed boundaries are smeared by distributing the singular forces to the surrounding background grid nodes using smooth functions or penalization methods diffuse interface methods can be further classified as classic ibms hou and shi 2008 ceniceros et al 2009 wang et al 2017 direct forcing ibms falun et al 2000 uhlmann 2005 kempe and frohlich 2012 ji et al 2012 wang et al 2018a b and penalization methods liu and vasilyev 2007 wang and zhang 2011 depending on the method for calculating the fictitious forces representing the effects of the immersed solid an inherent feature of the diffuse interface ibm is that the immersed boundaries are not sharp but are rather smeared across several grid nodes due to the use of the discrete delta function or a smoothing function the direct forcing ibm has been used successfully by many researchers in a variety of applications for example ji et al 2012 introduced an improved body force distribution function that transferred the body force in the discrete volume of ib points to the surrounding cartesian grids and performed a comparison of the computational results between the full distribution forcing strategy and the half distribution forcing strategy wang et al 2017 developed a simple and efficient implicit direct forcing immersed boundary model for the simulation of complex flows wang et al 2018a b presented an improved minimum least square approximation to combine with the implicit ib lbm method to improve the order of interpolation to motivate these successful applications of the ibm in this paper an implicit direct forcing ibm falun et al 2000 vikhansky 2003 chiu et al 2010 wu and shu 2009 ren et al 2012 wang et al 2017 is proposed to simulate an oscillating guide vane in a turbine cascade and the effects of different pitching motions on the energy input performance of a micro linear turbine cascade are investigated the rest of this paper is organized as follows the ib method is introduced in section 2 the numerical test and validation are described in section 3 the effects of the non sinusoidal pitching motion on the energy input performance are discussed in section 4 and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations in the ib method the action of the solid on the fluid is represented by forces as moment sources therefore the governing equations can be expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i f i where u i and p are the velocity and pressure respectively ρ is the fluid density and μ is the effective viscosity the momentum source term f i can be expressed as 3 f i x t v t f i x s t δ x x s t d v where x and x represent the eulerian coordinates of the fluid field and ib points on the immersed solid boundary respectively f i is the solid boundary force density and δ x x s t is the smooth delta function it is assumed that an arbitrary smooth region v t moves to δ x x s t at time t where 4 v t δ x x s t d x 1 i f x s t v t 0 o t h e r δ x x s t is expressed as 5 δ h x 1 h 2 ϕ x h ϕ y h where ϕ r can be written as 6 ϕ r 1 8 3 2 r 1 4 r 4 r 2 0 r 1 1 8 5 2 r 7 12 r 4 r 2 1 r 2 0 2 r where h is the local eulerian grid scale 2 2 immersed boundary framework with implicit direct forcing the generic conservation equation given by equation 2 which can be expressed as 7 φ t μ f where φ represents a conserved quantity such as ρ u or ρ v and μ is a flux function which can be expressed as 8 μ ρ u φ i p γ φ where γ is a generalized diffusive term and i is the unit tensor when the boundary body force density term f is omitted eq 7 can be expressed as 9 φ t μ 0 eq 9 can be discretized in time from step t n to t n 1 with time step size δ t t n 1 t n by a fractional step method and can be solved with a pressure poisson equation 27 an intermediate velocity u can be obtained and the source term f can be recovered eq 2 is discretized in time and eq 9 is subtracted yielding the following 10 u n 1 u δ t δ u δ t f the immersed solid boundary is represented by a set of ib points x i b i i 1 2 m and the fluid field is discretized on a fixed uniform cartesian mesh x j j 1 2 n with mesh spacing δ x δ y δ z furthermore two functions c j i and d i j which represent the interpolation and distribution functions are defined respectively as follows 11 c j i c x i b i x j 1 δ x δ y δ z ϕ x i b i x j δ x ϕ y i b i y j δ y ϕ z i b i z j δ z 12 d i j d x j x i b i 1 δ x δ y δ z ϕ x j x i b i δ x ϕ y j y i b i δ y ϕ z j z i b i δ z the distribution function c j i maps the physical field from the ib points to the cartesian grids however the interpolation function d i j projects the physical field from the cartesian grid back to the ib points the momentum source term f in eq 3 at the eulerian points is distributed from the boundary force f through the dirac delta function interpolation eq 3 can be written in the discrete form as 13 f x j t i c j i f x i b i t δ v i i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where δ v i is the ith segment boundary discrete volume these volumes are from a thin shell with a thickness equal to one mesh width around each ib point substituting eq 13 into eq 10 yields 14 δ u x j t i c j i f x i b i t δ v i δ t i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the only unknown in eq 14 is the solid boundary force density to satisfy the no slip boundary condition the velocity at the ib point interpolated from the corrected fluid velocity field via the smooth delta function d i j must be equal to the boundary natural velocity u x i b i t at the same position i e 15 u x i b i t j d i j u n 1 x j t δ x δ y j 1 2 n i 1 2 m u n 1 x j t is the corrected velocity at the jth eulerian grid point expressed as the sum of the predicted velocity u x j t and the velocity correction δ u x j t i e 16 u n 1 x j t u x j t δ u x j t substituting eqs 16 and 14 into eq 15 gives 17 u x i b i t j u x j t d i j δ x δ y j i d i j δ v i c j i f x i b i t δ t δ x δ y i 1 2 m j 1 2 n thus the equation system for the boundary force is formed this can be solved by direct or iterative methods and the unknown boundary force f x i b i t at all ib points are obtained simultaneously these are then substituted into eqs 14 and 16 to calculate the velocity correction δ u x j t and the corrected velocity u n 1 x j t in this study an immersed boundary lattice boltzmann flux solver was used to solve the governing equations of the fluid further details can be found elsewhere wang et al 2017 2 3 validation of numerical method 2 3 1 flow over stationary circular cylinder the flow over a circular cylinder is a typical example used to validate a numerical method in this work flow over a stationary circular cylinder was also used to validate the proposed method according to the definition of the function of ϕ r we only need to solve eq 6 in a reduced fluid domain as shown in fig 1 with dotted blue lines the solid is represented by a circular cylinder with diameter d d 4 δ x l d 6 δ x and d 4 δ y w d 6 δ y are the length and width of the reduced domain respectively the fluid density was taken as ρ f the free stream velocity was u the space mesh size was δ x δ y the time step was δ t and d 60 was the circular cylinder diameter the cylinder boundary was represented by 185 discrete points with uniform segmented boundary length δ s i for the simulations the computational domain was 20 d 15 d with an overall mesh size of 1200 900 the center of the cylinder was located at 7 5 d 7 5 d the reynolds number was based on ρ f u d and dynamic viscosity of the fluid fig 2 shows the streamlines when the flow reaches a steady state for reynolds numbers of 1 20 30 and 40 as well as the streamlines at an instantaneous state for reynolds numbers of 80 and 200 in general when the reynolds number was smaller than 40 a pair of symmetrical vortices was generated behind the circular cylinder and the recirculation length was incremented as the reynolds number increased when the reynolds number was greater than 40 the vortex was not symmetric and periodic eddy shedding occurred the streamlines obtained by the present method did not penetrate the cylinder surface which showed that the no slip boundary condition was satisfied next we define the relative recirculation length l w l d where l is the distance between the backmost point of the cylinder and the back stationary point of the vortex as shown in table 1 we compared the recirculation length l w for three cases with other references takami and keller 1969 dennis and chang 2006 ren et al 2012 wu et al 2012 the present recirculation length was close to those previously reported 2 3 2 in line oscillations of circular cylinder the problem of an in line oscillating circular cylinder in a static fluid is one classical case for moving boundary problems which has been studied using experiments imamura et al 2004 and numerical simulations dütsch et al 1998 wang et al 2009 yang and balaras 2006 the two key parameters for this flow are the reynolds number r e ρ f u m a x d μ where u m a x is the maximum velocity of the cylinder d is the diameter of the cylinder and the keulegan carpenter number k c u m a x f d where f is the characteristic frequency of the oscillation the in line motion of the cylinder is described by a simple harmonic oscillation 18 x t a s i n 2 π f t where a is the maximum displacement of the cylinder and a d was imposed the simulation was implemented on a rectangular domain 20d 15d with a uniform mesh size of 1200 900 the circular cylinder surface was represented by 150 discrete equidistant lagrangian points and the center of the circular cylinder was located at 10d 7 5d at t 0 free slip boundary conditions were imposed at four boundaries fig 3 reveals the vorticity contour at four different phase angles a b c and d represent the phase angles 2 π f t of 0 96 192 and 288 respectively in periodic vortex shedding as the oscillating cylinder moved in the forward direction the separating flow along the cylinder s upper and lower surfaces produced two counter rotating vortices with apparently the same strengths and vortex shapes when the cylinder started its backward motion it created the same vortex formation on the other side of the cylinder i e in the new wake of the cylinder flow this phenomenon and the vortex shape agreed well with the results of wang et al 2009 and yang and balaras 2006 the flow force acting on the circular cylinder was computed as follows 19 f i f x i b i t δ x δ s i ρ f v b α b where δ s i is the i t h boundary length δ x is grid scale for the fluid v b π d 2 4 and α b 4 a π 2 f 2 s i n 2 π f t fig 4 shows the variation of the dimensionless in line force f x in one cycle time t for an in line oscillating cylinder in a fluid at rest at re 100 and kc 5 the present results agreed well with those of wang et al 2009 and dütsch et al 1998 2 3 3 pitching and plunging oscillating hydrofoil at intermediate reynolds numbers in this section the flow around a naca0015 hydrofoil was tested at intermediate reynolds numbers the chord length c was 1 0 the motions of the foil are given by a combination of a pitching motion θ t θ 0 s i n 2 π f t and a heaving motion y t y 0 s i n 2 π f t 0 5 π y 0 c is the heaving amplitude θ 0 60 o is the pitching amplitude and f f c u 0 14 is a reduced frequency where u 1 0 is the inlet velocity the dimensionless coefficients for the thrust and lift and the reynold numbers are defined as c x f x 0 5 ρ u 2 c c y f y 0 5 ρ u 2 c and r e ρ f u c μ 5 10 5 respectively where f x is the horizontal hydrodynamic force and f y is the vertical hydrodynamic force the time histories of c x and c y have been compared with the results of kinsey and are shown in fig 5 the evolution c x and c y was consistent with that of kinsey which verified the validity of the present simulation strategy the vortex distribution around the hydrofoil at different times between a period are also shown in fig 6 which shows the generation and evolution of the leading edge vortex and tip vortex along the hydrofoil surface and the tail vortex movement 3 set up as shown in fig 7 a a linear turbine cascade was located in a channel which included stay vanes and guide vanes the upstream contains row stay vanes while the downstream contains row guide vanes five guide vanes in the middle were rotating while the others were static the channel inlet was a velocity inlet boundary condition the channel outlet used outflow boundary condition and the channel wall and vane surfaces were all no slip walls a two dimensional hydrofoil of the guide vane is shown in fig 7 b the chord length of the hydrofoil is denoted as a the pivoting point was located at the centerline of the hydrofoil with a distance b from the leading edge the angle of attack is denoted as θ which is the angle between the chord line and the y axis the upstream flow velocity at the inlet is denoted as u the flow reynolds number re ρ f u a μ the simulation was implemented on a rectangular domain for the rotating zone of the guide vane with a uniform fluid mesh size of 0 012 a and the rotating guide vane surface was represented by 169 discrete lagrangian points along a circumference with equal spacings of 0 012 a for the non sinusoidal pitching motion the instantaneous angle of attack θ is expressed as follows 20 θ θ 0 sin 1 2 β ω t 0 t π β ω θ 0 π β ω t π ω 2 1 β θ 0 sin 1 2 β ω t π 1 β π ω 2 1 β t 2 π ω where θ 0 is the pitching amplitude the angular flapping frequency ω 2 π f and f fa u is the reduced frequency when β 1 the foil pitches sinusoidally when β the pitching profile tends to be trapezoidal and the time variations of the pitching profile θ t for some typical values of β are shown in fig 8 dimensionless coefficients for lift drag and torque are respectfully defined as follows 21 c l t f l t 1 2 ρ f u 2 a c d t f d t 1 2 ρ f u 2 a c m t m t 1 2 ρ f u 2 a 3 where the velocity u is 0 055 m s for all the results the lift force drag force and torque were respectively computed from the viscous stress and pressure along the guide vane surface as 22 f l t γ f x t d s f d t γ f y t d s m t γ f r d s where f x t is the instantaneous x component of the solid boundary force f y t is the instantaneous y component of the solid boundary force and r is the distance between the ib points of the guide vane surface and pivoting point the instantaneous power input actuating the pitching motion of the guide vane can be calculated by p t m t θ t where m t is the torque about the pivoting point and θ t is the angular velocity of the guide vane the mean power input is defined as follows 23 p i t 1 3 t t 0 t 0 3 t p i t d t where t 2π ω is the period of the system three periods were used to calculate the mean input power 4 results 4 1 statistical results tables 2 4 show the lift drag and moment coefficients of the guide vane for three different reduced frequencies the time averaged lift and moment coefficients decreased with the decrease in reduced frequency and the amplitude of the moment and lift coefficients also declined with the increase in the reduced frequency the time averaged drag coefficient grew slightly with decreasing reduced frequency but the amplitude of the drag coefficient decreased with the decrease in the reduced frequency we concluded that the reduced frequency influences the hydrodynamic force and the more rapid the pitch movement the larger the lift drag and moment of the guide vane tables 5 7 show the lift drag and moment coefficients of guide vane 3 for different values of the shape parameter β the time averaged lift and drag coefficients all increased slightly with increasing β however the time averaged moment coefficient decreased with increasing β it is also shown that the amplitude of the lift drag and moment coefficients all increased with the increase in β thus the shape parameter β influenced the hydrodynamic force and the larger β the larger the lift drag and moment of the guide vane table 8 shows the mean input power of guide vane 3 for different β values at different reynolds numbers the mean input power of guide vane 3 increased with the increase in β however the reynolds number had a little influence on the mean input power fig 9 shows the mean input power of guide vane 3 versus β and f the mean input power of guide vane 3 increased almost linearly with increasing β when β ranged from 1 0 to 3 0 the mean input power of guide vane 3 sharply increased with the increase in f thus β and f have large effects on the mean input power for the pitch movement of the guide vane in a linear turbine cascade 4 2 unsteady results 4 2 1 effects of asynchronous pitch movement simulations were implemented for four different cases including case 1 five guide vanes underwent synchronous pitch movement case 2 only guide vanes 1 3 and 5 underwent synchronous pitch movement while the others were fixed case 3 only guide vanes 2 and 4 underwent synchronous pitch movement while the others were fixed and case 4 only guide vane 3 underwent pitch movement while the others were fixed fig 10 shows the input power for different cases at f 0 11 and re 6 65 103 comparing fig 10 a and b the asynchronous pitch movement had little affect on the input power of guide vane 3 comparing fig 10 b and d the input power was nearly the same for guide vanes 1 3 and 5 furthermore the position of the guide vane in the linear turbine cascade had little influence on the input power for the pitch movement of the guide vane we also determined that β had a significant effect on the input power supplied to the guide vane but the effect was the same for each guide at different positions fig 10 e f show the input powers of guide vanes 2 3 and 4 in different cases there was little influence on the input power curve for asynchronous pitch movement thus the asynchronous pitch movement had nearly no influence on the input power curve for each guide vane 4 2 2 effects of non sinusoidal pitching profile shape fig 11 shows the instantaneous lift drag moment coefficients and the input power versus β over three periods when f 0 11 and re 6 65 103 the following results were obtained 1 the computational results were excellent over the three periods which indirectly validated the computational method 2 the peaks of the lift drag and moment coefficients and the input power all increased and appeared earlier as β increased because a larger value of β yielded a larger rotating velocity of the pitch movement in the initial stage and 3 the time averaged lift was approximately 0 00188 and the drag was 0 04468 the peak of the lift at β 3 0 was 2 85 times that at β 1 0 the peak of the drag at β 3 0 was nearly 2 25 times that at β 1 0 the peak of the moment at β 3 0 was 3 0 times that at β 1 0 and the peak of the input power at β 3 0 was nearly 8 98 times that at β 1 0 thus it can be concluded that the pitch movement parameter β had large influence on the input power and hydrodynamic force 4 2 3 effects of reduced frequency fig 12 shows the instantaneous lift coefficient drag coefficient moment coefficient and input power versus f over three periods when β 2 0 and re 6 65 103 we found the following 1 the peak of lift coefficient drag coefficient moment coefficient and power input all increased with the increase in f because the larger f was the larger the average rotating velocity of the pitch movement was and the larger the required energy input was for example the peak of the input power at f 0 22 was nearly 9 41 times that at f 0 074 thus the pitch movement frequency had a large influence on the input power and hydrodynamic characteristics 4 2 4 effects of reynolds number in this section we selected four different reynolds numbers to implement the computation i e re 6 65 102 6 65 103 6 65 104 and 6 65 105 the instantaneous lift coefficient drag coefficient moment coefficient and the input power are illustrated in figs 13 16 respectively for three periods with different values of β the maximum instantaneous value of the lift coefficient increased with increasing β thus the maximum instantaneous value of the lift drag fig 14 and moment fig 15 as well as the input power coefficient fig 16 were all achieved at β 3 0 the maximum lift coefficient was achieved at a near zero angle of attack which corresponded to the minimum drag coefficient fig 14 moreover there was a corresponding peak of the moment and input power coefficient figs 15 and 16 which suggested that a peak of the moment and input power coefficient was achieved at a large ratio of the lift to the drag the peak value of the lift coefficient of a foil over one period is related to the traveling status of leading edge vortex along the upper surface of the foil moreover the leading edge vortex traveling along the surface of the foil is related to the flow velocity i e the reynolds number for re 6 65 105 the leading edge vortex was more intense and had little chance to reattach at the foil surface thus a sudden increase in the time averaged value of the lift and drag coefficients could occur at higher reynolds numbers fig 13 shows the instantaneous lift coefficient for different reynolds numbers at f 0 11 the amplitude of the lift was almost no different for the four reynolds numbers and the time averaged lift was nearly equal to zero for re 6 65 102 6 65 103 and 6 65 104 however the time averaged lift was 0 04364 for re 6 65 105 which is significantly larger than that of the other three cases overall the reynolds number had little influence on the lift fig 14 shows the drag coefficient for four different reynolds numbers the time averaged drag increased with increasing reynolds number and the amplitude also sharply increased the maximum drag coefficient for re 6 65 105 was 4 566 and was far larger than that for re 6 65 104 which was only 0 5912 the reason was that the higher flow rate led to a larger pressure gap between the pressure surface and the suction surface of the foil the symmetry of the curve of the drag coefficient over a periodic was broken as the reynolds number increased which suggested that the vortex shedding was entirely different between the process of the guide vane rotating from 0 to the maximum attack angle and that of the guide vane rotating back from the maximum attack angle to 0 figs 15 and 16 show the moment and input power at different reynolds numbers respectively both were nearly equal for the four reynolds numbers and retained symmetry over a period from 0 to the maximum attack angle and rotating back from the maximum attack angle to 0 this suggested that the reynolds number variation from 6 65 102 to 6 65 105 had no influence on the moment and input power which meant that a high flow velocity was not required to add input energy for the guide vane to undergo forced pitch movement it was only required to add force to resist the lateral movement 5 conclusions in this paper the effects of non sinusoidal pitching motion on the hydrodynamic load and input power performance of a full active pitching guide vane in a linear turbine cascade were studied the incompressible navier stokes equations with an added momentum source were solved using a finite volume method based on the fractional time step method with the ib method the influence of the key factors on the hydrodynamic characteristics and input power of the guide vane were investigated first the effects of different pitching motions on the hydrodynamic and power input performance were investigated the statistical results showed that β and f had large effects on the drag lift and moment mean coefficients and the input power for the pitch movement of the guide vane in a linear turbine cascade the larger the values of β and f the larger the lift drag moment and input power of the guide vane we also found that the reynolds number and the asynchronous pitch movement had nearly no influence on the input power curve for each guide vane second the time dependence of the drag lift and moment coefficients as well as the input power for different values of β were examined and f and the reynolds number for three rotating periods were also investigated the pitch frequency had a larger influence on the maximum input power compared to β and the effect of the reynolds number was slight finally the current study reinforces the notion that a better control strategy design requires future studies over wider ranges of the parameters of β and f credit author

22164,from the collected records of simultaneously measured wind and wave data during fetch experiment the sample and mean power spectral density and coherence functions of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes are calculated based on the calculated mean coherence function and interaction mechanism of wind and wave a parametric model and simple parameter estimate method are proposed to fit the coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes the model is an explicit function of the main characteristic parameters of wind and wave hence it can be used to model other empirical coherences of the random wind and wave processes in deep water combining the theoretical spectrum models fitting the calculated mean power spectral density functions of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes and proposed coherence model for modeling the processes the theoretical cross spectrum density matrix of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes is established samples of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes are simulated to illustrate the influence of coherence on the random wind and wave loads keywords random wind and wave coherence 3 parameter model cross spectrum density matrix simulated samples 1 introduction marine structures are usually subjected to seriously random wind and wave loads in storm survive and operation the fundamental frequencies of marine structures such as the articulated leg platforms tension leg platforms semi submersible oil drilling or living platforms and so on are often designed to be far below the commonly occurring frequency range of waves to avoid dynamic amplification however since most of energy in wind lies in the low frequency range and the exposed areas of some marine structures to wind may be large there will also be significant dynamic responses for the marine structures due to wind gustiness hence it is necessary to consider coherence of wind and wave and calculate the combined wind and wave loads in random vibration analysis of such marine structures there have been a few attempts to study coherence of wind and wave and calculate the combined wind and wave loads in the last decades the third generation wave models wamdi group 1988 komen et al 1994 integrates the wave action balance equation in which the source function consists of terms accounting for wind input miles 1957 janssen 1991 2004 therefore when the input wind is random the random wind waves generated by the input wind can be simulated based on the mechanism of wind sea energy transfer xu established a stochastic fourier spectrum for wind waves xu 2008 the fourier spectrum contains six random parameters including the equivalent wind velocity and air density which can be identified by recorded power spectrum samples of wind waves based on a selected record of simultaneously measured wind and wave data during fetch experiment pettersson et al 2003 drennan et al 2003 elsayed analyzed wavelet bi coherence of wind and wind wave which shows that the phase coupling occurs between wind speed and wave height over a certain rage of frequencies elsayed 2006 however this study did not establish the theoretical model of coherence of wind and wind wave in order to analyze the random dynamic responses of articulated towers under correlated wind and waves zaheer and islam used the previously established relations of the significant wave height and zero crossing period corresponding and wind velocity to obtain power spectra of related wind velocity and wave elevation whereby the combined wind and wave loads can be calculated zaheer and islam 2012 2017 in general the current research on coherence of wind and wave and combination of wind and wave loads is still not perfect enough at present there is no simple and practical theoretical models of coherence and cross spectrum of wind and wave which can be used conveniently to calculate random correlated wind and wave loads the main objective of the present study is to propose a theoretical model for coherence of random wind and wave in deep water based on the spectra analysis of the collected records of simultaneously measured wind and wave data during fetch experiment in addition the theoretical cross spectral density matrix model is also modeled for random wind and wave in deep water based on the spectra analysis the established coherence and cross spectral density matrix models are used to simulate the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes of fetch experiment which demonstrates the effectiveness and use of the theoretical models in the combination of random wind and wave loads 2 spectra and coherence analysis based on recorded data in the present study a total of 50 sets of recorded data of simultaneously measured wind and wave during fetch experiment pettersson et al 2003 drennan et al 2003 are analyzed to produce spectra and coherence of the wind and waves the fetch experiment took place from 12 march to april 16 1998 in the gulf of lion in the north western mediterranean sea data were recorded from an asis air sea interaction spar buoy moored at a depth of 100 m each set of recorded data includes time series of the wind velocity measured with a sonic anemometer at the height of 7 m above the mean surface level and the wave height measured with a capacitance wave gauge the wind and waves are sampled continuously at 12 hz and analyzed in 28 5 min blocks both wind and wave data are fully corrected for the motion of the platform as described in the papers above the data selected for the present study are from 20 21 march when the seas were strongly forced and the wave field was dominated by wind waves an example of the recorded data is given in fig 1 the mean values of the 50 recorded data of the wind velocities and their average value are calculated and plotted in fig 2 note that the average value of the 50 mean wind velocities is 13 202 m s the friction velocities related to the 50 wind records calculated by the eddy correlation method as described in drennan et al 2003 are plotted in fig 3 the average value of the friction velocities is calculated as 0 553 m s and is also shown in fig 3 note that the analysis of the auto correlation functions and marginal distributions of the 50 sets of recorded data shows that the wave fluctuating wind velocity process is weakly stationary and approximately gaussian from the recorded data a total of 50 of the sample auto and cross spectra of the horizontal fluctuating wind velocities and wave heights are calculated respectively by using the periodogram method and vector autoregressive var model hamilton 1994 brockwell and davis 2006 appendix a gives the comparative analysis of the calculated results from the periodogram method and var model as well as the reason for using the var model to calculate the spectra in this study in fact the further investigation also shows that it is not able to obtain the sufficiently smooth and consistent sample coherences by using the kernel smoothed empirical periodograms for the 50 sets of recorded data on the other hand the relative error of the calculated results from the 9 order var model and those from the 10 order var model are less than 3 therefore the 9 order var model is used in this study to analyze the sample spectra from the calculated sample auto and cross spectra the sample coherences of the fluctuating wind velocities and wave heights can be estimated by 1 γ ˆ u t η t ω s ˆ u t η t ω s ˆ u t ω s ˆ η t ω where γ ˆ u t η t ω is the sample coherence function u t denotes the fluctuating wind velocity process η t denotes the wave height process s ˆ u t ω and s ˆ η t ω are respectively the sample two sided auto power spectral density auto psd function of u t and η t and s ˆ u t η t ω is the sample two sided cross power spectral density cross psd function of u t and η t note that in time series the notion of the frequency coherence defined by 1 can be used to assess whether the wave height process η t is related to fluctuating wind velocity process u t by a time invariant linear filter kleiber 2017 the calculated auto psds s ˆ u t ω and s ˆ η t ω and their mean value function are shown in figs 4 and 5 it can be seen in figs 4 and 5 that most of energy in the fluctuating wind velocity process lies in the low frequency ranges ω 0 1 rad s while the commonly occurring frequency ranges of the wave height process are about 0 5 2 5 rad s the sample spectral peak frequencies of the wave height process are calculated and shown in fig 6 their average value is ω p 1 417 rad s as shown in fig 6 for the narrow banded see fig 5 stationary and gaussian wind wave the sample significant wave heights can be estimated from the formula 2 h ˆ s 4 σ ˆ η 4 2 0 s ˆ η t ω d ω 1 2 where σ ˆ η is the sample version of the standard deviation of the wave height process through using eq 2 one can approximately calculate the sample significant wave heights of the wave height process and the results are shown in fig 7 their average value is calculated as h s 1 860 m and is also shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows that the calculated significant wave heights are relatively smaller this indicates that the wave height process has the relatively larger spectral peak frequencies as shown in fig 6 from the sample auto psds s ˆ u t ω and s ˆ η t ω shown in figs 4 and 5 and the corresponding sample cross psds s ˆ u t η t ω that are calculated by the 9 order var model the sample coherence functions γ ˆ u t η t ω can be obtained through using eq 1 and are plotted in fig 8 the average value function of the sample coherences is also calculated and plotted in fig 8 it can be seen in fig 8 that almost each of the sample coherence functions is a unimodal curve which its ascending segment rises from a very small value at ω 0 rad s to the peak value at ω ω c p and its descending segment falls relatively slowly from the peak value at ω ω c p here ω c p denote the corresponding peak frequencies of the sample coherence functions fig 9 shows that the maximum values of the sample coherence functions as compared the maximum value of the mean coherence function is also calculated and shown in fig 9 the peak frequencies of the sample coherence functions and the frequency corresponding to the maximum value of the mean coherence function are calculated and shown in fig 10 note that the maximum value and peak frequency of the mean coherence function are γ max 0 185 and ω c p 1 490 rad s respectively 3 theoretical models of the auto psds coherence and spectral matrix 3 1 theoretical models of the mean auto psds some theoretical auto psd models have been developed in the several last decades to model the random fluctuating velocity process such as davenport spectrum davenport 1961 kaimal spectrum 1972 ochi spectrum 1988 npd spectrum and api spectrum adopted by the commercial softwares and so on the definitions of the infrequently used npd and api spectra are given in appendix b among the fore mentioned auto psds models only kaimal spectrum can fit well the mean auto psd shown in fig 4 in contrast the other theoretical models mentioned above cannot fit the mean auto psd in the present study therefore kaimal spectrum is used to model the mean auto psd of the fluctuating wind velocities of fetch experiment which can be written as 3 s u t ω 200 2 π u 2 z u z 1 1 50 ω z 2 π u z 5 3 where s u t ω denotes the theoretical function of the auto psd of the considered fluctuating wind velocity process u 0 553 m s is the calculated mean friction velocity of the 50 wind records of fetch experiment z 7 m is the height above the mean surface level and u z 13 202 m s is set to be the average value of the mean wind velocities of the 50 wind records of fetch experiment similarly some theoretical auto psd models have also been developed in the several last decades to model the random wave process such as neumann spectrum neumann 1952 the well known pierson moskowitz spectrum and jonswap spectrum etc relatively speaking jonswap spectrum has a better agreement with the mean wave spectrum shown in fig 5 jonswap spectrum therefore is used in the present study to model the mean wave spectrum which can be written in the terms of the significant wave height and spectral peak period 4 s η t ω 319 34 2 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1948 1 t p ω 4 γ exp 0 159 t p ω 1 2 2 σ 2 where s η t ω denotes the theoretical function of the two sided auto psd of the considered wave height process h s 1 860 m and t p 2 π ω p 2 π 1 417 4 434 s are respectively set to be the average values of the sample significant wave heights and spectral peak periods of the 50 wave records of fetch experiment γ 3 3 is the spectra peak coefficient and the coefficient σ is set to be σ 0 07 for ω ω p and σ 0 09 for ω ω p here ω p is the average value of the sample spectral peak frequencies of the 50 wave records of fetch experiment the resulting jonswap spectrum modeling the wave height process of fetch experiment is shown in fig 5 3 2 theoretical model of the mean coherence it can be seen in fig 8 that the mean coherence function of the 50 recorded data of simultaneously measured wind and wave during fetch experiment is unimodal function with an ascending segment and a descending segment compared with the ascending segment the descending segment falls relatively slowly in addition the previously developed mechanisms of the interaction of wind and wave indicate that coherence of wind and wave should decrease with the height z above the mean surface level increase with the mean wind velocity u z increase with the significant wave height h s and decrease with peak frequency ω p 2 π t p of wave spectrum hence a 5 paramter theoretical function can be proposed for modeling the coherence of the wind and wave processes 5 γ u t η t ω a ω 2 π c 1 z c 2 h s t p c 3 u z b exp ω 2 π c 1 z c 2 h s t p c 3 u z where a is the real scale parameter and b c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the real shape parameters note that the second term in eq 5 mainly dominates the ascending segment of the theoretical model and the last term in eq 5 mainly dominates the descending segment of the theoretical model in addition the right hand side of eq 5 has been treated by nondimensionalization in the 5 paramter model defined by eq 5 the parameters c 2 and c 3 can be regarded as the impact factors of the significant wave height and spectral peak frequency as well as mean wind velocity on the coherence however further analysis shows that the parameters c 2 and c 3 have little effect on the shape of the theoretical model defined by eq 5 the 5 paramter theoretical function therefore can be simplified to a 3 parameter model through setting the parameters c 2 c 3 1 and replacing c 1 by a real parameter c 6 γ u t η t ω a ω 2 π c z h s t p u z b exp ω 2 π c z h s t p u z obviously the least squares estimation method can be used to identify the scale parameter a and shape parameters b and c of the model defined by eq 6 however a simpler and more effective method is proposed herein to estimate the parameters of the 3 parameter model such that the resulting theoretical model has the extensive applicability and practical significance in the proposed parameter estimate method it is assumed that the maximum value and peak frequency of the 3 parameter model equal respectively to the maximum value γ max and peak frequency ω c p of the calculated mean coherence function whereby the flowing relationships of the parameters a and c and the parameter b can be derived out 7 a δ b ω c p b e b γ max and 8 c b δ 1 ω c p 1 in which δ z 2 π h s t p u z eqs 7 and 8 show that in order to estimate all the parameters of the 3 parameter model defined by eq 6 one just needs to choose a suitable shape parameter b dominating the ascending segment of coherence in the present study the parameter b is chosen as b 5 5 consequently the parameters a and c are calculated as a 4 832 10 6 and c 45 132 in the case that h s 1 860 m and t p 4 434 s are respectively set to be the average values of the significant wave heights and spectral peak frequencies obtained from the 50 wave recorded data the resulting theoretical coherence function is plotted in fig 8 compared with the theoretical coherence function whose parameters are estimated from the mean sample coherence by using the least squares estimation method note that the model parameters estimated by the least squares estimation method are a 0 0125 b 4 661 and c 35 603 respectively fig 8 shows that the theoretical model obtained by the proposed parameter estimation method has the same the peak point with that of the mean coherence function while the peak point of the theoretical coherence obtained by the least squares estimation method is much lower than that of the mean coherence in addition the theoretical model obtained by the proposed parameter estimation method has relatively larger values around the peak point and smaller values in the low and high frequency ranges than those of the mean coherence function and theoretical model obtained by the least squares estimation method noting that for the collected 50 wind and wave recorded data the peak frequency ω c p 1 490 rad s of the mean coherence function is similar to the peak frequency ω p 1 417 rad s of the mean wave spectrum one can find that the theoretical coherence model appropriately enlarges the interaction of the wind and wave processes in the frequency range in which most of energy in wave lies consequently in the random vibration analysis of marine structures energy in the wind and wave processes in this frequency range are all appropriately enlarged due to the positive coherence of the wind and wave processes from the structural safety point of view this is appropriate 3 3 theoretical model of the spectral density matrix since the coherence function defined by eq 6 is real according to eq 1 the theoretical two sided cross spectra of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes can be written as 9 s u t η t ω γ u t η t ω s u t ω s η t ω in which the auto psds s u t ω and s η t ω and coherence function γ u t η t ω are respectively defined by eq 3 eq 4 and eq 6 the theoretical spectral density matrix of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes can then be written as 10 s ω s u t ω s u t η t ω s u t η t ω s η t ω using the spectral representation algorithm for simulating the vector random processes geodatis 1996 the samples of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes defined by the spectral matrix eq 10 can be simulated which can be used to calculate the response samples of marine structures to the random wind and wave loads a simulated fluctuating wind velocity sample and a simulated wave height sample are respectively plotted in fig 11 and fig 12 as compared the simulated samples of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes without considering the interaction i e γ u t η t ω 0 are also plotted in figs 11 and 12 respectively note that in the simulation the lower and upper cutoff frequency are respectively ω l 0 02 rad s and ω u 3 0 rad s the equal frequency interval δ ω ω u ω l n ω 0 0015 rad s here n ω 2048 is the number of discrete frequency intervals and the discrete time step δ t 0 785 s the simulated fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes therefore have a period t 0 6 π δ ω 12954 3 s it can be seen in figs 11 and 12 that the maximum values of the simulated fluctuating wind velocity and wave height samples considering the interaction especially the latter are all larger than those of the simulated samples without considering the interaction in addition the frequency contents of the simulated fluctuating wind velocity and wave height samples considering the interaction are also changed compared with those of the simulated samples without considering the interaction hence the random vibration responses of the marine structures to the random wind and wave loads will be different for the cases that the interaction of the wind and wave is considered and not considered 4 summary and conclusions a total of 50 sets of the simultaneously measured wind and wave data during fetch experiment are collected to study the coherence of the random wind and wave processes in deep water based on the collected recorded data 50 sample auto psds and coherence functions of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes are calculated from which the mean auto psds and coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes as well as the mean significant wave height and spectral peak frequency period of the wave process are obtained according to the calculated mean auto psds kaimal spectrum and jonswap spectrum are chosen to be the theoretical models for modeling the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes respectively the specific forms of kaimal spectrum and jonswap spectrum modeling respectively the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes are established based on the parameters related to the wind and wave that are calculated from the collected recoded data during fetch experiment the calculated mean coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes is a unimodal function the peak frequency of the mean coherence approximately equals to the mean spectral peak frequency calculated from the sample auto psds of the wave height process this indicates that large coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes lies in the commonly occurring frequency range of the wave the maximum value of the mean coherence function is slightly less than 0 2 which shows that the coherence of the considered wind and wave cannot be ignored in practical applications based on the calculated mean coherence mechanism of the interaction of wind and wave and dimensional analysis a 5 parameter theoretical model is proposed in the present study for modeling coherence of fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes the model contains the variables of the mean wind velocity height above the mean surface level significant wave height and spectral peak period of wave it is therefore suitable to model coherences of general wind and wave processes in deep water the parameters of the proposed 5 parameter model can be identified from empirical coherences of wind and wave processes by using the least squares estimation method the 5 paramter model is further simplified to be a 3 parameter model through a parametric sensitivity analysis in the present study at the same time a simpler and more efficient method is proposed to estimate the parameters of the 3 parameter model through letting the peak point of the theoretical model coincides with that of the empirical coherence function using the 3 parameter model and proposed parameter estimate method the theoretical model is obtained to model the mean coherence function calculated from the collected 50 wind and wave records during fetch experiment the obtained theoretical model appropriately enlarges the coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes in the frequency range in which most of energy in wave lies to provide slightly conservative random wind and wave loads from the theoretical models of auto psds and coherence the spectral matrix of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave

22164,from the collected records of simultaneously measured wind and wave data during fetch experiment the sample and mean power spectral density and coherence functions of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes are calculated based on the calculated mean coherence function and interaction mechanism of wind and wave a parametric model and simple parameter estimate method are proposed to fit the coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes the model is an explicit function of the main characteristic parameters of wind and wave hence it can be used to model other empirical coherences of the random wind and wave processes in deep water combining the theoretical spectrum models fitting the calculated mean power spectral density functions of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes and proposed coherence model for modeling the processes the theoretical cross spectrum density matrix of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes is established samples of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes are simulated to illustrate the influence of coherence on the random wind and wave loads keywords random wind and wave coherence 3 parameter model cross spectrum density matrix simulated samples 1 introduction marine structures are usually subjected to seriously random wind and wave loads in storm survive and operation the fundamental frequencies of marine structures such as the articulated leg platforms tension leg platforms semi submersible oil drilling or living platforms and so on are often designed to be far below the commonly occurring frequency range of waves to avoid dynamic amplification however since most of energy in wind lies in the low frequency range and the exposed areas of some marine structures to wind may be large there will also be significant dynamic responses for the marine structures due to wind gustiness hence it is necessary to consider coherence of wind and wave and calculate the combined wind and wave loads in random vibration analysis of such marine structures there have been a few attempts to study coherence of wind and wave and calculate the combined wind and wave loads in the last decades the third generation wave models wamdi group 1988 komen et al 1994 integrates the wave action balance equation in which the source function consists of terms accounting for wind input miles 1957 janssen 1991 2004 therefore when the input wind is random the random wind waves generated by the input wind can be simulated based on the mechanism of wind sea energy transfer xu established a stochastic fourier spectrum for wind waves xu 2008 the fourier spectrum contains six random parameters including the equivalent wind velocity and air density which can be identified by recorded power spectrum samples of wind waves based on a selected record of simultaneously measured wind and wave data during fetch experiment pettersson et al 2003 drennan et al 2003 elsayed analyzed wavelet bi coherence of wind and wind wave which shows that the phase coupling occurs between wind speed and wave height over a certain rage of frequencies elsayed 2006 however this study did not establish the theoretical model of coherence of wind and wind wave in order to analyze the random dynamic responses of articulated towers under correlated wind and waves zaheer and islam used the previously established relations of the significant wave height and zero crossing period corresponding and wind velocity to obtain power spectra of related wind velocity and wave elevation whereby the combined wind and wave loads can be calculated zaheer and islam 2012 2017 in general the current research on coherence of wind and wave and combination of wind and wave loads is still not perfect enough at present there is no simple and practical theoretical models of coherence and cross spectrum of wind and wave which can be used conveniently to calculate random correlated wind and wave loads the main objective of the present study is to propose a theoretical model for coherence of random wind and wave in deep water based on the spectra analysis of the collected records of simultaneously measured wind and wave data during fetch experiment in addition the theoretical cross spectral density matrix model is also modeled for random wind and wave in deep water based on the spectra analysis the established coherence and cross spectral density matrix models are used to simulate the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes of fetch experiment which demonstrates the effectiveness and use of the theoretical models in the combination of random wind and wave loads 2 spectra and coherence analysis based on recorded data in the present study a total of 50 sets of recorded data of simultaneously measured wind and wave during fetch experiment pettersson et al 2003 drennan et al 2003 are analyzed to produce spectra and coherence of the wind and waves the fetch experiment took place from 12 march to april 16 1998 in the gulf of lion in the north western mediterranean sea data were recorded from an asis air sea interaction spar buoy moored at a depth of 100 m each set of recorded data includes time series of the wind velocity measured with a sonic anemometer at the height of 7 m above the mean surface level and the wave height measured with a capacitance wave gauge the wind and waves are sampled continuously at 12 hz and analyzed in 28 5 min blocks both wind and wave data are fully corrected for the motion of the platform as described in the papers above the data selected for the present study are from 20 21 march when the seas were strongly forced and the wave field was dominated by wind waves an example of the recorded data is given in fig 1 the mean values of the 50 recorded data of the wind velocities and their average value are calculated and plotted in fig 2 note that the average value of the 50 mean wind velocities is 13 202 m s the friction velocities related to the 50 wind records calculated by the eddy correlation method as described in drennan et al 2003 are plotted in fig 3 the average value of the friction velocities is calculated as 0 553 m s and is also shown in fig 3 note that the analysis of the auto correlation functions and marginal distributions of the 50 sets of recorded data shows that the wave fluctuating wind velocity process is weakly stationary and approximately gaussian from the recorded data a total of 50 of the sample auto and cross spectra of the horizontal fluctuating wind velocities and wave heights are calculated respectively by using the periodogram method and vector autoregressive var model hamilton 1994 brockwell and davis 2006 appendix a gives the comparative analysis of the calculated results from the periodogram method and var model as well as the reason for using the var model to calculate the spectra in this study in fact the further investigation also shows that it is not able to obtain the sufficiently smooth and consistent sample coherences by using the kernel smoothed empirical periodograms for the 50 sets of recorded data on the other hand the relative error of the calculated results from the 9 order var model and those from the 10 order var model are less than 3 therefore the 9 order var model is used in this study to analyze the sample spectra from the calculated sample auto and cross spectra the sample coherences of the fluctuating wind velocities and wave heights can be estimated by 1 γ ˆ u t η t ω s ˆ u t η t ω s ˆ u t ω s ˆ η t ω where γ ˆ u t η t ω is the sample coherence function u t denotes the fluctuating wind velocity process η t denotes the wave height process s ˆ u t ω and s ˆ η t ω are respectively the sample two sided auto power spectral density auto psd function of u t and η t and s ˆ u t η t ω is the sample two sided cross power spectral density cross psd function of u t and η t note that in time series the notion of the frequency coherence defined by 1 can be used to assess whether the wave height process η t is related to fluctuating wind velocity process u t by a time invariant linear filter kleiber 2017 the calculated auto psds s ˆ u t ω and s ˆ η t ω and their mean value function are shown in figs 4 and 5 it can be seen in figs 4 and 5 that most of energy in the fluctuating wind velocity process lies in the low frequency ranges ω 0 1 rad s while the commonly occurring frequency ranges of the wave height process are about 0 5 2 5 rad s the sample spectral peak frequencies of the wave height process are calculated and shown in fig 6 their average value is ω p 1 417 rad s as shown in fig 6 for the narrow banded see fig 5 stationary and gaussian wind wave the sample significant wave heights can be estimated from the formula 2 h ˆ s 4 σ ˆ η 4 2 0 s ˆ η t ω d ω 1 2 where σ ˆ η is the sample version of the standard deviation of the wave height process through using eq 2 one can approximately calculate the sample significant wave heights of the wave height process and the results are shown in fig 7 their average value is calculated as h s 1 860 m and is also shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows that the calculated significant wave heights are relatively smaller this indicates that the wave height process has the relatively larger spectral peak frequencies as shown in fig 6 from the sample auto psds s ˆ u t ω and s ˆ η t ω shown in figs 4 and 5 and the corresponding sample cross psds s ˆ u t η t ω that are calculated by the 9 order var model the sample coherence functions γ ˆ u t η t ω can be obtained through using eq 1 and are plotted in fig 8 the average value function of the sample coherences is also calculated and plotted in fig 8 it can be seen in fig 8 that almost each of the sample coherence functions is a unimodal curve which its ascending segment rises from a very small value at ω 0 rad s to the peak value at ω ω c p and its descending segment falls relatively slowly from the peak value at ω ω c p here ω c p denote the corresponding peak frequencies of the sample coherence functions fig 9 shows that the maximum values of the sample coherence functions as compared the maximum value of the mean coherence function is also calculated and shown in fig 9 the peak frequencies of the sample coherence functions and the frequency corresponding to the maximum value of the mean coherence function are calculated and shown in fig 10 note that the maximum value and peak frequency of the mean coherence function are γ max 0 185 and ω c p 1 490 rad s respectively 3 theoretical models of the auto psds coherence and spectral matrix 3 1 theoretical models of the mean auto psds some theoretical auto psd models have been developed in the several last decades to model the random fluctuating velocity process such as davenport spectrum davenport 1961 kaimal spectrum 1972 ochi spectrum 1988 npd spectrum and api spectrum adopted by the commercial softwares and so on the definitions of the infrequently used npd and api spectra are given in appendix b among the fore mentioned auto psds models only kaimal spectrum can fit well the mean auto psd shown in fig 4 in contrast the other theoretical models mentioned above cannot fit the mean auto psd in the present study therefore kaimal spectrum is used to model the mean auto psd of the fluctuating wind velocities of fetch experiment which can be written as 3 s u t ω 200 2 π u 2 z u z 1 1 50 ω z 2 π u z 5 3 where s u t ω denotes the theoretical function of the auto psd of the considered fluctuating wind velocity process u 0 553 m s is the calculated mean friction velocity of the 50 wind records of fetch experiment z 7 m is the height above the mean surface level and u z 13 202 m s is set to be the average value of the mean wind velocities of the 50 wind records of fetch experiment similarly some theoretical auto psd models have also been developed in the several last decades to model the random wave process such as neumann spectrum neumann 1952 the well known pierson moskowitz spectrum and jonswap spectrum etc relatively speaking jonswap spectrum has a better agreement with the mean wave spectrum shown in fig 5 jonswap spectrum therefore is used in the present study to model the mean wave spectrum which can be written in the terms of the significant wave height and spectral peak period 4 s η t ω 319 34 2 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1948 1 t p ω 4 γ exp 0 159 t p ω 1 2 2 σ 2 where s η t ω denotes the theoretical function of the two sided auto psd of the considered wave height process h s 1 860 m and t p 2 π ω p 2 π 1 417 4 434 s are respectively set to be the average values of the sample significant wave heights and spectral peak periods of the 50 wave records of fetch experiment γ 3 3 is the spectra peak coefficient and the coefficient σ is set to be σ 0 07 for ω ω p and σ 0 09 for ω ω p here ω p is the average value of the sample spectral peak frequencies of the 50 wave records of fetch experiment the resulting jonswap spectrum modeling the wave height process of fetch experiment is shown in fig 5 3 2 theoretical model of the mean coherence it can be seen in fig 8 that the mean coherence function of the 50 recorded data of simultaneously measured wind and wave during fetch experiment is unimodal function with an ascending segment and a descending segment compared with the ascending segment the descending segment falls relatively slowly in addition the previously developed mechanisms of the interaction of wind and wave indicate that coherence of wind and wave should decrease with the height z above the mean surface level increase with the mean wind velocity u z increase with the significant wave height h s and decrease with peak frequency ω p 2 π t p of wave spectrum hence a 5 paramter theoretical function can be proposed for modeling the coherence of the wind and wave processes 5 γ u t η t ω a ω 2 π c 1 z c 2 h s t p c 3 u z b exp ω 2 π c 1 z c 2 h s t p c 3 u z where a is the real scale parameter and b c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the real shape parameters note that the second term in eq 5 mainly dominates the ascending segment of the theoretical model and the last term in eq 5 mainly dominates the descending segment of the theoretical model in addition the right hand side of eq 5 has been treated by nondimensionalization in the 5 paramter model defined by eq 5 the parameters c 2 and c 3 can be regarded as the impact factors of the significant wave height and spectral peak frequency as well as mean wind velocity on the coherence however further analysis shows that the parameters c 2 and c 3 have little effect on the shape of the theoretical model defined by eq 5 the 5 paramter theoretical function therefore can be simplified to a 3 parameter model through setting the parameters c 2 c 3 1 and replacing c 1 by a real parameter c 6 γ u t η t ω a ω 2 π c z h s t p u z b exp ω 2 π c z h s t p u z obviously the least squares estimation method can be used to identify the scale parameter a and shape parameters b and c of the model defined by eq 6 however a simpler and more effective method is proposed herein to estimate the parameters of the 3 parameter model such that the resulting theoretical model has the extensive applicability and practical significance in the proposed parameter estimate method it is assumed that the maximum value and peak frequency of the 3 parameter model equal respectively to the maximum value γ max and peak frequency ω c p of the calculated mean coherence function whereby the flowing relationships of the parameters a and c and the parameter b can be derived out 7 a δ b ω c p b e b γ max and 8 c b δ 1 ω c p 1 in which δ z 2 π h s t p u z eqs 7 and 8 show that in order to estimate all the parameters of the 3 parameter model defined by eq 6 one just needs to choose a suitable shape parameter b dominating the ascending segment of coherence in the present study the parameter b is chosen as b 5 5 consequently the parameters a and c are calculated as a 4 832 10 6 and c 45 132 in the case that h s 1 860 m and t p 4 434 s are respectively set to be the average values of the significant wave heights and spectral peak frequencies obtained from the 50 wave recorded data the resulting theoretical coherence function is plotted in fig 8 compared with the theoretical coherence function whose parameters are estimated from the mean sample coherence by using the least squares estimation method note that the model parameters estimated by the least squares estimation method are a 0 0125 b 4 661 and c 35 603 respectively fig 8 shows that the theoretical model obtained by the proposed parameter estimation method has the same the peak point with that of the mean coherence function while the peak point of the theoretical coherence obtained by the least squares estimation method is much lower than that of the mean coherence in addition the theoretical model obtained by the proposed parameter estimation method has relatively larger values around the peak point and smaller values in the low and high frequency ranges than those of the mean coherence function and theoretical model obtained by the least squares estimation method noting that for the collected 50 wind and wave recorded data the peak frequency ω c p 1 490 rad s of the mean coherence function is similar to the peak frequency ω p 1 417 rad s of the mean wave spectrum one can find that the theoretical coherence model appropriately enlarges the interaction of the wind and wave processes in the frequency range in which most of energy in wave lies consequently in the random vibration analysis of marine structures energy in the wind and wave processes in this frequency range are all appropriately enlarged due to the positive coherence of the wind and wave processes from the structural safety point of view this is appropriate 3 3 theoretical model of the spectral density matrix since the coherence function defined by eq 6 is real according to eq 1 the theoretical two sided cross spectra of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes can be written as 9 s u t η t ω γ u t η t ω s u t ω s η t ω in which the auto psds s u t ω and s η t ω and coherence function γ u t η t ω are respectively defined by eq 3 eq 4 and eq 6 the theoretical spectral density matrix of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes can then be written as 10 s ω s u t ω s u t η t ω s u t η t ω s η t ω using the spectral representation algorithm for simulating the vector random processes geodatis 1996 the samples of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes defined by the spectral matrix eq 10 can be simulated which can be used to calculate the response samples of marine structures to the random wind and wave loads a simulated fluctuating wind velocity sample and a simulated wave height sample are respectively plotted in fig 11 and fig 12 as compared the simulated samples of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes without considering the interaction i e γ u t η t ω 0 are also plotted in figs 11 and 12 respectively note that in the simulation the lower and upper cutoff frequency are respectively ω l 0 02 rad s and ω u 3 0 rad s the equal frequency interval δ ω ω u ω l n ω 0 0015 rad s here n ω 2048 is the number of discrete frequency intervals and the discrete time step δ t 0 785 s the simulated fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes therefore have a period t 0 6 π δ ω 12954 3 s it can be seen in figs 11 and 12 that the maximum values of the simulated fluctuating wind velocity and wave height samples considering the interaction especially the latter are all larger than those of the simulated samples without considering the interaction in addition the frequency contents of the simulated fluctuating wind velocity and wave height samples considering the interaction are also changed compared with those of the simulated samples without considering the interaction hence the random vibration responses of the marine structures to the random wind and wave loads will be different for the cases that the interaction of the wind and wave is considered and not considered 4 summary and conclusions a total of 50 sets of the simultaneously measured wind and wave data during fetch experiment are collected to study the coherence of the random wind and wave processes in deep water based on the collected recorded data 50 sample auto psds and coherence functions of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes are calculated from which the mean auto psds and coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes as well as the mean significant wave height and spectral peak frequency period of the wave process are obtained according to the calculated mean auto psds kaimal spectrum and jonswap spectrum are chosen to be the theoretical models for modeling the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes respectively the specific forms of kaimal spectrum and jonswap spectrum modeling respectively the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes are established based on the parameters related to the wind and wave that are calculated from the collected recoded data during fetch experiment the calculated mean coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes is a unimodal function the peak frequency of the mean coherence approximately equals to the mean spectral peak frequency calculated from the sample auto psds of the wave height process this indicates that large coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes lies in the commonly occurring frequency range of the wave the maximum value of the mean coherence function is slightly less than 0 2 which shows that the coherence of the considered wind and wave cannot be ignored in practical applications based on the calculated mean coherence mechanism of the interaction of wind and wave and dimensional analysis a 5 parameter theoretical model is proposed in the present study for modeling coherence of fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes the model contains the variables of the mean wind velocity height above the mean surface level significant wave height and spectral peak period of wave it is therefore suitable to model coherences of general wind and wave processes in deep water the parameters of the proposed 5 parameter model can be identified from empirical coherences of wind and wave processes by using the least squares estimation method the 5 paramter model is further simplified to be a 3 parameter model through a parametric sensitivity analysis in the present study at the same time a simpler and more efficient method is proposed to estimate the parameters of the 3 parameter model through letting the peak point of the theoretical model coincides with that of the empirical coherence function using the 3 parameter model and proposed parameter estimate method the theoretical model is obtained to model the mean coherence function calculated from the collected 50 wind and wave records during fetch experiment the obtained theoretical model appropriately enlarges the coherence of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes in the frequency range in which most of energy in wave lies to provide slightly conservative random wind and wave loads from the theoretical models of auto psds and coherence the spectral matrix of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes of fetch experiment is obtained an example of the simulated samples of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes is given which shows that the maximum values of the simulated fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes samples become larger and moreover frequency contents of the simulated fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes samples also slightly change compared with those of the simulated samples of the fluctuating wind velocity and wave height processes without considering the coherence finally it should be pointed out that to make the theoretical coherence model proposed in the present study more extensive applicability more empirical coherences of random wind and wave processes should be calculated from the simultaneously
