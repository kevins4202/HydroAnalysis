sensing products used in this context topographic indices e g slope orientation rugosity derived from dems are widely used as surrogates for field measured environmental variables available global dems such as those from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm however do not provide information on bare earth elevation as they measure elevation of the highest objects above the ground e g canopy this affects the derived topographic indices and limits the use of global dems in ecological modelling unfortunately most ecological studies ignore this limitation despite the fact that methods to remove the vegetation offset have been developed we used high resolution lidar dtm to assess the accuracy of two newly available global bare earth dems where such methods were applied and to compare them with the srtm dem furthermore we assessed the effect of dems vertical error on species distribution models sdms by calculating slope and topographic wetness index twi from these different models and evaluating their suitability for sdms by adopting a virtual species approach we simulated virtual species based on slope and twi derived from accurate lidar dtm at three resolutions 30 m 90 m and 900 m and developed univariate generalized models to assess the performance of the bare earth and srtm dems our results show that the vertical error in both newly available vegetation corrected global dems is indeed successfully reduced the overall vertical root mean squared error rmse was 10 52 m for srtm while it was 6 80 m and 6 25 m for the two global bare earth dems the effect of the vertical error on sdms was most significant at finer spatial resolutions using srtm dem as opposed to a more accurate bare earth dem led to a decline in area under curve auc values from 0 94 to 0 77 sdms fitted with slope and twi derived from new global bare earth dtms performed slightly better than srtm since methods for vegetation offset removal in dems exist and corrected dems are freely

collected by c band radar during an 11 days mission in february 2000 farr et al 2007 the processed data were first released in june 2003 the srtm dem product was initially provided as srtm 3 with a resolution of 3 arc seconds approximately 90 m at the equator but the united states government recently released an updated version srtm 1 with a resolution of 1 arc second approximately 30 m at the equator and a near global coverage the raw data however contain voids areas for which no radar signal was returned which reduces its usability in modelling since its initial release the srtm 3 was post processed to fill data voids and is now available for free download which greatly encouraged its widespread use the srtm dem contains various errors the description of which is beyond the scope of this study more information can be found in rodriguez et al 2006 however an important but often misunderstood characteristic of the srtm dem is that it does not provide a bare earth elevation the measurements actually include a systematic positive bias due to the objects above the ground such as canopy the height of which is included into the model and this in turn produces considerable differences in accuracy between forested and open areas e g nelson et al 2009 it is caused by the inability of the c band radar signal to penetrate the vegetation canopy and to reach the bare ground most of the incoming signals are reflected by various scatterers in the upper part of the canopy e g leaves branches with the size similar to the relatively short wavelength of the c band 5 6 cm consequently the elevation values captured by the sensor are located somewhere between the ground and the top of the vegetation canopy depending on vegetation structure the theoretical vertical

acknowledging the vertical error and more particularly its vegetation offset component most studies use global dems as digital terrain models dtm if using the appropriate nomenclature the original srtm product and many of its subsequent alterations are actually digital surface models dsm they do not represent the bare ground elevation in vegetated areas and require further processing to remove vegetation heights in order to create a proper bare earth dtm methods for vegetation offset removal rely on maps of tree cover and vegetation height from independent sources such data however must have an appropriate resolution and match the environmental conditions at the time of dsm acquisition consequently most efforts to remove vegetation offset have been only applied locally gallant and read 2016 developed a method consisting of three steps first a map of tree presence absence yielding the best fit to the dem offset is created from available global data on vegetation cover e g www globallandcover com http earthenginepartners appspot com subsequently the offsets near the edges of vegetation patches and in areas of continuous vegetation cover are estimated finally the estimated offsets are subtracted from the dsm to produce bare earth dtm a similar method has been used by o loughlin et al 2016 to develop the first near global bare earth dtm based on srtm dem at 3 arc seconds

this study is to promote the valid and robust use of global dems in ecological modelling by raising awareness about the importance of using dems that are corrected for vegetation offset specific objectives are to 1 assess accuracy of srtm dem compared with newly available sgs ub and merit dtms with respect to land cover type forested and non forested areas 2 evaluate whether topographic indices derived from newly available bare earth dtms perform better in sdms than those derived from srtm dem and 3 assess the role of spatial resolution for dems vertical error propagation to sdms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and reference dtm our study area encompassed the czech part of krkonose mountains national park krnap located in central europe 15 25 15 50 e and 50 38 50 50 n krkonose is the highest mountain range in czechia and constitutes an area significant for biodiversity on the regional level the area is approximately 35 km in length with the main ridges and valleys arranged in a northwest to southeast direction the altitude range from 400 to 1600 m is covered mostly by grasslands pastures and spruce monocultures with remnants of original broad leaf and mixed mountain forests the tree line traverses the altitudinal range of 1200 1350 m for the purpose of the comparison a high quality dtm derived from small footprint airborne lidar data provided by krnap was used lidar data were collected in 2012 and comprise an area of 478 km2 with the average pulse density of 5 pulses per m2 we classified the point cloud into ground and non ground returns using lasground new with default setting for nature with following amendments a all returns were considered as possible ground and b intensified search for initial ground points was set to fine lastools 2017 we filtered the ground returns only and using blast2dem generated a dtm with a cell size of 1 m hereafter referred as lidar dtm the horizontal coordinate system of lidar dtm is datum of uniform trigonometric cadastral network s jtsk epsg 5514 and the vertical coordinate system is mean sea level msl baltic vertical datum after adjustment epsg 5705 the vertical datum of srtm dem sgs ub dtm and merit dtm is egm96 epsg 5171 which is a very close approximation of msl in czechia the differences should be below 1 m and all models can therefore be directly compared the data were horizontally referenced to wgs84 and projected to s jtsk using the bilinear resampling method to 30 m cell resolution for srtm dem and 90 m resolution for sgs ub dtm and merit dtm respectively there were no changes in the terrain height in the study area between the data acquisition for global dems and lidar data 2 2 dems validation the lidar dtm is considerably more accurate compared to other dems and can thus be used as the reference dataset true elevation to assess the accuracy of remaining dems we first calculated vertical differences between lidar dtm and remaining models srtm dem sgs ub dtm and merit dtm using pairwise combinations of all dems on cell by cell basis we used the differences to calculate root mean square error rmse and mean error me expressed as 1 r m s e 1 n i 1 n d e m i r e f i 2 2 m e 1 n i 1 n d e m i r e f i where dem i is the ith elevation from dem surface ref i is the corresponding true measured elevation and n is the number of elevation points cells sampled the rmse expresses the dispersion of the frequency distribution of deviations between the true elevation in this case represented by lidar dtm and the dem data the me tells us whether a set of measurements consistently overestimate positive value or underestimate negative value the true elevation to evaluate the success of sgs ub dtm and merit dtm in removing vegetation offset we additionally assessed rmse and me in forested and non forested areas the information on forested areas was obtained from the vector corine land cover database corine 3 1 1 3 1 2 3 1 3 for the year 2000 2 3 derived topographic indices we aggregated lidar dtm using focal statistics i e mean value at 30 m and 90 m resolutions and derived commonly employed direct and indirect variable the indirect variable we used was slope calculated according to zevenbergen and thorne 1987 slope i e rate of change of elevation affects the velocity of subsurface and surface flow and other surface processes gallant and wilson 2000 and it is therefore an important variable in predictive vegetation mapping e g zhang et al 2016 the direct variable was the topographic wetness index twi which is a surrogate for soil moisture raduła et al 2018 soil moisture is among the most important environmental variables affecting vegetation composition e g kopecký and čížková 2010 the twi is defined as twi ln as tan β where as is the specific catchment area and β is the local slope in radians beven and kirkby 1979 to calculate the specific catchment area we used the multiple flow routing algorithm of quinn et al 1991 recommended by kopecký and čížková 2010 slope and twi were derived from four different datasets i the lidar dtm used as a reference dataset in the simulation of virtual species ii srtm dem as a model burdened with vegetation offset iii the sgs ub dtm and iv the merit dtm as models that were corrected for vertical error caused by vegetation 2 4 virtual species generation in order to exemplify the effect of vertical error on sdms and to assess whether the recently introduced error free global merit dtm and sgs ub improve model performance we used the virtual species approach meynard and kaplan 2012 moudrý 2015 we used a simulated virtual species to ensure complete knowledge of species distribution in order to enable a proper assessment of model performance without confounding effects of real data e g moudrý et al 2017 we simulated relationships response function between species and an environmental variable i e slope and twi derived from lidar dem to generate environmental suitability the response to both variables was defined as the gaussian response function slope mean 15 and standard deviation 2 twi mean 8 and standard deviation 1 e g varela et al 2014 we adopted a probabilistic approach logistic function with alpha 0 15 and beta 0 65 to convert environmental suitability into probability of occurrence that is subsequently applied to randomly sampled presences and absences finally we simulated the sampling of 400 presences and 400 absences of the virtual species the use of relatively simple species environment relationships allows us to highlight the effects of vertical error on the performance of sdms all simulations were undertaken in r v 3 2 2 using the recently developed package virtualspecies leroy et al 2016 recommended by moudrý 2015 to simulate virtual species 2 5 model fitting and evaluation it is customary to fit gaussian response with a polynomial model we used generalized linear models glms with binomial error distribution and logit link function mccullagh and nelder 1989 oksanen and minchin 2002 the modelling was performed as univariate logistic regression the linear and quadratic term of slope and twi were included because of the known gaussian shape of the response function we modelled species distribution at 30 m 90 m and 900 m to evaluate the effect of spatial resolution to evaluate the models we split sampled presences absences into test 50 and training 50 datasets we run the entire process from species generation to model evaluation 100 times each repetition provided a different presence absence distribution leroy et al 2016 we evaluated model calibration by plotting the estimated environmental relationships and their discrimination capacity assessed by means of computing the area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic plot fielding and bell 1997 in addition we calculated rmse from differences between true i e virtual and predicted probability of occurrence all spatial analyses were performed in arcgis 10 4 1 and saga 2 1 4 conrad et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 dems and derived attributes accuracy among the dems studied only slight differences of the mean minimum and maximum values of elevation slope and twi were detected the values of mean elevation for both error corrected dtms were closer to the lidar dtm than those of the original srtm dem table 1 the overall rmse for the srtm dem was 10 52 with a mean bias of 7 62 m the vertical error of srtm dem significantly differed between forested and non forested areas as expected due to limits associated with the methods used for dem measurements and shown by numerous studies e g nelson et al 2009 in the forested areas the rmse was 13 25 and elevations were on average 11 60 m higher than the lidar dtm elevations in the non forested areas the rmse was 5 74 and the difference was 2 85 m table 2 the overall rmse for the sgs us dtm was 6 80 with a mean bias of 2 30 m in the forested areas the rmse was 6 94 and elevations on average 1 08 m lower than the lidar dem elevations this improvement was consistent with rmse of 6 m reported by o loughlin et al 2016 the vertical error has significantly improved in forested areas the terrain was however on average slightly underestimated as shown by our results table 2 fig 1 this is likely due to overestimation of tree heights o loughlin et al 2016o loughlin et al 2016 admitted that artefacts may exist at the boundaries between forested and non forested areas with the elevation in forested areas possibly being slightly lower than that of the adjacent non forested area this can be especially true in higher altitudes of our study area where tree heights can be significantly lower than those expected by the models in addition the results of sgs ub dtm got worse in non forested areas table 2 fig 1 with the rmse of 6 62 compare to rmse of 5 74 m for the srtm dem and the mean bias of 3 75 m the overall rmse for the merit dtm was 6 25 with mean bias of 3 09 m compared to srtm the vertical error has significantly improved in both forested and non forested areas table 2 fig 1 in the forested areas the rmse was 7 30 and elevations on average 4 58 m higher than the lidar dtm elevations in the non forested areas the rmse was 4 70 and the difference 1 30 m our results suggest a better accuracy of merit dtm over sgs ub dtm this is likely due to multiple error components considered i e speckle noise stripe noise absolute bias and tree height bias compared to study by o loughlin et al 2016 who only removed tree height bias to construct their sgs ub dtm furthermore the accuracy is highly dependent on the estimation of tree heights and size of individual forested areas sgs ub dtm accuracy decline in non forested areas is likely due to overestimation of the size of individual forested areas caused by limitations of adopted 250 m modis vegetation continuous field product dimiceli et al 2011 compared to yamazaki et al 2017 who adopted 30 m resolution data hansen et al 2013 3 2 sdm accuracy our results show considerable differences in rmse and auc values between models fitted with dem affected by vertical bias srtm dem and error free dtms models fitted with error free dtms sgs ub dtm and merit dtm performed better than srtm in most cases and never worse however the improvement in auc values was rather small and did not achieve the quality of models fitted with lidar dtm which was used for virtual species generation for instance the auc of the model fitted with topographic wetness index derived from merit dtm was 0 83 as opposed to 0 79 with srtm dem and 0 88 with the lidar derived reference dtm table 3 we also tested models with logistic response function obtaining the same results therefore we only present results for gaussian response however the effect of vertical bias on performance of individual models was more evident for models with gaussian response function than for simple logistic response this suggests that the effect of the vegetation offset can be much more significant for more complex response functions skewed unimodal responses often occurring in real ecological and biogeographical contexts oksanen and minchin 2002 dvorský et al 2017 it is also likely that using additional explanatory variables would increase differences in models performance when the multiple topographic indices and the elevation surface are combined for species distribution modelling applications the errors add up and can significantly impact the accuracy of the modelling van niel and austin 2007 the ability to model species environment relationships and to discriminate between presences and absences was also strongly affected by spatial resolution in ecological studies species distribution data are often available at a coarser resolution than data on elevation and topographic indices the latter are thus often aggregated resampled to match the coarser spatial resolution of the species data e g alba sánchez et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 kosicki 2017 it is well known that when dems contain vertical errors the accuracy of derived topographic indices increases with lower resolution e g zhou and liu 2004 in accordance with this shifts in the modelled response functions and differences in auc values table 3 were almost negligible at 900 m resolution however models based on srtm dem at 30 m resolution significantly underestimated the highest probability of occurrence and overestimated low probability of occurrence fig 2 this caused the highest drop in auc values decreasing from 0 94 and 0 90 for slope and twi respectively reference lidar dtm to 0 77 srtm dem as expected the differences in twi values are the highest at forest boundaries where the srtm dem records false increases in elevation and the areas of highest twi values are therefore shifted compared to values derived from lidar dtm fig 3 it is therefore likely that such vertical error in dems may also be the reason why some multi scale studies reported better models at intermediate scales than at the highest resolution available for example zhang et al 2016 assessed performance of topographic indices derived from aster gdem which suffer from vegetation offset error at five resolutions from 30 m to 900 m and reported the best models for abies faxoniana and quercus aquifolioides to be at 120 m and 240 m in contrast mohamedou et al 2017 tested the effect of lidar derived i e free of vertical bias dtm resolution on twi ability to predict tree growth they adopted resolutions ranging from 1 m to 30 m and found the best models to be derived at 1 m and 15 m resolutions respectively although different species may respond to environment at different resolutions e g lecours et al 2015 it supports our hypothesis that vertical bias in dems can prevent from getting the best models in higher resolutions according to zhang et al 2016 it is possible to use solely dems to predict vegetation distribution in combination with the recent availability of global dems at higher spatial resolution e g 12 m tandem x dem this can provide better grounds for conservation and management actions however vertical accuracy bias can become even more problematic and using models burdened with it albeit having good spatial resolution may provide misleading results and must be carefully interpreted to avoid the risk of making incorrect decisions sdms are increasingly generated using high resolution data moudrý and šímová 2012 lecours et al 2015 particularly dems pradervand et al 2014 matawa et al 2016 nezer et al 2017 bazzichetto et al 2018 it is therefore necessary to take into consideration the vertical accuracy of dems before including them and their derived topographic indices in the modelling process failure to do so can lead to misinterpretation of species environment relationships and misidentification of areas important for species conservation local high accuracy dtms should be used when available for example such models are available through governmental agencies in europe e g fogl and moudrý 2016 where not available the recently released global dtms with reduced vertical error represent an adequate substitute while our study area and the environmental conditions studied were limited in scope and extent our results are in line with those of other studies that have achieved satisfactory global accuracy assessments for instance o loughlin et al 2016 showed that improvement in dtm accuracy was consistent over all types of forest vegetation evergreen forest deciduous forest etc in addition yamazaki et al 2017 showed that the most significant improvement was in flat forested areas and that most residual errors were found in mountainous areas due to large subpixel topographic variability while studies looking at the accuracy of newly created global dtms will be required to validate our conclusions in other study areas our results show that correcting for vertical bias in mountainous area significantly improved the dtms vertical accuracy and consequently the performance of sdms based on those results we recommend the adoption of the merit dtm in any area where forests are present 4 conclusions we have shown that recently available vertical error corrected merit dtm at 90 m has a better accuracy in our study area than srtm dem furthermore models developed with merit dtm performed slightly better than uncorrected srtm dem thus being a more reliable alternative to dems affected by a vertical error however the improvement is lower than expected particularly due to limitations associated with estimates of tree heights and size of individual forested areas elimination or at least reduction of error components e g vegetation offset for dems available at better resolutions e g tandem x should be a priority for further enhancement of ecological modelling finally users must be aware that substantial vertical bias can still be present

for international agriculture research consortium for spatial information cgiar csi http www cgiar csi org data e g moudrý and šímová 2013 reino et al 2013 šímová et al 2015 kosicki 2017 by not acknowledging the vertical error and more particularly its vegetation offset component most studies use global dems as digital terrain models dtm if using the appropriate nomenclature the original srtm product and many of its subsequent alterations are actually digital surface models dsm they do not represent the bare ground elevation in vegetated areas and require further processing to remove vegetation heights in order to create a proper bare earth dtm methods for vegetation offset removal rely on maps of tree cover and vegetation height from independent sources such data however must have an appropriate resolution and match the environmental conditions at the time of dsm acquisition consequently most efforts to remove vegetation offset have been only applied locally gallant and read 2016 developed a method consisting of three steps first a map of tree presence absence yielding the best fit to the dem offset is created from available global data on vegetation cover e g www globallandcover com http earthenginepartners appspot com subsequently the offsets near the edges of vegetation patches and in areas of continuous vegetation cover are estimated finally the estimated offsets are subtracted from the dsm to produce bare earth dtm a similar method has been used by o loughlin et al 2016 to develop the first near global bare earth dtm based on srtm dem at 3 arc seconds resolution this dtm hereafter referred to as the sgs ub dtm was made freely available for non commercial use by the school of geographical sciences at university of bristol united kingdom http data bris ac uk data more recently yamazaki et al 2017 developed merit dtm a high accuracy global dtm at 3 arc seconds resolution produced by eliminating multiple error components including vegetation offset merit dtm was also made freely available for non commercial use by the japan agency for marine earth science and technology http hydro iis u tokyo ac jp yamadai merit dem the general aim of this study is to promote the valid and robust use of global dems in ecological modelling by raising awareness about the importance of using dems that are corrected for vegetation offset specific objectives are to 1 assess accuracy of srtm dem compared with newly available sgs ub and merit dtms with respect to land cover type forested and non forested areas 2 evaluate whether topographic indices derived from newly available bare earth dtms perform better in sdms than those derived from srtm dem and 3 assess the role of spatial resolution for dems vertical error propagation to sdms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and reference dtm our study area encompassed the czech part of krkonose mountains national park krnap located in central europe 15 25 15 50 e and 50 38 50 50 n krkonose is the highest mountain range in czechia and constitutes an area significant for biodiversity on the regional level the area is approximately 35 km in length with the main ridges and valleys arranged in a northwest to southeast direction the altitude range from 400 to 1600 m is covered mostly by grasslands pastures and spruce monocultures with remnants of original broad leaf and mixed mountain forests the tree line traverses the altitudinal range of 1200 1350 m for the purpose of the comparison a high quality dtm derived from small footprint airborne lidar data provided by krnap was used lidar data were collected in 2012 and comprise an area of 478 km2 with the average pulse density of 5 pulses per m2 we classified the point cloud into ground and non ground returns using lasground new with default setting for nature with following amendments a all returns were considered as possible ground and b intensified search for initial ground points was set to fine lastools 2017 we filtered the ground returns only and using blast2dem generated a dtm with a cell size of 1 m hereafter referred as lidar dtm the horizontal coordinate system of lidar dtm is datum of uniform trigonometric cadastral network s jtsk epsg 5514 and the vertical coordinate system is mean sea level msl baltic vertical datum after adjustment epsg 5705 the vertical datum of srtm dem sgs ub dtm and merit dtm is egm96 epsg 5171 which is a very close approximation of msl in czechia the differences should be below 1 m and all models can therefore be directly compared the data were horizontally referenced to wgs84 and projected to s jtsk using the bilinear resampling method to 30 m cell resolution for srtm dem and 90 m resolution for sgs ub dtm and merit dtm respectively there were no changes in the terrain height in the study area between the data acquisition for global dems and lidar data 2 2 dems validation the lidar dtm is considerably more accurate compared to other dems and can thus be used as the reference dataset true elevation to assess the accuracy of remaining dems we first calculated vertical differences between lidar dtm and remaining models srtm dem sgs ub dtm and merit dtm using pairwise combinations of all dems on cell by cell basis we used the differences to calculate root mean square error rmse and mean error me expressed as 1 r m s e 1 n i 1 n d e m i r e f i 2 2 m e 1 n i 1 n d e m i r e f i where dem i is the ith elevation from dem surface ref i is the corresponding true measured elevation and n is the number of elevation points cells sampled the rmse expresses the dispersion of the frequency distribution of deviations between the true elevation in this case represented by lidar dtm and the dem data the me tells us whether a set of measurements consistently overestimate positive value or underestimate negative value the true elevation to evaluate the success of sgs ub dtm and merit dtm in removing vegetation offset we additionally assessed rmse and me in forested and non forested areas the information on forested areas was obtained from the vector corine land cover database corine 3 1 1 3 1 2 3 1 3 for the year 2000 2 3 derived topographic indices we aggregated lidar dtm using focal statistics i e mean value at 30 m and 90 m resolutions and derived commonly employed direct and indirect variable the indirect variable we used was slope calculated according to zevenbergen and thorne 1987 slope i e rate of change of elevation affects the velocity of subsurface and surface flow and other surface processes gallant and wilson 2000 and it is therefore an important variable in predictive vegetation mapping e g zhang et al 2016 the direct variable was the topographic wetness index twi which is a surrogate for soil moisture raduła et al 2018 soil moisture is among the most important environmental variables affecting vegetation composition e g kopecký and čížková 2010 the twi is defined as twi ln as tan β where as is the specific catchment area and β is the local slope in radians beven and kirkby 1979 to calculate the specific catchment area we used the multiple flow routing algorithm of quinn et al 1991 recommended by kopecký and čížková 2010 slope and twi were derived from four different datasets i the lidar dtm used as a reference dataset in the simulation of virtual species ii srtm dem as a model burdened with vegetation offset iii the sgs ub dtm and iv the merit dtm as models that were corrected for vertical error caused by vegetation 2 4 virtual species generation in order to exemplify the effect of vertical error on sdms and to assess whether the recently introduced error free global merit dtm and sgs ub improve model performance we used the virtual species approach meynard and kaplan 2012 moudrý 2015 we used a simulated virtual species to ensure complete knowledge of species distribution in order to enable a proper assessment of model performance without confounding effects of real data e g moudrý et al 2017 we simulated relationships response function between species and an environmental variable i e slope and twi derived from lidar dem to generate environmental suitability the response to both variables was defined as the gaussian response function slope mean 15 and standard deviation 2 twi mean 8 and standard deviation 1 e g varela et al 2014 we adopted a probabilistic approach logistic function with alpha 0 15 and beta 0 65 to convert environmental suitability into probability of occurrence that is subsequently applied to randomly sampled presences and absences finally we simulated the sampling of 400 presences and 400 absences of the virtual species the use of relatively simple species environment relationships allows us to highlight the effects of vertical error on the performance of sdms all simulations were undertaken in r v 3 2 2 using the recently developed package virtualspecies leroy et al 2016 recommended by moudrý 2015 to simulate virtual species 2 5 model fitting and evaluation it is customary to fit gaussian response with a polynomial model we used generalized linear models glms with binomial error distribution and logit link function mccullagh and nelder 1989 oksanen and minchin 2002 the modelling was performed as univariate logistic regression the linear and quadratic term of slope and twi were included because of the known gaussian shape of the response function we modelled species distribution at 30 m 90 m and 900 m to evaluate the effect of spatial resolution to evaluate the models we split sampled presences absences into test 50 and training 50 datasets we run the entire process from species generation to model evaluation 100 times each repetition provided a different presence absence distribution leroy et al 2016 we evaluated model calibration by plotting the estimated environmental relationships and their discrimination capacity assessed by means of computing the area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic plot fielding and bell 1997 in addition we calculated rmse from differences between true i e virtual and predicted probability of occurrence all spatial analyses were performed in arcgis 10 4 1 and saga 2 1 4 conrad et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 dems and derived attributes accuracy among the dems studied only slight differences of the mean minimum and maximum values of elevation slope and twi were detected the values of mean elevation for both error corrected dtms were closer to the lidar dtm than those of the original srtm dem table 1 the overall rmse for the srtm dem was 10 52 with a mean bias of 7 62 m the vertical error of srtm dem significantly differed between forested and non forested areas as expected due to limits associated with the methods used for dem measurements and shown by numerous studies e g nelson et al 2009 in the forested areas the rmse was 13 25 and elevations were on average 11 60 m higher than the lidar dtm elevations in the non forested areas the rmse was 5 74 and the difference was 2 85 m table 2 the overall rmse for the sgs us dtm was 6 80 with a mean bias of 2 30 m in the forested areas the rmse was 6 94 and elevations on average 1 08 m lower than the lidar dem elevations this improvement was consistent with rmse of 6 m reported by o loughlin et al 2016 the vertical error has significantly improved in forested areas the terrain was however on average slightly underestimated as shown by our results table 2 fig 1 this is likely due to overestimation of tree heights o loughlin et al 2016o loughlin et al 2016 admitted that artefacts may exist at the boundaries between forested and non forested areas with the elevation in forested areas possibly being slightly lower than that of the adjacent non forested area this can be especially true in higher altitudes of our study area where tree heights can be significantly lower than those expected by the models in addition the results of sgs ub dtm got worse in non forested areas table 2 fig 1 with the rmse of 6 62 compare to rmse of 5 74 m for the srtm dem and the mean bias of 3 75 m the overall rmse for the merit dtm was 6 25 with mean bias of 3 09 m compared to srtm the vertical error has significantly improved in both forested and non forested areas table 2 fig 1 in the forested areas the rmse was 7 30 and elevations on average 4 58 m higher than the lidar dtm elevations in the non forested areas the rmse was 4 70 and the difference 1 30 m our results suggest a better accuracy of merit dtm over sgs ub dtm this is likely due to multiple error components considered i e speckle noise stripe noise absolute bias and tree height bias compared to study by o loughlin et al 2016 who only removed tree height bias to construct their sgs ub dtm furthermore the accuracy is highly dependent on the estimation of tree heights and size of individual forested areas sgs ub dtm accuracy decline in non forested areas is likely due to overestimation of the size of individual forested areas caused by limitations of adopted 250 m modis vegetation continuous field product dimiceli et al 2011 compared to yamazaki et al 2017 who adopted 30 m resolution data hansen et al 2013 3 2 sdm accuracy our results show considerable differences in rmse and auc values between models fitted with dem affected by vertical bias srtm dem and error free dtms models fitted with error free dtms sgs ub dtm and merit dtm performed better than srtm in most cases and never worse however the improvement in auc values was rather small and did not achieve the quality of models fitted with lidar dtm which was used for virtual species generation for instance the auc of the model fitted with topographic wetness index derived from merit dtm was 0 83 as opposed to 0 79 with srtm dem and 0 88 with the lidar derived reference dtm table 3 we also tested models with logistic response function obtaining the same results therefore we only present results for gaussian response however the effect of vertical bias on performance of individual models was more evident for models with gaussian response function than for simple logistic response this suggests that the effect of the vegetation offset can be much more significant for more complex response functions skewed unimodal responses often occurring in real ecological and biogeographical contexts oksanen and minchin 2002 dvorský et al 2017 it is also likely that using additional explanatory variables would increase differences in models performance when the multiple topographic indices and the elevation surface are combined for species distribution modelling applications the errors add up and can significantly impact the accuracy of the modelling van niel and austin 2007 the ability to model species environment relationships and to discriminate between presences and absences was also strongly affected by spatial resolution in ecological studies species distribution data are often available at a coarser resolution than data on elevation and topographic indices the latter are thus often aggregated resampled to match the coarser spatial resolution of the species data e g alba sánchez et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 kosicki 2017 it is well known that when dems contain vertical errors the accuracy of derived topographic indices increases with lower resolution e g zhou and liu 2004 in accordance with this shifts in the modelled response functions and differences in auc values table 3 were almost negligible at 900 m resolution however models based on srtm dem at 30 m resolution significantly underestimated the highest probability of occurrence and overestimated low probability of occurrence fig 2 this caused the highest drop in auc values decreasing from 0 94 and 0 90 for slope and twi respectively reference lidar dtm to 0 77 srtm dem as expected the differences in twi values are the highest at forest boundaries where the srtm dem records false increases in elevation and the areas of highest twi values are therefore shifted compared to values derived from lidar dtm fig 3 it is therefore likely that such vertical error in dems may also be the reason why some multi scale studies reported better models at intermediate scales than at the highest resolution available for example zhang et al 2016 assessed performance of topographic indices derived from aster gdem which suffer from vegetation offset error at five resolutions from 30 m to 900 m and reported the best models for abies faxoniana and quercus aquifolioides to be at 120 m and 240 m in contrast mohamedou et al 2017 tested the effect of lidar derived i e free of vertical bias dtm resolution on twi ability to predict tree growth they adopted resolutions ranging from 1 m to 30 m and found the best models to be derived at 1 m and 15 m resolutions respectively although different species may respond to environment at different resolutions e g lecours et al 2015 it supports our hypothesis that vertical bias in dems can prevent from getting the best models in higher resolutions according to zhang et al 2016 it is possible to use solely dems to predict vegetation distribution in combination with the recent availability of global dems at higher spatial resolution e g 12 m tandem x dem this can provide better grounds for conservation and management actions however vertical accuracy bias can become even more problematic and using models burdened with it albeit having good spatial resolution may provide misleading results and must be carefully interpreted to avoid the risk of making incorrect decisions sdms are increasingly generated using high resolution data moudrý and šímová 2012 lecours et al 2015 particularly dems pradervand et al 2014 matawa et al 2016 nezer et al 2017 bazzichetto et al 2018 it is therefore necessary to take into consideration the vertical accuracy of dems before including them and their derived topographic indices in the modelling process failure to do so can lead to misinterpretation of species environment relationships and misidentification of areas important for species conservation local high accuracy dtms should be used when available for example such models are available through governmental agencies in europe e g fogl and moudrý 2016 where not available the recently released global dtms with reduced vertical error represent an adequate substitute while our study area and the environmental conditions studied were limited in scope and extent our results are in line with those of other studies that have achieved satisfactory global accuracy assessments for instance o loughlin et al 2016 showed that improvement in dtm accuracy was consistent over all types of forest vegetation evergreen forest deciduous forest etc in addition yamazaki et al 2017 showed that the most significant improvement was in flat forested areas and that most residual errors were found in mountainous areas due to large subpixel topographic variability while studies looking at the accuracy of newly created global dtms will be required to validate our conclusions in other study areas our results show that correcting for vertical bias in mountainous area significantly improved the dtms vertical accuracy and consequently the performance of sdms based on those results we recommend the adoption of the merit dtm in any area where forests are present 4 conclusions we have shown that recently available vertical error corrected merit dtm at 90 m has a better accuracy in our study area than srtm dem furthermore models developed with merit dtm performed slightly better than uncorrected srtm dem thus being a more reliable alternative to dems affected by a vertical error however the improvement is lower than expected particularly due to limitations associated with estimates of tree heights and size of individual forested areas elimination or at least reduction of error components e g vegetation offset for dems available at better resolutions e g tandem x should be a priority for further enhancement of ecological modelling finally users must be aware that substantial vertical bias can still be present

25261,soil respiration causes the second largest c flux between ecosystems and the atmosphere emerging soil carbon dynamics models consider the complex interplay of microscale interactions between the physical and biological drivers of soil organic matter decomposition occurring in the 3d soil architecture they are expected to provide a way to upscale results to the macroscopic level and as such appear as an alternative modelling approach to the traditional black box macroscopic models however these models still need to be tested under a broader range of their parameters values and structures than has been the case to date we thus conducted uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of previous predictions on dissolved organic carbon biodegradation obtained by one of these microscopic carbon dynamics models lbios six parameters of the carbon dynamics module of lbios associated with bacterial metabolism and three microscopic 3d descriptors of soil architecture were considered as uncertain inputs we built two complete factorial designs in which the minimum and maximum of uncertainty intervals are considered each factorial design is assigned to a particular structure of the model one including dormancy of bacteria and the other considering optimal bacterial activity the scenarios took place in 3d computed tomography images of an undisturbed cultivated soil the sensitivity indices at different simulations dates were computed with an anova procedure taking into account main effects and interactions among factors the uncertainty analysis shows that only in the limiting case of low accessibility of resources to bacteria the different microbial metabolisms tested can modify to a small extent the system responses and uncertainty linked to parameters describing soil architecture becomes preponderant in the case of optimal accessibility output variability is due predominantly to uncertainty of the microbial metabolism parameters the sensitivity analysis suggests that whatever the structure of the model the role of soil architecture in the microbial activity can be evidenced using either doc or co2 as proxy measures beyond these results we stress that results of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of soil carbon models need to be interpreted with caution dependent as they are on the status of the model itself as well as on the particular scenarios used in the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses keywords lattice boltzmann model sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis soil architecture carbon bacteria 1 introduction with globally 68 to 120 pg c year 1 soil respiration represents the second largest c flux between ecosystems and the atmosphere among the hundreds of computer models that describe the dynamics of soil carbon under a range of soil and environmental conditions manzoni and porporato 2009 many adhere to a traditional macroscopic perspective in which the soil organic matter is divided into a number of connected pools but no detail is included on the spatial distribution of organic matter in the pore space nor on the biodiversity and activity of the biomass in contrast to this traditional approach a number of researchers have attempted to describe in detail the complex interplay of microscale processes that determine the fate of organic matter monga et al 2008 falconer et al 2012 ebrahimi and or 2015 vogel et al 2015 the anticipation being that if a proper description of these processes can be achieved and one can find a way to upscale the result to the macroscopic scale the description of emergent processes will be far better than what traditional black box models produce even though measurements techniques able to provide quantitative data on microscopic parameters of soils have experienced tremendous technological advances in the recent decade many of the microscopic processes these models involve are still little more than assumptions at this point kovarova kovar and egli 1998 gignoux et al 2001 or their descriptions are gross simplification of what we suspect is really occurring nevertheless even under these conditions as various authors have argued gras et al 2010 2011 folse and allison 2012 manzoni et al 2014 microscale models of soil processes can be very useful guides for further research as long as they are supplemented by thorough uncertainty and sensitivity analyses uncertainty analysis aims at characterizing the distribution of global output variables resulting from the probability distribution of several uncertain input factors saltelli et al 2009 wallach et al 2013 the purpose of sensitivity analysis is to evaluate the extent to which each model parameter is responsible for the observed outcome uncertainty saltelli et al 2009 whereas the latter analysis has been often used solely to identify the sensitive parameters of a given model in order to point out the ones whose measurement or independent estimation should deserve particular attention e g neff and asner 2001 cazelles et al 2013 pagel et al 2014 dwivedi et al 2017 uncertainty analysis has seldom been used in the context of soil carbon dynamic modelling only a few articles have carried out both types of analyses boulange et al 2012 wang et al 2013 2005 xenakis et al 2008 among the recent articles that have combined the development of a microscale computer model with a detailed sensitivity analysis of it vogel et al 2015 try to assess the role of meso and macropore topology on the biodegradation of a soluble carbon substrate in a soil under variably water saturated and pure diffusion conditions in order to do this they describe a 3d pore scale model lbios that couples a diffusion lattice boltzmann model and a compartmental biodegradation model with lbios they simulate a number of hypothetical scenarios in which four factors are systematically varied meso and macropore space geometry water saturation bacterial distribution and physiology a global sensitivity analysis of these factors highlights the influence of physical factors related to soil architecture on biodegradation kinetics the location of bacterial cells explains 28 of the total variance in substrate concentration in all scenarios while the interactions among location saturation and geometry explain up to 51 of it however this result is obtained by using only one set of parameters describing microbial metabolism and no uncertainty analysis is carried out in this context the purpose of the research described in the present article is to assess the robustness of observations made by vogel et al 2015 by reproducing the same scenarios but using several sets of parameters describing the microbial metabolism our hypothesis is that the strong influence of physical factors related to soil architecture on biodegradation kinetics found by vogel et al 2015 in their scenarios may be counterbalanced by the influence of biological factors related to microbial metabolism with more complete uncertainty and sensitivity analyses a different picture may emerge of what the key parameters of the model are and it may suggest to direct our attention to other types of macroscopic measurements than those suggested by vogel et al 2015 to test their model 2 material and methods 2 1 3d images of soil micro environments samples of a cultivated soil a silty loamy 19 clay 75 silt 6 sand albeluvisol were obtained by vogel et al 2015 and 3d images of the samples were obtained using an x ray ct scanner at the simbios center dundee the voxel resolution of the images is 68 μm and the image size is 6003 voxels the rather low resolution of the ct images did not permit to visualise the vast majority of the fine particles clay and silt of the soil and therefore neither the smaller sized pores that are associated with these particles therefore only the meso and macropores were considered in this study according to classification of luxmoore 1981 as discussed in vogel et al 2015 this resolution was chosen because it could reproduce the millimeter scale variability of microbial activity found for instance by vieublé gonod et al 2003 we selected 2 sub images g4 and g6 of 1003 voxels out of the dataset of vogel et al 2015 for their contrasted values of three indicators of the pore space topology these indicators are the euler poincaré characteristic epc the geometrical tortuosity τ g and the specific surface area ssa epc is a measure of the number of non redundant closed loop paths in the pore space τ g is the ratio of the geodesic distance over the euclidian distance between two distant points in the pore space and ssa is the liquid solid interface area per unit mass see vogel et al 2015 for more details about their calculations table 1 gives the values of these indicators for the two sub images g4 and g6 the sub image g4 has a geometrical tortuosity close to one indicating straight pathways from the top plane to the bottom plane a specific surface area of about twice that of a sphere of identical pore volume and epc has a value close to zero indicating a poorly connected pore network with a low variation in the geometry of the pores its pore space is thus considered as topologically homogeneous the sub image g6 has a high geometrical tortuosity indicating longer and more tortuous pathways from the top plane to the bottom plane a specific surface area of about three times that of a sphere of identical pore volume and its epc has a highly negative value indicating a continuous well connected pore space its pore space is thus considered as topologically complex these images correspond to a volume size of about 314 mm3 and their total macroporosity values are 11 25 and 18 82 for g4 and g6 respectively table 1 vogel et al 2015 calculated the 3d water and air distribution for different water saturation indexes s w the proportion of liquid phase on pore phase in each sub images using the model of genty and pot 2013 we selected two water and air distributions at the extreme values of the water saturation index s w 0 25 and s w 1 00 fig 1 we used the incubation experiments reported in monga et al 2014 of a single bacteria strain with fructose as sole source of carbon in sand microcosm to define initial substrate and bacteria concentrations in the sub images doc 0 0 62 mgccm 3 and b 0 1 31 10 6 mgccm 3 the boundary diffusion conditions were fixed to zero flow to mimick the pure diffusion conditions of the incubation experiments in the simulations fructose is applied as a pulse on the top horizontal plane of the images ten spots representing micro colonies of the bacteria strain are placed in ten voxels containing water in vogel et al 2015 three types of distribution are tested the ten selected voxels are close to the initial fructose source the top localisation i e the ten spots are localised within the 30 first horizontal planes corresponding to an average euclidian distance of 1 mm from the initial fructose top horizontal plane they are far from it the bottom localisation i e the ten spots are localised within the 30 last horizontal planes corresponding to a minimal euclidian distance of 4 7 mm from the initial fructose top horizontal plane or they are regularly spaced the distributed localisation see vogel et al 2015 we selected the most contrasted localisations top and bottom we thus constituted a dataset of 8 images of contrasted soil micro environments being the two ct images g4 and g6 at two water saturation indexes s w 0 25 and s w 1 00 for each of these four images presented in fig 1 we used two contrasted localisations of the bacterial spots either in the top 30 horizontal planes named in the rest of the text g4sw100top g4sw25top g6sw100top and g6sw25top or in the last 30 horizontal planes named g4sw100bottom g4sw25bottom g6sw100bottom and g6sw25bottom 2 2 carbon dynamics module of lbios the model lbios a 3d pore scale model designed to simulate carbon dynamics in a discrete spatial representation of soil pore space at the scale of soil microhabitats is described in detail in vogel et al 2015 lbios comprises two coupled modules a stock flow module predicting the dynamics of microbial transformations of carbon compounds and a lattice boltzmann module describing the diffusion of soluble carbon compounds in the liquid phase of soil pore space the diffusion module is not the focus of the present article and will not be discussed further except to mention that since the publication of vogel et al 2015 a paralleled version of the code ported on openmp has been developed and was used in the research described here to make this article reasonably self contained a succinct account of the carbon dynamics module of lbios its equations and their underlying principles is provided in the following in this module soil carbon is partitioned dynamically into several pools characterised by different biochemical compositions fig 2 four pools are considered bacterial biomass b dissolved organic carbon doc humified organic carbon hoc and carbon dioxide co 2 these pools evolve over time as a result of processes inducing stock flows uptake respiration mortality and biomass recycling which are described mathematically through the following equations 1 db dt μ max doc k s doc k r k m rb 2 ddoc dt μ max doc k s doc 1 p m k m rb 3 dco 2 dt k r rb 4 dhoc dt p m k m rb where μ max is the maximal specific rate of microbial growth t 1 k s is the so called half rate constant for microbial growth m l 3 k r and k m are first order rate constants t 1 accounting for respiration and mortality respectively r is the fraction of active bacteria in the range 0 to 1 p m is the fraction also between 0 and 1 of dead bacteria cells that become hoc whereas the rest 1 p m is recycled into the doc pool these equations encompass a number of assumptions the model involves bacteria only whose growth is described in eqs 1 and 2 according to monod s equation respiration and mortality are first order functions of the bacterial biomass b lbios consequently does not distinguish between growth respiration traditionally calculated as a function of substrate during uptake and maintenance respiration proportional to b wang and post 2012 the mortality products are split into a soluble part flowing eventually integrating the doc pool biomass recycling and an insoluble part accounting for soil organic matter neosynthesis or humification garnier et al 2008 into the hoc pool given the short timeframe of the simulations seven days hydrolysis of hoc into doc is not considered the division of the biomass into an active function quantified by r and a dormant portion equal to 1 r times the total biomass following wang et al 2014 is a special feature of lbios naturally r changes with environmental conditions its evolution over time is regulated by the substrate concentration doc following blagodatsky and richter 1998 5 dr dt μ max doc k s doc doc k i doc r where k i is a so called physiological state inhibition constant m l 3 r is applied to all bacterial fluxes eqs 1 4 as a multiplier hence any slow down of metabolism provoked by suboptimal resource availability is related to substrate deficiency the introduction of dormant bacteria can drastically modify the output variables b and co 2 which are directly related to the microbial metabolism as calculated by lbios vogel et al 2015 therefore we conducted the statistical analysis on two versions of lbios with and without dormancy in the simulations the mass of carbon of the doc pool is calculated in each fluid voxel of the 3d images the global value of doc at the scale of the soil sample is thus calculated as the sum of all carbon masses of doc in the fluid voxels in the same way the global output variables b co 2 and hoc are calculated as the sum of masses of carbon of the respective pools on the ten bacterial spots finally the global output variable r is calculated as the mean proportion of active bacteria over the ten bacterial spots in the simulations the initial mass of carbon of the hoc and co 2 pools is considered equal to zero in the version of lbios with dormancy the initial value of r is fixed to 10 according to ingwersen et al 2008 2 3 complete factorial designs the sensitivity analysis of a model is similar to an experiment where nature is being replaced by the simulated model it follows that the classical theory of experimental design provides very useful tools for sensitivity analysis wallach et al 2013 many different methods have been developed for global sensitivity analysis and those involving factorial designs represent one possible approach based on variance decomposition campolongo and saltelli 2000 this approach is able to capture the interactions among factors and to decompose the total variance of the model outputs into several terms representing main effects and total effects including interactions of the considered model inputs this method has already been applied in previous studies to complex models ginot et al 2006 lamboni et al 2009 2011 although other sampling techniques can be implemented we used the factorial design approach to express the total variance of the model outputs as a sum of the contributions of the different inputs campolongo and saltelli 2000 more details on this approach can be found in saltelli et al 2000 all six parameters of the carbon dynamics module of lbios were considered as uncertain inputs μ max k s k r k m p m k i if f m denotes the number of these parameters describing the microbial metabolism f m 6 for the version of lbios with dormancy and the parameters are μ max k s k r k m p m and k i whereas f m 5 for the version of lbios without dormancy and the parameters are μ max k s k r k m and p m analyses of the variability associated with these parameters require adopting specific theoretical ranges for them unfortunately the relevant literature is unevenly informative about the variability of these parameters whereas we have been able to locate only a few values for k r and k i plenty of values are provided for μ max and k s available values for k r and k i typically result from the fitting of soil carbon dynamics models to data from soil incubations with composite microbiota and carbon sources whereas values for μ max and k s sometimes also originate from incubations in liquid cultures another difficulty is linked to the non uniform formalism of the som models used to describe the stock flows between the different carbon pools we thus chose the interval range of those parameters based on only two studies data for μ max k s k r k m p m k i are obtained from monga et al 2014 who use a carbon dynamics module similar to the one incorporated in lbios the article by ingwersen et al 2008 who use the same physiological index r as lbios provided the uncertainty level of k i table 2 however we were not able to define precise probability distributions for the uncertain model inputs with such scarce information on the parameter values instead of defining arbitrary distributions we chose to rely only on the lower and upper bounds of the values found in the papers of monga et al 2014 and ingwersen et al 2008 we then generated all possible combinations of the parameter bounds using a complete factorial design as in wallach et al 2013 in addition three more microscopic descriptors associated with soil architecture were considered as uncertain input factors table 2 the soil pore space topology g the water saturation index of the soil pore space s w and the localisation of spots where bacterial cells are in the soil pore space l relative to the initial position of doc let us define f s the number of these microscopic parameters with f s 3 as we showed in section 2 1 the complexity of the pore space topology cannot be described by a single quantitative indicator the objective of the present work is to assess the robustness of previous predictions of vogel et al 2015 when using different values of the parameters describing the microbial metabolism and not to find quantitative relations linking the bacterial activity with the topology we thus used a qualitative factor g to describe the degree of complexity of the topology in the same way defining a single quantitative indicator of the distance between the ten bacterial spots to doc remains a difficult task which is beyond the objective of the present paper although the distances between the spots and the initial doc pulse can be quantified through their geodesic pathways for instance these distances will change throughout the simulation as doc diffuses in the liquid phase we thus used a qualitative factor l to describe the initial accessibility of resources to the bacterial spots in the same way as for the parameters of the carbon dynamics module we selected their minimal and maximal values as reported in section 2 2 the minimal and maximal values of s w are 0 25 and 1 00 for the qualitative factor g the minimal level is the most homogeneous pore space g4 and the maximal level is the most complex pore space g6 for the qualitative factor l the minimal level corresponds to the best initial accessibility of resources to the bacterial spots the top distribution and the maximal level corresponds to the worse initial accessibility of resources to the bacterial spots the bottom distribution the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed according to complete 2 f m f s factorial designs in which for each input factor the minimum and the maximum of the corresponding uncertainty interval were systematically considered for the version of lbios without dormancy a complete 28 factorial design 256 simulations was constructed using the fac design function of the r software doe base library whereas a complete 29 factorial design 512 simulations was used for the version of lbios with dormancy all simulations computed the degradation of doc on a seven day timespan in the 3d computed tomography images described earlier 2 4 global sensitivity analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed on each one of the global output variables doc b co 2 hoc and r using the aov function of the software r the total variance s t of the simulated outputs is decomposed as the sum of the f main effects of the f uncertain input factors and of all interactions between the f factors according to 6 s t s f 1 s f 2 s f m f s s f 1 f 2 s f 1 f 3 s f m f s 1 f m f s s f 1 f 2 f 3 s f 1 f 2 f 3 s f m f s 2 f m f s 1 f m fs s f 1 f 1 f 3 f m f s in which the terms s f i represent the variance explained by the main effect of factor f i the terms s f i f j represent the variance explained by interactions between two factors the terms s f i f j f k represent the variance explained by interactions between three factors and so on where the symbol denotes an interaction the contribution of each term x of the decomposition s x main effect or interaction was assessed through the calculation of the sensitivity indexes si x along 7 si x s x s t 100 the method was applied sequentially at seven simulation dates days 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 the dynamic evolution of each sensitivity index si x was reported graphically following lamboni et al 2009 and saltelli et al 2009 3 results 3 1 model output distributions generated by the uncertain parameters fig 3 displays the simulated kinetics for the 2 f m combinations of parameters describing the microbial metabolism with f m 6 for lbios version allowing dormancy and f m 5 for lbios version without dormancy fig 3 only displays the kinetics for the best and worse accessibility of resources to the bacteria spots as defined in section 2 1 as they are the extreme kinetics cases encountered figs 4 and 5 show the simulations obtained for the five global output variables doc b co 2 hoc and r for all simulations all owing to the 2 f m f s combinations where f s 3 is the number of microscopic parameters associated with soil architecture two dates were selected after two and seven days because they generally showed either the biggest or the smallest variability depending on the global output variable in the same graphics we display the outputs simulated separately for each accessibility case 2 f s the latter simulations are thus those associated to the f m input factors describing the microbial metabolism this graphical representation makes it straightforward to decouple the influence of the input factors describing the microbial metabolism from the influence resulting from the input factors describing the spatial accessibility of doc to bacteria all combinations of input factors describing the microbial metabolism produce realistic kinetics of doc uptake emissions of co 2 and biomass growth fig 3 the inclusion of dormancy considerably modifies the biomass growth kinetics since when doc is exhausted the bacteria switch to a dormant state after which biomass does not change without dormancy when doc is exhausted biomass decreases through respiration and mortality consequently higher co 2 and hoc are produced after seven days for optimal microbial metabolism figs 3 4 and 5 accessibility clearly controls microbial activity as it decreases dramatically for the worse accessibility case fig 3 regardless of the model version and the combinations of the f m input factors these results confirmed the previous results obtained by vogel et al 2015 in which only one set of parameters describing the microbial metabolism was used observation of the simulations generated by the f m factors indicates that except for doc at seven days when accessibility is optimal geometry g4 and case g6sw100top a larger variability in the global output variables is found compared to the lower accessibility case figs 4 and 5 in some situations this variability can even reach that of the total output variability on the seventh day comparison of both versions of lbios with and without dormancy suggests that uncertainties appear higher for b when bacteria can become dormant whereas the opposite is observed for co 2 and hoc variables no marked differences are observed for doc this result is expected since when dormancy is activated few co 2 and hoc can be produced because doc is rapidly exhausted and as a consequence bacteria go promptly into dormancy when bacteria remain always active they continuously produced co 2 and hoc with a production rate differing for the different combinations of f m factors although differences in uncertainties are observed between both versions of lbios the same variability trends resulting from the f m factors are found when comparing the different accessibilities figs 4 and 5 3 2 global sensitivity analyses to present the result of global sensitivity analyses the easiest way is to plot the time evolution of the fraction of total variance explained by the most influential main effect and interaction terms and to lump together the least influential terms with si x 2 percent in a residual class this is done in fig 6 for lbios with dormancy and in fig 7 for the cases without for doc μ max initially explains up to 55 of the total variance but this effect decreases rapidly and after 3 days it has become negligible at that point g g l and l explain the majority of the total variance and after 6 days 98 of the total variance is accounted for by parameters associated with soil architecture g g l and l sw sw l g sw and g sw l fig 6 for b μ max explains up to 50 of the total variance initially then k m and k i explain up to 36 of the total variance after four days input factors associated with soil architecture g g l l sw and g sw explain up to 64 of the total variance between days three and four and 51 of the total variance after six days for co 2 μ max alone explains less than 36 of the total variance at first then k r k i and p m explain about 53 of the total variance after six days the factors g g l and l explained about 31 of the total variance after six days for hoc μ max and μ max k m explain up to 36 of the total variance initially then k m alone explains 55 of the total variance after six days whereas together with k i and p m they explain 70 of the total variance finally for r μ max has little influence initially quickly rises to explaining roughly 70 of the total variance on day two and decreases to 36 on day four then k m k i k m p m and p m explain 36 of the total variance until day seven the factor g explains up to 36 on day one and quickly vanishes before explaining about 25 of the total variance after six days these results suggest that the maximum growth rate alone controlled the uptake of doc the biomass growth the proportion of active dormant bacteria and to a lesser extent the production of co 2 after four days however this parameter no longer has any influence on these variables except on the proportion r of active bacteria the decrease of its control on the microbial activity kinetics is concomitant with the depletion of the doc resource in the cases where accessibility is high fig 3 the input factors associated with soil architecture and in particular the geometry of the soil pore space the localization of bacteria within it and the interaction between both factors control the fate of doc over time depending on their values they control the accessibility of resources to bacteria and therefore the kinetics of bacterial activity however the sensitivity analysis reveals that this control takes place only after days two or three when the biomass reaches a sufficient level for doc uptake to be noticeable this delay is controlled mainly by the maximum growth rate the saturation level does not appear to be a strong controlling parameter alone but in interaction with either the geometry or the localization of bacteria or in interaction with both geometry and localization it explains up to 29 of the total variance of doc even in the case where s w 0 25 for the cube g4 having the highest accessibility the kinetics are not so different from those with s w 1 00 whatever the localization of bacterial spots data not shown for the biomass and co 2 productions the input factors associated with soil architecture and those directly linked to microbial metabolism control the kinetics in similar fashion after the third day a peak of control of g g l and l is observed at day four for biomass while this peak was very much attenuated for co 2 production the factors of the microbial metabolism differ to explain biomass and co 2 production as expected the mortality rate controls biomass while respiration rate controls co 2 production the proportion of active bacteria also controls the production of co 2 through the parameter k i finally the humification process appears to be mainly controlled by the mortality rate and surprisingly to a much lesser extent by the proportion of dead bacteria that become hoc fig 6 the input factors associated with soil architecture play only a minor role in this kinetic the proportion of active bacteria is mainly controlled by the maximum uptake rate while it is diversely affected by accessibility the maximum value reached by r does not depend so much on the accessibility as is displayed in fig 3 however the increase of r is much slower when accessibility is low a probable explanation is that in this latter case after about two days the concentration of doc reaching bacteria becomes high enough to increase the proportion of active bacteria but is not sufficiently high to promote exponential growth of bacteria because of affinity to substrate for the version of lbios without dormancy the most influential terms found to explain the total variance of doc are similar to those obtained with the model with dormancy only the control of doc uptake by μ max decreases one day earlier fig 7 this shortest control of the maximal growth rate occurs also for b it can be related to the smaller uncertainty of the doc and b global output variables observed without dormancy compared to dormancy figs 4 and 5 by contrast to the case with dormancy the factors g g l and l explain up to 60 of the total variance of b only on the second day then k m k r p m and k m k r explain about 82 of the total variance after days four when all bacteria are active and once the doc resource is mostly exhausted that is after day four for almost all kinetics fig 3 and data not shown mortality and respiration are thus the only processes left to explain the further evolution of biomass and the factors related to accessibility are no longer at play the proportion of dead cells that are humified also influences the amount of biomass that is present whereas it is not a relevant to explain the amount of biomass once bacteria are in a dormant state for co 2 the chart of the proportions of variance explained by the most influential main effect and interaction terms is very similar to that of the case with dormancy figs 6 and 7 the major difference is that when all bacteria are active k m is substituted to k i and k m explains a higher proportion 36 of the total variance than does k r 15 this means that the production of co 2 can be considerably decreased when mortality rate is high and thus the respiration rate appears only in second rank in terms of explaining co 2 as for co 2 the charts of the most influential terms explaining the variance of hoc associated with both versions of lbios are very similar figs 6 and 7 without dormancy k m is substituted to k r to explain 51 of the total variance after day three the proportion of dead cells that become humified explains more 13 of the total variance compared to the case with dormancy 8 it seems noteworthy that the parameter k s alone or in interaction with other parameters did not explain any of the total variance of the global output variables whatever the version of the model yet the half rate constant for microbial growth bears one of the highest uncertainty range a factor of seven between its minimal and maximal value together with the mortality constant rate table 2 to better disentangle the influence of the factors linked to microbial metabolism and the influence of physical factors related to soil architecture on biodegradation kinetics we summed all proportions of variances explained by the f m factors linked to microbial metabolism on the one hand and those explained by the f s factors related to soil architecture on the other hand we further distinguished among each of these two groups the proportions of variances explained by a single factor those explained by interactions between 2 factors and those explained by interactions between 3 factors let us define m the sum of proportions of variances explained by main biological factors m m the sum of proportions of variances explained by interactions between two biological factors and m m m the sum of proportions of variances explained by interactions between three biological factors in the same way we define s s s and s s s the proportions of variance explained by single physical factor interactions between two physical factors and interactions between three physical factors s m represents the sum of proportions of variance explained by the interactions between a biological factor and a physical factor figs 8 and 9 thus display the time dependent area charts of the most influential main effect and interaction terms grouped into two different categories biological factors m m m and m m m and physical factors s s s and s s s the figures also display the most influential interaction between a single biological and a single physical factor s m this graphical presentation illustrates that in the case of doc the beginning of the kinetics is mainly controlled by parameters describing the microbial metabolism whereas these parameters continuously control the kinetics over time for the other output variables b co 2 hoc and r in general the bulk of the variance is due to individual main effects of the f m parameters except for co 2 hoc and r where two factor interactions also have an influence but not exceeding 20 of the total variance by contrast two factor interactions of the parameters emerging from soil architecture appear to make a more important contribution to the variability of the outputs a small contribution up to 7 of three factor interactions is also observed for the f s parameters finally two factor interactions between f m and f s factors could explain up to 24 of the total variance mainly at the beginning of the kinetics these figures also clearly demonstrate that doc kinetics can be a relevant proxy to emphasize the role of soil architecture whatever the version of the model more surprisingly the variability of b and co 2 kinetics is also controlled by parameters associated with soil architecture up to 60 for b however the extent of this control differs markedly depending on whether bacteria can or cannot become dormant 4 discussion the uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses for microbial parameters performed by cazelles et al 2013 highlights the influence of soil architecture in microbial processes using a comparable approach we confirm their results and are able to disentangle the interacting biotic and abiotic sources of variability the uncertainty analysis shows that the uncertainty linked to microbial metabolism parameters translates into a high output variability on the kinetics when accessibility is not a limiting factor however the output variability resulting from uncertainty affecting microbial metabolism parameters is strongly reduced when accessibility is low the same result is obtained for both versions of the model with and without dormancy the immediate consequence is that the currently widely accepted hypothesis that accessibility at the microscopic scale controls microbial activity could be challenged since uncertainty linked with microbial metabolism can generate as much variability as soil architecture heterogeneity however in the limiting case of low accessibility the different microbial metabolisms tested in the various scenarios tested can only modify to a small extent the system responses and uncertainty linked to factors associated with soil architecture is preponderant in these cases the global sensitivity analyses shed a different view on the simulation data their results afford a detailed description of the parameters that are chiefly responsible for the observed uncertainty over time it emphasized that variability of the global output variable responses is diversely controlled by uncertainty either of the factors describing microbial metabolism or of the factors linked with soil architecture but also that interactions between biotic and abiotic factors are relatively inconsequential the percentage of explained variance by biotic and abiotic factors remains similar for two variables doc and co 2 whatever the version of the model with or without dormancy whereas results are markedly different for variable b and to a lesser extent for variable hoc in the various cases considered these results suggest that for the uncertainty intervals fixed in this study and for the two chosen levels of each parameter using different versions of the som model the role of soil architecture can be evidenced using either doc or co 2 as proxy measures in this respect vogel et al 2015 reached a slightly different conclusion namely that doc is a good proxy but not co 2 their sensitivity analysis was performed by mixing both versions of the model with a single set of parameter describing microbial metabolism by contrast the sensitivity analysis reported here is performed separately for each version of the model with various sets of parameters describing microbial metabolism this methodology thus appears to better tease apart the biotic and abiotic interacting sources of variability and to select good proxies for measuring them however it should be noted that the quality of the results of these statistical analyses also depends on the number of simulations although porting lbios to openmp considerably decreased the cpu time calculations to less than half an hour on a pc with two intel 3 ghz xeon processors we selected only two levels of each parameter further work is in order to assess the robustness of our results using a larger number of simulations in which parameters values are selected at regular increments within the uncertainty intervals this research will require access to more powerful computer facilities than are typically allocated at the moment to research on soils thus one could consider that the key message of the research described above is that one needs to be very careful when carrying out uncertainty and sensitivity analyses on soil carbon models depending on how these analyses are conducted results can lead to the conclusion that different global output variables would appear to be better windows than others into the often intricate soil processes to the extent that such outcomes could help experimentalists decide which measurements would be most useful to perform in their work the consequences may not be trivial at this juncture instead of refining further the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of the lbios model it may be more useful in the short run to first improve various aspects of the model to align them better with the information that has become available in recent years inclusion of oxygen distribution within the 3d pore space is one of the next steps to get more realistic predictions indeed several authors have pointed out its importance in soil microbial activity e g ebrahimi and or 2018 however we expect that for our scenarios where we could target only the meso and macro porosity oxygen is not a limiting factor for bacteria metabolism including the motility of bacteria or external controls on their growth kinetics that can manifest through predation e g by protozoans or parasitism by bacteriophages would certainly lead to a different picture than the one we get in particular chemotaxis would help bacteria to reduce the distances to doc resource in the cases of low accessibility scenarios the scenarios would also be more realistic if solid organic matter was considered as the resource instead of dissolved organic carbon it is also clear that even the current description of dormancy in lbios borrowed from blagodatsky and richter 1998 could be improved it assumes an absolute repression of biomass flows uptake mortality respiration when bacteria are all dormant such a description of dormancy is thus questionable as this approach idealizes metabolic capacities of microorganisms by considering transition to dormant state as perfectly efficient and a costless way to save carbon when it cannot be gained because of low resources evidence indicates however that resting life requires maintenance lennon and jones 2011 which is formalized in some other models for example in the models of kopnoka 1999 or manzoni et al 2014 describing biomass as two pools active and dormant dormant biomass is affected by maintenance or mortality flows like the active pool though with much smaller rates another aspect of the lbios model and indeed at this stage of all the microscopic scale models of soil microbial processes currently available is the neglect of sub resolution pores in ct images which could have a significant influence on bacterial metabolism as argued by baveye et al 2017 perhaps one should wait for some of these shortcomings to be alleviated to carry out more advanced uncertainty and sensitivity analyses using the key lessons learned in this article as a guide at that point 5 conclusions uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses were performed on modeling scenarios of a particular carbon dynamics model lbios in two complete factorial designs each factorial design was assigned to a particular version of the lbios model one including a variation of the physiological state dormancy of bacteria and the other using optimal microbial activity the scenarios took place in discrete 3d soil pore spaces obtained from computed tomography images uncertainty ranges were fixed for parameters describing the carbon dynamics module of lbios and for parameters describing the soil architecture heterogeneity the uncertainty analysis shows that the output variability associated to the uncertain input factors describing microbial metabolism can be as high as the total output variability associated to all uncertain factors when accessibility of resources to bacteria is high when accessibility is limiting the output variability associated with uncertainty of the input factors describing microbial metabolism is drastically reduced and total output variability is due predominantly to uncertainty of the input factors associated with soil architecture thus by using a thorough uncertainty and sensitivity analysis a more complex picture emerged than the one found by vogel et al 2015 where in the case of resources easily accessible to bacteria the influence of the biological factors on biodegradation kinetics is comparable to the influence of the physical factors the sensitivity analysis reveals that not only the doc variable as suggested by vogel et al 2015 but also the co 2 variable are appropriate macroscopic proxies to identify the parameters describing the heterogeneity of soil architecture as drivers of biodegradation kinetics whatever the model structure used however it also shows that model structure strongly impacts the identification

25261,soil respiration causes the second largest c flux between ecosystems and the atmosphere emerging soil carbon dynamics models consider the complex interplay of microscale interactions between the physical and biological drivers of soil organic matter decomposition occurring in the 3d soil architecture they are expected to provide a way to upscale results to the macroscopic level and as such appear as an alternative modelling approach to the traditional black box macroscopic models however these models still need to be tested under a broader range of their parameters values and structures than has been the case to date we thus conducted uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of previous predictions on dissolved organic carbon biodegradation obtained by one of these microscopic carbon dynamics models lbios six parameters of the carbon dynamics module of lbios associated with bacterial metabolism and three microscopic 3d descriptors of soil architecture were considered as uncertain inputs we built two complete factorial designs in which the minimum and maximum of uncertainty intervals are considered each factorial design is assigned to a particular structure of the model one including dormancy of bacteria and the other considering optimal bacterial activity the scenarios took place in 3d computed tomography images of an undisturbed cultivated soil the sensitivity indices at different simulations dates were computed with an anova procedure taking into account main effects and interactions among factors the uncertainty analysis shows that only in the limiting case of low accessibility of resources to bacteria the different microbial metabolisms tested can modify to a small extent the system responses and uncertainty linked to parameters describing soil architecture becomes preponderant in the case of optimal accessibility output variability is due predominantly to uncertainty of the microbial metabolism parameters the sensitivity analysis suggests that whatever the structure of the model the role of soil architecture in the microbial activity can be evidenced using either doc or co2 as proxy measures beyond these results we stress that results of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of soil carbon models need to be interpreted with caution dependent as they are on the status of the model itself as well as on the particular scenarios used in the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses keywords lattice boltzmann model sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis soil architecture carbon bacteria 1 introduction with globally 68 to 120 pg c year 1 soil respiration represents the second largest c flux between ecosystems and the atmosphere among the hundreds of computer models that describe the dynamics of soil carbon under a range of soil and environmental conditions manzoni and porporato 2009 many adhere to a traditional macroscopic perspective in which the soil organic matter is divided into a number of connected pools but no detail is included on the spatial distribution of organic matter in the pore space nor on the biodiversity and activity of the biomass in contrast to this traditional approach a number of researchers have attempted to describe in detail the complex interplay of microscale processes that determine the fate of organic matter monga et al 2008 falconer et al 2012 ebrahimi and or 2015 vogel et al 2015 the anticipation being that if a proper description of these processes can be achieved and one can find a way to upscale the result to the macroscopic scale the description of emergent processes will be far better than what traditional black box models produce even though measurements techniques able to provide quantitative data on microscopic parameters of soils have experienced tremendous technological advances in the recent decade many of the microscopic processes these models involve are still little more than assumptions at this point kovarova kovar and egli 1998 gignoux et al 2001 or their descriptions are gross simplification of what we suspect is really occurring nevertheless even under these conditions as various authors have argued gras et al 2010 2011 folse and allison 2012 manzoni et al 2014 microscale models of soil processes can be very useful guides for further research as long as they are supplemented by thorough uncertainty and sensitivity analyses uncertainty analysis aims at characterizing the distribution of global output variables resulting from the probability distribution of several uncertain input factors saltelli et al 2009 wallach et al 2013 the purpose of sensitivity analysis is to evaluate the extent to which each model parameter is responsible for the observed outcome uncertainty saltelli et al 2009 whereas the latter analysis has been often used solely to identify the sensitive parameters of a given model in order to point out the ones whose measurement or independent estimation should deserve particular attention e g neff and asner 2001 cazelles et al 2013 pagel et al 2014 dwivedi et al 2017 uncertainty analysis has seldom been used in the context of soil carbon dynamic modelling only a few articles have carried out both types of analyses boulange et al 2012 wang et al 2013 2005 xenakis et al 2008 among the recent articles that have combined the development of a microscale computer model with a detailed sensitivity analysis of it vogel et al 2015 try to assess the role of meso and macropore topology on the biodegradation of a soluble carbon substrate in a soil under variably water saturated and pure diffusion conditions in order to do this they describe a 3d pore scale model lbios that couples a diffusion lattice boltzmann model and a compartmental biodegradation model with lbios they simulate a number of hypothetical scenarios in which four factors are systematically varied meso and macropore space geometry water saturation bacterial distribution and physiology a global sensitivity analysis of these factors highlights the influence of physical factors related to soil architecture on biodegradation kinetics the location of bacterial cells explains 28 of the total variance in substrate concentration in all scenarios while the interactions among location saturation and geometry explain up to 51 of it however this result is obtained by using only one set of parameters describing microbial metabolism and no uncertainty analysis is carried out in this context the purpose of the research described in the present article is to assess the robustness of observations made by vogel et al 2015 by reproducing the same scenarios but using several sets of parameters describing the microbial metabolism our hypothesis is that the strong influence of physical factors related to soil architecture on biodegradation kinetics found by vogel et al 2015 in their scenarios may be counterbalanced by the influence of biological factors related to microbial metabolism with more complete uncertainty and sensitivity analyses a different picture may emerge of what the key parameters of the model are and it may suggest to direct our attention to other types of macroscopic measurements than those suggested by vogel et al 2015 to test their model 2 material and methods 2 1 3d images of soil micro environments samples of a cultivated soil a silty loamy 19 clay 75 silt 6 sand albeluvisol were obtained by vogel et al 2015 and 3d images of the samples were obtained using an x ray ct scanner at the simbios center dundee the voxel resolution of the images is 68 μm and the image size is 6003 voxels the rather low resolution of the ct images did not permit to visualise the vast majority of the fine particles clay and silt of the soil and therefore neither the smaller sized pores that are associated with these particles therefore only the meso and macropores were considered in this study according to classification of luxmoore 1981 as discussed in vogel et al 2015 this resolution was chosen because it could reproduce the millimeter scale variability of microbial activity found for instance by vieublé gonod et al 2003 we selected 2 sub images g4 and g6 of 1003 voxels out of the dataset of vogel et al 2015 for their contrasted values of three indicators of the pore space topology these indicators are the euler poincaré characteristic epc the geometrical tortuosity τ g and the specific surface area ssa epc is a measure of the number of non redundant closed loop paths in the pore space τ g is the ratio of the geodesic distance over the euclidian distance between two distant points in the pore space and ssa is the liquid solid interface area per unit mass see vogel et al 2015 for more details about their calculations table 1 gives the values of these indicators for the two sub images g4 and g6 the sub image g4 has a geometrical tortuosity close to one indicating straight pathways from the top plane to the bottom plane a specific surface area of about twice that of a sphere of identical pore volume and epc has a value close to zero indicating a poorly connected pore network with a low variation in the geometry of the pores its pore space is thus considered as topologically homogeneous the sub image g6 has a high geometrical tortuosity indicating longer and more tortuous pathways from the top plane to the bottom plane a specific surface area of about three times that of a sphere of identical pore volume and its epc has a highly negative value indicating a continuous well connected pore space its pore space is thus considered as topologically complex these images correspond to a volume size of about 314 mm3 and their total macroporosity values are 11 25 and 18 82 for g4 and g6 respectively table 1 vogel et al 2015 calculated the 3d water and air distribution for different water saturation indexes s w the proportion of liquid phase on pore phase in each sub images using the model of genty and pot 2013 we selected two water and air distributions at the extreme values of the water saturation index s w 0 25 and s w 1 00 fig 1 we used the incubation experiments reported in monga et al 2014 of a single bacteria strain with fructose as sole source of carbon in sand microcosm to define initial substrate and bacteria concentrations in the sub images doc 0 0 62 mgccm 3 and b 0 1 31 10 6 mgccm 3 the boundary diffusion conditions were fixed to zero flow to mimick the pure diffusion conditions of the incubation experiments in the simulations fructose is applied as a pulse on the top horizontal plane of the images ten spots representing micro colonies of the bacteria strain are placed in ten voxels containing water in vogel et al 2015 three types of distribution are tested the ten selected voxels are close to the initial fructose source the top localisation i e the ten spots are localised within the 30 first horizontal planes corresponding to an average euclidian distance of 1 mm from the initial fructose top horizontal plane they are far from it the bottom localisation i e the ten spots are localised within the 30 last horizontal planes corresponding to a minimal euclidian distance of 4 7 mm from the initial fructose top horizontal plane or they are regularly spaced the distributed localisation see vogel et al 2015 we selected the most contrasted localisations top and bottom we thus constituted a dataset of 8 images of contrasted soil micro environments being the two ct images g4 and g6 at two water saturation indexes s w 0 25 and s w 1 00 for each of these four

carbon dynamics in a discrete spatial representation of soil pore space at the scale of soil microhabitats is described in detail in vogel et al 2015 lbios comprises two coupled modules a stock flow module predicting the dynamics of microbial transformations of carbon compounds and a lattice boltzmann module describing the diffusion of soluble carbon compounds in the liquid phase of soil pore space the diffusion module is not the focus of the present article and will not be discussed further except to mention that since the publication of vogel et al 2015 a paralleled version of the code ported on openmp has been developed and was used in the research described here to make this article reasonably self contained a succinct account of the carbon dynamics module of lbios its equations and their underlying principles is provided in the following in this module soil carbon is partitioned dynamically into several pools characterised by different biochemical compositions fig 2 four pools are considered bacterial biomass b dissolved organic carbon doc humified organic carbon hoc and carbon dioxide co 2 these pools evolve over time as a result of processes inducing stock flows uptake respiration mortality and biomass recycling which are described mathematically through the following equations 1 db dt μ max doc k s doc k r k m rb 2 ddoc dt μ max doc k s doc 1 p m k m rb 3 dco 2 dt k r rb 4 dhoc dt p m k m rb where μ max is the maximal specific rate of microbial growth t 1 k s is the so called half rate constant for microbial growth m l 3 k r and k m are first order rate constants t 1 accounting for respiration and mortality respectively r is the fraction of active bacteria in the range 0 to 1 p m is the fraction also between 0 and 1 of dead bacteria cells that become hoc whereas the rest 1 p m is recycled into the doc pool these equations encompass a number of assumptions the model involves bacteria only whose growth is described in eqs 1 and 2 according to monod s equation respiration and mortality are first order functions of the bacterial biomass b lbios consequently does not distinguish between growth respiration traditionally calculated as a function of substrate during uptake and maintenance respiration proportional to b wang and post 2012 the mortality products are split into a soluble part flowing eventually integrating the doc pool biomass recycling and an insoluble part accounting for soil organic matter neosynthesis or humification garnier et al 2008 into the hoc pool given the short timeframe of the simulations seven days hydrolysis of hoc into doc is not considered the division of the biomass into an active function quantified by r and a dormant portion equal to 1 r times the total biomass following wang et al 2014 is a special feature of lbios naturally r changes with environmental conditions its evolution over time is regulated by the substrate concentration doc following blagodatsky and richter 1998 5 dr dt μ max doc k s doc doc k i doc r where k i is a so called physiological state inhibition constant m l 3 r is applied to all bacterial fluxes eqs 1 4 as a multiplier hence any slow down of metabolism provoked by suboptimal resource availability is related to substrate deficiency the introduction of dormant bacteria can drastically modify the output variables b and co 2 which are directly related to the microbial metabolism as calculated by lbios vogel et al 2015 therefore we conducted the statistical analysis on two versions of lbios with and without dormancy in the simulations the mass of carbon of the doc pool is calculated in each fluid voxel of the 3d images the global value of doc at the scale of the soil sample is thus calculated as the sum of all carbon masses of doc in the fluid voxels in the same way the global output variables b co 2 and hoc are calculated as the sum of masses of carbon of the respective pools on the ten bacterial spots finally the global output variable r is calculated as the mean proportion of active bacteria over the ten bacterial spots in the simulations the initial mass of carbon of the hoc and co 2 pools is considered equal to zero in the version of lbios with dormancy the initial value of r is fixed to 10 according to ingwersen et al 2008 2 3 complete factorial designs the sensitivity analysis of a model is similar to an experiment where nature is being replaced by the simulated model it follows that the classical theory of experimental design provides very useful tools for sensitivity analysis wallach et al 2013 many different methods have been developed for global sensitivity analysis and those involving factorial designs represent one possible approach based on variance decomposition campolongo and saltelli 2000 this approach is able to capture the interactions among factors and to decompose the total variance of the model outputs into several terms representing main effects and total effects including interactions of the considered model inputs this method has already been applied in previous studies to complex models ginot et al 2006 lamboni et al 2009 2011 although other sampling techniques can be implemented we used the factorial design approach to express the total variance of the model outputs as a sum of the contributions of the different inputs campolongo and saltelli 2000 more details on this approach can be found in saltelli et al 2000 all six parameters of the carbon dynamics module of lbios were considered as uncertain inputs μ max k s k r k m p m k i if f m denotes the number of these parameters describing the microbial metabolism f m 6 for the version of lbios with dormancy and the parameters are μ max k s k r k m p m and k i whereas f m 5 for the version of lbios without dormancy and the parameters are μ max k s k r k m and p m analyses of the variability associated with these parameters require adopting specific theoretical ranges for them unfortunately the relevant literature is unevenly informative about the variability of these parameters whereas we have been able to locate only a few values for k r and k i plenty of values are provided for μ max and k s available values for k r and k i typically result from the fitting of soil carbon dynamics models to data from soil incubations with composite microbiota and carbon sources whereas values for μ max and k s sometimes also originate from incubations in liquid cultures another difficulty is linked to the non uniform formalism of the som models used to describe the stock flows between the different carbon pools we thus chose the interval range of those parameters based on only two studies data for μ max k s k r k m p m k i are obtained from monga et al 2014 who use a carbon dynamics module similar to the one incorporated in lbios the article by ingwersen et al 2008 who use the same physiological index r as lbios provided the uncertainty level of k i table 2 however we were not able to define precise probability distributions for the uncertain model inputs with such scarce information on the parameter values instead of defining arbitrary distributions we chose to rely only on the lower and upper bounds of the values found in the papers of monga et al 2014 and ingwersen et al 2008 we then generated all possible combinations of the parameter bounds using a complete factorial design as in wallach et al 2013 in addition three more microscopic descriptors associated with soil architecture were considered as uncertain input factors table 2 the soil pore space topology g the water saturation index of the soil pore space s w and the localisation of spots where bacterial cells are in the soil pore space l relative to the initial position of doc let us define f s the number of these microscopic parameters with f s 3 as we showed in section 2 1 the complexity of the pore space topology cannot be described by a single quantitative indicator the objective of the present work is to assess the robustness of previous predictions of vogel et al 2015 when using different values of the parameters describing the microbial metabolism and not to find quantitative relations linking the bacterial activity with the topology we thus used a qualitative factor g to describe the degree of complexity of the topology in the same way defining a single quantitative indicator of the distance between the ten bacterial spots to doc remains a difficult task which is beyond the objective of the present paper although the distances between the spots and the initial doc pulse can be quantified through their geodesic pathways for instance these distances will change throughout the simulation as doc diffuses in the liquid phase we thus used a qualitative factor l to describe the initial accessibility of resources to the bacterial spots in the same way as for the parameters of the carbon dynamics module we selected their minimal and maximal values as reported in section 2 2 the minimal and maximal values of s w are 0 25 and 1 00 for the qualitative factor g the minimal level is the most homogeneous pore space g4 and the maximal level is the most complex pore space g6 for the qualitative factor l the minimal level corresponds to the best initial accessibility of resources to the bacterial spots the top distribution and the maximal level corresponds to the worse initial accessibility of resources to the bacterial spots the bottom distribution the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed according to complete 2 f m f s factorial designs in which for each input factor the minimum and the maximum of the corresponding uncertainty interval were systematically considered for the version of lbios without dormancy a complete 28 factorial design 256 simulations was constructed using the fac design function of the r software doe base library whereas a complete 29 factorial design 512 simulations was used for the version of lbios with dormancy all simulations computed the degradation of doc on a seven day timespan in the 3d computed tomography images described earlier 2 4 global sensitivity analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed on each one of the global output variables doc b co 2 hoc and r using the aov function of the software r the total variance s t of the simulated outputs is decomposed as the sum of the f main effects of the f uncertain input factors and of all interactions between the f factors according to 6 s t s f 1 s f 2 s f m f s s f 1 f 2 s f 1 f 3 s f m f s 1 f m f s s f 1 f 2 f 3 s f 1 f 2 f 3 s f m f s 2 f m f s 1 f m fs s f 1 f 1 f 3 f m f s in which the terms s f i represent the variance explained by the main effect of factor f i the terms s f i f j represent the variance explained by interactions between two factors the terms s f i f j f k represent the variance explained by interactions between three factors and so on where the symbol denotes an interaction the contribution of each term x of the decomposition s x main effect or interaction was assessed through the calculation of the sensitivity indexes si x along 7 si x s x s t 100 the method was applied sequentially at seven simulation dates days 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 the dynamic evolution of each sensitivity index si x was reported graphically following lamboni et al 2009 and saltelli et al 2009 3 results 3 1 model output distributions generated by the uncertain parameters fig 3 displays the simulated kinetics for the 2 f m combinations of parameters describing the microbial metabolism with f m 6 for lbios version allowing dormancy and f m 5 for lbios version without dormancy fig 3 only displays the kinetics for the best and worse accessibility of resources to the bacteria spots as defined in section 2 1 as they are the extreme kinetics cases encountered figs 4 and 5 show the simulations obtained for the five global output variables doc b co 2 hoc and r for all simulations all owing to the 2 f m f s combinations where f s 3 is the number of microscopic parameters associated with soil architecture two dates were selected after two and seven days because they generally showed either the biggest or the smallest variability depending on the global output variable in the same graphics we display the outputs simulated separately for each accessibility case 2 f s the latter simulations are thus those associated to the f m input factors describing the microbial metabolism this graphical representation makes it straightforward to decouple the influence of the input factors describing the microbial metabolism from the influence resulting from the input factors describing the spatial accessibility of doc to bacteria all combinations of input factors describing the microbial metabolism produce realistic kinetics of doc uptake emissions of co 2 and biomass growth fig 3 the inclusion of dormancy considerably modifies the biomass growth kinetics since when doc is exhausted the bacteria switch to a dormant state after which biomass does not change without dormancy when doc is exhausted biomass decreases through respiration and mortality consequently higher co 2 and hoc are produced after seven days for optimal microbial metabolism figs 3 4 and 5 accessibility clearly controls microbial activity as it decreases dramatically for the worse accessibility case fig 3 regardless of the model version and the combinations of the f m input factors these results confirmed the previous results obtained by vogel et al 2015 in which only one set of parameters describing the microbial metabolism was used observation of the simulations generated by the f m factors indicates that except for doc at seven days when accessibility is optimal geometry g4 and case g6sw100top a larger variability in the global output variables is found compared to the lower accessibility case figs 4 and 5 in some situations this variability can even reach that of the total output variability on the seventh day comparison of both versions of lbios with and without dormancy suggests that uncertainties appear higher for b when bacteria can become dormant whereas the opposite is observed for co 2 and hoc variables no marked differences are observed for doc this result is expected since when dormancy is activated few co 2 and hoc can be produced because doc is rapidly exhausted and as a consequence bacteria go promptly into dormancy when bacteria remain always active they continuously produced co 2 and hoc with a production rate differing for the different combinations of f m factors although differences in uncertainties are observed between both versions of lbios the same variability trends resulting from the f m factors are found when comparing the different accessibilities figs 4 and 5 3 2 global sensitivity analyses to present the result of global sensitivity analyses the easiest way is to plot the time evolution of the fraction of total variance explained by the most influential main effect and interaction terms and to lump together the least influential terms with si x 2 percent in a residual class this is done in fig 6 for lbios with dormancy and in fig 7 for the cases without for doc μ max initially explains up to 55 of the total variance but this effect decreases rapidly and after 3 days it has become negligible at that point g g l and l explain the majority of the total variance and after 6 days 98 of the total variance is accounted for by parameters associated with soil architecture g g l and l sw sw l g sw and g sw l fig 6 for b μ max explains up to 50 of the total variance initially then k m and k i explain up to 36 of the total variance after four days input factors associated with soil architecture g g l l sw and g sw explain up to 64 of the total variance between days three and four and 51 of the total variance after six days for co 2 μ max alone explains less than 36 of the total variance at first then k r k i and p m explain about 53 of the total variance after six days the factors g g l and l explained about 31 of the total variance after six days for hoc μ max and μ max k m explain up to 36 of the total variance initially then k m alone explains 55 of the total variance after six days whereas together with k i and p m they explain 70 of the total variance finally for r μ max has little influence initially quickly rises to explaining roughly 70 of the total variance on day two and decreases to 36 on day four then k m k i k m p m and p m explain 36 of the total variance until day seven the factor g explains up to 36 on day one and quickly vanishes before explaining about 25 of the total variance after six days these results suggest that the maximum growth rate alone controlled the uptake of doc the biomass growth the proportion of active dormant bacteria and to a lesser extent the production of co 2 after four days however this parameter no longer has any influence on these variables except on the proportion r of active bacteria the decrease of its control on the microbial activity kinetics is concomitant with the depletion of the doc resource in the cases where accessibility is high fig 3 the input factors associated with soil architecture and in particular the geometry of the soil pore space the localization of bacteria within it and the interaction between both factors control the fate of doc over time depending on their values they control the accessibility of resources to bacteria and therefore the kinetics of bacterial activity however the sensitivity analysis reveals that this control takes place only after days two or three when the biomass reaches a sufficient level for doc uptake to be noticeable this delay is controlled mainly by the maximum growth rate the saturation level does not appear to be a strong controlling parameter alone but in interaction with either the geometry or the localization of bacteria or in interaction with both geometry and localization it explains up to 29 of the total variance of doc even in the case where s w 0 25 for the cube g4 having the highest accessibility the kinetics are not so different from those with s w 1 00 whatever the localization of bacterial spots data not shown for the biomass and co 2 productions the input factors associated with soil architecture and those directly linked to microbial metabolism control the kinetics in similar fashion after the third day a peak of control of g g l and l is observed at day four for biomass while this peak was very much attenuated for co 2 production the factors of the microbial metabolism differ to explain biomass and co 2 production as expected the mortality rate controls biomass while respiration rate controls co 2 production the proportion of active bacteria also controls the production of co 2 through the parameter k i finally the humification process appears to be mainly controlled by the mortality rate and surprisingly to a much lesser extent by the proportion of dead bacteria that become hoc fig 6 the input factors associated with soil architecture play only a minor role in this kinetic the proportion of active bacteria is mainly controlled by the maximum uptake rate while it is diversely affected by accessibility the maximum value reached by r does not depend so much on the accessibility as is displayed in fig 3 however the increase of r is much slower when accessibility is low a probable explanation is that in this latter case after about two days the concentration of doc reaching bacteria becomes high enough to increase the proportion of active bacteria but is not sufficiently high to promote exponential growth of bacteria because of affinity to substrate for the version of lbios without dormancy the most influential terms found to explain the total variance of doc are similar to those obtained with the model with dormancy only the control of doc uptake by μ max decreases one day earlier fig 7 this shortest control of the maximal growth rate occurs also for b it can be related to the smaller uncertainty of the doc and b global output variables observed without dormancy compared to dormancy figs 4 and 5 by contrast to the case with dormancy the factors g g l and l explain up to 60 of the total variance of b only on the second day then k m k r p m and k m k r explain about 82 of the total variance after days four when all bacteria are active and once the doc resource is mostly exhausted that is after day four for almost all kinetics fig 3 and data not shown mortality and respiration are thus the only processes left to explain the further evolution of biomass and the factors related to accessibility are no longer at play the proportion of dead cells that are humified also influences the amount of biomass that is present whereas it is not a relevant to explain the amount of biomass once bacteria are in a dormant state for co 2 the chart of the proportions of variance explained by the most influential main effect and interaction terms is very similar to that of the case with dormancy figs 6 and 7 the major difference is that when all bacteria are active k m is substituted to k i and k m explains a higher proportion 36 of the total variance than does k r 15 this means that the production of co 2 can be considerably decreased when mortality rate is high and thus the respiration rate appears only in second rank in terms of explaining co 2 as for co 2 the charts of the most influential terms explaining the variance of hoc associated with both versions of lbios are very similar figs 6 and 7 without dormancy k m is substituted to k r to explain 51 of the total variance after day three the proportion of dead cells that become humified explains more 13 of the total variance compared to the case with dormancy 8 it seems noteworthy that the parameter k s alone or in interaction with other parameters did not explain any of the total variance of the global output variables whatever the version of the model yet the half rate constant for microbial growth bears one of the highest uncertainty range a factor of seven between its minimal and maximal value together with the mortality constant rate table 2 to better disentangle the influence of the factors linked to microbial metabolism and the influence of physical factors related to soil architecture on biodegradation kinetics we summed all proportions of variances explained by the f m factors linked to microbial metabolism on the one hand and those explained by the f s factors related to soil architecture on the other hand we further distinguished among each of these two groups the proportions of variances explained by a single factor those explained by interactions between 2 factors and those explained by interactions between 3 factors let us define m the sum of proportions of variances explained by main biological factors m m the sum of proportions of variances explained by interactions between two biological factors and m m m the sum of proportions of variances explained by interactions between three biological factors in the same way we define s s s and s s s the proportions of variance explained by single physical factor interactions between two physical factors and interactions between three physical factors s m represents the sum of proportions of variance explained by the interactions between a biological factor and a physical factor figs 8 and 9 thus display the time dependent area charts of the most influential main effect and interaction terms grouped into two different categories biological factors m m m and m m m and physical factors s s s and s s s the figures also display the most influential interaction between a single biological and a single physical factor s m this graphical presentation illustrates that in the case of doc the beginning of the kinetics is mainly controlled by parameters describing the microbial metabolism whereas these parameters continuously control the kinetics over time for the other output variables b co 2 hoc and r in general the bulk of the variance is due to individual main effects of the f m parameters except for co 2 hoc and r where two factor interactions also have an influence but not exceeding 20 of the total variance by contrast two factor interactions of the parameters emerging from soil architecture appear to make a more important contribution to the variability of the outputs a small contribution up to 7 of three factor interactions is also observed for the f s parameters finally two factor interactions between f m and f s factors could explain up to 24 of the total variance mainly at the beginning of the kinetics these figures also clearly demonstrate that doc kinetics can be a relevant proxy to emphasize the role of soil architecture whatever the version of the model more surprisingly the variability of b and co 2 kinetics is also controlled by parameters associated with soil architecture up to 60 for b however the extent of this control differs markedly depending on whether bacteria can or cannot become dormant 4 discussion the uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses for microbial parameters performed by cazelles et al 2013 highlights the influence of soil architecture in microbial processes using a comparable approach we confirm their results and are able to disentangle the interacting biotic and abiotic sources of variability the uncertainty analysis shows that the uncertainty linked to microbial metabolism parameters translates into a high output variability on the kinetics when accessibility is not a limiting factor however the output variability resulting from uncertainty affecting microbial metabolism parameters is strongly reduced when accessibility is low the same result is obtained for both versions of the model with and without dormancy the immediate consequence is that the currently widely accepted hypothesis that accessibility at the microscopic scale controls microbial activity could be challenged since uncertainty linked with microbial metabolism can generate as much variability as soil architecture heterogeneity however in the limiting case of low accessibility the different microbial metabolisms tested in the various scenarios tested can only modify to a small extent the system responses and uncertainty linked to factors associated with soil architecture is preponderant in these cases the global sensitivity analyses shed a different view on the simulation data their results afford a detailed description of the parameters that are chiefly responsible for the observed uncertainty over time it emphasized that variability of the global output variable responses is diversely controlled by uncertainty either of the factors describing microbial metabolism or of the factors linked with soil architecture but also that interactions between biotic and abiotic factors are relatively inconsequential the percentage of explained variance by biotic and abiotic factors remains similar for two variables doc and co 2 whatever the version of the model with or without dormancy whereas results are markedly different for variable b and to a lesser extent for variable hoc in the various cases considered these results suggest that for the uncertainty intervals fixed in this study and for the two chosen levels of each parameter using different versions of the som model the role of soil architecture can be evidenced using either doc or co 2 as proxy measures in this respect vogel et al 2015 reached a slightly different conclusion namely that doc is a good proxy but not co 2 their sensitivity analysis was performed by mixing both versions of the model with a single set of parameter describing microbial metabolism by contrast the sensitivity analysis reported here is performed separately for each version of the model with various sets of parameters describing microbial metabolism this methodology thus appears to better tease apart the biotic and abiotic interacting sources of variability and to select good proxies for measuring them however it should be noted that the quality of the results of these statistical analyses also depends on the number of simulations although porting lbios to openmp considerably decreased the cpu time calculations to less than half an hour on a pc with two intel 3 ghz xeon processors we selected only two levels of each parameter further work is in order to assess the robustness of our results using a larger number of simulations in which parameters values are selected at regular increments within the uncertainty intervals this research will require access to more powerful computer facilities than are typically allocated at the moment to research on soils thus one could consider that the key message of the research described above is that one needs to be very careful when carrying out uncertainty and sensitivity analyses on soil carbon models depending on how these analyses are conducted results can lead to the conclusion that different global output variables would appear to be better windows than others into the often intricate soil processes to the extent that such outcomes could help experimentalists decide which measurements would be most useful to perform in their work the consequences may not be trivial at this juncture instead of refining further the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of the lbios model it may be more useful in the short run to first improve various aspects of the model to align them better with the information that has become available in recent years inclusion of oxygen distribution within the 3d pore space is one of the next steps to get more realistic predictions indeed several authors have pointed out its importance in soil microbial activity e g ebrahimi and or 2018 however we expect that for our scenarios where we could target only the meso and macro porosity oxygen is not a limiting factor for bacteria metabolism including the motility of bacteria or external controls on their growth kinetics that can manifest through predation e g by protozoans or parasitism by bacteriophages would certainly lead to a different picture than the one we get in particular chemotaxis would help bacteria to reduce the distances to doc resource in the cases of low accessibility scenarios the scenarios would also be more realistic if solid organic matter was considered as the resource instead of dissolved organic carbon it is also clear that even the current description of dormancy in lbios borrowed from blagodatsky and richter 1998 could be improved it assumes an absolute repression of biomass flows uptake mortality respiration when bacteria are all dormant such a description of dormancy is thus questionable as this approach idealizes metabolic capacities of microorganisms by considering transition to dormant state as perfectly efficient and a costless way to save carbon when it cannot be gained because of low resources evidence indicates however that resting life requires maintenance lennon and jones 2011 which is formalized in some other models for example in the models of kopnoka 1999 or manzoni et al 2014 describing biomass as two pools active and dormant dormant biomass is affected by maintenance or mortality flows like the active pool though with much smaller rates another aspect of the lbios model and indeed at this stage of all the microscopic scale models of soil microbial processes currently available is the neglect of sub resolution pores in ct images which could have a significant influence on bacterial metabolism as argued by baveye et al 2017 perhaps one should wait for some of these shortcomings to be alleviated to carry out more advanced uncertainty and sensitivity analyses using the key lessons learned in this article as a guide at that point 5 conclusions uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses were performed on modeling scenarios of a particular carbon dynamics model lbios in two complete factorial designs each factorial design was assigned to a particular version of the lbios model one including a variation of the physiological state dormancy of bacteria and the other using optimal microbial activity the scenarios took place in discrete 3d soil pore spaces obtained from computed tomography images uncertainty ranges were fixed for parameters describing the carbon dynamics module of lbios and for parameters describing the soil architecture heterogeneity the uncertainty analysis shows that the output variability associated to the uncertain input factors describing microbial metabolism can be as high as the total output variability associated to all uncertain factors when accessibility of resources to bacteria is high when accessibility is limiting the output variability associated with uncertainty of the input factors describing microbial metabolism is drastically reduced and total output variability is due predominantly to uncertainty of the input factors associated with soil architecture thus by using a thorough uncertainty and sensitivity analysis a more complex picture emerged than the one found by vogel et al 2015 where in the case of resources easily accessible to bacteria the influence of the biological factors on biodegradation kinetics is comparable to the influence of the physical factors the sensitivity analysis reveals that not only the doc variable as suggested by vogel et al 2015 but also the co 2 variable are appropriate macroscopic proxies to identify the parameters describing the heterogeneity of soil architecture as drivers of biodegradation kinetics whatever the model structure used however it also shows that model structure strongly impacts the identification of the key biological parameters responsible for the variability of model outputs acknowledgements the authors thank cédric nouguier for his help to port the lattice boltzmann module to openmp this

25262,arctic ecosystems exhibit functional convergence in net ecosystem exchange nee s of co2 response to light air temperature the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and leaf area index lai potentially simplifying predictions of climate change impacts on the arctic c cycle over space and time this convergence is hypothesized to be induced by tightly coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles but has never been explicitly tested we used model data fusion on a mass balance model i e the coupled carbon and nitrogen ccan to determine whether functional convergence in nee results from tightly coupled carbon c and nitrogen n cycles ccan captured a majority but not all of nee and ndvi observations across eight growing seasons and modis ndvi observations across a tundra latitudinal gradient in alaska the hypothesis of temporal functional convergence was challenged by model data disagreements for nee during shoulder seasons and low light the hypothesis of spatial functional convergence was challenged by the underestimation of ndvi in warm tundra ccan structure and parameter uncertainty analyses revealed that factors controlling leaf litter rate the proportion of n in leaves and net n mineralization rate are critical knowledge gaps in predicting pan arctic nee and ndvi in a future warmer climate keywords arctic lter nee ndvi coupled biogeochemical cycles 1 introduction arctic tundra ecosystems illustrate surprising convergence in the net uptake of co2 from the atmosphere i e the net ecosystem exchange of co2 nee despite large variability in soils climate and vegetation cover shaver et al 2007 2013 this functional convergence is demonstrated by the ability to accurately model the spatial and temporal dynamics in the net ecosystem exchange of co2 with a single functional response to light temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index a spectral reflectance based proxy of leaf area index lai shaver et al 2007 loranty et al 2011 shaver et al 2013 understanding functional convergence is important because it can simplify c cycling predictions in a rapidly changing environment and help determine whether increased temperatures will make the arctic a future c source or sink a limitation of the functional convergence model however is that it requires lai to predict nee which is often difficult to predict in ecosystem models hence a mechanistic understanding of c uptake and allocation to lai is needed to predict future carbon cycling with the functional convergence model in arctic ecosystems a simple and strong relationship exists between foliar n and canopy lai across a wide variety of tundra communities fig 1 this relationship arises as a unique emergent property at the plant community level and reflects both the strong n limitation in arctic systems and a stoichiometric n cost of producing canopy leaf area and increasing photosynthetic potential williams and rastetter 1999 van wijk et al 2005 this relationship is important because it may allow for the prediction of both lai and nee in the functional convergence model provided knowledge of n cycling arctic ecosystems are thought to have relatively closed n cycles where n internally recycles among biomass soil organic matter and available n pools due to the low rates of deposition runoff and mineralization of n shaver et al 1992 williams and rastetter 1999 pearce et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 n can impose substantial biological constraints on soil and plant c cycling that may contribute to the observed functionally convergent responses of nee to light temperature and lai consequently we hypothesize that coupled c and n cycling and functional convergence can be used to predict arctic nee and ndvi simple ecosystem models provide a means to further understand the dependence of functional convergence on tightly coupled tundra c and n cycles such models provide quantitative frameworks to corroborate or challenge our current understanding of ecosystems ågren and bosatta 1990 rastetter 2003 rastetter et al 2003 dietze et al 2013 agreement between models and data indicate a parsimonious understanding of ecosystem function while disagreement between models and data highlights gaps in model structure and current understanding rastetter et al 2003 rastetter 2017 assessing model data agreement is challenging however because uncertainty can be as large as the measurement itself model parameters regulating ecosystem processes can be biologically unrealistic and model parameters can offset one another through covariation resulting in correct model predictions for the wrong reasons raupach et al 2005 luo et al 2009 keenan et al 2011 one way to overcome these issues is to incorporate model and data uncertainty during parameterization through model data fusion williams et al 2005 keenan et al 2012 dietze et al 2013 lebauer et al 2013 model data fusion is an iterative technique used to find the best set of parameters that fit a proposed model to data with quantified uncertainties since model data fusion statistically characterizes both model and data uncertainty and incorporates biological constraints into model parameterization it provides a robust method to detect model data disagreements we used model data fusion with a simple mass balance model i e the coupled carbon and nitrogen model ccan to test the hypothesis that coupled c and n cycling and functional convergence can be used to predict arctic nee and ndvi we developed ccan instead of using other more commonly used c cycling models for several reasons first ccan s simplicity allowed us to avoid issues of overfitting and equalfinality that can limit process based understanding from more complex models second ccan s simplicity also allowed us to relate model processes to actual field measurements to constrain model parameters within realistic and biologically valid limits during ccan model data assimilation third ccan s simplicity allowed us to better diagnose processes that resulted in model data disagreements with statistical certainty and thus highlight ecosystem process that require further understanding lastly ccan is the only model to link the tight relationship between foliar n and lai in van wijk et al 2005 and williams and rastetter 1999 to the functional convergence in nee as proposed by shaver et al 2007 2013 further understanding how the functional convergence of arctic co2 fluxes is related to tightly coupled c and n cycles will not only help to predict tundra c cycling but also help constrain the responses of plants and soils to climate change 2 methods 2 1 research approach we developed and parameterized a coupled c and n mass balance model ccan using model data fusion with eddy covariance nee and daily ndvi our approach followed the code of best practices for model data fusion keenan et al 2011 by 1 quantifying measurement uncertainties 2 testing our model data fusion framework against synthetic data 3 assimilating multiple data sources i e ndvi and nee to estimate parameters 4 testing model output with independent observations 5 minimizing equifinality by choosing a simple model and carefully selecting free parameters and 6 incorporating quantified model and data uncertainties into model predictions our hypothesis was that coupled c and n cycling and functional convergence can be used to predict arctic nee and ndvi the test of this hypothesis is whether the ccan model using a single parameter set estimated with model data fusion can replicate the temporal and spatial dynamics of arctic nee and ndvi provided both model and measurement uncertainty the model and model data fusion code were written in r and can be found on a github page https github com kkremers ccan ms2016 git 2 2 ccan model ccan fig 2 is a spin off of the simple arctic model sam shaver et al 1992 in terms of its simplicity and n limitation on c fluxes ccan is consistent with the view of a relatively closed n cycle where n is internally recycled among biomass som and available n pools shaver et al 1992 williams and rastetter 1999 pearce et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 ccan was driven with daily light and air temperature and predicted daily nee lai and ndvi ccan equations and details can be found in the appendix and in table 1 but we will briefly describe the model framework in the following section ccan pools are plant biomass c and n soil organic matter som c and n and available n table 1 the functional convergence model for nee controlled c moving into and out of the system c inputs gpp were controlled by par and lai c is respired from biomass as autotrophic respiration ra which is controlled by temperature and lai and from som pools as heterotrophic respiration rh which is controlled by temperature alone lai is estimated by ccan using a linear relationship with total foliar n tfn that is sensitive to biomass n temperature and vegetation phenology williams and rastetter 1999 lai is converted to ndvi by inverting the exponential relationship derived from shaver et al 2007 and rocha and shaver 2009 equation 3 all parameters associated with the functional response of gpp ra and rh are derived from loranty et al 2011 which is a temporally scaled version of the original functional convergence model described in shaver et al 2007 along with the tight relationship between tfn and lai c and n cycles are coupled by several other processes in ccan both biomass c and n moved to soil organic matter som through a shared litterfall rate plant uptake of n from the available n pool is limited by root biomass c and the amount of available n net n mineralization net n transferred n from som to the available n pool and is sensitive to temperature the amount of som n and a net mineralization rate the available n pool also is influenced by smaller fluxes that included n deposition fixation and leaching whose rates are obtained from lter data shaver et al 2014 model data fusion estimated ccan parameters kplant litterrate uptakerate propnfol0 propnroots netnrate and q10 associated with the n cycle which were constrained by informed prior distributions from measurements ccan s coupled c and n cycles and the observed relationship between tfn and lai fig 1 also see table 1 2 3 available datasets meteorological measurements tower ndvi and uncertainty air temperature and par from the unburned anaktuvuk river fire eddy covariance site during the 2008 2015 growing seasons june august were used as environmental drivers for ccan model parameterization and temporal corroboration details on instrumentation site description data processing and quality control are described extensively elsewhere rocha and shaver 2009 2011a rocha and shaver 2011b wang et al 2012 jiang et al 2015 briefly the site was located in a homogenous 5 km2 patch of moist acidic tussock tundra approximately 40 km from the toolik lake lter station rocha and shaver 2011a wang et al 2012 winter gaps in air temperature and par were filled with toolik field station meteorological data located 40 km away daily average vapor pressure deficits vpd also were collected at the anaktuvuk tower during the growing season daily precipitation data were collected by the toolik lter half hourly reflected and incident par and shortwave radiation at the anaktuvuk tower were used to calculate daily averaged ndvi rocha and shaver 2009 tower ndvi represented a broadband derivation of ndvi and needed to be converted to a narrowband ndvi to apply the appropriate ndvi lai relationship this conversion was accomplished through a linear calibration between tower based ndvi and averaged ndvi spectroradiometer measurements n 80 taken within the footprint of the eddy covariance tower at bi monthly intervals from 2008 to 2015 see supplementary materials rocha and shaver 2009 ndvi uncertainty was estimated by comparing the scaled tower measurements to modis ndvi for the area encompassing the eddy covariance tower see supplementary materials 2 4 available datasets eddy covariance data gap filling and uncertainty eddy covariance derived nee from the unburned anaktuvuk river site during the 2008 2015 growing seasons june august were used to parameterize and corroborate ccan half hourly nee data were scaled to daily sums using quality control and gap filling techniques used by ameriflux and fluxnet reichstein et al 2012 data gaps were filled using a bulk nee light and temperature response function that was parameterized every day using an 11 day window with least squares regression nee gaps comprised 15 of the growing season measurement period with the longest gap lasting only a few days uncertainty in daily nee was quantified using a paired tower approach that compared nee from the unburned anaktuvuk site to nee from another site located less than 7 km away see supplementary materials hollinger and richardson 2005 richardson et al 2008 nee followed the meteorological sign convention with negative fluxes indicating co2 uptake and positive fluxes indicating co2 loss from the land surface 2 5 available datasets toolik lter data on soils and vegetation from the toolik lter were used to assign biologically valid maximum and minimum parameter values during model data fusion uniform prior distributions were established on all model parameters which were bounded by maximum and minimum values obtained in the field table 1 maximum and minimum net n mineralization netnrate rates were from a gradient of tundra community types within a snow fence

datasets modis ndvi and surface temperature from 32 tundra sites along a north south transect extending from 65 n to 70 n along alaska s dalton highway were used to corroborate ccan ndvi spatially three of the sites were located below 68 n and were tundra situated in the boreal region whereas the rest of the sites were situated north of alaska s brooks range this transect was chosen because it spanned a variety of tundra communities and soil conditions and because we have conducted detailed vegetation surveys at these sites the transect includes all vegetation communities found on the north slope of alaska and ranged from erect shrub tundra in the south acidic and non acidic graminoid tundra in the north slope foothills and wetland tundra in the far north modis ndvi mod13q1 8 day 250 m resolution and night and day surface temperatures mod11a2 8 day 1 km resolution were extracted for each site modis quality control flags were used to remove low quality data ccan was driven with daily interpolated par from the university of alaska s scenarios network for alaskan and arctic planning snap monthly 1 km resolution and daily interpolated modis average surface temperatures with a linear spline ccan pools were initialized with spatially explicit north slope som and biomass c and n data from jiang et al 2016 2017 and spun up with 2000 2010 growing season climatology to determine starting values at each site decadal average growing season 6 1 8 31 modis ndvi was compared to ccan ndvi and interannual variability in modis ndvi quantified measurement uncertainty at each site 2 7 model data fusion functional convergence hypothesizes that nee in all arctic tundra communities responds similarly to temperature light lai and ndvi throughout time hence ccan was parameterized using a batch model approach where parameters are estimated simultaneously from data and assumed to be static over space and time ccan was parameterized using a weighted least squares two step model data fusion based on keenan et al 2012 and richardson et al 2010 the routine was an adaptive markov chain monte carlo that used metropolis hastings sampling metropolis et al 1953 and incorporated measurement uncertainty into the parameterization allowing propagation of parameter uncertainty into model predictions prior distributions for the seven parameters estimated table 1 were assumed to be uniform the model data fusion algorithm was corroborated using synthetic nee and ndvi data from ccan parameters were then estimated using growing season nee and ndvi data from odd years i e 2009 2011 2013 and 2015 leaving data from even years i e 2008 2010 2012 2014 for ccan corroboration to assess goodness of fit of ccan to nee and ndvi we calculated an individual cost function j i as the total uncertainty weighted squared data model disagreement for each data type richardson et al 2010 eq 1 1 j i t 1 n i y i t p i t δ i t 2 where ni was the number of observations for data type i yi t was the data at time t pi t was the value predicted by the model and δi t was the measurement uncertainty in step one the best parameter set was determined by minimizing the overall cost function j which was the product of the individual cost functions richardson et al 2010 eq 2 treating all data equally by valuing relative improvements in goodness of fit richardson et al 2010 franks et al 1999 2 j i j i at each iteration parameters were randomly drawn from a normal distribution with mean equal to the previous parameter and standard deviation equal to a fraction of the initial parameter range that was adjusted to achieve an acceptance rate of 25 30 preventing the routine from getting stuck at local minima parameters that fell outside of their prior distribution were disregarded and re drawn to determine starting values for pools table 1 a model spin up was run for thirty years using decadal averaged daily forcing data the pool starting values for the model spin up were determined from previous publications jiang et al 2016 the model was run with the new parameter set and starting values and the cost functions were calculated the parameter space was explored in this manner until the overall cost function j stopped improving for 20 000 iterations in step two parameter uncertainty was estimated by exploring the parameter space around the parameter set that resulted in the smallest j in step one parameters were randomly drawn from a normal distribution with a mean equal to the best parameter and standard deviation held constant at the value from the end of step one uncertainty weighted data model disagreements were normalized based on the variance of the j s obtained in step one and parameter sets were only accepted if the cost function for each data steam j i passed a chi square test at 90 confidence which ensured that predictions were consistent with each data type franks et al 1999 richardson et al 2010 keenan et al 2012 step two was run until 1000 parameter sets were accepted providing distributions and uncertainty estimates for each parameter 2 8 residual analysis daily nee and ndvi residuals were calculated for the 2008 2015 growing seasons measured ccan for nee negative residuals occurred when ccan predicted less c uptake than measurements and positive residuals occurred when ccan predicted greater c uptake than measurements for ndvi negative residuals occurred when ccan overestimated ndvi and positive residuals occurred when ccan underestimated ndvi moving averages of these residuals were compared with associated measurement uncertainties of nee and ndvi and used to assess ccan prediction biases with time temperature par and vpd 2 9 sensitivity and variance decomposition analyses local and global sensitivity and variance decomposition analyses were conducted for all seven estimated parameters in ccan soetaert and petzoldt 2010 the local sensitivity analysis determined model sensitivity based solely on model structure whereas the global sensitivity analysis estimated 90 confidence intervals for ccan nee and ndvi from the quantified parameter uncertainties i e posterior distributions obtained with model data fusion local model sensitivity for each parameter s was quantified as the average change in model output per change in parameter δoutput δparameter multiplied by the size of the output and parameter values parameter output to treat all parameters equally ccan parameters were altered individually and a high average s indicated high sensitivity to model predictions for the global sensitivity analysis 90 confidence intervals for ccan predictions were obtained by simultaneously altering ccan parameters in accordance with their posterior distributions determined from model data fusion variance decomposition assessed the contribution of parameter uncertainty to ccan prediction uncertainty for variance decomposition each parameter was altered using their associated posterior distribution while the other model parameters were held constant at their statistical mean the variance in nee and ndvi was calculated after variance decomposition was accomplished 1000 times for each parameter parameters contributing larger amounts of variance into ccan predictions signified the most important and dominant processes within the model framework 3 results 3 1 meteorological data weather at the anaktuvuk site spanned a range of environmental conditions during the measurement period table 2 growing season length ranged from 119 to 139 days with above average growing season lengths in 2008 2010 and 2012 and below average growing season lengths in 2009 and 2015 table 2 2014 and 2008 were cool and wet growing seasons whereas 2011 was a cool and dry growing season 2012 and 2009 were warm and wet growing seasons whereas 2015 and 2010 were cold and wet growing seasons interannual variation in growing season par was small with a 0 08 coefficient of variation growing season vpd was highest in 2009 and lowest in 2011 with a 0 24 coefficient of variation 3 2 parameter estimation and covariation the majority of ccan parameters were uncorrelated with the exception of litterfall rate litterrate and net n mineralization rate netnrate and to a lesser extent litterrate and the proportion of n in foliage propn fol0 fig 3 model data fusion improved posterior distributions for all seven parameters with reductions in the 5th and 95th parameter interquartile ranges and a shift from uniform to approximately normally distributed histograms data not shown this constraint of all parameter posteriors illustrated that the nee and ndvi data were able to adequately inform ccan parameterization and improve predictions 3 3 temporal corroboration ccan captured the magnitudes and seasonal trends in measured nee and ndvi fig 4 a b both ccan and measured nee were positive in the shoulder seasons i e spring and fall and most negative during peak growing season fig 4a ccan and measured ndvi peaked between 0 6 and 0 7 and exhibited similar seasonality with increases in spring and declines in the fall fig 4b ccan nee explained 17 of the variance in measured nee for unassimilated years fig 4c and 77 of nee measurement and model uncertainties overlapped fig 4a overall nee rmse was 0 79 with a minimum of 0 52 in 2008 and a maximum of 0 94 in 2013 fig 4e nee rmse decreased when ccan was assessed at longer time steps fig 5 8 day 14 day and 30 day averaged nee had an rmse closer to 0 4 and 90 day averaged nee had an rmse of 0 18 fig 5 nee r2 increased to 0 6 for 8 day 14 day and 30 day time periods and decreased to 0 06 for 90 day averaged nee table 3 ccan ndvi explained 54 of the variance in measured ndvi for unassimilated years fig 4d and 85 of ndvi measurement and model uncertainties overlapped fig 4b overall ndvi rmse was 0 04 with a minimum of 0 03 in 2008 and a maximum of 0 06 in 2012 fig 4f ndvi rmse decreased as ccan was assessed at longer time steps with a minimum of 0 02 occurring for 90 day averaged ndvi fig 5 ndvi r2 slightly increased to 0 57 for 8 day 14 day and 30 day time periods and decreased to 0 03 for 90 day averaged ndvi seasonal bias in ccan nee occurred in both the spring and fall fig 6 a ccan predicted less c uptake than nee measurements in the spring and residuals fell below measurement uncertainty around day of year 180 fig 6a ccan also predicted greater c uptake than nee measurements in the fall and residuals fell above measurement uncertainty around day of year 280 fig 6a nee biases were unrelated to daily average air temperature with residuals within the measurement uncertainty bounds fig 6b however ccan nee biases occurred at low par and residuals fell below measurement uncertainty bounds when daily average par was lower than 20 mol m 2 day 1 fig 6c average nee residuals decreased with increasing daily average vpd and fell outside of the measurement uncertainty bounds just above a vpd of 1 25 kpa fig 6d ccan ndvi average residuals showed no bias across day of year daily average air temperature daily average par or daily average vpd fig 6e h average ndvi residuals fell within measurement uncertainty bounds and largely remained near zero fig 6e h average ndvi residuals illustrated a slight increase with doy throughout the growing season but never fell outside the measurement uncertainty bounds fig 6e 3 4 spatial corroboration ccan ndvi latitudinal trends followed a similar pattern to modis ndvi fig 7 a both ccan and modis ndvi were highest 0 6 at the low latitude 68 n and low elevation sites 69 n and lowest at high latitude sites 70 n fig 7a ccan and modis ndvi were significantly correlated with average growing season temperature but ccan exhibited a slightly lower temperature sensitivity than modis fig 7b consequently the greatest data model disagreement occurred at sites with high temperature and high ndvis fig 7a 3 5 ccan sensitivity and variance decomposition local sensitivity analysis revealed higher sensitivity of nee to model parameter changes than ndvi fig 8 a ccan nee and ndvi were most sensitive to changes in litter fall rate litterrate followed by the net n mineralization rate netnrate proportion of biomass n in foliage propnfol0 and the q10 of n mineralization fig 8a ccan nee and ndvi were less sensitive to changes in the half saturation of n uptake kplant n uptake rate uptakerate and proportion of n in roots propnroots than the other four parameters fig 8a in contrast with the local sensitivity analyses variance decomposition revealed that model data fusion constrained parameter ranges within biologically reasonable values resulting in different conclusions about ccan sensitivity fig 8b the uncertainty in the rate of net n mineralization netnrate introduced the greatest amount of annual variance into nee followed by the proportion of biomass n in foliage propnfol0 and litter fall rate litterrate fig 8b ndvi followed the opposite trend the uncertainty in litter fall rate litterrate introduced the greatest amount of annual variance followed by the proportion of biomass n in foliage propnfol0 and the rate of net n mineralization netnrate fig 8b the uncertainty in the q10 of n mineralization and the half saturation of n uptake contributed very little to the total annual variance in both nee and ndvi fig 8b 4 discussion ccan is a parsimonious model that provided a simple representation of arctic c and n cycling the model tested several hypotheses that have been put forth about predicting lai ndvi and nee from coupled c and n cycles williams and rastetter 1999 shaver et al 2013 ccan was based on the hypothesis of functional convergence that states that arctic nee can be predicted in both time and space with light air temperature and lai alone using a single response function i e parameter set shaver et al 2013 we extended the functional convergence hypothesis by including coupled c and n cycling model to predict lai ndvi and nee over time and space ccan excluded factors that are important for arctic c and n cycling such as varying response functions for different vegetation types soil moisture impacts on nee and n cycling and the impacts of microbial biomass on c and n cycling within multiple soil layers however despite the exclusion of these factors ccan performed well in capturing the latitudinal patterns in ndvi and performed similarly to other nee models i e loranty et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 ccan had higher predictive ability for ndvi than nee likely because nee is a complex flux that involves the response of ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis to environmental factors ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis are driven by both rapid changes to the environment and slower changing vegetation and soils it is clear that increasing the complexity of ccan s response to the environment would improve its performance however an increase in model complexity would stray from the framework of the functional convergence hypothesis model and hinder our ability to diagnose model data disagreements and highlight important processes and measurements that are needed to improve understanding of arctic c fluxes given the large landscape variability in edaphic biologic and climatic factors it may seem odd that such a parsimonious model could predict arctic ecosystem structure and function across north slope vegetation communities however the strong nitrogen limitation and dependence of c and n cycles on carbon inputs via photosynthesis likely impose strong stoichiometric constraints resulting in functional convergence as an emergent ecosystem property in arctic ecosystems nutrients are limited and primarily internally recycled because of high soil organic c and water content low soil ph cold temperatures and low atmospheric deposition shaver et al 2014 low soil n availability limits plant productivity leaf area soil c inputs and co2 fluxes because n controls the carboxylation capacity of photosynthesis and biomass litterfall production heskel et al 2012 street et al 2012 shaver et al 2014 the low soil n causes n to be recycled through the system via litterfall resulting in a relatively coupled c and n cycle these processes as well as the low arctic ecosystem diversity likely create stoichiometric limitations in tundra biogeochemistry that cause functional convergence in c and n cycles which are driven by the reorganization of c and n among ecosystem pools i e leaves woody tissue and soils along with insights into arctic c and n cycles and functional convergence in nee our analyses detected statistically significant model data disagreements that highlight knowledge gaps and areas for future research on arctic nee at the daily timescale ccan predicted less c uptake at low light levels than indicated by measurements fig 5c these observations may be evidence of important mechanisms such as the enhancement of photosynthesis under low light with high diffuse radiation or the inhibition of leaf respiration at low light i e the kok effect which are not included in the ccan light response function williams et al 2014 heskel et al 2013 at the seasonal timescale ccan highlighted a seasonal bias in nee predicting lower c uptake in the spring and lower c losses in the fall than indicated by measurements higher observed ndvi lai could be due to leaf physiological changes as photosynthesis decline with age bond 2000 in ccan only ndvi lai determines maximum photosynthetic rates as changes in leaf physiology are assumed temporally invariant in accordance with the functional convergence model in shaver et al 2007 the seasonal bias is not due to improper representation of lai since ndvi lai exhibited no such seasonal bias fig 5e changes in the q10 and basal ecosystem respiration rates is another process that is not included in ccan that may explain the late season bias in nee however the temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration is known to change seasonally from increased thaw depth and soil volume although these interpretations are somewhat speculative they are consistent with known ecophysiological process and highlight potential hypotheses that motivate increased understanding of arctic nee and its seasonal controls our analysis also provided insights into the longer term i e decadal ecosystem processes that are important for predicting the response of nee to future climate change by using a space for time approach with the 7 c latitudinal temperature gradient we identified functional differences in c and n cycling responses to the environment between tundra with low and high lai ccan under predicted ndvi in warm tundra ecosystems with lais 1 0 m2 m 2 indicating that these canopies likely deviate from the hypothesis of functional convergence in c and n cycling fig 6a c because ndvi is directly related to the prediction of nee through lai in the functional convergence model data model disagreements in ndvi also would carry over into estimates of nee in arctic tundra lai s above 1 0 are associated with increased vegetation height canopy complexity and shrub cover shrub tundra differs from graminoid tundra in a variety of ways with greater nutrient use efficiencies greater ecosystem respiration rates and greater allocation to woody tissues and leaves williams and rastetter 1999 parker et al 2015 koller et al 2016 the underprediction of ndvi in warm tundra with high lai in ccan indicates these systems form a distinct cohort that results in them deviating from the hypothesis of functional convergence in nee the implication of this result is that future warming will cause a detectable state shift in ecosystem structure and function that will have consequences for c and n coupling and cycling 4 1 what measurements are needed to improve ccan and our understanding of arctic c fluxes understanding the daily and seasonal controls on tundra nee will require improved measurements of canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration it is unlikely that nee alone can provide such understanding as the long arctic photo period and measurement limitations challenge partitioning nee into canopy photosynthesis and hetero and auto trophic respiration rather small scale leaf photosynthesis and soil respiration measurements throughout the growing season could be used in conjunction with nee measurements to improve and quantify flux partitioning uncertainties in the arctic moreover proxies of canopy photosynthesis such as the solar induced florescence isotopic 13c 18o or other trace gas fluxes carbonyl sulfide cos may further aide in constraining nee partitioning at the ecosystem scale asaf et al 2013 baldocchi 2014 saleska et al 2006 yang et al 2015 other measures such as ecosystem c and n stocks turnover times and allocation are likely to be dependent on community composition and may help to disentangle plant versus soil responses to the environment it is clear from this work that combining multiple measures of ecosystem processes within an analytical framework provides a powerful tool for constraining and further understanding arctic ecosystem function understanding the spatial controls on arctic nee will require improved knowledge of the biotic and abiotic controls on leaf area and ndvi in tundra ecosystems disentangling the ecological mechanisms driving high lai in tundra ecosystems is critically important as climate change will drive ecosystems into more productive states myers smith et al 2011 ccan suggests that tundra nee and ndvi are driven more by changes in allocation and turnover rather than biochemical efficiencies associated with plants and microbes fig 7 for example factors that regulated the efficiency of plant nutrient use kplant and microbial temperature responses q10 contributed less variance into nee and ndvi predictions than the factors regulating turnover and allocation of c and n i e litterrate propn fol0 netnrate fig 7 litterrate likely explained much of the variability in ndvi because the closed n cycle in ccan required faster n cycling to support greater lai this suggests that warming and shifts in arctic species composition will increase c and n cycling rates among pools i e decrease residence time and provides motivation for pulse chase experiments with 14c 13c and 15n in high and low lai tundra canopies peterson and fry 1987 carbone et al 2007 such experiments will yield insight into the impact of c and n allocation turnover and plant nutrient use efficiencies on arctic nee and ndvi that can be used to constrain these processes in biogeochemical models 4 2 conclusions and implications we developed a parsimonious model which included a mass balance of c and n among pools and coupled c and n cycles to predict nee lai and ndvi the governing framework of ccan included the functional convergence model of shaver et al 2007 and shaver et al 2013 and the tight coupling between leaf n and lai through a closed coupled c and n cycle ccan performed much better in predicting spatial patterns in ndvi and lai than predicting temporal variability in nee model sensitivity analyses indicated that the inclusion of field measurements reduced model uncertainty and that better understanding of the factors controlling leaf litter rate the proportion of n in leaves and the net n mineralization rate would improve ccan s predictions our implementation of model data fusion with ccan allowed us to diagnose model data disagreements that were outside of field measurements and model uncertainty and identify important processes that are missing from such a parsimonious approach in this case ccan served more as a hypothesis on how the system works conceptually rather than serving solely as a predictive tool understanding where and when a model fails can result in further mechanistic understanding and highlight significant knowledge gaps provided that the uncertainty in the measurements and models are properly quantified moreover our approach also allowed us to incorporate diverse datasets such as from the arctic lter to help inform biologically realistic parameter values such an approach could be used elsewhere and it is clear that using model data fusion for model parameterization is ideal for gaining a greater understanding of ecological systems through modeling there have been and will continue to be changes in species composition and canopy structure as northern latitudes warm goetz et al 2005 myers smith et al 2011 many of these changes are happening at rates faster than we can measure them hence developing models that can forecast these changes remains a high priority for justifying measurement campaigns in global change biology research this study highlights a further need to understand the biotic and abiotic factors controlling the component fluxes of nee i e photosynthesis autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration as well as c and n cycling in warm tundra ecosystems with high leaf area our model data comparison also emphasized a need to understand how temperature influences plant c allocation and ecosystem c and n turnover in tundra with high lai and warm climates this is important because c and n fluxes and cycling in these systems is poorly understood a search on ameriflux reveals an underrepresentation of arctic nee measurements from warm shrub tundra sites further validation of ccan in shrub tundra would be needed to determine the reason the model performed poorly in these systems improved understanding of such systems will determine whether the vegetation response to climate change will offset c losses from thawing permafrost stieglitz et al 2006 hicks pries et al 2013 schuur et al

25262,arctic ecosystems exhibit functional convergence in net ecosystem exchange nee s of co2 response to light air temperature the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and leaf area index lai potentially simplifying predictions of climate change impacts on the arctic c cycle over space and time this convergence is hypothesized to be induced by tightly coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles but has never been explicitly tested we used model data fusion on a mass balance model i e the coupled carbon and nitrogen ccan to determine whether functional convergence in nee results from tightly coupled carbon c and nitrogen n cycles ccan captured a majority but not all of nee and ndvi observations across eight growing seasons and modis ndvi observations across a tundra latitudinal gradient in alaska the hypothesis of temporal functional convergence was challenged by model data disagreements for nee during shoulder seasons and low light the hypothesis of spatial functional convergence was challenged by the underestimation of ndvi in warm tundra ccan structure and parameter uncertainty analyses revealed that factors controlling leaf litter rate the proportion of n in leaves and net n mineralization rate are critical knowledge gaps in predicting pan arctic nee and ndvi in a future warmer climate keywords arctic lter nee ndvi coupled biogeochemical cycles 1 introduction arctic tundra ecosystems illustrate surprising convergence in the net uptake of co2 from the atmosphere i e the net ecosystem exchange of co2 nee despite large variability in soils climate and vegetation cover shaver et al 2007 2013 this functional convergence is demonstrated by the ability to accurately model the spatial and temporal dynamics in the net ecosystem exchange of co2 with a single functional response to light temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index a spectral reflectance based proxy of leaf area index lai shaver et al 2007 loranty et al 2011 shaver et al 2013 understanding functional convergence is important because it can simplify c cycling predictions in a rapidly changing environment and help determine whether increased temperatures will make the arctic a future c source or sink a limitation of the functional convergence model however is that it requires lai to predict nee which is often difficult to predict in ecosystem models hence a mechanistic understanding of c uptake and allocation to lai is needed to predict future carbon cycling with the functional convergence model in arctic ecosystems a simple and strong relationship exists between foliar n and canopy lai across a wide variety of tundra communities fig 1 this relationship arises as a unique emergent property at the plant community level and reflects both the strong n limitation in arctic systems and a stoichiometric n cost of producing canopy leaf area and increasing photosynthetic potential williams and rastetter 1999 van wijk et al 2005 this relationship is important because it may allow for the prediction of both lai and nee in the functional convergence model provided knowledge of n cycling arctic ecosystems are thought to have relatively closed n cycles where n internally recycles among biomass soil organic matter and available n pools due to the low rates of deposition runoff and mineralization of n shaver et al 1992 williams and rastetter 1999 pearce et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 n can impose substantial biological constraints on soil and plant c cycling that may contribute to the observed functionally convergent responses of nee to light temperature and lai consequently we hypothesize that coupled c and n cycling and functional convergence can be used to predict arctic nee and ndvi simple ecosystem models provide a means to further understand the dependence of functional convergence on tightly coupled tundra c and n cycles such models provide quantitative frameworks to corroborate or challenge our current understanding of ecosystems ågren and bosatta 1990 rastetter 2003 rastetter et al 2003 dietze et al 2013 agreement between models and data indicate a parsimonious understanding of ecosystem function while disagreement between models and data highlights gaps in model structure and current understanding rastetter et al 2003 rastetter 2017 assessing model data agreement is challenging however because uncertainty can be as large as the measurement itself model parameters regulating ecosystem processes can be biologically unrealistic and model parameters can offset one another through covariation resulting in correct model predictions for the wrong reasons raupach et al 2005 luo et al 2009 keenan et al 2011 one way to overcome these issues is to incorporate model and data uncertainty during parameterization through model data fusion williams et al 2005 keenan et al 2012 dietze et al 2013 lebauer et al 2013 model data fusion is an iterative technique used to find the best set of parameters that fit a proposed model to data with quantified uncertainties since model data fusion statistically characterizes both model and data uncertainty and incorporates biological constraints into model parameterization it provides a robust method to detect model data disagreements we used model data fusion with a simple mass balance model i e the coupled carbon and nitrogen model ccan to test the hypothesis that coupled c and n cycling and functional convergence can be used to predict arctic nee and ndvi we developed ccan instead of using other more commonly used c cycling models for several reasons first ccan s simplicity allowed us to avoid issues of overfitting and equalfinality that can limit process based understanding from more complex models second ccan s simplicity also allowed us to relate model processes to actual field measurements to constrain model parameters within realistic and biologically valid limits during ccan model data assimilation third ccan s simplicity allowed us to better diagnose processes that resulted in model data disagreements with statistical certainty and thus highlight ecosystem process that require further understanding lastly ccan is the only model to link the tight relationship between foliar n and lai in van wijk et al 2005 and williams and rastetter 1999 to the functional convergence in nee as proposed by shaver et al 2007 2013 further understanding how the functional convergence of arctic co2 fluxes is related to tightly coupled c and n cycles will not only help to predict tundra c cycling but also help constrain the responses of plants and soils to climate change 2 methods 2 1 research approach we developed and parameterized a coupled c and n mass balance model ccan using model data fusion with eddy covariance nee and daily ndvi our approach followed the code of best practices for model data fusion keenan et al 2011 by 1 quantifying measurement uncertainties 2 testing our model data fusion framework against synthetic data 3 assimilating multiple data sources i e ndvi and nee to estimate parameters 4 testing model output with independent observations 5 minimizing equifinality by choosing a simple model and carefully selecting free parameters and 6 incorporating quantified model and data uncertainties into model predictions our hypothesis was that coupled c and n cycling and functional convergence can be used to predict arctic nee and ndvi the test of this hypothesis is whether the ccan model using a single parameter set estimated with model data fusion can replicate the temporal and spatial dynamics of arctic nee and ndvi provided both model and measurement uncertainty the model and model data fusion code were written in r and can be found on a github page https github com kkremers ccan ms2016 git 2 2 ccan model ccan fig 2 is a spin off of the simple arctic model sam shaver et al 1992 in terms of its simplicity and n limitation on c fluxes ccan is consistent with the view of a relatively closed n cycle where n is internally recycled among biomass som and available n pools shaver et al 1992 williams and rastetter 1999 pearce et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 ccan was driven with daily light and air temperature and predicted daily nee lai and ndvi ccan equations and details can be found in the appendix and in table 1 but we will briefly describe the model framework in the following section ccan pools are plant biomass c and n soil organic matter som c and n and available n table 1 the functional convergence model for nee controlled c moving into and out of the system c inputs gpp were controlled by par and lai c is respired from biomass as autotrophic respiration ra which is controlled by temperature and lai and from som pools as heterotrophic respiration rh which is controlled by temperature alone lai is estimated by ccan using a linear relationship with total foliar n tfn that is sensitive to biomass n temperature and vegetation phenology williams and rastetter 1999 lai is converted to ndvi by inverting the exponential relationship derived from shaver et al 2007 and rocha and shaver 2009 equation 3 all parameters associated with the functional response of gpp ra and rh are derived from loranty et al 2011 which is a temporally scaled version of the original functional convergence model described in shaver et al 2007 along with the tight relationship between tfn and lai c and n cycles are coupled by several other processes in ccan both biomass c and n moved to soil organic matter som through a shared litterfall rate plant uptake of n from the available n pool is limited by root biomass c and the amount of available n net n mineralization net n transferred n from som to the available n pool and is sensitive to temperature the amount of som n and a net mineralization rate the available n pool also is influenced by smaller fluxes that included n deposition fixation and leaching whose rates are obtained from lter data shaver et al 2014 model data fusion estimated ccan parameters kplant litterrate uptakerate propnfol0 propnroots netnrate and q10 associated with the n cycle which were constrained by informed prior distributions from measurements ccan s coupled c and n cycles and the observed relationship between tfn and lai fig 1 also see table 1 2 3 available datasets meteorological measurements tower ndvi and uncertainty air temperature and par from the unburned anaktuvuk river fire eddy covariance site during the 2008 2015 growing seasons june august were used as environmental drivers for ccan model parameterization and

2012 jiang et al 2015 briefly the site was located in a homogenous 5 km2 patch of moist acidic tussock tundra approximately 40 km from the toolik lake lter station rocha and shaver 2011a wang et al 2012 winter gaps in air temperature and par were filled with toolik field station meteorological data located 40 km away daily average vapor pressure deficits vpd also were collected at the anaktuvuk tower during the growing season daily precipitation data were collected by the toolik lter half hourly reflected and incident par and shortwave radiation at the anaktuvuk tower were used to calculate daily averaged ndvi rocha and shaver 2009 tower ndvi represented a broadband derivation of ndvi and needed to be converted to a narrowband ndvi to apply the appropriate ndvi lai relationship this conversion was accomplished through a linear calibration between tower based ndvi and averaged ndvi spectroradiometer measurements n 80 taken within the footprint of the eddy covariance tower at bi monthly intervals from 2008 to 2015 see supplementary materials rocha and shaver 2009 ndvi uncertainty was estimated by comparing the scaled tower measurements to modis ndvi for the area encompassing the eddy covariance tower see supplementary materials 2 4 available datasets eddy covariance data gap filling and uncertainty eddy covariance derived nee from the unburned anaktuvuk river site during the 2008 2015 growing seasons june august were used to parameterize and corroborate ccan half hourly nee data were scaled to daily sums using quality control and gap filling techniques used by ameriflux and fluxnet reichstein et al 2012 data gaps were filled using a bulk nee light and temperature response function that was parameterized every day using an 11 day window with least squares regression nee gaps comprised 15 of the growing season measurement period with the longest gap lasting only a few days uncertainty in daily nee was quantified using a paired tower approach that compared nee from the unburned anaktuvuk site to nee from another site located less than 7 km away see supplementary materials hollinger and richardson 2005 richardson et al 2008 nee followed the meteorological sign convention with negative fluxes indicating co2 uptake and positive fluxes indicating co2 loss from the land surface 2 5 available datasets toolik lter data on soils and vegetation from the toolik lter were used to assign biologically valid maximum and minimum parameter values during model data fusion uniform prior distributions were established on all model parameters which were bounded by maximum and minimum values obtained in the field table 1 maximum and minimum net n mineralization netnrate rates were from a gradient of tundra community types within a snow fence

litterrate uptakerate and q10 were obtained from tussock tundra at or near toolik field station hobbie 1999 leadley et al 1997 mclaughlin et al 2014 the temperature sensitivity of the proportion of biomass n in foliage α was determined with the lter greenhouse experimental plots which warmed air temperatures by 5 6 c shaver 1998 α was calculated as the biomass weighted average temperature

datasets modis ndvi and surface temperature from 32 tundra sites along a north south transect extending from 65 n to 70 n along alaska s dalton highway were used to corroborate ccan ndvi spatially three of the sites were located below 68 n and were tundra situated in the boreal region whereas the rest of the sites were situated north of alaska s brooks range this transect was chosen because it spanned a variety of tundra communities and soil conditions and because we have conducted detailed vegetation surveys at these sites the transect includes all vegetation communities found on the north slope of alaska and ranged from erect shrub tundra in the south acidic and non acidic graminoid tundra in the north slope foothills and wetland tundra in the far north modis ndvi mod13q1 8 day 250 m resolution and night and day surface temperatures mod11a2 8 day 1 km resolution were extracted for each site modis quality control flags were used to remove low quality data ccan was driven with daily interpolated par from the university of alaska s scenarios network for alaskan and arctic planning snap monthly 1 km resolution and daily interpolated modis average surface temperatures with a linear spline ccan pools were initialized with spatially explicit north slope som and biomass c and n data from jiang et al 2016 2017 and spun up with 2000 2010 growing season climatology to determine starting values at each site decadal average growing season 6 1 8 31 modis ndvi was compared to ccan ndvi and interannual variability in modis ndvi quantified measurement uncertainty at each site 2 7 model data fusion functional convergence hypothesizes that nee in all arctic tundra communities responds similarly to temperature light lai and ndvi throughout time hence ccan was parameterized using a batch model approach where parameters are estimated simultaneously from data and assumed to be static over space and time ccan was parameterized using a weighted least squares two step model data fusion based on keenan et al 2012 and richardson et al 2010 the routine was an adaptive markov chain monte carlo that used metropolis hastings sampling metropolis et al 1953 and incorporated measurement uncertainty into the parameterization allowing propagation of parameter uncertainty into model predictions prior distributions for the seven parameters estimated table 1 were assumed to be uniform the model data fusion algorithm was corroborated using synthetic nee and ndvi data from ccan parameters were then estimated using growing season nee and ndvi data from odd years i e 2009 2011 2013 and 2015 leaving data from even years i e 2008 2010 2012 2014 for ccan corroboration to assess goodness of fit of ccan to nee and ndvi we calculated an individual cost function j i as the total uncertainty weighted squared data model disagreement for each data type richardson et al 2010 eq 1 1 j i t 1 n i y i t p i t δ i t 2 where ni was the number of observations for data type i yi t was the data at time t pi t was the value predicted by the model and δi t was the measurement uncertainty in step one the best parameter set was determined by minimizing the overall cost function j which was the product of the individual cost functions richardson et al 2010 eq 2 treating all data equally by valuing relative improvements in goodness of fit richardson et al 2010 franks et al 1999 2 j i j i at each iteration parameters were randomly drawn from a normal distribution with mean equal to the previous parameter and standard deviation equal to a fraction of the initial parameter range that was adjusted to achieve an acceptance rate of 25 30 preventing the routine from getting stuck at local minima parameters that fell outside of their prior distribution were disregarded and re drawn to determine starting values for pools table 1 a model spin up was run for thirty years using decadal averaged daily forcing data the pool starting values for the model spin up were determined from previous publications jiang et al 2016 the model was run with the new parameter set and starting values and the cost functions were calculated the parameter space was explored in this manner until the overall cost function j stopped improving for 20 000 iterations in step two parameter uncertainty was estimated by exploring the parameter space around the parameter set that resulted in the smallest j in step one parameters were randomly drawn from a normal distribution with a mean equal to the best parameter and standard deviation held constant at the value from the end of step one uncertainty weighted data model disagreements were normalized based on the variance of the j s obtained in step one and parameter sets were only accepted if the cost function for each data steam j i passed a chi square test at 90 confidence which ensured that predictions were consistent with each data type franks et al 1999 richardson et al 2010 keenan et al 2012 step two was run until 1000 parameter sets were accepted providing distributions and uncertainty estimates for each parameter 2 8 residual analysis daily nee and ndvi residuals were calculated for the 2008 2015 growing seasons measured ccan for nee negative residuals occurred when ccan predicted less c uptake than measurements and positive residuals occurred when ccan predicted greater c uptake than measurements for ndvi negative residuals occurred when ccan overestimated ndvi and positive residuals occurred when ccan underestimated ndvi moving averages of these residuals were compared with associated measurement uncertainties of nee and ndvi and used to assess ccan prediction biases with time temperature par and vpd 2 9 sensitivity and variance decomposition analyses local and global sensitivity and variance decomposition analyses were conducted for all seven estimated parameters in ccan soetaert and petzoldt 2010 the local sensitivity analysis determined model sensitivity based solely on model structure whereas the global sensitivity analysis estimated 90 confidence intervals for ccan nee and ndvi from the quantified parameter uncertainties i e posterior distributions obtained with model data fusion local model sensitivity for each parameter s was quantified as the average change in model output per change in parameter δoutput δparameter multiplied by the size of the output and parameter values parameter output to treat all parameters equally ccan parameters were altered individually and a high average s indicated high sensitivity to model predictions for the global sensitivity analysis 90 confidence intervals for ccan predictions were obtained by simultaneously altering ccan parameters in accordance with their posterior distributions determined from model data fusion variance decomposition assessed the contribution of parameter uncertainty to ccan prediction uncertainty for variance decomposition each parameter was altered using their associated posterior distribution while the other model parameters were held constant at their statistical mean the variance in nee and ndvi was calculated after variance decomposition was accomplished 1000 times for each parameter parameters contributing larger amounts of variance into ccan predictions signified the most important and dominant processes within the model framework 3 results 3 1 meteorological data weather at the anaktuvuk site spanned a range of environmental conditions during the measurement period table 2 growing season length ranged from 119 to 139 days with above average growing season lengths in 2008 2010 and 2012 and below average growing season lengths in 2009 and 2015 table 2 2014 and 2008 were cool and wet growing seasons whereas 2011 was a cool and dry growing season 2012 and 2009 were warm and wet growing seasons whereas 2015 and 2010 were cold and wet growing seasons interannual variation in growing season par was small with a 0 08 coefficient of variation growing season vpd was highest in 2009 and lowest in 2011 with a 0 24 coefficient of variation 3 2 parameter estimation and covariation the majority of ccan parameters were uncorrelated with the exception of litterfall rate litterrate and net n mineralization rate netnrate and to a lesser extent litterrate and the proportion of n in foliage propn fol0 fig 3 model data fusion improved posterior distributions for all seven parameters with reductions in the 5th and 95th parameter interquartile ranges and a shift from uniform to approximately normally distributed histograms data not shown this constraint of all parameter posteriors illustrated that the nee and ndvi data were able to adequately inform ccan parameterization and improve predictions 3 3 temporal corroboration ccan captured the magnitudes and seasonal trends in measured nee and ndvi fig 4 a b both ccan and measured nee were positive in the shoulder seasons i e spring and fall and most negative during peak growing season fig 4a ccan and measured ndvi peaked between 0 6 and 0 7 and exhibited similar seasonality with increases in spring and declines in the fall fig 4b ccan nee explained 17 of the variance in measured nee for unassimilated years fig 4c and 77 of nee measurement and model uncertainties overlapped fig 4a overall nee rmse was 0 79 with a minimum of 0 52 in 2008 and a maximum of 0 94 in 2013 fig 4e nee rmse decreased when ccan was assessed at longer time steps fig 5 8 day 14 day and 30 day averaged nee had an rmse closer to 0 4 and 90 day averaged nee had an rmse of 0 18 fig 5 nee r2 increased to 0 6 for 8 day 14 day and 30 day time periods and decreased to 0 06 for 90 day averaged nee table 3 ccan ndvi explained 54 of the variance in measured ndvi for unassimilated years fig 4d and 85 of ndvi measurement and model uncertainties overlapped fig 4b overall ndvi rmse was 0 04 with a minimum of 0 03 in 2008 and a maximum of 0 06 in 2012 fig 4f ndvi rmse decreased as ccan was assessed at longer time steps with a minimum of 0 02 occurring for 90 day averaged ndvi fig 5 ndvi r2 slightly increased to 0 57 for 8 day 14 day and 30 day time periods and decreased to 0 03 for 90 day averaged ndvi seasonal bias in ccan nee occurred in both the spring and fall fig 6 a ccan predicted less c uptake than nee measurements in the spring and residuals fell below measurement uncertainty around day of year 180 fig 6a ccan also predicted greater c uptake than nee measurements in the fall and residuals fell above measurement uncertainty around day of year 280 fig 6a nee biases were unrelated to daily average air temperature with residuals within the measurement uncertainty bounds fig 6b however ccan nee biases occurred at low par and residuals fell below measurement uncertainty bounds when daily average par was lower than 20 mol m 2 day 1 fig 6c average nee residuals decreased with increasing daily average vpd and fell outside of the measurement uncertainty bounds just above a vpd of 1 25 kpa fig 6d ccan ndvi average residuals showed no bias across day of year daily average air temperature daily average par or daily average vpd fig 6e h average ndvi residuals fell within measurement uncertainty bounds and largely remained near zero fig 6e h average ndvi residuals illustrated a slight increase with doy throughout the growing season but never fell outside the measurement uncertainty bounds fig 6e 3 4 spatial corroboration ccan ndvi latitudinal trends followed a similar pattern to modis ndvi fig 7 a both ccan and modis ndvi were highest 0 6 at the low latitude 68 n and low elevation sites 69 n and lowest at high latitude sites 70 n fig 7a ccan and modis ndvi were significantly correlated with average growing season temperature but ccan exhibited a slightly lower temperature sensitivity than modis fig 7b consequently the greatest data model disagreement occurred at sites with high temperature and high ndvis fig 7a 3 5 ccan sensitivity and variance decomposition local sensitivity analysis revealed higher sensitivity of nee to model parameter changes than ndvi fig 8 a ccan nee and ndvi were most sensitive to changes in litter fall rate litterrate followed by the net n mineralization rate netnrate proportion of biomass n in foliage propnfol0 and the q10 of n mineralization fig 8a ccan nee and ndvi were less sensitive to changes in the half saturation of n uptake kplant n uptake rate uptakerate and proportion of n in roots propnroots than the other four parameters fig 8a in contrast with the local sensitivity analyses variance decomposition revealed that model data fusion constrained parameter ranges within biologically reasonable values resulting in different conclusions about ccan sensitivity fig 8b the uncertainty in the rate of net n mineralization netnrate introduced the greatest amount of annual variance into nee followed by the proportion of biomass n in foliage propnfol0 and litter fall rate litterrate fig 8b ndvi followed the opposite trend the uncertainty in litter fall rate litterrate introduced the greatest amount of annual variance followed by the proportion of biomass n in foliage propnfol0 and the rate of net n mineralization netnrate fig 8b the uncertainty in the q10 of n mineralization and the half saturation of n uptake contributed very little to the total annual variance in both nee and ndvi fig 8b 4 discussion ccan is a parsimonious model that provided a simple representation of arctic c and n cycling the model tested several hypotheses that have been put forth about predicting lai ndvi and nee from coupled c and n cycles williams and rastetter 1999 shaver et al 2013 ccan was based on the hypothesis of functional convergence that states that arctic nee can be predicted in both time and space with light air temperature and lai alone using a single response function i e parameter set shaver et al 2013 we extended the functional convergence hypothesis by including coupled c and n cycling model to predict lai ndvi and nee over time and space ccan excluded factors that are important for arctic c and n cycling such as varying response functions for different vegetation types soil moisture impacts on nee and n cycling and the impacts of microbial biomass on c and n cycling within multiple soil layers however despite the exclusion of these factors ccan performed well in capturing the latitudinal patterns in ndvi and performed similarly to other nee models i e loranty et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 ccan had higher predictive ability for ndvi than nee likely because nee is a complex flux that involves the response of ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis to environmental factors ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis are driven by both rapid changes to the environment and slower changing vegetation and soils it is clear that increasing the complexity of ccan s response to the environment would improve its performance however an increase in model complexity would stray from the framework of the functional convergence hypothesis model and hinder our ability to diagnose model data disagreements and highlight important processes and measurements that are needed to improve understanding of arctic c fluxes given the large landscape variability in edaphic biologic and climatic factors it may seem odd that such a parsimonious model could predict arctic ecosystem structure and function across north slope vegetation communities however the strong nitrogen limitation and dependence of c and n cycles on carbon inputs via photosynthesis likely impose strong stoichiometric constraints resulting in functional convergence as an emergent ecosystem property in arctic ecosystems nutrients are limited and primarily internally recycled because of high soil organic c and water content low soil ph cold temperatures and low atmospheric deposition shaver et al 2014 low soil n availability limits plant productivity leaf area soil c inputs and co2 fluxes because n controls the carboxylation capacity of photosynthesis and biomass litterfall production heskel et al 2012 street et al 2012 shaver et al 2014 the low soil n causes n to be recycled through the system via litterfall resulting in a relatively coupled c and n cycle these processes as well as the low arctic ecosystem diversity likely create stoichiometric limitations in tundra biogeochemistry that cause functional convergence in c and n cycles which are driven by the reorganization of c and n among ecosystem pools i e leaves woody tissue and soils along with insights into arctic c and n cycles and functional convergence in nee our analyses detected statistically significant model data disagreements that highlight knowledge gaps and areas for future research on arctic nee at the daily timescale ccan predicted less c uptake at low light levels than indicated by measurements fig 5c these observations may be evidence of important mechanisms such as the enhancement of photosynthesis under low light with high diffuse radiation or the inhibition of leaf respiration at low light i e the kok effect which are not included in the ccan light response function williams et al 2014 heskel et al 2013 at the seasonal timescale ccan highlighted a seasonal bias in nee predicting lower c uptake in the spring and lower c losses in the fall than indicated by measurements higher observed ndvi lai could be due to leaf physiological changes as photosynthesis decline with age bond 2000 in ccan only ndvi lai determines maximum photosynthetic rates as changes in leaf physiology are assumed temporally invariant in accordance with the functional convergence model in shaver et al 2007 the seasonal bias is not due to improper representation of lai since ndvi lai exhibited no such seasonal bias fig 5e changes in the q10 and basal ecosystem respiration rates is another process that is not included in ccan that may explain the late season bias in nee however the temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration is known to change seasonally from increased thaw depth and soil volume although these interpretations are somewhat speculative they are consistent with known ecophysiological process and highlight potential hypotheses that motivate increased understanding of arctic nee and its seasonal controls our analysis also provided insights into the longer term i e decadal ecosystem processes that are important for predicting the response of nee to future climate change by using a space for time approach with the 7 c latitudinal temperature gradient we identified functional differences in c and n cycling responses to the environment between tundra with low and high lai ccan under predicted ndvi in warm tundra ecosystems with lais 1 0 m2 m 2 indicating that these canopies likely deviate from the hypothesis of functional convergence in c and n cycling fig 6a c because ndvi is directly related to the prediction of nee through lai in the functional convergence model data model disagreements in ndvi also would carry over into estimates of nee in arctic tundra lai s above 1 0 are associated with increased vegetation height canopy complexity and shrub cover shrub tundra differs from graminoid tundra in a variety of ways with greater nutrient use efficiencies greater ecosystem respiration rates and greater allocation to woody tissues and leaves williams and rastetter 1999 parker et al 2015 koller et al 2016 the underprediction of ndvi in warm tundra with high lai in ccan indicates these systems form a distinct cohort that results in them deviating from the hypothesis of functional convergence in nee the implication of this result is that future warming will cause a detectable state shift in ecosystem structure and function that will have consequences for c and n coupling and cycling 4 1 what measurements are needed to improve ccan and our understanding of arctic c fluxes understanding the daily and seasonal controls on tundra nee will require improved measurements of canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration it is unlikely that nee alone can provide such understanding as the long arctic photo period and measurement limitations challenge partitioning nee into canopy photosynthesis and hetero and auto trophic respiration rather small scale leaf photosynthesis and soil respiration measurements throughout the growing season could be used in conjunction with nee measurements to improve and quantify flux partitioning uncertainties in the arctic moreover proxies of canopy photosynthesis such as the solar induced florescence isotopic 13c 18o or other trace gas fluxes carbonyl sulfide cos may further aide in constraining nee partitioning at the ecosystem scale asaf et al 2013 baldocchi 2014 saleska et al 2006 yang et al 2015 other measures such as ecosystem c and n stocks turnover times and allocation are likely to be dependent on community composition and may help to disentangle plant versus soil responses to the environment it is clear from this work that combining multiple measures of ecosystem processes within an analytical framework provides a powerful tool for constraining and further understanding arctic ecosystem function understanding the spatial controls on arctic nee will require improved knowledge of the biotic and abiotic controls on leaf area and ndvi in tundra ecosystems disentangling the ecological mechanisms driving high lai in tundra ecosystems is critically important as climate change will drive ecosystems into more productive states myers smith et al 2011 ccan suggests that tundra nee and ndvi are driven more by changes in allocation and turnover rather than biochemical efficiencies associated with plants and microbes fig 7 for example factors that regulated the efficiency of plant nutrient use kplant and microbial temperature responses q10 contributed less variance into nee and ndvi predictions than the factors regulating turnover and allocation of c and n i e litterrate propn fol0 netnrate fig 7 litterrate likely explained much of the variability in ndvi because the closed n cycle in ccan required faster n cycling to support greater lai this suggests that warming and shifts in arctic species composition will increase c and n cycling rates among pools i e decrease residence time and provides motivation for pulse chase experiments with 14c 13c and 15n in high and low lai tundra canopies peterson and fry 1987 carbone et al 2007 such experiments will yield insight into the impact of c and n allocation turnover and plant nutrient use efficiencies on arctic nee and ndvi that can be used to constrain these processes in biogeochemical models 4 2 conclusions and implications we developed a parsimonious model which included a mass balance of c and n among pools and coupled c and n cycles to predict nee lai and ndvi the governing framework of ccan included the functional convergence model of shaver et al 2007 and shaver et al 2013 and the tight coupling between leaf n and lai through a closed coupled c and n cycle ccan performed much better in predicting spatial patterns in ndvi and lai than predicting temporal variability in nee model sensitivity analyses indicated that the inclusion of field measurements reduced model uncertainty and that better understanding of the factors controlling leaf litter rate the proportion of n in leaves and the net n mineralization rate would improve ccan s predictions our implementation of model data fusion with ccan allowed us to diagnose model data disagreements that were outside of field measurements and model uncertainty and identify important processes that are missing from such a parsimonious approach in this case ccan served more as a hypothesis on how the system works conceptually rather than serving solely as a predictive tool understanding where and when a model fails can result in further mechanistic understanding and highlight significant knowledge gaps provided that the uncertainty in the measurements and models are properly quantified moreover our approach also allowed us to incorporate diverse datasets such as from the arctic lter to help inform biologically realistic parameter values such an approach could be used elsewhere and it is clear that using model data fusion for model parameterization is ideal for gaining a greater understanding of ecological systems through modeling there have been and will continue to be changes in species composition and canopy structure as northern latitudes warm goetz et al 2005 myers smith et al 2011 many of these changes are happening at rates faster than we can measure them hence developing models that can forecast these changes remains a high priority for justifying measurement campaigns in global change biology research this study highlights a further need to understand the biotic and abiotic factors controlling the component fluxes of nee i e photosynthesis autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration as well as c and n cycling in warm tundra ecosystems with high leaf area our model data comparison also emphasized a need to understand how temperature influences plant c allocation and ecosystem c and n turnover in tundra with high lai and warm climates this is important because c and n fluxes and cycling in these systems is poorly understood a search on ameriflux reveals an underrepresentation of arctic nee measurements from warm shrub tundra sites further validation of ccan in shrub tundra would be needed to determine the reason the model performed poorly in these systems improved understanding of such systems will determine whether the vegetation response to climate change will offset c losses from thawing permafrost stieglitz et al 2006 hicks pries et al 2013 schuur et al

projected climate changes over the next century may increase the likelihood of large wildfires in western north america stavros et al 2014 barbero et al 2015 liu and wimberly 2016 parks et al 2016 impacting a variety of ecosystems guyette et al 2014 and associated anthropogenic landscapes schoennagel et al 2017 in addition a broad scale trend of anthropogenically decreased global fire activity has recently been detected andela et al 2017 niche modelling techniques serve as important tools in spatial modelling of current wildfire activity including binomial logistic regression kalabokidis et al 2002 barbero et al 2014 maxent parisien and moritz 2009 parisien et al 2012 boosted regression trees parks et al 2015 liu and wimberly 2015 2016 random forests liu and wimberly 2016 and gaussian linear regression robinne et al 2016 several of these niche models have been used in projecting future increased trends in wildfire activity in western north america barbero et al 2015 parks et al 2016 liu and wimberly 2016 higher quality niche models of wildfire activity at finer resolution are needed to better identify areas of decreased fire activity where action can be taken to restore more natural fire regimes and reduce wildfire risks to human assets both the selection of appropriate predictor variables and taking into account the effects of different sets of predictors are critical in developing better niche models of wildfire activity for both current and future climate scenarios the choice of predictor variables can produce great variability in niche model outcomes beaumont et al 2005 synes and osborne 2011 braunisch et al 2013 harris et al 2013 porfirio et al 2014 synes and osborne 2011 found that dissimilarities in outcomes due to different variable sets can be greater than dissimilarities resulting from niche model projections of different future climate scenarios they concluded that dissimilar outcomes resulted in an unmanageable level of uncertainty in projections of both current and future climate niche models in order to address this issue they stressed the importance of developing better methods of selecting predictor variables and better representation of niche model variability related to variable selection however there is no standard for researchers to determine appropriate variable sets for example the size of variable sets of future wildfire activity models developed for the western us range in number from five variables selected on the basis of previous studies parks et al 2016 to 28 variables screened using a boosted regression trees model liu and wimberly 2016 this study investigates a novel formal feature selection algorithm for screening and selection of variables to improve ecological niche modelling performance a variety of strategies have been previously employed in feature variable selection also known as input variable selection ivs galelli et al 2014 for niche modelling especially using maxent e g bradley et al 2010 halvorsen et al 2015 2016 jueterbock et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 which additionally includes a built in feature selection strategy phillips et al 2006 however there are few examples of feature selection for niche modelling being characterized in the context of a formal feature selection algorithm fsa e g jović et al 2015 but see gobeyn et al 2017 an fsa is a data mining tool for selecting a subset of variables with high relevancy and low redundancy for improving performance and efficiency of a variety of analyses such as classification regression and clustering jović et al 2015 the smaller variable sets identified through feature selection can produce niche models with reduced complexity and overfitting which can increase model generalization and transferability across space and time jiménez valverde et al 2008 warren and seifert 2011 verbruggen et al 2013 moreno amat et al 2015 in addition lower redundancy among variables can also facilitate model transferability dormann et al 2013 lower numbers of variables also reduce model computation time and facilitate interpretation jović et al 2015 several authors have drawn attention to the need for characterizing the variability of current and future climate niche models arising from the choice of predictor variables in order to produce more robust forecasts e g synes and osborne 2011 porfirio et al 2014 however characterization of feature related niche model variability is seldom done and we make this another focus of our study combinations of models that differ only in the feature subsets from which they were developed are known as feature subset ensembles fses aly and atiya 2006 part of boundary conditions of araújo and new 2007 our study is the first to formally employ stand alone fses in niche modelling we utilize feature subset ensembles to represent niche model variability arising from different predictor sets and facilitate comparisons across 1 niche models of various feature subset sizes 2 different niche modelling methods and 3 different climate scenarios for a given niche modelling method see appendix a section 1 for a more detailed review of feature selection and ensemble types in the context of niche modelling the large set of fire presence and absence data for western north america is ideally suited for demonstrating new techniques involving both the application of a novel formal feature selection algorithm for niche modelling and the representation of niche model variability arising from predictors through the use of feature subset ensembles the available 31 year historical fire data includes large fires of three burn severities low moderate and high that are not mutually exclusive within an area over such a long period making them suitable for development of separate niche models separate niche models for each of the three burn severities also illustrate uncertainty in the type of burn severity projected for a given area in addition individual niche models for each burn severity rather than a single multinomial model for all three burn severities facilitates the development and evaluation of our new ensemble feature selection techniques for commonly employed two class regression based niche modelling methods these methods include presence only maxent niche models and presence absence binomial logistic regression glm and glmnet niche models both maxent and glm have been previously utilized in spatial modelling of wildfire activity maxent is one of the most commonly used presence only niche modelling methods elith et al 2006 merow et al 2013 and it is particularly suitable for projecting the likelihood of fires in areas that may not have burned during a study period e g parisien and moritz 2009 parisien et al 2012 the lasso l1 regularization of model variable coefficients built into maxent phillips and dudík 2008 is generally effective in feature selection for smaller sets of variables however additional screening of larger variable sets is advised elith et al 2011 to this end we demonstrate the ability of a novel feature selection algorithm to identify smaller subsets of potentially important variables from a larger and more varied initial set of features than used for previous wildfire activity models including 90 variables from the categories of climatic topographic and anthropogenic indices many of these indices have been previously identified as important in wildfire activity models e g kalabokidis et al 2002 parisien and moritz 2009 dillon et al 2011 liu and wimberly 2016 our novel fsa utilizes a randomized search strategy involving screening a large number of niche models developed from random feature subsets of limited correlation and of a given size e g garcia et al 2006 the algorithm identifies a feature subset ensemble of high performance niche models the selected feature subset ensembles are employed to represent niche model variability in statistical comparisons of wildfire activity niche modelling results across various modelling methods and climate scenarios our study has three main objectives 1 demonstrate the ability of a novel random subset feature selection algorithm rsfsa e g garcia et al 2006 to improve performance of wildfire activity models for western north america 2 employ an innovative use of rsfsa selected feature subset ensembles in niche modelling to characterize wildfire activity model variability and provide a basis for comparing both niche modelling methods and model projections across climate scenarios and 3 analyze ecoregion level projections of wildfire activity for three different burn severity classes low moderate and high under current and future 2050 and 2070 climate scenarios for both low and high estimates for co2 emissions over western north america 2 methods 2 1 study area the study site consisted of the region in the western coterminous united states from which fire occurrence data see below was available for fires larger than 405 ha generally west of ca 93 5 w longitude fig 1 we regarded this region as our background evaluation extent bee for model training and evaluation see table a 1 for acronym abbreviations and definitions in order to incorporate portions of ecoregions extending across the us border into mexico and canada into our wildfire activity models we extended the projection area beyond the background evaluation extent to include northern mexico generally north of ca 16 n latitude and a portion of southwestern canada generally south of ca 58 n latitude in the interest of analyzing results across a commonly accepted ecoregion classification scheme for north america we calculated projected burned areas for 53 commission for environmental cooperation cec 2005 level iii ecoregions 46 within the background evaluation extent that are encompassed by nine cec level i ecoregions fig 1 2 2 fire occurrence data we combined monitoring trends in burn severity mtbs 2016 and landfire 2016 data to obtain spatial occurrences of large wildland fires generally greater than or equal to 405 ha in extent for each of the 31 years from 1984 to 2014 the mtbs data were derived from correlations of landsat satellite derived spectral indices with ground based burn severity indices key and benson 2006 eidenshink et al 2007 finco et al 2012 we precluded data on prescribed fires from both databases in order to analyze only wildland fires raster wildfire presence absence data for three burn severities of low moderate and high at 30 m resolution were spatially aggregated to point data at 1 km resolution all point data were spatially filtered to produce a minimum 10 km distance between points e g boria et al 2014 in order to reduce spatial autocorrelation and the associated inflation of model performance veloz 2009 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 fig 2 for further details on burn severity classes and resampling burn data see appendix a section 2 1 2 3 wildfire activity models 2 3 1 environmental variables and climate scenarios a total of 90 environmental predictor variables at one km resolution were assembled for model input including 57 climatic indices 16 topographic indices and 17 anthropogenic indices table 1 to evaluate the importance of different types of indices in wildfire activity models we further divided these indices into the eight subgroups table 1 we followed parks et al 2016 in regarding climatic indices as proxies for potential vegetation which simplified projection of vegetation under future climates parisien et al 2012 found that omitting vegetation fuel percent cover from their maxent wildfire activity models for the western us had negligible effect on model accuracy we followed liu and wimberly 2016 dillon et al 2011 and parisien et al 2012 in including topographic and anthropogenic indices in addition to climatic indices in our wildfire activity models the maximum absolute value of spearman rank correlation among variables used in any given wildfire activity niche model was limited to 0 7 in order to reduce variable collinearity and improve model transferability dormann et al 2013 fig a 2 for additional information regarding the sources and calculations for indices see appendix a section 2 3 1 2 3 2 climate scenarios the hadley global environmental model 2 earth system hadgem2 es or he general circulation model gcm jones et al 2011 was chosen to simulate future climate scenarios for 2050 average 2041 2060 and 2070 average 2061 2080 we chose two co2 representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 which represent the extremes of low and high concentrations in greenhouse gases respectively the 19 supplementary climate indices suppclim were calculated using one km resolution monthly gridded climate data for these scenarios available from worldclim 2017 the monthly aet and pet climate indices layers needed to calculate the 19 aet pet indices table 1 were derived from future worldclim 2017 layers according to methods of zomer et al 2007 2008 and trabucco and zomer 2010 topographic and anthropogenic indices were assumed constant over all climate scenarios for additional details on climate scenarios see appendix a section 2 3 2 2 3 3 niche models we developed wildfire activity niche models for each of the three burn severity classes i e low moderate and high using top selected niche models of each burn severity class we projected the current and future distributions of binary fire frequency classes for the 1984 2014 period 1 16 5 year mean fire interval mfi average number of years between fires representing fire presence data and 2 31 years mfi representing fire absence we regarded the fire absence data as quasi absence data that is subject to stochasticity related to fire ignition events and some error of fire detection over the 31 year study period e g parisien and moritz 2009 the fire absence points were buffered to occur at least 20 km from fire presence points in order to increase model sensitivity and minimize the percentage of true presences predicted as absences e g barbet massin et al 2012 niche models of several regression based methods and parameterization complexities were developed for performance comparison using the feature subset ensembles developed from random subset feature selection see section 2 4 below maxent version 3 3 3 phillips et al 2006 in r r core team 2016 dismo package hijmans et al 2011 was used to develop presence only niche models with various feature complexities 1 linear features only 2 linear and quadratic features with no interactions 3 quadratic and forward and reverse hinge features quadratic hinge features in which linear features were only used if hinge features were not used models generally employed hinge in place of linear features and 4 various levels of l1 regularization various β regularization multiplication parameters from β0 to β40 with quadratic hinge features for details on analyses of β regularization parameter values see appendix a section 2 3 3 1 in order to restrain potentially unnecessary maxent model complexity we did not use additional product and threshold features we developed presence absence binomial logistic regression niche models for glm from the r dismo package and for glmnet using the glmnet r package friedman et al 2010 with 1 linear and 2 orthogonalized linear quadratic features in order to simplify computations we used only raw non orthogonalized linear quadratic feature glmnet models when projecting to raster performance did not differ between raw and orthogonalized glmnet linear quadratic models fig a 3 we provide model parameters and coefficients for final selected maxent models appendix b tables b 1 3 which is seldom done halvorsen 2013 model evaluation statistics such as the true skill statistic tss and area under the curve auc fielding and bell 1997 were calculated with the r presenceabsence package freeman and moisen 2008 using fire presence absence pa data to produce tsspa and aucpa this approach to calculating auc utilizes only the true fire absence data as absence data in contrast the default calculation of auc carried out within the maxent implementation of the r dismo package utilizes both random background data aucbg smith 2013 and presence points aucbgp as absence data we calculated the corrected akaike information criterion aicc for maxent warren and seifert 2011 as a measure of model complexity and information content bozdogan 1987 the typical calculation of aicc for maxent using the enmeval r package muscarella et al 2014 requires the time consuming generation of a maxent prediction raster consequently we developed an r script to more rapidly calculate aicc for thousands of models using maxent samples with data swd mode predictions for background and training presence point data which we termed background aicc or aiccbg for more details on calculation of aiccbg see appendix a section 2 3 3 2 values of aicc calculated using available methods for glm and glmnet models have different scales than either aicc or aiccbg calculated for maxent models making comparisons problematic in order to facilitate an approximate comparison of aicc for these models we derived a linear calibration equation to convert aicc of glm and glmnet models to aiccbg of maxent models under the assumption that aiccbg for maxent β2 linear feature models was directly proportional to aicc of glm linear feature models using the same training data and numbers and types of variables for further details see appendix a section 2 3 3 3 all comparisons between niche modelling methods were made using the same training data and the same initial set of randomly generated variable subsets top selected models by rsfsa auc ranking were calibrated using a random 2 3 of all data for training and 1 3 data for testing selecting a threshold of maximum tsspa liu et al 2013 to yield a binary burned unburned classification for the two mean fire intervals fire presence or absence in 31 years this same threshold was applied to wildfire activity models parameterized with variables of future climate scenarios the top four selected binary wildfire activity models for each burn severity were combined by frequency consensus cf porfirio et al 2014 to form feature subset ensembles we compared different highly ranked variables in the selected niche models across different climate scenarios in terms of their linear relationships with latitude across the study area for additional details on model selection and variable rankings see appendix a section 2 3 3 4 2 3 4 contemporary wildfire deficit in contrast to the practice of parks et al 2015 for assessing wildfire surplus or deficit using wildfire activity modelling we include areas with high human influence in training our models and incorporate additional anthropogenic and topographic variables this allows us to project what we distinguish as a contemporary wildfire surplus or deficit taking into account current anthropogenic influences we compare relative differences between actual and projected burned areas in order to estimate contemporary wildfire deficit and surplus for the cec 2005 ecoregions for each burn severity we also develop a contemporary wildfire deficit surplus rating map through comparing the raster of historical fire presence with the model projected wildfire activity for further details see appendix a section 2 3 3 5 2 4 random subset feature selection algorithm the rsfsa was carried out in two stages 1 the optimal feature subset size estimation stage and 2 the variable subset selection stage which includes statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of feature selected versus random feature niche models fig 3 within each of these two stages were two phases employing differing feature selection criteria and search strategies 1 the univariate filter phase involving a sequential forward search strategy to build hundreds or thousands of random variable subsets of various sizes with the filter of an absolute value of spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs less than 0 7 dormann et al 2013 between any variables of a subset and 2 the subset wrapper phase in which a random subset search strategy is utilized with wrappers of auc or aicc to rank the performance of niche models developed from the randomly generated variable subsets with wrapper training and testing data for evaluation of any feature selection algorithm it is critical to use randomly partitioned final training and testing data data used to evaluate performance of random versus feature selected niche models which is held out from the wrapper training and testing data data used for training testing and ranking niche models with a test wrapper in order to avoid selecting features performing better only for the model wrapper training and testing data kohavi and john 1997 the final product of rsfsa is a feature subset ensemble niche model developed from top ranked variable subsets of the selected size that perform better than random subsets fig 3 final rsfsa evaluation was replicated with 3 randomizations of wrapper training and testing and final training and testing data stracuzzi 2007 to test the stability of the rsfsa to different sets of training data kalousis et al 2007 our ensemble rsfsa is a hybrid filter wrapper approach c f jović et al 2015 we incorporate the generation of random subsets of a given size and the ranking of these subsets by wrapper performance in the modelling method as in garcia et al 2006 our rsfsa is novel in several ways including 1 application of a correlation filter when building the random subsets 2 estimating an optimal feature subset size 3 using niche model auc or aicc as wrappers for ranking subsets and 4 selecting a feature subset ensemble model of top selected subsets rather than combining the variables from top selected subsets our rsfsa also differs from the random subset feature selection rsfs of räsänen and pohjalainen 2013 which ranks individual features not feature subsets by the wrapper performance of multiple random subsets in which they appear pooling top ranked features into a single subset for subsequent modelling we developed the rsfsa using r software that takes advantage of parallel processing in both the filter and wrapper phases to simultaneously generate and evaluate thousands of variable subsets for the different niche modelling algorithms r code for rsfsa with maxent glm and glmnet including glmnet model raster prediction functions available at https github com jamesltracy rsfsa r we also developed and compared alternative novel rsfsa variants that use expert screened variables for maxent quadratic hinge β2 low burn severity wildfire activity niche models for details on rsfsa phases stages and variants see appendix a section 2 4 the rsfsa selected and random wildfire activity niche models were compared for three evaluation statistics 1 higher accuracy as measured by testing auc aucpa finaltest 2 relatively lower complexity and higher information content as measured by lower aiccbg final and 3 lower overfitting of the training data as measured by a lower difference between final training data aucpa finaltrain and final testing data aucpa finaltest which yields aucpa diff final auctrain minus auctest warren and seifert 2011 we also compared training auc aucpa finaltrain in combination with testing auc aucpa finaltest to evaluate underfitting among modelling methods relatively poor model accuracy for both the training data aucpa finalrain and testing data aucpa finaltest indicates a poorly fitted model c f harrell et al 1996 the rsfsa allows the researcher flexibility in both stages to subjectively balance niche model underfitting overfitting and information content with the desired level of model complexity in terms of the selected numbers of environmental variables and derived parameters 2 5 additional model assessment the post rsfsa stage iii involved final calibration of rsfsa selected models from stage ii using all of the presence data divided into 2 3 training and 1 3 testing described above in section 2 3 3 fig 3 we evaluated the potential influence of the number of variables in low burn severity wildfire activity models on projected burned areas within and beyond the background evaluation extent e g beaumont et al 2005 from the rsfsa selected models we additionally selected more conservative models in terms of projected burned area and map accuracy according to regional indices described in appendix a section 2 3 3 4 in order to better inform conservation management decisions e g schwartz 2012 2 6 statistical tests in order to allow for observed cases of unequal variance among wildfire activity model results the welch anova was used to test whether 1 model evaluation statistics did not differ among rsfsa selected models and random models and 2 projected burned areas within ecoregions or larger areas did not differ between models for current and future climate scenarios following a significant welch anova test separate secondary paired tests were performed using a welch t test with the holm correction to control for type i error related to the number of paired comparisons for each set of tests following a significant welch s one way anvova test pairwise multiple comparisons were conducted using the games and howell 1976 pairwise multiple comparison test which also allows for unequal variance and sample sizes 3 results 3 1 niche modelling methods and feature selection in estimating the optimal variable subset size rsfsa stage i we observed apparent trends of increased accuracy high aucpa finaltest lower complexity low aiccbg final and higher overfitting aucpa diff final as the number of variables per subset increased from three to 25 for wildfire activity models these trends hold for all three burn severity models as well as for all types of niche modelling methods including various parameterizations of maxent glm and glmnet models figs 4 and 5 a 5 8 for all burn severities maxent quadratic hinge models using β regularization multipliers of one two or three β1 β2 β3 and glm and glmnet linear quadratic models tended to exhibit higher training and testing auc which indicated lower underfitting and lower aiccbg i e greater information content however these models also displayed greater overfitting than simpler models as revealed by higher aucdiff figs 4 a 6 8 the glm and glmnet models of the same feature parameterization generally performed similarly for all evaluation statistics figs 4 a 5 7 an exception was the poor performance of some rsfsa selected linear quadratic glm models for moderate and high burn severities with larger sized variable subsets figs a 6 7 an increase in maxent quadratic hinge model β regularization values from zero no regularization to 40 high regularization fig a 8 produced a range in model performance similar to the various feature parameterization complexities of maxent glm and glmnet models figs 4 a 6 7 increasing l1 regularization for maxent quadratic hinge models lowered testing and training auc raised aiccbg and below 12 variable subsets lowered overfitting aucdiff only low burn severity maxent quadratic hinge models with β regularization values around five or less β 5 achieved lower aiccbg than maxent models with no l1 regularization β0 fig a 8c the rsfsa selected variable subset models ranked by either aucpa wrappertest or aiccbg wrapper show improvement over random models for all of the niche modelling methods figs 5 a 5 generally the sharpest visual changes in model evaluation statistics occurred over an increase in subset size from six to 15 variables consequently we chose six and 15 variable subsets for further evaluation in rsfsa stage ii for conducting statistical comparisons among modelling methods part of rsfsa stage ii we increased replications for 15 variable models with the best performance in auc and aiccbg the maxent quadratic hinge β1 β2 β3 and glm and glmnet linear quadratic models low burn severity maxent quadratic hinge models exhibited significantly lower underfitting as indicated by higher training and testing auc and lower aicc than the three training replicate sets of glm and glmnet linear quadratic models p 0 05 games howell pairwise multiple comparison test preceded by significant welch s one way anova test p 0 05 fig a 9a c in contrast the glm and glmnet linear quadratic models performed significantly better in terms of lower overfitting fig a 9d among the low burn severity maxent quadratic hinge models those of β1 and β2 performed significantly better in most training sets than β3 models in terms of lower underfitting higher training and testing auc fig a 9a b in addition the maxent quadratic hinge β2 models performed better than β1 and β3 models in terms of lower aiccbg fig a 9c and for most training replicates they usually had significantly lower overfitting than β1 models fig a 9d corresponding results for moderate and high burn severity models were generally similar but not as consistent due to unstable results for rsfsa with linear quadratic glm models in some training replicates figs a 10 11 see appendix a section 3 1 for details overall maxent quadratic hinge β2 models performed best in terms of lower underfitting and higher information content and they were selected for further evaluation for wildfire activity niche models of all three burn severities we compared six and 15 variables maxent quadratic hinge β2 models and found significant trends for both higher accuracy and lower complexity for 15 variable models across all three training set replications when using the rsfsa aucpa wrappertest wrapper p 0 05 welch t test with holm correction preceded by significant welch anova test p 0 05 fig a 12a f however a little over half of these rsfsa replications across all burn severities showed a significant increasing trend for overfitting from six to 15 variable subsets fig a 12g i we also evaluated the projected burned areas in mha of rsfsa selected six ten and 15 variable maxent quadratic hinge and 15 variable glmnet linear quadratic wildfire activity binary models for low burn severity no apparent differences and no relationships were found in the areas projected as burned either within or beyond the background evaluation extent fig a 13 a b we selected the 15 variable subset size for maxent quadratic hinge β2 models for further evaluation with rsfsa in order to compare ranking using auc versus aiccbg in completing rsfsa stage ii evaluations we further compared the efficiency of the aucpa wrappertest versus the aiccbg wrapper for improving performance of the chosen 15 variable maxent quadratic hinge β2 models we found significantly higher accuracy aucpa finaltest for models selected with rsfsa wrappers of either aucpa wrappertest or aiccbg wrapper compared to random models for all three replications of all three burn severities p 0 05 welch t test with holm correction preceded by significant welch anova test p 0 05 fig 6 a c we found consistently improved lower model complexity aiccbg final for all three burn severities using the aucpa wrappertest wrapper but not the aiccbg wrapper wrapper fig 6d f the rsfsa selected models from aiccbg wrapper and aucpa wrappertest wrappers achieved significantly reduced overfitting compared to random models across all three replications for the low burn severity fig 6g and high burn severity models fig 6i respectively we chose the rsfsa aucpa wrappertest wrapper method which was more consistent for optimizing aiccbg final for selecting maxent wildfire models for all three burn severities attempts to obtain lower overfitting for all three replicates for moderate burn severity models using 10 12 and 17 variable subset sizes or combinations of wrappers e g aucpa wrappertest and aiccbg final were also unsuccessful results not shown in consideration of the variability of burned areas projected for rsfsa selected 15 variable subset models figs a 13 a a 14 regional indices were employed to select the top four most conservative models in terms of burned area within the background evaluation extent for details see appendix a section 2 3 3 4 the rsfsa selected 15 variable maxent β2 quadratic hinge models for all three burn severities actually employed 14 to 15 environmental variables from which 81 103 derived features were used in the model equation see appendix b tables b 1 3 for derived features for each selected model provided in embedded maxent lambdas text files the use of an expert filter to narrow down our initial set of variables from 90 to 38 did not significantly improve performance of the rsfsa for maxent quadratic hinge β2 15 variable low burn severity wildfire activity models only models developed from random sets of 38 of 90 variables and ranked with aucpa wrappertest auc38of90 consistently produced significant improvement over models developed from unranked random sets rand38of90 in all three evaluation statistics including overfitting aucpa diff final p 0 05 welch t test with holm correction preceded by significant welch anova test p 0 05 fig a 15 improvements over random models for evaluation statistics of rsfsa selected models derived from 38 expert selected variables were generally similar to that seen in rsfsa selected models from 38 random variables or the entire 90 variable set fig a 15 3 2 selected features for wildfire activity models the top four rsfsa aucpa wrappertest wrapper selected 15 variable maxent quadratic hinge β2 wildfire activity models for each of the three burn severities 12 models total were quite varied in their composition of variables sixty of the 90 total variables were used at least once in the four rsfsa selected models of each burn severity table 1 variables correlated above the rs threshold of 0 7 which were not allowed in the same model could sometimes appear in different rsfsa selected models in the selected feature subset ensemble for example annual and spring quarter evapotranspiration ratio are correlated at 0 97 rs over the background presence points and these variables appeared in two different selected low burn severity wildfire activity models table b 1 for top selected models of all burn severities three variables were shared among the top ten ranked variables by mean permutation importance and frequency

evapotranspiration for the spring quarter aett spr and 5 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio 8 among these eight commonly high ranked variables five are climatic indices two are topographic indices and one is an anthropogenic index there were some clear differences among the three burn severities in the top ranked variables in the four rsfsa selected models table a 4 for example the three top ranked variables in low burn severity models were precipitation in the spring quarter 3 4 models percent agricultural land cover all four models and mean temperature of the driest quarter

different burn severities see appendix a section 3 3 2 and fig a 23 4 discussion 4 1 niche modelling methods and feature selection feature selection with rsfsa facilitates optimizing the performance of a variety of niche modelling methods in terms of both the number of variables employed and the features included in the variable subsets we found no improvement in rsfsa selected model performance from using an expert based filter for our initial set of 90 variables the feature selection ensembles generated through rsfsa facilitate comparison of niche models utilizing different feature subset sizes various niche modelling methods and niche models across different species phenomena or scenarios e g climates for example we utilized feature subset ensembles based on rsfsa selected models to identify statistical differences in projected burned areas across climate scenarios in addition feature subset ensembles allowed the use of highly correlated variables in different wildfire activity models improving representation of model uncertainty which is especially important for climate scenario models braunisch et al 2013 the rsfsa generated feature subset ensembles facilitated comparison of niche modelling methods across a variety of subset sizes for different feature types e g linear versus quadratic and levels of l1 regularization β1 β40 e g warren and seifert 2011 anderson and gonzalez 2011 morales et al 2017 we found that simpler linear or linear quadratic maxent glm and glmnet models have lower overfitting aucdiff than more complex quadratic hinge maxent models however these simpler models also have comparably higher underfitting lower training and testing auc and lower information content higher aiccbg model underfitting has been observed to more negatively affect performance of maxent models than overfitting using simulation data with a variety of metrics warren and seifert 2011 consequently we chose to emphasize the reduction in model underfitting and increased information content by choosing the maxent quadratic hinge models over simpler maxent glmnet or glm models for projecting wildfire activity other studies have found that maxent models using all features and just linear quadratic features outperform linear quadratic probit glm thibaud et al 2014 and linear quadratic logistic glmnet dicko et al 2014 models respectively however guillera arroita et al 2014 found that logistic glmnet linear quadratic models outperformed maxent quadratic hinge models in terms of root mean squared error with simulated data for moderate and high burn severity models developed from larger variable subsets we found that feature selection results were more stable for maxent and glmnet linear quadratic models than for glm linear quadratic models in agreement with radosavljevic and anderson 2014 we found that a maxent beta regularization multiplier value slightly above the default value of β1 namely β2 can reduce overfitting for maxent models in addition our maxent quadratic hinge β2 models generally had lower aiccbg compared to both β1 and β3 models a maxent beta regularization value of around five or less β5 was necessary to see improvement in lower aiccbg than maxent wildfire activity models without regularization β0 as maxent quadratic hinge model l1 regularization is increased from β1 to β40 over a broad range of variable subset sizes model overfitting decreases lower aucdiff but there is an increase in model underfitting lower training and testing auc and decrease in model information content higher aiccbg although our maxent quadratic hinge β2 wildfire activity models had high numbers of derived features we were able to effectively utilize maxent software outputs of variable permutation importance and variable response curves for interpretation of the more important variables the potential use of rsfsa to directly select derived maxent variables as halvorsen et al 2015 2016 did using sequential feature selection may facilitate further model optimization with lower numbers of parameters we regard maxent quadratic hinge β2 niche models as potentially widely suitable for use in rsfsa with large sets of occurrence data and many environmental variables niche models employing rsfsa should utilize about twice the minmum sample size of occurrence data that is normally recommended e g proosdij et al 2016 in order to facilitate evaluation of rsfsa selected versus random models using one half of the data held out for final testing the rsfsa selected maxent quadratic hinge β2 models exhibited significantly lower underfitting higher training and testing auc higher information content lower aiccbg and sometimes lower overfitting aucdiff in comparison to models generated from random variable subsets in contrast increasing levels of embedded feature selection using l1 regularization higher values of β for rsfsa selected maxent quadratic hinge models resulted in lower overfitting lower aucdiff but greater underfitting lower training and testing auc and lower information content higher aiccbg the combined use of rsfsa and l1 regularization can work together for improving the balance of overfitting underfitting and information content in niche models in feature selection two variables that are useless by themselves in improving model accuracy can be useful and highly relevant together guyon and elisseeff 2003 the success of the rsfsa in reducing model underfitting and improving information content probably benefits from its ability to identify variable combinations that are synergistic in terms of model relevancy among the thousands of screened models the randomized search strategy we employ has several advantages over the sequential search strategy evaluation of individual variables in sequence that has most often been employed in feature selection for niche modelling especially with maxent e g mouton et al 2009 bradley et al 2010 lahoz monfort et al 2010 bellamy and altringham 2015 halvorsen et al 2015 2016 yost et al 2008 jueterbock et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 the random subset selection search strategy can 1 better avoid entrapment in local minima selecting the best feature subset at the moment liu and motoda 1998 jović et al 2015 2 better identify synergistic combinations of variables c f guyon and elisseeff 2003 and 3 take better advantage of parallel processing in evaluating several random variable subsets simultaneously garcia et al 2006 the tendency of niche models utilizing larger sets of variables to exhibit a higher auctest has been demonstrated previously e g synes and osborne 2011 thus a convergence in auctest values between random and rsfsa selected models is expected as auctest values increase with growing variable subset size over a broad range of niche modelling methods of increasing variable subset sizes we also observed a strong correlation between improved increasing values of auctest and improved decreasing values aiccbg zeng et al 2016 their fig 1 also observed a general decrease in aicc as the number of maxent environmental variables increased similar to beaumont et al 2005 we found no effect of variable subset sizes from six to 15 variables on the projected area burned in maxent models we also found no correlation among projected burned areas within the background evaluation extent with the projected area burned beyond the background evaluation extent therefore we expect that the projected area burned within the background evaluation extent for current climate probably also has little to no relationship to the projected area burned across future climate scenarios either within or beyond the background evaluation extent as a result our choice of more conservative maxent models in terms of current projected area burned within the background evaluation extent probably did not produce more conservative estimates for burned areas when extrapolating the models across space or time 4 2 selected features for wildfire activity models only about half of the top ranked variables across rsfsa selected maxent quadratic hinge β2 models for all three burn severities were expert selected variables from previous studies table a 3 consequently screening a wider initial set of 90 variables allowed us to identify additional important variables for modelling wildfire activity such as mean temperature of the driest quarter bio 9 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio 8 spring actual evapotranspiration aett sprq and spring evapotranspiration ratio etrt sprq for the top four rsfa selected wildfire activity models for each burn severity a generally higher proportion of climatic indices 42 were utilized compared to topographic 31 and anthropogenic 27 indices table 1 in contrast dillon et al 2011 found that topographic variables especially elevation and topographic position index with a 2 km radius were generally more important than climate and weather variables for non spatial high burn severity models developed with the random forests algorithm similar to our results they found models performed better when including several categories of topographic climate and weather variables together in contrast to using a single category of topographic variables within the climatic indices for our maxent quadratic hinge β2 wildfire activity models there was a tendency for top rsfsa selected models to include about equal percentages of bioclim and aet pet indices indicating the importance of including both of these groups of indices in wildfire activity models although lower percentages of suppclim indices were used in our wildfire activity models compared to other climatic indices table 1 some were among the top ranked indices such as precipitation in the summer quarter prec sumq within the topographic indices the geomorphologic indices ranked higher than the hydrogeomorphologic indices table a 4 three of the five variables used in the wildfire activity models of parks et al 2015 were included in our study 1 annual actual evapotranspiration 2 annual precipitation and 3 annual climate water deficit snow water equivalent and soil moisture were excluded two of these variables total annual evapotranspiration and annual climate water deficit appeared in some of our rsfsa selected 15 variable maxent quadratic hinge β2 models for low burn severity wildfires table 1 in addition precipitation in the summer quarter closely related to annual precipitation occurred in models for all three burn severities of the 17 anthropogenic indices only agricultural land cover was among the top ten ranked variables for rsfsa selected maxent quadratic hinge β2 wildfire activity models of all three burn severities appearing in every model higher amounts of agricultural land cover were associated with lower probability of wildfire for all three burn severities reduced wildfire probability with higher agricultural land cover is probably related to reduced availability of woody vegetation as fuel several previous studies have also found that anthropogenic indices including agricultural land cover and a variety of other indices related to anthropogenic fire ignition and suppression are of critical importance to modelling large scale wildfire activity kalabokidis et al 2002 liu and wimberly 2016 robinne et al 2016 mann et al 2016 4 3 projections for wildfire activity models 4 3 1 current climate we project wildfire activity at one km resolution over a larger area of western north america than has been done previously employing a novel combination of different niche model types with the mtbs data used by liu and wimberly 2016 and parks et al 2016 and additional data from the mtbs and landfire databases the auctest values of our wildfire models for the three burn severity classes were fairly high above 0 84 even though severe contemporary wildfire deficits were projected for many ecoregions similar to parks et al 2015 we observed a general trend of greater contemporary wildfire deficits projected among forested ecoregions in addition we found that the proportion of ecoregions projected with severe contemporary wildfire deficits increased with increasing burn severity for the northwestern forested mountains the current climate multiclass burn severity category models of parks et al 2016 also project greater high burn severity fires in these northwestern forested ecoregions in contrast to projections for forested ecoregions we projected only a small proportion of non forested level i ecoregions with severe contemporary wildfire deficits for the low and moderate burn severity categories the severity of our projected contemporary wildfire deficits in forested ecoregions for all burn severity categories were generally much greater than found for wildfire deficits in similarly defined forested ecoregions by parks et al 2015 the generally higher projected contemporary wildfire deficits in our models could be related to finer scale detection of variation in wildfire activity due to our use of a higher spatial resolution one km2 and additional variables particularly agricultural land cover we make available 1 km resolution contemporary wildfire deficit ratings map shapefiles for all three burn severities for the western us that may assist land managers in identifying areas with greater long term potential hazard for large wildfires see embedded shapefiles in appendix a section 3 3 1 many areas with little or no data on contemporary wildfire deficits e g much of the east texas central plains and arizona new mexico plateau ecoregions may have had pre columbian mean fire return intervals greater than or equal to those seen in the recent historical 31 year 1984 2014 period used in our study but land use land cover change to cultivation urbanization and heavy grazing has probably led to long term anthropogenic fire suppression 4 3 2 future climate future projections of increased low burn severity wildfires in several northern ecoregions may be associated with projected changes in three important bioclimatic indices 1 higher mean temperatures of the driest quarter bio 9 2 decreases in mean precipitation during the summer quarter prec sumq in the north but not in the south and 3 increases in mean precipitation during the spring quarter prec sprq in the north but not in the south potentially increased primary productivity for northern ecoregions associated with projected increases in spring precipitation may favor larger areas of low burn severity wildfires projected increases in temperature for the driest quarter bio 9 and decreases in summer precipitation prec sumq in the north may favor wildfire ignition and propagation of low burn severity wildfires rogers et al 2013 similarly projected future increased wildfire activity in the pacific northwest from increased summer droughts related to decreased summer precipitation and higher summer temperatures and increased fuel loads related to higher winter precipitation projections of smaller areas of large low burn severity wildfires in some southern ecoregions may be related to projected reductions in rainfall e g prec sprq at southern latitudes which could be associated with lower primary productivity for further discussion of variable influence on climate projections see appendix a section 4 1 our wildfire activity models do not attempt to incorporate projections of the complex long term interactions between vegetation population dynamics and changes in extreme weather events such as prolonged drought that could greatly impact future landscape wildfire activity mckenzie and littell 2017 in addition there is considerable uncertainty in the accuracy of both the original mtbs burn severity classifications used in training our models kolden et al 2015 and in the gcms used for projecting future climate in western north america for example several gcms project generally drier and warmer conditions in southwestern north america over this century swain and hayhoe 2015 such as we observed in projected reduced spring precipitation prec sprq with the hadgem2 es gcm for 2070 fig a 23b however chylek et al 2014 report that the historically cyclic influences of the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo and pacific decadal oscillation pdo indices are poorly incorporated into gcms furthermore they maintain that projected amo pdo cycles may lead to stable temperatures and increased precipitation over the next several decades in the southwestern us which is in contrast to projections from gcms we also caution the interpretation of our wildfire activity model projections in areas such as central mexico that are far beyond the background evaluation extent of our continental us training data in spite of uncertainties our models are in general agreement with several other recent studies projecting future increases in burned areas in western north america especially for low and moderate burn severity wildfires parks et al 2016 liu and wimberly 2016 5 conclusions 5 1 feature selection for niche modelling a novel random subset feature selection algorithm was used to effectively screen a large number of variables to develop a feature subset ensemble of optimally sized feature subsets that can increase performance for a variety of niche modelling methods the feature selection algorithm does not improve niche model performance over expert selected models but it facilitates identification of new relevant variables or variable combinations that can be useful in developing and interpreting the models the algorithm is especially useful in identifying variables for modelling tasks about which little expert information is available in addition identification of alternative high performing models of different variable subsets by the feature selection algorithm is important in accounting for model uncertainty in comparisons across modelling methods or scenarios the utilization of highly collinear variables in separate models of selected feature subset ensembles can be valuable for reflecting model uncertainty our feature selection algorithm affords the researcher flexibility in balancing the levels of niche model underfitting overfitting and information content and the number and complexity of model parameters the combination of random subset feature selection with l1 regularization via maxent quadratic hinge β2 models appears to be especially suitable for developing feature subset ensembles representing higher performance niche models when large sets of occurrence data and environmental variables are available as is the case with wildfire activity further studies are needed to assess the performance of the random subset feature selection algorithm for improving niche models for species and of other phenomena and using pseudoabsence data and differing niche modelling methods such as bioclim and random forests c f jović et al 2015 the degree of spatial variability in feature selected models versus random models for current and future climate scenarios should also be examined comparisons of the spatial variability of feature subset ensemble models from random subset feature selection should also be made with other types of model ensembles such as training set ensembles and multi algorithm ensembles e g zhang et al 2015 additional niche model evaluation statistics could also be investigated for use in feature selection such as the hosmer lemeshow goodness of fit statistic for logistic regression potential improvements in model transferability across space and time using various feature selection strategies can also be explored 5 2 implications for conservation comparisons of historical and projected wildfire activity indicate that unnaturally low fire return intervals amounting to severe contemporary wildfire deficits are widespread in the western us including in areas of conservation concern such as the madrean archilpelago ecoregion of southern arizona and new mexico embedded zipped shapefiles of contemporary wildfire deficits are provided in appendix a section 3 3 1 where feasible reduction of anthropogenic fire suppression such as by limiting grazing and increasing prescribed or wildland fires may be critical for maintaining the integrity of fire dependent western montane ecosystems e g noss et al 2006 the projected reductions in fire frequency through climate change in southwestern north america could further degrade natural fire regimes of fire dependent ecosystems making long term reduction of anthropogenic fire suppression even more imperative in contrast our models projected future increases in wildfire activity in forested ecoregions of northwestern north america in these northwestern forests it will be critical to remove excess fuel build up such as through prescribed burns to prevent increased wildfire damage to human lives and property in and around these ecosystems data statement data from this study has been made available in the online repository https github com jamesltracy rsfsa r

25263,variable selection in ecological niche modelling can influence model projections to a degree comparable to variations in future climate scenarios consequently it is important to select feature variable subsets for optimizing model performance and characterizing variability we utilize a novel random subset feature selection algorithm rsfsa for niche modelling to select an ensemble of optimally sized feature subsets of limited correlation r 0 7 from 90 climatic topographic and anthropogenic indices generating wildfire activity models for western north america with higher performance monitoring trends in burn severity and landfire wildfire data were used to develop thousands of maxent glm and glmnet models the rsfsa selected models performed better than random models having higher accuracy area under the curve statistic auc lower complexity corrected akaike information criterion aicc and in some cases lower overfitting aucdiff the rsfsa selected maxent quadratic hinge β regularization 2 feature models generally had higher auc and lower aicc outperforming other niche model parameterizations and methods feature subset ensembles of rsfsa selected 15 variable maxent quadratic hinge models were used to characterize variability in projected areas of large wildfires for three burn severities under current 2050 and 2070 climate scenarios expert screening of variables before rsfsa did not improve model performance widespread contemporary wildfire deficits and projected regional changes in wildfires highlight the need to manage fuel loads and restore natural fire regimes the rsfsa is valuable for optimizing niche model performance and generating feature subset ensembles to characterize model variability across niche models of various feature subset sizes modelling methods and climate scenarios keywords variable selection niche models species distribution models fire pyrogeography climatic topographic anthropogenic indices 1 introduction projected climate changes over the next century may increase the likelihood of large wildfires in western north america stavros et al 2014 barbero et al 2015 liu and wimberly 2016 parks et al 2016 impacting a variety of ecosystems guyette et al 2014 and associated anthropogenic landscapes schoennagel et al 2017 in addition a broad scale trend of anthropogenically decreased global fire activity has recently been detected andela et al 2017 niche modelling techniques serve as important tools in spatial modelling of current wildfire activity including binomial logistic regression kalabokidis et al 2002 barbero et al 2014 maxent parisien and moritz 2009 parisien et al 2012 boosted regression trees parks et al 2015 liu and wimberly 2015 2016 random forests liu and wimberly 2016 and gaussian linear regression robinne et al 2016 several of these niche models have been used in projecting future increased trends in wildfire activity in western north america barbero et al 2015 parks et al 2016 liu and wimberly 2016 higher quality niche models of wildfire activity at finer resolution are needed to better identify areas of decreased fire activity where action can be taken to restore more natural fire regimes and reduce wildfire risks to human assets both the selection of appropriate predictor variables and taking into account the effects of different sets of predictors are critical in developing better niche models of wildfire activity for both current and future climate scenarios the choice of predictor variables can produce great variability in niche model outcomes beaumont et al 2005 synes and osborne 2011 braunisch et al 2013 harris et al 2013 porfirio et al 2014 synes and osborne 2011 found that dissimilarities in outcomes due to different variable sets can be greater than dissimilarities resulting from niche model projections of different future climate scenarios they concluded that dissimilar outcomes resulted in an unmanageable level of uncertainty in projections of both current and future climate niche models in order to address this issue they stressed the importance of developing better methods of selecting predictor variables and better representation of niche model variability related to variable selection however there is no standard for researchers to determine appropriate variable sets for example the size of variable sets of future wildfire activity models developed for the western us range in number from five variables selected on the basis of previous studies parks et al 2016 to 28 variables screened using a boosted regression trees model liu and wimberly 2016 this study investigates a novel formal feature selection algorithm for screening and selection of variables to improve ecological niche modelling performance a variety of strategies have been previously employed in feature variable selection also known as input variable selection ivs galelli et al 2014 for niche modelling especially using maxent e g bradley et al 2010 halvorsen et al 2015 2016 jueterbock et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 which additionally includes a built in feature selection strategy phillips et al 2006 however there are few examples of feature selection for niche modelling being characterized in the context of a formal feature selection algorithm fsa e g jović et al 2015 but see gobeyn et al 2017 an fsa is a data mining tool for selecting a subset of variables with high relevancy and low redundancy for improving performance and efficiency of a variety of analyses such as classification regression and clustering jović et al 2015 the smaller variable sets identified through feature selection can produce niche models with reduced complexity and overfitting which can increase model generalization and transferability across space and time jiménez valverde et al 2008 warren and seifert 2011 verbruggen et al 2013 moreno amat et al 2015 in addition lower redundancy among variables can also facilitate model transferability dormann et al 2013 lower numbers of variables also reduce model computation time and facilitate interpretation jović et al 2015 several authors have drawn attention to the need for characterizing the variability of current and future climate niche models arising from the choice of predictor variables in order to produce more robust forecasts e g synes and osborne 2011 porfirio et al 2014 however characterization of feature related niche model variability is seldom done and we make this another focus of our study combinations of models that differ only in the feature subsets from which they were developed are known as feature subset ensembles fses aly and atiya 2006 part of boundary conditions of araújo and new 2007 our study is the first to formally employ stand alone fses in niche modelling we utilize feature subset ensembles to represent niche model variability arising from different predictor sets and facilitate comparisons across 1 niche models of various feature subset sizes 2 different niche modelling methods and 3 different climate scenarios for a given niche modelling method see appendix a section 1 for a more detailed review of feature selection and ensemble types in the context of niche modelling the large set of fire presence and absence data for western north america is ideally suited for demonstrating new techniques involving both the application of a novel formal feature selection algorithm for niche modelling and the representation of niche model variability arising from predictors through the use of feature subset ensembles the available 31 year historical fire data includes large fires of three burn severities low moderate and high that are not mutually exclusive within an area over such a long period making them suitable for development of separate niche models separate niche models for each of the three burn severities also illustrate uncertainty in the type of burn severity projected for a given area in addition individual niche models for each burn severity rather than a single multinomial model for all three burn severities facilitates the development and evaluation of our new ensemble feature selection techniques for commonly employed two class regression based niche modelling methods these methods include presence only maxent niche models and presence absence binomial logistic regression glm and glmnet niche models both maxent and glm have been previously utilized in spatial modelling of wildfire activity maxent is one of the most commonly used presence only niche modelling methods elith et al 2006 merow et al 2013 and it is particularly suitable for projecting the likelihood of fires in areas that may not have burned during a study period e g parisien and moritz 2009 parisien et al 2012 the lasso l1 regularization of model variable coefficients built into maxent phillips and dudík 2008 is generally effective in feature selection for smaller sets of variables however additional screening of larger variable sets is advised elith et al 2011 to this end we demonstrate the ability of a novel feature selection algorithm to identify smaller subsets of potentially important variables from a larger and more varied initial set of features than used for previous wildfire activity models including 90 variables from the categories of climatic topographic and anthropogenic indices many of these indices have been previously identified as important in wildfire activity models e g kalabokidis et al 2002 parisien and moritz 2009 dillon et al 2011 liu and wimberly 2016 our novel fsa utilizes a randomized search strategy involving screening a large number of niche models developed from random feature subsets of limited correlation and of a given size e g garcia et al 2006 the algorithm identifies a feature subset ensemble of high performance niche models the selected feature subset ensembles are employed to represent niche model variability in statistical comparisons of wildfire activity niche modelling results across various modelling methods and climate scenarios our study has three main objectives 1 demonstrate the ability of a novel random subset feature selection algorithm rsfsa e g garcia et al 2006 to improve performance of wildfire activity models for western north america 2 employ an innovative use of rsfsa selected feature subset ensembles in niche modelling to characterize wildfire activity model variability and provide a basis for comparing both niche modelling methods and model projections across climate scenarios and 3 analyze ecoregion level projections of wildfire activity for three different burn severity classes low moderate and high under current and future 2050 and 2070 climate scenarios for both low and high estimates for co2 emissions over western north america 2 methods 2 1 study area the study site consisted of the region in the western coterminous united states from which fire occurrence data see below was available for fires larger than 405 ha generally west of ca 93 5 w longitude fig 1 we regarded this region as our background evaluation extent bee for model training and evaluation see table a 1 for acronym abbreviations and definitions in order to incorporate portions of ecoregions extending across the us border into mexico and canada into our wildfire activity models we extended the projection area beyond the background evaluation extent to include northern mexico generally north of ca 16 n latitude and a portion of southwestern canada generally south of ca 58 n latitude in the interest of analyzing results across a commonly accepted ecoregion classification scheme for north america we calculated projected burned areas for 53 commission for environmental cooperation cec 2005 level iii ecoregions 46 within the background evaluation extent that are encompassed by nine cec level i ecoregions fig 1 2 2 fire occurrence data we combined monitoring trends in burn severity mtbs 2016 and landfire 2016 data to obtain spatial occurrences of large wildland fires generally greater than or equal to 405 ha in extent for each of the 31 years from 1984 to 2014 the mtbs data were derived from correlations of landsat satellite derived spectral indices with ground based burn severity indices key and benson 2006 eidenshink et al 2007 finco et al 2012 we precluded data on prescribed fires from both databases in order to analyze only wildland fires raster wildfire presence absence data for three burn severities of low moderate and high at 30 m resolution were spatially aggregated to point data at 1 km resolution all point data were spatially filtered to produce a minimum 10 km distance between points e g boria et al 2014 in order to reduce spatial autocorrelation and the associated inflation of model performance veloz 2009 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 fig 2 for further details on burn severity classes and resampling burn data see appendix a section 2 1 2 3 wildfire activity models 2 3 1 environmental variables and climate scenarios a total of 90 environmental predictor variables at one km resolution were assembled for model input including 57 climatic indices 16 topographic indices and 17 anthropogenic indices table 1 to evaluate the importance of different types of indices in wildfire activity models we further divided these indices into the eight subgroups table 1 we followed parks et al 2016 in regarding climatic indices as proxies for potential vegetation which simplified projection of vegetation under future climates parisien et al 2012 found that omitting vegetation fuel percent cover from their maxent wildfire activity models for the western us had negligible effect on model accuracy we followed liu and wimberly 2016 dillon et al 2011 and parisien et al 2012 in including topographic and anthropogenic indices in addition to climatic indices in our wildfire activity models the maximum absolute value of spearman rank correlation among variables used in any given wildfire activity niche model was limited to 0 7 in order to reduce variable collinearity and improve model transferability dormann et al 2013 fig a 2 for additional information regarding the sources and calculations for indices see appendix a section 2 3 1 2 3 2 climate scenarios the hadley global environmental model 2 earth system hadgem2 es or he general circulation model gcm jones et al 2011 was chosen to simulate future climate scenarios for 2050 average 2041 2060 and 2070 average 2061 2080 we chose two co2 representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 which represent the extremes of low and high concentrations in greenhouse gases respectively the 19 supplementary climate indices suppclim were calculated using one km resolution monthly gridded climate data for these scenarios available from worldclim 2017 the monthly aet and pet climate indices layers needed to calculate the 19 aet pet indices table 1 were derived from future worldclim 2017 layers according to methods of zomer et al 2007 2008 and trabucco and zomer 2010 topographic and anthropogenic indices were assumed constant over all climate scenarios for additional details on climate scenarios see appendix a section 2 3 2 2 3 3 niche models we developed wildfire activity niche models for each of the three burn severity classes i e low moderate and high using top selected niche models of each burn severity class we projected the current and future distributions of binary fire frequency classes for the 1984 2014 period 1 16 5 year mean fire interval mfi average number of years between fires representing fire presence data and 2 31 years mfi representing fire absence we regarded the fire absence data as quasi absence data that is subject to stochasticity related to fire ignition events and some error of fire detection over the 31 year study period e g parisien and moritz 2009 the fire absence points were buffered to occur at least 20 km from fire presence points in order to increase model sensitivity and minimize the percentage of true presences predicted as absences e g barbet massin et al 2012 niche models of several regression based methods and parameterization complexities were developed for performance comparison using the feature subset ensembles developed from random subset feature selection see section 2 4 below maxent version 3 3 3 phillips et al 2006 in r r core team 2016 dismo package hijmans et al 2011 was used to develop presence only niche models with various feature complexities 1 linear features only 2 linear and quadratic features with no interactions 3 quadratic and forward and reverse hinge features quadratic hinge features in which linear features were only used if hinge features were not used models generally employed hinge in place of linear features and 4 various levels of l1 regularization various β regularization multiplication parameters from β0 to β40 with quadratic hinge features for details on analyses of β regularization parameter values see appendix a section 2 3 3 1 in order to restrain potentially unnecessary maxent model complexity we did not use additional product and threshold features we developed presence absence binomial logistic regression niche models for glm from the r dismo package and for glmnet using the glmnet r package friedman et al 2010 with 1 linear and 2 orthogonalized linear quadratic features in order to simplify computations we used only raw non orthogonalized linear quadratic feature glmnet models when projecting to raster performance did not differ between raw and orthogonalized glmnet linear quadratic models fig a 3 we provide model parameters and coefficients for final selected maxent models appendix b tables b 1 3 which is seldom done halvorsen 2013 model evaluation statistics such as the true skill statistic tss and area under the curve auc fielding and bell 1997 were calculated with the r presenceabsence package freeman and moisen 2008 using fire presence absence pa data to produce tsspa and aucpa this approach to calculating auc utilizes only the true fire absence data as absence data in contrast the default calculation of auc carried out within the maxent implementation of the r dismo package utilizes both random background data aucbg smith 2013 and presence points aucbgp as absence data we calculated the corrected akaike information criterion aicc for maxent warren and seifert 2011 as a measure of model complexity and information content bozdogan 1987 the typical calculation of aicc for maxent using the enmeval r package muscarella et al 2014 requires the time consuming generation of a maxent prediction raster consequently we developed an r script to more rapidly calculate aicc for thousands of models using maxent samples with data swd mode predictions for background and training presence point data which we termed background aicc or aiccbg for more details on calculation of aiccbg see appendix a section 2 3 3 2 values of aicc calculated using available methods for glm and glmnet models have different scales than either aicc or aiccbg calculated for maxent models making comparisons problematic in order to facilitate an approximate comparison of aicc for these models we derived a linear calibration equation to convert aicc of glm and glmnet models to aiccbg of maxent models under the assumption that aiccbg for maxent β2 linear feature models was directly proportional to aicc of glm linear feature models using the same training data and numbers and types of variables for further details see appendix a section 2 3 3 3 all comparisons between niche modelling methods were made using the same training data and the same initial set of randomly generated variable subsets top selected models by rsfsa auc ranking were calibrated using a random 2 3 of all data for training and 1 3 data for testing selecting a threshold of maximum tsspa liu et al 2013 to yield a binary burned unburned classification for the two mean fire intervals fire presence or absence in 31 years this same threshold was applied to wildfire activity models parameterized with variables of future climate scenarios the top four selected binary wildfire activity models for each burn severity were combined by frequency consensus cf porfirio et al 2014 to form feature subset ensembles we compared different highly ranked variables in the selected niche models across different climate scenarios in terms of their linear relationships with latitude across the study area for additional details on model selection and variable rankings see appendix a section 2 3 3 4 2 3 4 contemporary wildfire deficit in contrast to the practice of parks et al 2015 for assessing wildfire surplus or deficit using wildfire activity modelling we include areas with high human influence in training our models and incorporate additional anthropogenic and topographic variables this allows us to project what we distinguish as a contemporary wildfire surplus or deficit taking into account current anthropogenic influences we compare relative differences between actual and projected burned areas in order to estimate contemporary wildfire deficit and surplus for the cec 2005 ecoregions for each burn severity we also develop a contemporary wildfire deficit surplus rating map through comparing the raster of historical fire presence with the model projected wildfire activity for further details see appendix a section 2 3 3 5 2 4 random subset feature selection algorithm the rsfsa was carried out in two stages 1 the optimal feature subset size estimation stage and 2 the variable subset selection stage which includes statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of feature selected versus random feature niche models fig 3 within each of these two stages were two phases employing differing feature selection criteria and search strategies 1 the univariate filter phase involving a sequential forward search strategy to build hundreds or thousands of random variable subsets of various sizes with the filter of an absolute value of spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs less than 0 7 dormann et al 2013 between any variables of a subset and 2 the subset wrapper phase in which a random subset search strategy is utilized with wrappers of auc or aicc to rank the performance of niche models developed from the randomly generated variable subsets with wrapper training and testing data for evaluation of any feature selection algorithm it is critical to use randomly partitioned final training and testing data data used to evaluate performance of random versus feature selected niche models which is held out from the wrapper training and testing data data used for training testing and ranking niche models with a test wrapper in order to avoid selecting features performing better only for the model wrapper training and testing data kohavi and john 1997 the final product of rsfsa is a feature subset ensemble niche model developed from top ranked variable subsets of the selected size that perform better than random subsets fig 3 final rsfsa evaluation was replicated with 3 randomizations of wrapper training and testing and final training and testing data stracuzzi 2007 to test the stability of the rsfsa to different sets of training data kalousis et al 2007 our ensemble rsfsa is a hybrid filter wrapper approach c f jović et al 2015 we incorporate the generation of random subsets of a given size and the ranking of these subsets by wrapper performance in the modelling method as in garcia et al 2006 our rsfsa is novel in several ways including 1 application of a correlation filter when building the random subsets 2 estimating an optimal feature subset size 3 using niche model auc or aicc as wrappers for ranking subsets and 4 selecting a feature subset ensemble model of top selected subsets rather than combining the variables from top selected subsets our rsfsa also differs from the random subset feature selection rsfs of räsänen and pohjalainen 2013 which ranks individual features not feature subsets by the wrapper performance of multiple random subsets in which they appear pooling top ranked features into a single subset for subsequent modelling we developed the rsfsa using r software that takes advantage of parallel processing in both the filter and wrapper phases to simultaneously generate and evaluate thousands of variable subsets for the different niche modelling algorithms r code for rsfsa with maxent glm and glmnet including glmnet model raster prediction functions available at https github com jamesltracy rsfsa r we also developed and compared alternative novel rsfsa variants that use expert screened variables for maxent quadratic hinge β2 low burn severity wildfire activity niche models for details on rsfsa phases stages and variants see appendix a section 2 4 the rsfsa selected and random wildfire activity niche models were compared for three evaluation statistics 1 higher accuracy as measured by testing auc aucpa finaltest 2 relatively lower complexity and higher information content as measured by lower aiccbg final and 3 lower overfitting of the training data as measured by a lower difference between final training data aucpa finaltrain and final testing data aucpa finaltest which yields aucpa diff final auctrain minus auctest warren and seifert 2011 we also compared training auc aucpa finaltrain in combination with testing auc aucpa finaltest to evaluate underfitting among modelling methods relatively poor model accuracy for both the training data aucpa finalrain and testing data aucpa finaltest indicates a poorly fitted model c f harrell et al 1996 the rsfsa allows the researcher flexibility in both stages to subjectively balance niche model underfitting overfitting and information content with the desired level of model complexity in terms of the selected numbers of environmental variables and derived parameters 2 5 additional model assessment the post rsfsa stage iii involved final calibration of rsfsa selected models from stage ii using all of the presence data divided into 2 3 training and 1 3 testing described above in section 2 3 3 fig 3 we evaluated the potential influence of the number of variables in low burn severity wildfire activity models on projected burned areas within and beyond the background evaluation extent e g beaumont et al 2005 from the rsfsa selected models we additionally selected more conservative models in terms of projected burned area and map accuracy according to regional indices described in appendix a section 2 3 3 4 in order to better inform conservation management decisions e g schwartz 2012 2 6 statistical tests in order to allow for observed cases of unequal variance among wildfire activity model results the welch anova was used to test whether 1 model evaluation statistics did not differ among rsfsa selected models and random models and 2 projected burned areas within ecoregions or larger areas did not differ between models for current and future climate scenarios following a significant welch anova test separate secondary paired tests were performed using a welch t test with the holm correction to control for type i error related to the number of paired comparisons for each set of tests following a significant welch s one way anvova test pairwise multiple comparisons were conducted using the games and howell 1976 pairwise multiple comparison test which also allows for unequal variance and sample sizes 3 results 3 1 niche modelling methods and feature selection in estimating the optimal variable subset size rsfsa stage i we observed apparent trends of increased accuracy high aucpa finaltest lower complexity low aiccbg final and higher overfitting aucpa diff final as the number of variables per subset increased from three to 25 for wildfire activity models these trends hold for all three burn severity models as well as for all types of niche modelling methods including various parameterizations of maxent glm and glmnet models figs 4 and 5 a 5 8 for all burn severities maxent quadratic hinge models using β regularization multipliers of one two or three β1 β2 β3 and glm and glmnet linear quadratic models tended to exhibit higher training and testing auc which indicated lower underfitting and lower aiccbg i e greater information content however these models also displayed greater overfitting than simpler models as revealed by higher aucdiff figs 4 a 6 8 the glm and glmnet models of the same feature parameterization generally performed similarly for all evaluation statistics figs 4 a 5 7 an exception was the poor performance of some rsfsa selected linear quadratic glm models for moderate and high burn severities with larger sized variable subsets figs a 6 7 an increase in maxent quadratic hinge model β regularization values from zero no regularization to 40 high regularization fig a 8 produced a range in model performance similar to the various feature parameterization complexities of maxent glm and glmnet models figs 4 a 6 7 increasing l1 regularization for maxent quadratic hinge models lowered testing and training auc raised aiccbg and below 12 variable subsets lowered overfitting aucdiff only low burn severity maxent quadratic hinge models with β regularization values around five or less β 5 achieved lower aiccbg than maxent models with no l1 regularization β0 fig a 8c the rsfsa selected variable subset models ranked by either aucpa wrappertest or aiccbg wrapper show improvement over random models for all of the niche modelling methods figs 5 a 5 generally the sharpest visual changes in model evaluation statistics occurred over an increase in subset size from six to 15 variables consequently we chose six and 15 variable subsets for further evaluation in rsfsa stage ii for conducting statistical comparisons among modelling methods part of rsfsa stage ii we increased replications for 15 variable models with the best performance in auc and aiccbg the maxent quadratic hinge β1 β2 β3 and glm and glmnet linear quadratic models low burn severity maxent quadratic hinge models exhibited significantly lower underfitting as indicated by higher training and testing auc and lower aicc than the three training replicate sets of glm and glmnet linear quadratic models p 0 05 games howell pairwise multiple comparison test preceded by significant welch s one way anova test p 0 05 fig a 9a c in contrast the glm and glmnet linear quadratic models performed significantly better in terms of lower overfitting fig a 9d among the low burn severity maxent quadratic hinge models those of β1 and β2 performed significantly better in most training sets than β3 models in terms of lower underfitting higher training and testing auc fig a 9a b in addition the maxent quadratic hinge β2 models performed better than β1 and β3 models in terms of lower aiccbg fig a 9c and for most training replicates they usually had significantly lower overfitting than β1 models fig a 9d corresponding results for moderate and high burn severity models were generally similar but not as consistent due to unstable results for rsfsa with linear quadratic glm models in some training replicates figs a 10 11 see appendix a section 3 1 for details overall maxent quadratic hinge β2 models performed best in terms of lower underfitting and higher information content and they were selected for further evaluation for wildfire activity niche models of all three burn severities we compared six and 15 variables maxent quadratic hinge β2 models and found significant trends for both higher accuracy and lower complexity for 15 variable models across all three training set replications when using the rsfsa aucpa wrappertest wrapper p 0 05 welch t test with holm correction preceded by significant welch anova test p 0 05 fig a 12a f however a little over half of these rsfsa replications across all burn severities showed a significant increasing trend for overfitting from six to 15 variable subsets fig a 12g i we also evaluated the projected burned areas in mha of rsfsa selected six ten and 15 variable maxent quadratic hinge and 15 variable glmnet linear quadratic wildfire activity binary models for low burn severity no apparent differences and no relationships were found in the areas projected as burned either within or beyond the background evaluation extent fig a 13 a b we selected the 15 variable subset size for maxent quadratic hinge β2 models for further evaluation with rsfsa in order to compare ranking using auc versus aiccbg in completing rsfsa stage ii evaluations we further compared the efficiency of the aucpa wrappertest versus the aiccbg wrapper for improving performance of the chosen 15 variable maxent quadratic hinge β2 models we found significantly higher accuracy aucpa finaltest for models selected with rsfsa wrappers of either aucpa wrappertest or aiccbg wrapper compared to random models for all three replications of all three burn severities p 0 05 welch t test with holm correction preceded by significant welch anova test p 0 05 fig 6 a c we found consistently improved lower model complexity aiccbg final for all three burn severities using the aucpa wrappertest wrapper but not the aiccbg wrapper wrapper fig 6d f the rsfsa selected models from aiccbg wrapper and aucpa wrappertest wrappers achieved significantly reduced overfitting compared to random models across all three replications for the low burn severity fig 6g and high burn severity models fig 6i respectively we chose the rsfsa aucpa wrappertest wrapper method which was more consistent for optimizing aiccbg final for selecting maxent wildfire models for all three burn severities attempts to obtain lower overfitting for all three replicates for moderate burn severity models using 10 12 and 17 variable subset sizes or combinations of wrappers e g aucpa wrappertest and aiccbg final were also unsuccessful results not shown in consideration of the variability of burned areas projected for rsfsa selected 15 variable subset models figs a 13 a a 14 regional indices were employed to select the top four most conservative models in terms of burned area within the background evaluation extent for details see appendix a section 2 3 3 4 the rsfsa selected 15 variable maxent β2 quadratic hinge models for all three burn severities actually employed 14 to 15 environmental variables from which 81 103 derived features were used in the model equation see appendix b tables b 1 3 for derived features for each selected model provided in embedded maxent lambdas text files the use of an expert filter to narrow down our initial set of variables from 90 to 38 did not significantly improve performance of the rsfsa for maxent quadratic hinge β2 15 variable low burn severity wildfire activity models only models developed from random sets of 38 of 90 variables and ranked with aucpa wrappertest auc38of90 consistently produced significant improvement over models developed from unranked random sets rand38of90 in all three evaluation statistics including overfitting aucpa diff final p 0 05 welch t test with holm correction preceded by significant welch anova test p 0 05 fig a 15 improvements over random models for evaluation statistics of rsfsa selected models derived from 38 expert selected variables were generally similar to that seen in rsfsa selected models from 38 random variables or the entire 90 variable set fig a 15 3 2 selected features for wildfire activity models the top four rsfsa aucpa wrappertest wrapper selected 15 variable maxent quadratic hinge β2 wildfire activity models for each of the three burn severities 12 models total were quite varied in their composition of variables sixty of the 90 total variables were used at least once in the four rsfsa selected models of each burn severity table 1 variables correlated above the rs threshold of 0 7 which were not allowed in the same model could sometimes appear in different rsfsa selected models in the selected feature subset ensemble for example annual and spring quarter evapotranspiration ratio are correlated at 0 97 rs over the background presence points and these variables appeared in two different selected low burn severity wildfire activity models table b 1 for top selected models of all burn severities three variables were shared among the top ten ranked variables by mean permutation importance and frequency of appearance table a 4 1 slope slope with higher values more associated with more wildfire figs a 16 f a 17 a a 18 a 2 percent agricultural land cover agric lc with higher values associated with less wildfire figs a 16d a 17d a 18d and 3 precipitation in the summer quarter prec sumq with higher values generally associated with more fire fig a 17 f in addition five of the top ten variables were shared among models of at least two burn severities 1 mean temperature of the driest quarter bio 9 2 elevation elev 3 evapotranspiration ratio of the spring quarter etrt sprq 4 actual evapotranspiration for the spring quarter aett spr and 5 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio 8 among these eight commonly high ranked variables five are climatic indices two are topographic indices and one is an anthropogenic index there were some clear differences among the three burn severities in the top ranked variables in the four rsfsa selected models table a 4 for example the three top ranked variables in low burn severity models were precipitation in the spring quarter 3 4 models percent agricultural land cover all four models and mean temperature of the driest quarter bio 9 3 4 models the three top ranked variables in moderate burn severity models were slope all four models actual evapotranspiration for the spring quarter 3 4 models and percent agricultural land cover all four models for high burn severity models the three top ranked variables were slope all four models mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio 8 3 4 models and elevation 3 4 models for permutation importance and response curves for variables of the single top models see appendix a section 3 2 table a 5 figs a 16 19 3 3 projections for wildfire activity models 3 3 1 current climate

least 60 of the 46 level iii ecoregions within the background evaluation extent the projected burned areas for all three burn severities were at least 5 greater than the area actually burned figs 7 9 tables a 6 8 at least 25 of the level iii ecoregions for all three burn severities exhibited severe contemporary wildfire deficits with projected burned areas greater than or equal to 50 percentage points higher than the actual area burned in addition these ecoregions also had at least 50 usually much more of their total area projected as burned very high contemporary wildfire deficit ratings were widespread in various ecoregions throughout the western us for all three burn severities figs a 20 22 for further details including embedded zipped shapefiles for wildfire deficit rating maps for each burn severity see appendix a section 3 3 1 3 3 2 future climate there were generally more significant differences between current and future projected burned areas for low burn severity wildfire

decreases in large wildfires were generally below 35 n for further details including relationships between important climate indices and latitude across the study area for climate scenarios of different burn severities see appendix a section 3 3 2 and fig a 23 4 discussion 4 1 niche modelling methods and feature selection feature selection with rsfsa facilitates optimizing the performance of a variety of niche modelling methods in terms of both the number of variables employed and the features included in the variable subsets we found no improvement in rsfsa selected model performance from using an expert based filter for our initial set of 90 variables the feature selection ensembles generated through rsfsa facilitate comparison of niche models utilizing different feature subset sizes various niche modelling methods and niche models across different species phenomena or scenarios e g climates for example we utilized feature subset ensembles based on rsfsa selected models to identify statistical differences in projected burned areas across climate scenarios in addition feature subset ensembles allowed the use of highly correlated variables in different wildfire activity models improving representation of model uncertainty which is especially important for climate scenario models braunisch et al 2013 the rsfsa generated feature subset ensembles facilitated comparison of niche modelling methods across a variety of subset sizes for different feature types e g linear versus quadratic and levels of l1 regularization β1 β40 e g warren and seifert 2011 anderson and gonzalez 2011 morales et al 2017 we found that simpler linear or linear quadratic maxent glm and glmnet models have lower overfitting aucdiff than more complex quadratic hinge maxent models however these simpler models also have comparably higher underfitting lower training and testing auc and lower information content higher aiccbg model underfitting has been observed to more negatively affect performance of maxent models than overfitting using simulation data with a variety of metrics warren and seifert 2011 consequently we chose to emphasize the reduction in model underfitting and increased information content by choosing the maxent quadratic hinge models over simpler maxent glmnet or glm models for projecting wildfire activity other studies have found that maxent models using all features and just linear quadratic features outperform linear quadratic probit glm thibaud et al 2014 and linear quadratic logistic glmnet dicko et al 2014 models respectively however guillera arroita et al 2014 found that logistic glmnet linear quadratic models outperformed maxent quadratic hinge models in terms of root mean squared error with simulated data for moderate and high burn severity models developed from larger variable subsets we found that feature selection results were more stable for maxent and glmnet linear quadratic models than for glm linear quadratic models in agreement with radosavljevic and anderson 2014 we found that a maxent beta regularization multiplier value slightly above the default value of β1 namely β2 can reduce overfitting for maxent models in addition our maxent quadratic hinge β2 models generally had lower aiccbg compared to both β1 and β3 models a maxent beta regularization value of around five or less β5 was necessary to see improvement in lower aiccbg than maxent wildfire activity models without regularization β0 as maxent quadratic hinge model l1 regularization is increased from β1 to β40 over a broad range of variable subset sizes model overfitting decreases lower aucdiff but there is an increase in model underfitting lower training and testing auc and decrease in model information content higher aiccbg although our maxent quadratic hinge β2 wildfire activity models had high numbers of derived features we were able to effectively utilize maxent software outputs of variable permutation importance and variable response curves for interpretation of the more important variables the potential use of rsfsa to directly select derived maxent variables as halvorsen et al 2015 2016 did using sequential feature selection may facilitate further model optimization with lower numbers of parameters we regard maxent quadratic hinge β2 niche models as potentially widely suitable for use in rsfsa with large sets of occurrence data and many environmental variables niche models employing rsfsa should utilize about twice the minmum sample size of occurrence data that is normally recommended e g proosdij et al 2016 in order to facilitate evaluation of rsfsa selected versus random models using one half of the data held out for final testing the rsfsa selected maxent quadratic hinge β2 models exhibited significantly lower underfitting higher training and testing auc higher information content lower aiccbg and sometimes lower overfitting aucdiff in comparison to models generated from random variable subsets in contrast increasing levels of embedded feature selection using l1 regularization higher values of β for rsfsa selected maxent quadratic hinge models resulted in lower overfitting lower aucdiff but greater underfitting lower training and testing auc and lower information content higher aiccbg the combined use of rsfsa and l1 regularization can work together for improving the balance of overfitting underfitting and information content in niche models in feature selection two variables that are useless by themselves in improving model accuracy can be useful and highly relevant together guyon and elisseeff 2003 the success of the rsfsa in reducing model underfitting and improving information content probably benefits from its ability to identify variable combinations that are synergistic in terms of model relevancy among the thousands of screened models the randomized search strategy we employ has several advantages over the sequential search strategy evaluation of individual variables in sequence that has most often been employed in feature selection for niche modelling especially with maxent e g mouton et al 2009 bradley et al 2010 lahoz monfort et al 2010 bellamy and altringham 2015 halvorsen et al 2015 2016 yost et al 2008 jueterbock et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 the random subset selection search strategy can 1 better avoid entrapment in local minima selecting the best feature subset at the moment liu and motoda 1998 jović et al 2015 2 better identify synergistic combinations of variables c f guyon and elisseeff 2003 and 3 take better advantage of parallel processing in evaluating several random variable subsets simultaneously garcia et al 2006 the tendency of niche models utilizing larger sets of variables to exhibit a higher auctest has been demonstrated previously e g synes and osborne 2011 thus a convergence in auctest values between random and rsfsa selected models is expected as auctest values increase with growing variable subset size over a broad range of niche modelling methods of increasing variable subset sizes we also observed a strong correlation between improved increasing values of auctest and improved decreasing values aiccbg zeng et al 2016 their fig 1 also observed a general decrease in aicc as the number of maxent environmental variables increased similar to beaumont et al 2005 we found no effect of variable subset sizes from six to 15 variables on the projected area burned in maxent models we also found no correlation among projected burned areas within the background evaluation extent with the projected area burned beyond the background evaluation extent therefore we expect that the projected area burned within the background evaluation extent for current climate probably also has little to no relationship to the projected area burned across future climate scenarios either within or beyond the background evaluation extent as a result our choice of more conservative maxent models in terms of current projected area burned within the background evaluation extent probably did not produce more conservative estimates for burned areas when extrapolating the models across space or time 4 2 selected features for wildfire activity models only about half of the top ranked variables across rsfsa selected maxent quadratic hinge β2 models for all three burn severities were expert selected variables from previous studies table a 3 consequently screening a wider initial set of 90 variables allowed us to identify additional important variables for modelling wildfire activity such as mean temperature of the driest quarter bio 9 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio 8 spring actual evapotranspiration aett sprq and spring evapotranspiration ratio etrt sprq for the top four rsfa selected wildfire activity models for each burn severity a generally higher proportion of climatic indices 42 were utilized compared to topographic 31 and anthropogenic 27 indices table 1 in contrast dillon et al 2011 found that topographic variables especially elevation and topographic position index with a 2 km radius were generally more important than climate and weather variables for non spatial high burn severity models developed with the random forests algorithm similar to our results they found models performed better when including several categories of topographic climate and weather variables together in contrast to using a single category of topographic variables within the climatic indices for our maxent quadratic hinge β2 wildfire activity models there was a tendency for top rsfsa selected models to include about equal percentages of bioclim and aet pet indices indicating the importance of including both of these groups of indices in wildfire activity models although lower percentages of suppclim indices were used in our wildfire activity models compared to other climatic indices table 1 some were among the top ranked indices such as precipitation in the summer quarter prec sumq within the topographic indices the geomorphologic indices ranked higher than the hydrogeomorphologic indices table a 4 three of the five variables used in the wildfire activity models of parks et al 2015 were included in our study 1 annual actual evapotranspiration 2 annual precipitation and 3 annual climate water deficit snow water equivalent and soil moisture were excluded two of these variables total annual evapotranspiration and annual climate water deficit appeared in some of our rsfsa selected 15 variable maxent quadratic hinge β2 models for low burn severity wildfires table 1 in addition precipitation in the summer quarter closely related to annual precipitation occurred in models for all three burn severities of the 17 anthropogenic indices only agricultural land cover was among the top ten ranked variables for rsfsa selected maxent quadratic hinge β2 wildfire activity models of all three burn severities appearing in every model higher amounts of agricultural land cover were associated with lower probability of wildfire for all three burn severities reduced wildfire probability with higher agricultural land cover is probably related to reduced availability of woody vegetation as fuel several previous studies have also found that anthropogenic indices including agricultural land cover and a variety of other indices related to anthropogenic fire ignition and suppression are of critical importance to modelling large scale wildfire activity kalabokidis et al 2002 liu and wimberly 2016 robinne et al 2016 mann et al 2016 4 3 projections for wildfire activity models 4 3 1 current climate we project wildfire activity at one km resolution over a larger area of western north america than has been done previously employing a novel combination of different niche model types with the mtbs data used by liu and wimberly 2016 and parks et al 2016 and additional data from the mtbs and landfire databases the auctest values of our wildfire models for the three burn severity classes were fairly high above 0 84 even though severe contemporary wildfire deficits were projected for many ecoregions similar to parks et al 2015 we observed a general trend of greater contemporary wildfire deficits projected among forested ecoregions in addition we found that the proportion of ecoregions projected with severe contemporary wildfire deficits increased with increasing burn severity for the northwestern forested mountains the current climate multiclass burn severity category models of parks et al 2016 also project greater high burn severity fires in these northwestern forested ecoregions in contrast to projections for forested ecoregions we projected only a small proportion of non forested level i ecoregions with severe contemporary wildfire deficits for the low and moderate burn severity categories the severity of our projected contemporary wildfire deficits in forested ecoregions for all burn severity categories were generally much greater than found for wildfire deficits in similarly defined forested ecoregions by parks et al 2015 the generally higher projected contemporary wildfire deficits in our models could be related to finer scale detection of variation in wildfire activity due to our use of a higher spatial resolution one km2 and additional variables particularly agricultural land cover we make available 1 km resolution contemporary wildfire deficit ratings map shapefiles for all three burn severities for the western us that may assist land managers in identifying areas with greater long term potential hazard for large wildfires see embedded shapefiles in appendix a section 3 3 1 many areas with little or no data on contemporary wildfire deficits e g much of the east texas central plains and arizona new mexico plateau ecoregions may have had pre columbian mean fire return intervals greater than or equal to those seen in the recent historical 31 year 1984 2014 period used in our study but land use land cover change to cultivation urbanization and heavy grazing has probably led to long term anthropogenic fire suppression 4 3 2 future climate future projections of increased low burn severity wildfires in several northern ecoregions may be associated with projected changes in three important bioclimatic indices 1 higher mean temperatures of the driest quarter bio 9 2 decreases in mean precipitation during the summer quarter prec sumq in the north but not in the south and 3 increases in mean precipitation during the spring quarter prec sprq in the north but not in the south potentially increased primary productivity for northern ecoregions associated with projected increases in spring precipitation may favor larger areas of low burn severity wildfires projected increases in temperature for the driest quarter bio 9 and decreases in summer precipitation prec sumq in the north may favor wildfire ignition and propagation of low burn severity wildfires rogers et al 2013 similarly projected future increased wildfire activity in the pacific northwest from increased summer droughts related to decreased summer precipitation and higher summer temperatures and increased fuel loads related to higher winter precipitation projections of smaller areas of large low burn severity wildfires in some southern ecoregions may be related to projected reductions in rainfall e g prec sprq at southern latitudes which could be associated with lower primary productivity for further discussion of variable influence on climate projections see appendix a section 4 1 our wildfire activity models do not attempt to incorporate projections of the complex long term interactions between vegetation population dynamics and changes in extreme weather events such as prolonged drought that could greatly impact future landscape wildfire activity mckenzie and littell 2017 in addition there is considerable uncertainty in the accuracy of both the original mtbs burn severity classifications used in training our models kolden et al 2015 and in the gcms used for projecting future climate in western north america for example several gcms project generally drier and warmer conditions in southwestern north america over this century swain and hayhoe 2015 such as we observed in projected reduced spring precipitation prec sprq with the hadgem2 es gcm for 2070 fig a 23b however chylek et al 2014 report that the historically cyclic influences of the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo and pacific decadal oscillation pdo indices are poorly incorporated into gcms furthermore they maintain that projected amo pdo cycles may lead to stable temperatures and increased precipitation over the next several decades in the southwestern us which is in contrast to projections from gcms we also caution the interpretation of our wildfire activity model projections in areas such as central mexico that are far beyond the background evaluation extent of our continental us training data in spite of uncertainties our models are in general agreement with several other recent studies projecting future increases in burned areas in western north america especially for low and moderate burn severity wildfires parks et al 2016 liu and wimberly 2016 5 conclusions 5 1 feature selection for niche modelling a novel random subset feature selection algorithm was used to effectively screen a large number of variables to develop a feature subset ensemble of optimally sized feature subsets that can increase performance for a variety of niche modelling methods the feature selection algorithm does not improve niche model performance over expert selected models but it facilitates identification of new relevant variables or variable combinations that can be useful in developing and interpreting the models the algorithm is especially useful in identifying variables for modelling tasks about which little expert information is available in addition identification of alternative high performing models of different variable subsets by the feature selection algorithm is important in accounting for model uncertainty in comparisons across modelling methods or scenarios the utilization of highly collinear variables in separate models of selected feature subset ensembles can be valuable for reflecting model uncertainty our feature selection algorithm affords the researcher flexibility in balancing the levels of niche model underfitting overfitting and information content and the number and complexity of model parameters the combination of random subset feature selection with l1 regularization via maxent quadratic hinge β2 models appears to be especially suitable for developing feature subset ensembles representing higher performance niche models when large sets of occurrence data and environmental variables are available as is the case with wildfire activity further studies are needed to assess the performance of the random subset feature selection algorithm for improving niche models for species and of other phenomena and using pseudoabsence data and differing niche modelling methods such as bioclim and random forests c f jović et al 2015 the degree of spatial variability in feature selected models versus random models for current and future climate scenarios should also be examined comparisons of the spatial variability of feature subset ensemble models from random subset feature selection should also be made with other types of model ensembles such as training set ensembles and multi algorithm ensembles e g zhang et al 2015 additional niche model evaluation statistics could also be investigated for use in feature selection such as the hosmer lemeshow goodness of fit statistic for logistic regression potential improvements in model transferability across space and time using various feature selection strategies can also be explored 5 2 implications for conservation comparisons of historical and projected wildfire activity indicate that unnaturally low fire return intervals amounting to severe contemporary wildfire deficits are widespread in the western us including in areas of conservation concern such as the madrean archilpelago ecoregion of southern arizona and new mexico embedded zipped shapefiles of contemporary wildfire deficits are provided in appendix a section 3 3 1 where feasible reduction of anthropogenic fire suppression such as by limiting grazing and increasing prescribed or wildland fires may be critical for maintaining the integrity of fire dependent western montane ecosystems e g noss et al 2006 the projected reductions in fire frequency through climate change in southwestern north america could further degrade natural fire regimes of fire dependent ecosystems making long term reduction of anthropogenic fire suppression even more imperative in contrast our models projected future increases in wildfire activity in forested ecoregions of northwestern north america in these northwestern forests it will be critical to remove excess fuel build up such as through prescribed burns to prevent increased

25264,assessment of ecological status is crucial for establishing well defined reference conditions for a lake in this study a model based on system dynamics was developed to simulate the production transport and distribution of the nutrients in lake chenghai yunnan province china application of the proposed model with a system retrieval technique yielded the variations in nutrient concentrations and eutrophication levels under different hydraulic conditions during the past several decades results showed that the proposed model is capable of describing the historical process of the lake s eutrophication after calibrating with the experimental data the reference conditions for lake chenghai were proposed as follows 0 0074 0 0091 mg l for the total phosphorus concentration 0 112 0 128 mg l for the total nitrogen concentration 0 859 1 081 ug l for the chlorophyll a concentration and 6 327 5 557 m for the secci depth transparency it provided an effective way to establish the nutrient reference conditions for the foundation of a lake s nutrient criteria as well as the eutrophication control standards in china keywords nutrient criteria reference conditions system dynamics simulation lake chenghai 1 introduction well defined lake trophic status and reference conditions are the basis for the development of scientifically rational criteria and standards for water quality and trophic status of a lake which are critical for effective eutrophication control and restoration of aquatic ecosystems xu et al 2010 developed countries such as the united states japan australia establish regional water quality criteria and standards for eutrophication control in the early 21st century which were based on their characteristics of aquatic systems and environmental protection expectations china is one of the largest developing countries a series of water quality standards such as hygienic standard for drinking water water quality standard for farm irrigation and surface water quality standard and so on have been formulated but still lacks special water quality criteria system for lakes which now is substituted by surface water quality standards in some cases therefore the development of water quality criteria system for lakes will be of great significance for both theoretical research and practical application meng et al 2008 xia et al 2004 total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and chlorophyll a chl a are generally used to characterize reference conditions for nutrient criteria of a lake these represent the lake s conditions with the least anthropogenic disturbances and pollution or the most attainable conditions painting et al 2005 however almost all lakes of china have been impacted more or less by human activities and it is difficult to determine the degree of human impacts therefore it is necessary to establish reference conditions of a lake previous studies have reported several methods to define the reference conditions such as the statistical analysis of the historical data model prediction and inference reconstruction of the ancient limnology and expert judgments andersen et al 2004 solheim 2005 chen et al 1998 however due to the regional differences in climate and geography as well as the heavy interference of human activity to most of the lakes and the general lack of historical monitoring data the reported methods are not appropriate for direct use in china in order to define the lake reference conditions of nutrients in china the efforts have been made through preliminary studies for example huo et al 2009 analyzed the significance of several reported methods to develop lake nutrient criteria in china the reference conditions for lake taihu were established through a population frequency distribution analysis with respect to tn tp chlorophyll a and secchi depth zheng et al 2009 then based on the eastern plain paleolimnology reconstruction information along with the existing water quality data chen et al 2010 estimated the ranges of the four parameters of the nutrient reference conditions for lake chaohu by using lake population distribution trisection and regression approaches yan and wu 1994 fang and yan 2007 it is widely known that a lake is a specific ecoregion with nutrient production transport transformation and so on which is integrated with watersheds to form a relatively independent complex system however a lack of integrated and systematic data currently exists for lake eutrophication in china liu and guo 2008 zhang et al 2007 lake water resource system is a complex system which will have an impact on both the regional socio economic development and ecological system balance long et al 2004 rijsberman and van de ven 2000 while it is difficult to model the lake watershed system for its uncertain influence factors of unclear administrative attribution and boundaries incomplete information and so on endter wada et al 1998 gaiser et al 2008 gibson et al 2000 conventional mechanical description and inference approaches are not sufficient to establish a complete systematic model for such a complex system chen 1999 chou et al 2007 cheng 1999 the motion of all systems in the world is assumed as the motion of fluid according to system dynamics method sdm which overall adopts the causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagram to represent the structure and nonlinear feedback relationship within the system jǿgensen 2003 wang et al 2007 therefore the primary objective of this research was to present a sdm model coupled with system retrieval technique and eutrophication assessment method to characterize the production distribution and transport of nutrients in the lake chenghai by developing the causal feedback diagrams between kinds of nutrients concentration and its influencing factors under different influence scenarios of watershed hydrology ecology and human activities zhang et al 2008 and finally the threshold of nutrient reference conditions was obtained which would provide an effective basis to establish the nutrient reference conditions for the establishment of lake nutrient criteria and eutrophication control standards in china besides due to the advantages of intuitivism practicality flexibility and convenience sdm has been widely applied in socio economic strategic military and resource utilization systems by coupling with other mathematical models wang 1996 2 material and methods lake chenghai known as the black sea or black wuhai is located in the central yongsheng county in yunnan province between liangguan and star lake 45 km from the county center jin 1995 it is located at 26 27 26 38 north latitude and 100 30 26 49 longitude and is part of the jinsha river system it is one of the nine plateau lakes in yunnan province and is also one of the world s three lakes with growing spirulina the other two are lake cocoa in mexico and lake chad in africa it presents the status quo of a long and narrow lake the catchment area is 318 3 km2 with the land area of 243 km2 shoreline length of 45 1 km and water area of 74 6 km2 the north south length of the lake is 19 0 km with a maximum width of 5 4 km the average width of the lake is 4 3 km with a storage capacity of 1 98 billion m3 the average water depth is 25 7 m with the deepest water depth of 35 0 m the inclination of lake chenghai s bed is large however the shallow water is less than 0 87 of the water depth up to 20 m chenghai lake originally emptied into the jinsha river until 1609 after which the water level declined year by year until no more water entered into the jinsha river it gradually evolved into an inland lake with no outlet however a part of the lake includes a groundwater excretion which is not derived from river input fig 1 2 1 natural basin ecosystem model of lake chenghai lake chenghai is located in the jinsha river valley and has a subtropical plateau monsoon climate the annual average temperature of the lake is approximately 18 7 c with no frost occurring at any time during the year in the lake area the wet and dry seasons are obvious although the four seasons are not distinct the sun illumination is sufficient and the duration of sunshine ranges between 2500 and 2750 h the 10 c accumulated temperature reaches between 5000 and 6000 c every year 2 1 1 water resources and environment subsystems of lake chenghai s basin according to the statistics from the hydrological station of hekou street 26 28 n and 100 39 e during the last 20 years its average annual rainfall was 733 6 mm and the rain period was between 90 and 100 days rainfall during the dry seasons was extremely rare and the annual evaporation was 2040 mm with the drought index of approximately 2 4 yielding a seasonally arid environment the precipitation during the rainy season accounted for 92 of total annual precipitation the lake water was mainly from watershed runoff and precipitation the lake s elevation is 1501 m and the highest point in the watershed is 3280 0 m which is located in the western basin of the lake in this study according to the field observations it was found that the remains of algae were still visible on the bank of the lake above 30 m which further demonstrated the fact that the water s course to the sea experienced significant levels of fluctuations in the past according to the historical statistics of 276 years between 1690 and 1965 the water flowed over 30 km south into the jinsha river and formed the cheng river system since then the total water has dropped 37 8 m due to water depletion and reduced rainfall therefore lake chenghai has become a closed lake without outflow with many years of fixed ground water recharge its water supply is mainly from groundwater and lake precipitation the basin rainfall data from 1970 to 2009 is shown in fig 2 lake chenghai is located in the dry heat zone of the jinsha river the lake evaporation is three times that of the entire basin precipitation the long term water deficits have led to continuous decline in the lake s water level to prevent the continued decline a diversion tunnel project was built in august 1993 at present local government is building a massive water diversion project to bring water from the yongsheng river into the lake also irrigation projects were controlled in order to maintain the water level of chenghai lake when the diversion complement sea project was completed in 1994 the lake s water level tended towards stability therefore it could be seen that the lake s water was derived mainly from the runoff and precipitation of lakes basin the roles of the rainfall and evaporation were the dominant factors in controlling the water level in accordance with the existing discharge data regarding the watershed rainfall evaporation and water storage a dynamic system model of lakes water subsystem was constructed as fig 3 2 1 2 subsystem of the chenghai river basin land resource in the new generation of the mid tertiary dating back to 12 million years the himalayan orogeny formed a fault graben which was trapped in the low lying places in polywater from the highland lakes and is geologically referred to as the fall of the lake the lake is ringed on three sides east west and north by mountains the terrain is flat in the south and clastic rock in the east with a slow slope in the north carbonate rock forms a mountainous terrain in the middle and basalt forms an endless steep mountain range in the west the landscape is generally high in the northwest low in the southeast high on two sides and low in the center the rock of the lake is mainly permian basalt and tuff jurassic mudstone sandstone limestone devonian limestone and so on around the lake zonal soil is spread mainly in the form of red red brown and farming soil along the lake the lake has sparse vegetation and the soil erosion is severe the lake has also developed widely basalt sandstone dolomitic limestone and shale the land in the lake chenghai watershed is mainly used as forested agricultural urban construction residential land areas with rural hills lakes and so on the woodland area is less than normal and accounts for only 23 19 to the total forest area the vast majority of the land is woodland and shrub land which accounts for 76 18 of the total land area due to the fact that the land is not highly arable the cultivated land resource development is restricted by the surrounding environment these areas account for 7 74 of the river catchment area which is slightly higher than the provincial average 7 20 but below the national average simultaneously the soil erosion is considered to be serious the most serious soil erosion areas in this province are located in yongsheng county and the chenghai river basin is even more extreme the soil erosion area accounts for 61 59 to the total which is much higher than the province s average the soil erosion modulus is 784 000 t km2 a the severe and extreme intensity of the soil erosion mainly occurs from the liu river to the east of lake to the mountains at the lower part of the tuanshan mountain river strong erosion has occurred from the beam of the mazongzi mountains in northeast of lake chenghai to mount jiguan the moderate erosion areas are mainly distributed in the mountains around the lake as well as the upper part of the lake the flat dams at the south and north ends of the lake have slight or low erosion zones the land use from 1985 to 2005 is shown in the table 1 in this study in accordance with the main landforms of the chenghai river basin the land resources of the sdm flow diagram were established as fig 4 2 2 social and economic system model of the chenghai river basin the lake chenghai watershed is a predominantly agricultural production area in less developed area during recent years a small amount of industrial production input has occurred in the basin in 2007 the rural economic revenues reached 98 32 million yuan the farmers pure revenue was 1303 yuan with 420 kg of grain per capita there were several aspects which characterized the main economic industry as follows 1 in the vegetable industry there were 11 871 mu of grown vegetables which mainly included early fava beans peas tomatoes and garlic the total output of these vegetables was 26 280 t with the value of 27 million yuan and included garlic planting at 12 500 mu with an output value of 37 million yuan the vegetable industry has become an important economic growth point for increasing farmers income agricultural efficiency and rural stability in chenghai town 2 in 2007 the total tobacco planting was 3100 mu the total volume and gross output value of the flue cured tobacco hitted a new high the flue cured tobacco industry has become one of the main profitable industries of the mountain people 3 in regards to food crops in the appropriate areas high quality rice planting had been promoted resulting in 42 631 mu of grain being produced each year 4 for animal husbandry there were 1520 large livestock 7747 pigs and 77 47 t of meat produced which achieved an output value of 2 3241 million yuan for the animal husbandry industry in this area 5 in regards to fishing there were 950 t of fish produced of which bright silver fish was 470 t and 480 t of produced fish were native varieties including carp white fish small fish red wing carp sharksucker and so on the fish production in this area achieved an output value of 7 66 million yuan 6 at the end of 1998 spirulina farming had achieved a domestic output value of 74 million yuan the lake chenghai watershed is located in the center of yongsheng county which is located in yongbei town and includes 15 townships it lies in the northwest section of yunnan province as well as the central part of lijiang city and belongs to the upper reaches of the yangtze river its range includes 12 village committees in addition to gifford two villages are located in mountainous and mid level regions and the remaining 10 villages in the lake chenghai area are located at the dam area in the late 2003 the total population of the county was 383 997 of which 28 673 were a non agricultural population group accounting for 7 5 of the total population with the agricultural population of 355 324 and accounting for 92 5 of the total population also the total population of the ethnic minorities group was 121 162 accounting for 31 6 of the total population in the county in 2004 the population of lake chenghai was 41 512 of which 3 8 were the non agricultural population the total population was 41 042 and 41 198 in 2006 and 2007 respectively a subsystem sdm flowchart of the basin s population groups can be seen in fig 5 as mentioned earlier due to the lack of industrial economic activities the industrial gdp in recent years accounted for less than 10 in the overall river basin therefore it has been generalized in this study by a simple model of low growth due to the lake s spirulina breeding in recent years at the growing stage its proportion of nutrients in the lake s pollutants was also larger which had a direct and profound impacts on the water quality therefore it was examined as a separate subsystem of spirulina farming in this study currently five spirulina farms belonging to the shipurui co have been established on the south east bank and are quickly becoming the world s largest spirulina agricultural base its annual output of algae powder amounts to more than 1000 t also its developed production includes spirulina powder tablets capsules soft drinks cosmetics and other products which are sold both in china and internationally fig 6 in this study based on the comprehensive consideration of the previously mentioned elements the cultivated land areas and farmland fertilizers such as tn and tp as well as other closely related factors were introduced into the system model and the sdm flow diagram of the agricultural production subsystem see the land use subsystem of agricultural production the model was inferred from a necessary generalization in the process of establishing a system this was due to the fact that the nutrition and hierarchical structure reflected the material recycling process in the lake s water ecosystem which was the foundation of the hydrodynamics of the lake s water ecosystem model therefore the flow of nutrients was a chain and the system hierarchy was a guide which were used in this study to establish a simple lake ecosystem dynamic model then based on the consideration of the lake basin s nutrients tp tn input and output the roles of the nutrients were mainly focused on the subsidence and erosion of the lake exchange with the lake s bottom mud and the relationship between the chlorophyll a water ecosystem chla and transparency sd the sdm flow chart of the subsystems is shown in fig 7 3 lake chenghai calibration of the system simulation model the solving and calibrating of a model s parameters is one of the key links in the complex system simulation after a lake s ecological economic system dynamic simulation model has been established historical monitoring and related research objects are used to estimate the parameters and solve the model equations then a complete efficacy and sensitivity analysis is conducted after the establishment of a completed model is finally confirmed 3 1 consistency test of the model s dimensions a dimensional inspection is a type of well known fast and effective methods for the determination of a geometric or physical formula in mathematical equations similarly for complex systems simulation models a series of problems may exist during the modeling process through the consistency testing of the model s dimensions which can potentially assist modelers in identifying and resolving deficiencies and defects in the model in this study after the verification was completed through a dimensional consistency validation using vensim software the results showed that the model was correct in both structure and logic 3 2 extreme conditions and border inspection of the model the model used in this study was a simulation of the real world as well as the researchers perceptions in order to improve the effectiveness of the model it was necessary to observe and verify whether the real world things were included in the model and to make a behavioral pattern comparison of the model and real systems 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the model s parameters a parameter sensitivity analysis is a method which studies and analyses the sensitive degree of a model state the sensitivity analysis can determine the parameters with the greatest influence on the system model some required assumptions are introduced into the system s modeling process a sensitivity analysis is used to examine the overall impact of the microscopic changes under these conditions since the establishment of the model s sensitivity analysis alters the assumption conditions along with the model verification after establishment a sensitivity analysis is also applied to examine the stability of the original data when inaccurate or has been changed in the process of the system s optimization 3 4 parameter calibration and optimization of the model parameter calibration is the key to model construction and associated with the reliability and practicality of the simulation results in this study the historical monitoring and related subjects of the watershed and lake were used to estimate and calibrate the model s parameters there was a lack of long term monitoring data especially for the quality of the river s water emptying into the lake the lake s water ecology such as aquatic animals and plants fish and so allowed for the simulation and verification of the lake s data and affected the fitting accuracy of the model to some extent the improved method was interpolation and added the existing data or increased the amount of information by extending the mathematical model as well as other methods then in accordance with the sensitivity analysis and system suitability test and the parameter calibration which focused on the parameter setting of high sensitivity the main subsystem fitting results were as follows 3 4 1 water resources subsystem of lake chenghai due to the large drought coefficient of lake chenghai which led the inability of the water to be sufficient over a long period of time and the lake s water levels continued to decline this study simulated the natural conditions of lake chenghai s water changes and the reappearance of the actual state was in a declining trend in order to ensure that the surface of lake chenghai does not continue to decline the engineering of the xianren river diversion tunnel was completed in august 1993 which supplies approximately 4000 m3 of water to lake chenghai every year the results reflected that the lake levels tended to be stable the water changes with or without the water transfer project are shown in fig 8 when compared with the persistent decline of the lake s reservoir water diversion project the calculated results of the model showing the leading river emptying into the sea basic project caused the lake chenghai s water to reach a relatively stable level the stability of the lake area and the shore band width and length had positive impacts on the lake s water ecosystem 3 4 2 lake chenghai s water body nutrients subsystem the tp sd tn and transparency test series of lake chenghai between 1988 and 2009 were used as a sample of the calibrated model the fitting outcome of the estimated value and water quality of the measured values in lake chenghai are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the above that lake chenghai s tp concentrations fit appropriately with the exception of the large deviations observed in 2000 and 2001 as far as accuracy the other points basically satisfied the sd fitting the calculated values of the other major nutrient density fitting details with lake chenghai s water quality measurements and relative error are shown in table 2 it is indicated from table 2 that the average of relative error for concentration tp and transparency sd were 15 06 and 10 07 respectively in the evaluation criteria of the simulation the prediction model had an excellent rating meanwhile the average of relative error for tn was barely 20 and basically belonged to a good level due to the extreme complexity of the nitrogen cycle itself these results illustrated that through the system s simulation of the of the lake chenghai basin the model s results for the main nutrients had a better simulated effect and thus were suitable to be used for the simulation and inversion analysis calculation of the development and changes of the nutrients in the social economic system of lake chenghai 4 basin lake system model application of lake chenghai the nutrient reference state with less impact by human activities can be inversely obtained through the comprehensive evaluation of ecological health state according to the water quality model of a lake and the watershed information including the amounts of nutrient loading runoff and water withdrawl etc then the year when least affected by human activities can be determined therefore the nutrient condition in this year can be considered as the nutrient reference state 4 1 inversion of main driving factors of lake chenghai in this study based on the system simulation model described above the natural and social economies of the chenghai river basin were determined and a mathematical model was established using the main driving factors of the nutrient concentrations meanwhile by retrodicting to the historical changes in the process and putting it into the sdm simulation model the lake s nutrient reference state was back stepped to the early 1980s when the area was less affected by human activities while incorporating the lake s hydrological and meteorological data the retrodiction results of partial driving factors of lake chenghai s water nutrients were shown in fig 10 the retrodiction results included the total population agricultural population industrial gdp and production of spirulina from the above results it can be seen that the total population accounted for an absolute proportion of the basin s watershed agricultural population with lake chenghai s urbanization rate continuously less than 5 concurrently it can be observed that the industrial gdp did not start to grow at a high speed until the 1980s and accounted for approximately 10 to the highest of the watershed following this a more significant growth was observed year by year the main driving characteristics of the watershed nutrients affected directly the properties of the sea basin s nutrient sources the retrodiction results are shown in fig 11 therefore based on the reasons mentioned above the nutrient sources on the surface of chenghai river basin in the case of the tp accounted for an absolute proportion although the point sources had highly increased rising to approximately 20 of the total since 1994 however they were far below non point source emissions of the watershed which were consistent with the actual historical situation estimated in addition in the point source loads the urban tp emissions was relatively stable due to the slow growing increase in the population of the urban areas the point sources were associated with the industrial production along with rapid industrial increase in the gdp in the late 1990s the river water has been introduced from the outside since 1994 and has also brought a flow of life with the river nutrients causing it a new point source for the chenghai 4 2 nutrient density calculations during different years in lake chenghai in the justified case of the simulation model s calibration verification this study s system was based on the input of the inverse modeling of the population land use and the industrial and agricultural production of the lake basin with a focus placed on the analysis and calculation of the different nutrients under various hydro meteorological conditions each year water situation from 1951 to 2009 within the average nutrient concentrations of the lake fig 12 depicts the nutrient concentrations estimated from the lakes as can be seen from the results above the boundary of the sea basin in the mid 1980s was obvious during the period ranging from 1951 to 1984 the tn and tp concentration levels were low and stable and only displayed a rising trend in 1985 and after the average annual concentration of the various nutrients historical inverting data calculated is detailed in the table below 4 3 reference year and state concentration determination in lake chenghai the status of the reference baseline year was determined according to the analysis and evaluation conducted the commonly used methods of eutrophication evaluation in lakes are as follows carlson nutrition index method improved nutritional status index other comprehensive nutrition index method and scoring method considering the simplicity of the comprehensive nutrition index and small subjective effects this study selected the lake s comprehensive nutrition index method to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the lake s nutrition described as follows 1 t l i j 1 m w j t l i j where tli indicates the trophic state index and wj represents the first j parameters of the nutrition state index the relative weight also there are references to chla as the baseline parameters of the nutritional property values and the nutrition state index tli j represents the jth parameters the trophic status was classified by a series of consecutive digits from 0 to 100 the concentration values of chlorophyll a total phosphorus total nitrogen and transparency sd were used to estimate the nutritional status indicators tli of the single index in the lake then the embedded sdm simulation model for the evaluation of the comprehensive nutrition index method was constructed and the sdm flow diagram was not drawn the comprehensive nutrition index was calculated by the model and the retrodiction results of the calendar year were shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the lake s comprehensive nutrition index was divided into two stages by 1985 as the boundary i e the lake s oligotrophic condition the water quality was good before 1985 and then entered into medium trophic levels after 1985 an increasing trend was not observed until 2004 and the comprehensive nutritional index of the tli was close to 40 this was mainly due to the fact that the economic activities of the human society in the basin began to increase year by year in the mid 1980s such as increasing the amount of fertilizer application in agriculture intensive farming of the lake s spirulina and so on as a result of the river diversion project starting in 1994 the nutrients in lake chenghai have achieved a certain amplitude increase which can be seen in the inversion results with the consideration given to the internal flow pattern of lake chenghai and developmental needs of the human social economy in the basin it was determined that the stage of the lake during the mid 1980s was a benchmark reference point and the resultant nutrient concentrations were intended for the nutrient state reference in lake chenghai this study focused on the analysis and calculation of the different nutrient densities during different years under various meteorological and hydrological conditions the results are shown in table 3 in this study frequency analysis was conducted with the estimated concentrations of various nutrients in each year under different hydro meteorological conditions the results of the examination of the tp distribution frequency are shown in the following figure fig 14 according to the hydrological conditions in the lake chenghai basin with the different guarantee rates confidence levels of p 0 50 and p 0 75 the lake s nutrient density for the reference year were obtained through the frequency distribution shown in table 4 5 conclusion in this study a comprehensive natural social economic system of the lake basin was established based on the theory of the integrated lake basin identification of lake chenghai and its watershed through the system simulation and inversion calculation from the lake s trophic index during the medium trophic levels after 1985 an increasing trend was observed after 2004 and the comprehensive nutritional index of the tli was close to 40 in combination with the analysis of the social and economic development of the lake chenghai basin certain factors impacting the lake were determined mainly including activities which began to increase year by year from the mid 1980s in the basin such as increased amounts of fertilizer application in agriculture intensive farming of the lake s spirulina and so on in 1994 as a result of a river diversion project the nutrients in lake chenghai exhibited a certain amplitude increase therefore this study evaluated the reference state based on the lake in the mid 1980s as a benchmark and also determined each of the nutrient concentrations of the stage as the nutrient reference data of lake chenghai the results recommended the adoption of data in the mid 1980s as the nutrient reference status of lake chenghai the results based on the proposed model and inversion from the historical data showed that the tp reference concentrations of 0 0074 0 0091 mg l tn of 0 112 0 128 mg l chla concentration of 0 859 1 081 μg l and sd in transparency of 6 327 5 557 m under the 50 75 in the hydrological year acknowledgements the

25264,assessment of ecological status is crucial for establishing well defined reference conditions for a lake in this study a model based on system dynamics was developed to simulate the production transport and distribution of the nutrients in lake chenghai yunnan province china application of the proposed model with a system retrieval technique yielded the variations in nutrient concentrations and eutrophication levels under different hydraulic conditions during the past several decades results showed that the proposed model is capable of describing the historical process of the lake s eutrophication after calibrating with the experimental data the reference conditions for lake chenghai were proposed as follows 0 0074 0 0091 mg l for the total phosphorus concentration 0 112 0 128 mg l for the total nitrogen concentration 0 859 1 081 ug l for the chlorophyll a concentration and 6 327 5 557 m for the secci depth transparency it provided an effective way to establish the nutrient reference conditions for the foundation of a lake s nutrient criteria as well as the eutrophication control standards in china keywords nutrient criteria reference conditions system dynamics simulation lake chenghai 1 introduction well defined lake trophic status and reference conditions are the basis for the development of scientifically rational criteria and standards for water quality and trophic status of a lake which are critical for effective eutrophication control and restoration of aquatic ecosystems xu et al 2010 developed countries such as the united states japan australia establish regional water quality criteria and standards for eutrophication control in the early 21st century which were based on their characteristics of aquatic systems and environmental protection expectations china is one of the largest developing countries a series of water quality standards such as hygienic standard for drinking water water quality standard for farm irrigation and surface water quality standard and so on have been formulated but still lacks special water quality criteria system for lakes which now is substituted by surface water quality standards in some cases therefore the development of water quality criteria system for lakes will be of great significance for both theoretical research and practical application meng et al 2008 xia et al 2004 total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and chlorophyll a chl a are generally used to characterize reference conditions for nutrient criteria of a lake these represent the lake s conditions with the least anthropogenic disturbances and pollution or the most attainable conditions painting et al 2005 however almost all lakes of china have been impacted more or less by human activities and it is difficult to determine the degree of human impacts therefore it is necessary to establish reference conditions of a lake previous studies have reported several methods to define the reference conditions such as the statistical analysis of the historical data model prediction and inference reconstruction of the ancient limnology and expert judgments andersen et al 2004 solheim 2005 chen et al 1998 however due to the regional differences in climate and geography as well as the heavy interference of human activity to most of the lakes and the general lack of historical monitoring data the reported methods are not appropriate for direct use in china in order to define the lake reference conditions of nutrients in china the efforts have been made through preliminary studies for example huo et al 2009 analyzed the significance of several reported methods to develop lake nutrient criteria in china the reference conditions for lake taihu were established through a population frequency distribution analysis with respect to tn tp chlorophyll a and secchi depth zheng et al 2009 then based on the eastern plain paleolimnology reconstruction information along with the existing water quality data chen et al 2010 estimated the ranges of the four parameters of the nutrient reference conditions for lake chaohu by using lake population distribution trisection and regression approaches yan and wu 1994 fang and yan 2007 it is widely known that a lake is a specific ecoregion with nutrient production transport transformation and so on which is integrated with watersheds to form a relatively independent complex system however a lack of integrated and systematic data currently exists for lake eutrophication in china liu and guo 2008 zhang et al 2007 lake water resource system is a complex system which will have an impact on both the regional socio economic development and ecological system balance long et al 2004 rijsberman and van de ven 2000 while it is difficult to model the lake watershed system for its uncertain influence factors of unclear administrative attribution and boundaries incomplete information and so on endter wada et al 1998 gaiser et al 2008 gibson et al 2000 conventional mechanical description and inference approaches are not sufficient to establish a complete systematic model for such a complex system chen 1999 chou et al 2007 cheng 1999 the motion of all systems in the world is assumed as the motion of fluid according to system dynamics method sdm which overall adopts the causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagram to represent the structure and nonlinear feedback relationship within the system jǿgensen 2003 wang et al 2007 therefore the primary objective of this research was to present a sdm model coupled with system retrieval technique and eutrophication assessment method to characterize the production distribution and transport of nutrients in the lake chenghai by developing the causal feedback diagrams between kinds of nutrients concentration and its influencing factors under different influence scenarios of watershed hydrology ecology and human activities zhang et al 2008 and finally the threshold of nutrient reference conditions was obtained which would provide an effective basis to establish the nutrient reference conditions for the establishment of lake nutrient criteria and eutrophication control standards in china besides due to the advantages of intuitivism practicality flexibility and convenience sdm has been widely applied in socio economic strategic military and resource utilization systems by coupling with other mathematical models wang 1996 2 material and methods lake chenghai known as the black sea or black wuhai is located in the central yongsheng county in yunnan province between liangguan and star lake 45 km from the county center jin 1995 it is located at 26 27 26 38 north latitude and 100 30 26 49 longitude and is part of the jinsha river system it is one of the nine plateau lakes in yunnan province and is also one of the world s three lakes with growing spirulina the other two are lake cocoa in mexico and lake chad in africa it presents the status quo of a long and narrow lake the catchment area is 318 3 km2 with the land area of 243 km2 shoreline length of 45 1 km and water area of 74 6 km2 the north south length of the lake is 19 0 km with a maximum width of 5 4 km the average width of the lake is 4 3 km with a storage capacity of 1 98 billion m3 the average water depth is 25 7 m with the deepest water depth of 35 0 m the inclination of lake chenghai s bed is large however the shallow water is less than 0 87 of the water depth up to 20 m chenghai lake originally emptied into the jinsha river until 1609 after which the water level declined year by year until no more water entered into the jinsha river it gradually evolved into an inland lake with no outlet however a part of the lake includes a groundwater excretion which is not derived from river input fig 1 2 1 natural basin ecosystem model of lake chenghai lake chenghai is located in the jinsha river valley and has a subtropical plateau monsoon climate the annual average temperature of the lake is approximately 18 7 c with no frost occurring at any time during the year in the lake area the wet and dry seasons are obvious although the four seasons are not distinct the sun illumination is sufficient and the duration of sunshine ranges between 2500 and 2750 h the 10 c accumulated temperature reaches between 5000 and 6000 c every year 2 1 1 water resources and environment subsystems of lake chenghai s basin according to the statistics from the hydrological station of hekou street 26 28 n and 100 39 e during the last 20 years its average annual rainfall was 733 6 mm and the rain period was between 90 and 100 days rainfall during the dry seasons was extremely rare and the annual evaporation was 2040 mm with the drought index of approximately 2 4 yielding a seasonally arid environment the precipitation during the rainy season accounted for 92 of total annual precipitation the lake water was mainly from watershed runoff and precipitation the lake s elevation is 1501 m and the highest point in the watershed is 3280 0 m which is located in the western basin of the lake in this study according to the field observations it was found that the remains of algae were still visible on the bank of the lake above 30 m which further demonstrated the fact that the water s course to the sea experienced significant levels of fluctuations in the past according to the historical statistics of 276 years between 1690 and 1965 the water flowed over 30 km south into the jinsha river and formed the cheng river system since then the total water has dropped 37 8 m due to water depletion and reduced rainfall therefore lake chenghai has become a closed lake without outflow with many years of fixed ground water recharge its water supply is mainly from groundwater and lake precipitation the basin rainfall data from 1970 to 2009 is shown in fig 2 lake chenghai is located in the dry heat zone of the jinsha river the lake evaporation is three times that of the entire basin precipitation the long term water deficits have led to continuous decline in the lake s water level to prevent the continued decline a diversion tunnel project was built in august 1993 at present local government is building a massive water diversion project to bring water from the yongsheng river into the lake also irrigation projects were controlled in order to maintain the water level of chenghai lake when the diversion complement sea project was completed in 1994 the lake s water level tended towards stability therefore it could be seen that the lake s water was derived mainly from the runoff and precipitation of lakes basin the roles of the rainfall and evaporation were the dominant factors in controlling the water level in accordance with the existing discharge data regarding the watershed rainfall evaporation and water storage a dynamic system model of lakes water subsystem was constructed as fig 3 2 1 2 subsystem of the chenghai river basin land resource in the new generation of the mid tertiary dating back to 12 million years the himalayan orogeny formed a fault graben which was trapped in the low lying places in polywater from the highland lakes and is geologically referred to as the fall of the lake the lake is ringed on three sides east west and north by mountains the terrain is flat in the south and clastic rock in the east with a slow slope in the north carbonate rock forms a mountainous terrain in the middle and basalt forms an endless steep mountain range in the west the landscape is generally high in the northwest low in the southeast high on two sides and low in the center the rock of the lake is mainly permian basalt and tuff jurassic mudstone sandstone limestone devonian limestone and so on around the lake zonal soil is spread mainly in the form of red red brown and farming soil along the lake the lake has sparse vegetation and the soil erosion is severe the lake has also developed widely basalt sandstone dolomitic limestone and shale the land in the lake chenghai watershed is mainly used as forested agricultural urban construction residential land areas with rural hills lakes and so on the woodland area is less than normal and accounts for only 23 19 to the total forest area the vast majority of the land is woodland and shrub land which accounts for 76 18 of the total land area due to the fact that the land is not highly arable the cultivated land resource development is restricted by the surrounding environment these areas account for 7 74 of the river catchment area which is slightly higher than the provincial average 7 20 but below the national average simultaneously the soil erosion is considered to be serious the most serious soil erosion areas in this province are located in yongsheng county and the chenghai river basin is even more extreme the soil erosion area accounts for 61 59 to the total which is much higher than the province s average the soil erosion modulus is 784 000 t km2 a the severe and extreme intensity of the soil erosion mainly occurs from the liu river to the east of lake to the mountains at the lower part of the tuanshan mountain river strong erosion has occurred from the beam of the mazongzi mountains in northeast of lake chenghai to mount jiguan the moderate erosion areas are mainly distributed in the mountains around the lake as well as the upper part of the lake the flat dams at the south and north ends of the lake have slight or low erosion zones the land use from 1985 to 2005 is shown in the table 1 in this study in accordance with the main landforms of the chenghai river basin the land resources of the sdm flow diagram were established as fig 4 2 2 social and economic system model of the chenghai river basin the lake chenghai watershed is a predominantly agricultural production area in less developed area during recent years a small amount of industrial production input has occurred in the basin in 2007 the rural economic revenues reached 98 32 million yuan the farmers pure revenue was 1303 yuan with 420 kg of grain per capita there were several aspects which characterized the main economic industry as follows 1 in the vegetable industry there were 11 871 mu of grown vegetables which mainly included early fava beans peas tomatoes and garlic the total output of these vegetables was 26 280 t with the value of 27 million yuan and included garlic planting at 12 500 mu with an output value of 37 million yuan the vegetable industry has become an important economic growth point for increasing farmers income agricultural efficiency and rural stability in chenghai town 2 in 2007 the total tobacco planting was 3100 mu the total volume and gross output value of the flue cured tobacco hitted a new high the flue cured tobacco industry has become one of the main profitable industries of the mountain people 3 in regards to food crops in the appropriate areas high quality rice planting had been promoted resulting in 42 631 mu of grain being produced each year 4 for animal husbandry there were 1520 large livestock 7747 pigs and 77 47 t of meat produced which achieved an output value of 2 3241 million yuan for the animal husbandry industry in this area 5 in regards to fishing there were 950 t of fish produced of which bright silver fish was 470 t and 480 t of produced fish were native varieties including carp white fish small fish red wing carp sharksucker and so on the fish production in this area achieved an output value of 7 66 million yuan 6 at the end of 1998 spirulina farming had achieved a domestic output value of 74 million yuan the lake chenghai watershed is located in the center of yongsheng county which is located in yongbei town and includes 15 townships it lies in the northwest section of yunnan province as well as the central part of lijiang city and belongs to the upper reaches of the yangtze river its range includes 12 village committees in addition to gifford two villages are located in mountainous and mid level regions and the remaining 10 villages in the lake chenghai area are located at the dam area in the late 2003 the total population of the county was 383 997 of which 28 673 were a non agricultural population group accounting for 7 5 of the total population with the agricultural population of 355 324 and accounting for 92 5 of the total population also the total population of the ethnic minorities group was 121 162 accounting for 31 6 of the total population in the county in 2004 the population of lake chenghai was 41 512 of which 3 8 were the non agricultural population the total population was 41 042 and 41 198 in 2006 and 2007 respectively a subsystem sdm flowchart of the basin s population groups can be seen in fig 5 as mentioned earlier due to the lack of industrial economic activities the industrial gdp in recent years accounted for less than 10 in the overall river basin therefore it has been generalized in this study by a simple model of low growth due to the lake s spirulina breeding in recent years at the growing stage its proportion of nutrients in the lake s pollutants was also larger which had a direct and profound impacts on the water quality therefore it was examined as a separate subsystem of spirulina farming in this study currently five spirulina farms belonging to the shipurui co have been established on the south east bank and are quickly becoming the world s largest spirulina agricultural base its annual output of algae powder amounts to more than 1000 t also its developed production includes spirulina powder tablets capsules soft drinks cosmetics and other products which are sold both in china and internationally fig 6 in this study based on the comprehensive consideration of the previously mentioned elements the cultivated land areas and farmland fertilizers such as tn and tp as well as other closely related factors were introduced into the system model and the sdm flow diagram of the agricultural production subsystem see the land use subsystem of agricultural production the model was inferred from a necessary generalization in the process of establishing a system this was due to the fact that the nutrition and hierarchical structure reflected the material recycling process in the lake s water ecosystem which was the foundation of the hydrodynamics of the lake s water ecosystem model therefore the flow of nutrients was a chain and the system hierarchy was a guide which were used in this study to establish a simple lake ecosystem dynamic model then based on the consideration of the lake basin s nutrients tp tn input and output the roles of the nutrients were mainly focused on the subsidence and erosion of the lake exchange with the lake s bottom mud and the relationship between the chlorophyll a water ecosystem chla and transparency sd the sdm flow chart of the subsystems is shown in fig 7 3 lake chenghai calibration of the system simulation model the solving and calibrating of a model s parameters is one of the key links in the complex system simulation after a lake s ecological economic system dynamic simulation model has been established historical monitoring and related research objects are used to estimate the parameters and solve the model equations then a complete efficacy and sensitivity analysis is conducted after the establishment of a completed model is finally confirmed 3 1 consistency test of the model s dimensions a dimensional inspection is a type of well known fast and effective methods for the determination of a geometric or physical formula in mathematical equations similarly for complex systems simulation models a series of problems may exist during the modeling process through the consistency testing of the model s dimensions which can potentially assist modelers in identifying and resolving deficiencies and defects in the model in this study after the verification was completed through a dimensional consistency validation using vensim software the results showed that the model was correct in both structure and logic 3 2 extreme conditions and border inspection of the model the model used in this study was a simulation of the real world as well as the researchers perceptions in order to improve the effectiveness of the model it was necessary to observe and verify whether the real world things were included in the model and to make a behavioral pattern comparison of the model and real systems 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the model s parameters a parameter sensitivity analysis is a method which studies and analyses the sensitive degree of a model state the sensitivity analysis can determine the parameters with the greatest influence on the system model some required assumptions are introduced into the system s modeling process a sensitivity analysis is used to examine the overall impact of the microscopic changes under these conditions since the establishment of the model s sensitivity analysis alters the assumption conditions along with the model verification after establishment a sensitivity analysis is also applied to examine the stability of the original data when inaccurate or has been changed in the process of the system s optimization 3 4 parameter calibration and optimization of the model parameter calibration is the key to model construction and associated with the reliability and practicality of the simulation results in this study the historical monitoring and related subjects of the watershed and lake were used to estimate and calibrate the model s parameters there was a lack of long term monitoring data especially for the quality of the river s water emptying into the lake the lake s water ecology such as aquatic animals and plants fish and so allowed for the simulation and verification of the lake s data and affected the fitting accuracy of the model to some extent the improved method was interpolation and added the existing data or increased the amount of information by extending the mathematical model as well as other methods then in accordance with the sensitivity analysis and system suitability test and the parameter calibration which focused on the parameter setting of high sensitivity the main subsystem fitting results were as follows 3 4 1 water resources subsystem of lake chenghai due to the large drought coefficient of lake chenghai which led the inability of the water to be sufficient over a long period of time and the lake s water levels continued to decline this study simulated the natural conditions of lake chenghai s water changes and the reappearance of the actual state was in a declining trend in order to ensure that the surface of lake chenghai does not continue to decline the engineering of the xianren river diversion tunnel was completed in august 1993 which supplies approximately 4000 m3 of water to lake chenghai every year the results reflected that the lake levels tended to be stable the water changes with or without the water transfer project are shown in fig 8 when compared with the persistent decline of the lake s reservoir water diversion project the calculated results of the model showing the leading river emptying into the sea basic project caused the lake chenghai s water to reach a relatively stable level the stability of the lake area and the shore band width and length had positive impacts on the lake s water ecosystem 3 4 2 lake chenghai s water body nutrients subsystem the tp sd tn and transparency test series of lake chenghai between 1988 and 2009 were used as a sample of the calibrated model the fitting outcome of the estimated value and water quality of the measured values in lake chenghai are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the above that lake chenghai s tp concentrations fit appropriately with the exception of the large deviations observed in 2000 and 2001 as far as accuracy the other points basically satisfied the sd fitting the calculated values of the other major nutrient density fitting details with lake chenghai s water quality measurements and relative error are shown in table 2 it is indicated from table 2 that the average of relative error for concentration tp and transparency sd were 15 06 and 10 07 respectively in the evaluation criteria of the simulation the prediction model had an excellent rating meanwhile the average of relative error for tn was barely 20 and basically belonged to a good level due to the extreme complexity of the nitrogen cycle itself these results illustrated that through the system s simulation of the of the lake chenghai basin the model s results for the main nutrients had a better simulated effect and thus were suitable to be used for the simulation and inversion analysis calculation of the development and changes of the nutrients in the social economic system of lake chenghai 4 basin lake system model application of lake chenghai the nutrient reference state with less impact by human activities can be inversely obtained through the comprehensive evaluation of ecological health state according to the water quality model of a lake and the watershed information including the amounts of nutrient loading runoff and water withdrawl etc then the year when least affected by human activities can be determined therefore the nutrient condition in this year can be considered as the nutrient reference state 4 1 inversion of main driving factors of lake chenghai in this study based on the system simulation model described above the natural and social economies of the chenghai river basin were determined and a mathematical model was established using the main driving factors of the nutrient concentrations meanwhile by retrodicting to the historical changes in the process and putting it into the sdm simulation model the lake s nutrient reference state was back stepped to the early 1980s when the area was less affected by human activities while incorporating the lake s hydrological and meteorological data the retrodiction results of partial driving factors of lake chenghai s water nutrients were shown in fig 10 the retrodiction results included the total population agricultural population industrial gdp and production of spirulina from the above results it can be seen that the total population accounted for an absolute proportion of the basin s watershed agricultural population with lake chenghai s urbanization rate continuously less than 5 concurrently it can be observed that the industrial gdp did not start to grow at a high speed until the 1980s and accounted for approximately 10 to the highest of the watershed following this a more significant growth was observed year by year the main driving characteristics of the watershed nutrients affected directly the properties of the sea basin s nutrient sources the retrodiction results are shown in fig 11 therefore based on the reasons mentioned above the nutrient sources on the surface of chenghai river basin in the case of the tp accounted for an absolute proportion although the point sources had highly increased rising to approximately 20 of the total since 1994 however they were far below non point source emissions of the watershed which were consistent with the actual historical situation estimated in addition in the point source loads the urban tp emissions was relatively stable due to the slow growing increase in the population of the urban areas the point sources were associated with the industrial production along with rapid industrial increase in the gdp in the late 1990s the river water has been introduced from the outside since 1994 and has also brought a flow of life with the river nutrients causing it a new point source for the chenghai 4 2 nutrient density calculations during different years in lake chenghai in the justified case of the simulation model s calibration verification this study s system was based on the input of the inverse modeling of the population land use and the industrial and agricultural production of the lake basin with a focus placed on the analysis and calculation of the different nutrients under various hydro meteorological conditions each year water situation from 1951 to 2009 within the average nutrient concentrations of the lake fig 12 depicts the nutrient concentrations estimated from the lakes as can be seen from the results above the boundary of the sea basin in the mid 1980s was obvious during the period ranging from 1951 to 1984 the tn and tp concentration levels were low and stable and only displayed a rising trend in 1985 and after the average annual concentration of the various nutrients historical inverting data calculated is detailed in the table below 4 3 reference year and state concentration determination in lake chenghai the status of the reference baseline year was determined according to the analysis and evaluation conducted the commonly used methods of eutrophication evaluation in lakes are as follows carlson nutrition index method improved nutritional status index other comprehensive nutrition index method and scoring method considering the simplicity of the comprehensive nutrition index and small subjective effects this study selected the lake s comprehensive nutrition index method to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the lake s nutrition described as follows 1 t l i j 1 m w j t l i j where tli indicates the trophic state index and wj represents the first j parameters of the nutrition state index the relative weight also there are references to chla as the baseline parameters of the nutritional property values and the nutrition state index tli j represents the jth parameters the trophic status was classified by a series of consecutive digits from 0 to 100 the concentration values of chlorophyll a total phosphorus total nitrogen and transparency sd were used to estimate the nutritional status indicators tli of the single index in the lake then the embedded sdm simulation model for the evaluation of the comprehensive nutrition index method was constructed and the sdm flow diagram was not drawn the comprehensive nutrition index was calculated by the model and the retrodiction results of the calendar year were shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the lake s comprehensive nutrition index was divided into two stages by 1985 as the boundary i e the lake s oligotrophic condition the water quality was good before 1985 and then entered into medium trophic levels after 1985 an increasing trend was not observed until 2004 and the comprehensive nutritional index of the tli was close to 40 this was mainly due to the fact that the economic activities of the human society in the basin began to increase year by year in the mid 1980s such as increasing the amount of fertilizer application in agriculture intensive farming of the lake s spirulina and so on as a result of the river diversion project starting in 1994 the nutrients in lake chenghai have achieved a certain amplitude increase which can be seen in the inversion results with the consideration given to the internal flow pattern of lake chenghai and developmental needs of the human social economy in the basin it was determined that the stage of the lake during the mid 1980s was a benchmark reference point and the resultant nutrient concentrations were intended for the nutrient state reference in lake chenghai this study focused on the analysis and calculation of the different nutrient densities during different years under various meteorological and hydrological conditions the results are shown in table 3 in this study frequency analysis was conducted with the estimated concentrations of various nutrients in each year under different hydro meteorological conditions the results of the examination of the tp distribution frequency are shown in the following figure fig 14 according to the hydrological conditions in the lake chenghai basin with the different guarantee rates confidence levels of p 0 50 and p 0 75 the lake s nutrient density for the reference year were obtained through the frequency distribution shown in table 4 5 conclusion in this study a comprehensive natural social economic system of the lake basin was established based on the theory of the integrated lake basin identification of lake chenghai and its watershed through the system simulation and inversion calculation from the lake s trophic index during the medium trophic levels after 1985 an increasing trend was observed after 2004 and the comprehensive nutritional index of the tli was close to 40 in combination with the analysis of the social and economic development of the lake chenghai basin certain factors impacting the lake were determined mainly including activities which began to increase year by year from the mid 1980s in the basin such as increased amounts of fertilizer application in agriculture intensive farming of the lake s spirulina and so on in 1994 as a result of a river diversion project the nutrients in lake chenghai exhibited a certain amplitude increase therefore this study evaluated the reference state based on the lake in the mid 1980s as a benchmark and also determined each of the nutrient concentrations of the stage as the nutrient reference data of lake chenghai the results recommended the adoption of data in the mid 1980s as the nutrient reference status of lake chenghai the results based on the proposed model and inversion from the historical data showed that the tp reference concentrations of 0 0074 0 0091 mg l tn of 0 112 0 128 mg l chla concentration of 0 859 1 081 μg l and sd in transparency of 6 327 5 557 m under the 50 75 in the hydrological year acknowledgements the
