17935,space exploration is demanding longer lasting human missions and water resupply from earth will become increasingly unrealistic in a near future the spacecraft water monitoring systems will require technological advances to promptly identify and counteract contingent events of waterborne microbial contamination posing health risks to astronauts with lowered immune responsiveness the search for bio analytical approaches alternative to those applied on earth by cultivation dependent methods is pushed by the compelling need to limit waste disposal and avoid microbial regrowth from analytical carryovers prospective technologies will be selected only if first validated in a flight like environment by following basic principles advantages and limitations beyond their current

suitable for the in flight water and microbiological research graphical abstract image 1 keywords international space station space missions biomonitoring water biological contamination 1 introduction liquid water is essential for all known earth derived life forms living in space conditions including microbes mckay 2014 the on going space exploration has not yet demonstrated whether the presence of extra terrestrial water could indicate itself the occurrence of microbial life but the prevailing paradigm is that living microorganisms necessitate temporal and spatial proximity with aqueous solutions for their metabolism martín torres et al 2015 merino et al 2019 stevenson et al 2015 in turn the microbial contamination cannot be thoroughly eliminated from earth s waters but only controlled and attenuated on the long term time scale lopez et al 2019 o rourke et al 2020b rettberg et al 2019 since space exploration has been demanding longer lasting missions the analysis of waterborne microorganisms turned out of utmost importance for future human spaceflights planetary outposts and life support systems horneck et al 2010 the prevention of crew infectious waterborne diseases is retained among the highest priorities particularly for long duration missions ott et al 2014 since emergency resupply is unrealistic and recycled water could represent the only suitable source for the on board activities most of the aquatic microorganisms found aboard the international space station iss do not generally constitute a severe hazard for human health blaustein et al 2019 checinska sielaff et al 2019 sobisch et al 2019 however they may threat astronauts with reduced immune response mostly following prolonged microgravity stress conditions garrett bakelman et al 2019 netea et al 2020 ott et al 2016 other concerning issues arise from microbial influences on spacecraft integrity and function owing to the potential corrosion and degradation of stainless steel and other materials associated with the electronic equipment and life support systems horneck et al 2010 yang et al 2018 zea et al 2018 therefore there is an increasing interest to improve the spacecraft water monitoring systems to identify and possibly counteract contingent events of microbial contamination ichijo et al 2020 van houdt et al 2012 yamaguchi et al 2014 the definition identification and test of the microbial monitoring approaches suitable for the on board water quality control are challenged by several technical constraints e g material safety compatibility resistance to launch vibration and a minimal availability for managing excess power storage volume mass and crew time allen et al 2018 moreover selected devices and their supporting reagents must remain viable for years while operating safely and reliably in extreme conditions e g in the absence of gravity technology flexibility is also critical since monitoring systems should be able to detect different microbial targets i e fungi protists prokaryotes viruses and to accept samples of various origin spanning from biomedical e g blood urine saliva samples routine chemistry cell cultures to water and environmental samples nelson 2011 in recent years the chinese modular space station built on the experience gained from its precursors tiangong 1 and tiangong 2 will be placed and operating in the low earth orbit gibney 2019 the sustainable human exploration of the moon is programmed in the meanwhile el jaby et al 2019 pittman et al 2016 whereas the human missions to the surface of mars are envisioned before 2040 isecg 2018 therefore it is hypothesized that only prospective methodological applications at a high technology readiness level i e at least validated in a flight like environment straub 2015 will be selected by following their basic principles and current uses in earth and space analogue settings a number of review papers has recently emphasized the need for high throughput technologies to timely monitor and achieve the stringent microbial quality requirements of future crewed space habitats de middeleer et al 2019 grigorev et al 2020 ichijo et al 2020 karouia et al 2017 liu 2017 moissl eichinger et al 2016 mora et al 2016 yamaguchi et al 2014 in this article we narrow the focus on promising bio analytic technologies for quality assessments of waters in space with the aim to explore advantages and limitations beyond their current applications on earth starting from the rigorous housekeeping program and the consolidated results of water monitoring activity on the iss duncan et al 2008 limero and wallace 2017 we provide a critical overview of the microbial monitoring approaches based on flexible technologies for the identification of microbial components and a total contamination assessment total microbial burden in waters circulating on crewed space vehicles 2 water recycle and microbial monitoring aboard the international space station 2 1 the iss water cycle the water recycling system innovations required to support iss activities have been listed among the major benefits for humanity detsis and detsis 2013 nasa et al 2019 the iss is provided with potable water from different suppliers coordinated by the space agencies of united states national aeronautics and space administration nasa russia russian federal space agency roscosmos europe european space agency esa and japan japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa bruce et al 2005 van houdt et al 2012 all the possible necessary precautions to prevent external contamination are applied throughout water transferring and loading steps over the entire treatment period before the liftoff of supply modules for instance the american and russian waters are produced in conditioned and limited access areas and preparation facilities with no risk of accidental water quality modifications during the production process at the research center of the italian società metropolitana acque torino smat purified waters for space travels are also processed upon selecting well and spring waters that most closely meet the physical chemical and bacteriological quality standards for astronauts lobascio et al 2004 currently on iss waters for direct human consumption are regularly delivered and recovered in order to guarantee approximately 4 l per person per day fig 1 a reserve of potable water up to approx 2000 l is stored in contingency containers to maintain iss operations in response to emergency scenarios carter et al 2018 although routinely monitored and kept constant the overall water mass balance represents a recurrent major challenge owing to the various iss water needs pickett et al 2020 beside the on demand crew consumption on board waters are distributed for different purposes comprising hygiene and cleaning practices urinal flushing oxygen generation via electrolysis life support systems and flexible water based experimental activities e g vegetable and food production systems animal physiology and behavioral adaptation tests baiocco et al 2018 chatani et al 2015 massa et al 2016 niederwieser et al 2018 ronca et al 2019 wolff et al 2018 wastewaters are continuously collected and recycled at high efficiency level pickett et al 2020 in the us segment the water recovery and management system was reported to recuperate up to 85 from crew urine and flush water along with the water content from liquid wastes and humidity condensate from the cabin various containers reservoirs tanks and bellows are also necessary to maintain water pressure and circulation through the distribution network carter et al 2018 since microbial growth is unavoidable in persistent stagnation zones and at varying residence times along the water distribution network lautenschlager et al 2010 ling et al 2018 the pre and in flight addition of biocides is used for residual microbial control molecular iodine is applied in the u s segment while the ionic silver level is amended in russian waters both at low concentrations i e not detrimental for human health artemyeva 2016 lobascio et al 2004 moreover high temperature in the catalytic reactor multifiltration beds within the water processor assembly uv c leds within the co2 concentration assembly of the advanced closed loop system and novel antimicrobial coatings on various iss surfaces were proved effective against potential microbial biomass growth bockstahler et al 2017 carter et al 2018 perrin et al 2018 petala et al 2020 roman et al 2006 sobisch et al 2019 finally the iss is maintained at pressure and oxygen levels very close to those at sea level on earth with a cabin temperature of about 22 c and a relative humidity of about 60 in order to minimize detrimental growth of microbial biofilms on cabin surfaces pierson et al 2013 2 2 on board water monitoring and microbial contamination the achievement and maintenance of water quality standards are evaluated by systematic monitoring procedures limero and wallace 2017 major water physical chemical parameters including conductivity ph total organic total inorganic and total carbon nitrate potassium chloride and ammonium are monitored in flight together with iodine and silver levels artemyeva 2016 moreover a robust monitoring program was implemented to verify that risks of microbial contamination were within acceptable limits in samples collected from different sites of the russian and us segments respectively once every three months and each month pierson et al 2013 van houdt and leys 2012 crewmembers use handheld equipment to monitor iss waters and humidity condensate from surfaces chemical and biological samples are taken concurrently and at a frequency that may change due to real time flight necessities pierson et al 2013 water samples can be processed on board by cultivation based methods using the us supplied water microbiology kit for the quantification of total heterotrophic bacteria and coliforms bruce et al 2005 the maximum total number of aerobic heterotrophic viable bacterial cells counted as colony forming units on a rich agar medium was internationally defined according to the concentration levels that are achievable with the current prevention and monitoring technologies available and applicable for space i e hpc 50 cfu ml microbial quality standards are also set for iss internal surfaces from which humidity condensate is collected maximum bacterial load 10 000 cfu 100 cm2 maximum fungal load 100 cfu 100 cm2 van houdt and leys 2012 along with the on board monitoring activities archival water samples are regularly collected in teflon bags fig 1 preserved and returned to earth approximately every three months for post flight analyses limero and wallace 2017 the microbial contamination level was above the former acceptability limits several times during previous in flight monitoring surveys events of microbial biofilm growth within space vehicles were mainly associated with the water layer covering internal surfaces and life support systems la duc et al 2004 novikova et al 2006 roman et al 2006 thus waters collected from humidity condensate were retained among the major sources of microbiological hazard for potable water quality deterioration horneck et al 2010 several cultivable microbial isolates obtained from spaceflights were mainly affiliated to bacteria and fungi bruce et al 2005 coil et al 2016 novikova et al 2006 o rourke et al 2020b for the purposes of this review it is worth noting that the analysis of the microbial cultivable fraction were likely to provide only a limited snapshot of the highly diverse community found on the iss by cultivation independent methods checinska sielaff et al 2019 coil et al 2016 de middeleer et al 2019 ichijo et al 2016 lang et al 2017 mora et al 2019 morris et al 2012 despite major advantages arise from target specific isolation and characterization of different types of waterborne microorganisms and pathogens in pure culture a number of technical and logistic disadvantages characterizes the space application of cultivation based methods the microgravity conditions provide conflicting results on microbial growth and virulence of opportunistic human pathogens gilbert et al 2020 morrison et al 2017 o rourke et al 2020a b zhang et al 2019 while the analysis of archival samples generates a detrimental time gap for a flight supportive result interpretation huang et al 2018 novikova et al 2006 hpc was proved to be also affected by carbon sources in cultivation media the incubation time and the initial microbial load level amalfitano et al 2018b finally the prompt development and requirement update of alternate bio analytical technologies for microbial monitoring during space exploration is pushed fundamentally by the need to avoid microbial regrowth from analytical wastes wong et al 2017 3 nucleic acid amplification based methods for microbial identification in space waters methods based on nucleic acid amplification offer the advantage of specific and fast detection easy automatization and standardization many of the limitations of cultivation based techniques adopted for bacterial detection and water quality monitoring are overwhelmed by largely reducing the time required for the microbial identification including also viable but not cultivable bacteria and un cultivable pathogens 3 1 sample pre treatments and nucleic acid extraction in space sample pre treatment and nucleic acid extraction are key starting points for most of the molecular approaches and product developments dedicated to microbial water quality monitoring nucleic acids extracted from water samples are amplified to specific markers the extraction and purification of nucleic acids rely on cell lysis and the selective binding of cellular dna and rna to solid surfaces through filtration and column based protocols a fast biomolecular analysis can be conducted in space settings with the in line implementation of optimized protocols for fast dna and rna extraction and sample preparation for sequencing published studies reported new promising field deployable amplification devices and approaches for on board applications boguraev et al 2017 montague et al 2018 fig 2 a and b simplified sample processing and dna purification strategies have currently been tested aboard the international space station iss the wetlab 2 project has already developed and tested on the iss a sample preparation module spm to lyse cells and to provide high quality extraction of nucleic acids by circumventing operational issues related to microgravity surface tension alteration reduced operational space and handling expertise parra et al 2017 numerous commercialized kits for solid phase extraction allow handy and rapid nucleic acid purification procedures in which potential contaminants are removed through sequential washing steps based on centrifugation or dna separation by paramagnetic beads tan and yiap 2009 methods for the direct pcr amplification without dna extraction were also developed williams et al 2017 recent papers reported simplified methods for nucleic acid purification and amplification directly on filtration membranes kaliyappan et al 2012 rodriguez et al 2016 notably a cellulose paper based dipstick was used to efficiently bind wash and elute purified nucleic acids from different matrices without any pipetting or electrical equipment zou et al 2017 nevertheless a major bottleneck for the in flight application of amplification based approaches still lies on the need for time consuming and waste producing sample concentration and dna extraction girones et al 2010 in particular the method sensibility is lowered when amplifying targets present at low levels over the total extracted dna brandt and albertsen 2018 suboptimal dna extraction and purification are known to affect results of biomolecular analysis mainly owing to uncomplete lysis of more resistant bacterial populations and poor removal of dna polymerase inhibitors albertsen et al 2015 girones et al 2010 dna purification requires effective cell disruption inactivation of nucleases and purification of dna from contaminants that might interfere with the amplification efficiency residual extracellular dna could not be easily discriminated from that of viable dangerous microorganisms thus leading to an overestimation of risk for human health girones et al 2010 moreover waterborne substances can concentrate together with dna during sample processing and inhibit polymerase enzymes thus influencing the sensitivity and reliability of the pcr based microbial detection overall the relative accuracy and precision i e repeatability and reproducibility of nucleic acid amplification based methods are affected by sample type and pre treatment methods concentration and dna extraction thus requiring to be evaluated across the whole sample processing hospodsky et al 2010 kralik and ricchi 2017 3 2 target based techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic acids the polymerase chain reaction pcr is widely used for detecting genes and microorganisms of health concern in water ramírez castillo et al 2015 among these target based detection approaches the loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp of nucleic acids was retained as a rapid and sensible option zhao et al 2015 with minimal requirements for the in flight water quality monitoring and pathogen detection ott et al 2014 rubinfien et al 2020 the amplification takes place at isothermal temperature 60 65 c and positive reactions can be visualised by naked eye i e without post amplification steps following the increase of sample turbidity or colour owing to the addition of fluorescent dyes notomi et al 2015 being less sensible than pcr to inhibition and not significantly influenced by non target dna direct lamp assays are currently used with good analytical performances etchebarne et al 2017 samhan et al 2017 low amount of dna can be amplified up to generating 109 copies within 1 h and producing as final amplification product a complex stem loop dna with several inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower like structures commercial kits for the rapid on site detection of water pathogens are already available for terrestrial applications also comprising quantitative real time lamp reverse transcription rt lamp in situ lamp and viable lamp notomi et al 2015 for the scopes of this review it is worth noting that a rapid method for detecting approximately 1 cfu 100 ml of legionella pneumophila in tap water was developed and efficiently applied on field in less than 2 working hours through a direct on filter lamp amplification with live dead propidium monoazide pma differentiation samhan et al 2017 among the target based quantification approaches the quantitative pcr qpcr represents a popular technique for the in flight water quality monitoring oubre et al 2013 the quantification of target sequences is based on the development of a fluorescent signal proportional to the amount of amplified product obtained during the pcr thermal cycles multiplex qpcr can be used for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple pathogens consistently reducing analytical time and costs ibekwe et al 2002 lagier et al 2004 with low detection limits 400 cells per sample and volume requirements 100 μl of sample qpcr assays are routinely applied in monitoring plans for the detection and quantification of waterborne pathogens girones et al 2010 ramírez castillo et al 2015 good repeatability and reproducibility of qpcr outcomes were reported for gene targets of fecal origin and a standardized workflow achieved consistent results with low intra and inter laboratory coefficients of variation median cv 0 1 3 3 and 1 9 7 1 respectively ebentier et al 2013 orin et al 2012 a large body of the scientific literature has documented the development and use of qpcr for pathogenic viruses bacteria protozoa and fungi kralik and ricchi 2017 ramírez castillo et al 2015 through a pre treatment with cell membrane impermeant dna intercalating dyes the so called viable qpcr was applied for discriminating between viable with intact membrane and dead with damaged membrane bacteria allowing the quantification of water and food borne pathogens such as campylobacter e coli o157 h7 legionella pneumophila salmonella cryptosporidium banihashemi et al 2012 brescia et al 2009 delgado viscogliosi et al 2009 given the versatile applications of the numerous available assays both lamp and qpcr have been retained as suitable water monitoring methods for long term exploration missions owing to the high sensitivity specificity and simple post amplification steps to detect the amplified targets lamp was proposed by the japanese aerospace exploration agency as alternative microbial contamination monitoring system for the iss ott et al 2014 for the analysis of crew health related genetic modifications qpcr technologies have been successfully tested on board the iss within the projects gene in space and wet lab2 devoted to definition of a robust user friendly nucleic acid extraction and sequencing approach aboard iss boguraev et al 2017 https www genesinspace org https www nasa gov mission pages station research experiments 1913 html https www nasa gov ames research space biosciences wetlab 2 moreover the razor ex pcr launched on space x 9 july 2016 within water monitoring suite project will allow performing direct pcr amplification from water samples in all current space applications however the selected target based detection and quantification approaches require the use of disposable materials and labour intense protocols which will inevitably reduce their long term applicability in space conditions the general precautions used on earth to limit contamination risks including the most stringent procedures applied in clean rooms rettberg et al 2019 might also represent a limiting practical issue in the small close spacecraft environment since the high sensibility of pcr based detection increases the chance of amplifying carry over contamination with the consequent production of false positive results this is crucial for lamp owing to the limited accessibility to degradation of dna products while a major limitation of qpcr is also the occurrence of inhibitors that can be co concentrated or extracted along with nucleic acids from the target microorganisms gibson et al 2012 the presence of qpcr inhibitors introduces a number of problems ranging from low amplification efficiency and reduced assay sensitivity to complete reaction failure and false negative results radstrom et al 2008 3 3 sequencing based omics approaches for microbial community characterization the high throughput sequencing hts encloses a popular suite of technologies methodological approaches and data elaboration workflows used to characterize the phylogenetic composition of the total microbial community in different aquatic matrices the taxonomic classification is based on the huge amount of sequences generated by either a portion of the cellular nucleic acid content or the whole genome through the so called amplicon and shotgun sequencing approaches respectively peabody et al 2015 the amplicon analysis represents the extension of sequencing based methods of organisms classification defined by specific protocols under the general name of genetic or molecular barcoding hebert and gregory 2005 which is based on the information carried by a single conventional marker such as the 16s rrna for microorganisms the shotgun sequencing consists in generating millions of dna fragments of different lengths from a starting pool of genomes these fragments cover a quote of the original genomes inversely proportional to the genome lengths and taxonomic assignment may be quantitative according to the proportion of fragments classified for each taxon the amplified products are sequenced controlled for quality and assembled in longer contigs the obtained sequences are classified at different taxonomic levels according to the best match with a reference sequence database and following different similarity criteria segata et al 2012 currently the most used sequencing platforms are characterized by different technical principles and include roche 454 gs flx pyrosequencing illumina miseq and hiseq reversible terminator sequencing by synthesis ion pgm semiconductor based sequencing by synthesis and the nanopore gridion and minion check hayden 2015 clooney et al 2016 ghanbari et al 2015 glenn 2011 performance evaluation and standardization of hts workflows are still limited for water microbial community characterization the dna extraction procedures and primers sets were reported to influence the assessment of the bacterial community composition in drinking waters with a generally effective representation of the core abundant taxa at total cell abundance levels of 103 105 cells ml brandt and albertsen 2018 moreover the method sensitivity was detrimentally affected owing to the occurrence of contaminating bacteria in extraction kits and laboratory reagents salter et al 2014 hts based technologies have been already tested under microgravity conditions and directly on the iss burton et al 2020 carr et al 2020 castro wallace et al 2017 mcintyre et al 2016 the most suitable candidate technology to be transported and mounted on the iss was the minion pocket size device fig 2 which can provide rapid identification up to 300 kb with single strand and 60 kb with double strands reads jain et al 2016 the integrity and activity of nanopores in which dna rna molecules pass through during base reading were not adversely affected by storage conditions launch cosmic radiations or handling in microgravity and reusability of flow cells was warranted specific indications to avoid air bubbles interference at the nanopores were implemented castro wallace et al 2017 rizzardi et al 2016 moreover minion performances in sequencing a mixture of genomic dna from a virus a bacterium and of mammal mtdna were comparable to those of minion illumina miseq and pacbio rsii run on ground accuracy respect to miseq and rsii was slightly inferior 89 identity to the reference genome respect to 99 but sufficient for sequence analysis sequencing reads were successfully assigned to the correct reference sequences in 90 of cases likely with the novel improved versions of flow cells the molecular detection of aquatic microorganisms will improve notably kilianski et al 2015 tests also demonstrated that real time metagenomics analysis was also possible by using a laptop device that can be integrated in the iss hardware considering genomic data analysis one of the least demanding platforms has been tested successfully simulating flight conditions and hardware availability onboard of the iss demonstrating its realistic applicability even on a laptop base castro wallace et al 2017 provided the adaptation of hardware and instruments to the spatial and logistic limitations onboard both the shotgun and amplicon approaches can be considered as suitable tools for microbial community characterization and pathogen detection on the iss the amplicon approach requires straightforward pcr amplification protocols downstream bioinformatics and database searches nevertheless this technique is prone to fail to detect unknown or highly divergent 16s rrna gene sequences which may be associated to novel or previously undetected pathogens moreover taxonomic assignment is highly sensitive to the gene region selected as a marker and to the assignment method claesson et al 2010 liu et al 2008 tremblay et al 2015 while accuracy of quantification can be affected by the variability in the number of gene copies shown by microbial taxon and even between individual cells of the same species větrovský and baldrian 2013 finally a common scientific view of suitable markers for viruses is still missing chakraborty et al 2014 in comparison to amplicon analysis the shotgun sequencing offers a wide genome coverage of organisms allowing the detection of unknown contaminants and the possibility to screen for both bacteria and viruses in the field of water quality monitoring the shotgun sequencing was used as benchmark method to assess the occurrence of potential multiple waterborne pathogens novel indicators for human sewage contamination and microbial safety of drinking water in relation to the efficiency of reclamation treatments chao et al 2013 lu et al 2015 mclellan and eren 2014 newton et al 2015 although the possibility to obtain up to a few thousands of base pairs for each read improved the microbial identification specificity non trivial disadvantages include the initial skimming of the huge number of produced reads their quality check and assemblage in contigs useful for classification which require high computational effort and time tan et al 2015 4 real time technologies for early warning microbial monitoring the total contamination assessment total microbial burden through the accurate quantification of microbial cell abundance and viability in waters circulating is a recognized necessity on space crewed vehicles morris et al 2012 different early warning real time methods that target parameters at the single cell level e g cellular biomolecules membrane integrity enzyme activity substrate uptake have been developed for water monitoring but only few can efficiently operate in flight like and space settings with reasonable requirements for analytical standardization 4 1 atp metry an option for real time monitoring of biological contamination in water samples is the analysis of adenosine triphosphate atp cell content the analysis is carried out through the chemical and or enzymatic extraction of this molecule from microbial cells followed by the measurement of light emission derived when the dissolved atp in presence of magnesium reacts with the luciferine substrate luciferase enzyme complex the emitted light intensity is linearly related to the atp concentration easily measurable using a luminometer and gives virtually instant information within minutes of the metabolically active microbial population this peculiarity makes it suitable as an early warning approach for measuring bacterial contamination and monitoring water treatment efficacy in near real time hammes et al 2010 the method is robust easy to perform and suitable to detect both cultivable and uncultivable cells with better estimates of total active microorganisms compared to heterotrophic plate counts the concomitant use of traditional cultivation based approaches showed levels of cultivable cells order of magnitude lower that those estimated by atp siebel et al 2008 zhang et al 2019a b the atp analysis was performed on pre flight and post flight iss water samples and revealed a biological contamination ranging between 0 drinking water and 4 9 104 cells ml humidity condensate bacci et al 2019 la duc et al 2004 recently the viable microbial contamination on board iss was reliably monitored on surface samples by intracellular atp measurement perrin et al 2018 venkateswaran et al 2003 atp assays were also proved effective in monitoring microbial contamination on surfaces from an inflated lunar mars analogous habitat during long term human occupation mayer et al 2016 the total atp content from both dead and live microbes and viable microorganisms intracellular atp content were in the range of 105 106 relative luminescence unit rlu m2 these results were in line with atp data measured directly on board within the experiment t2 carried out during euromir 95 mission guarnieri et al 1997 recently the atp metry was selected for the real time monitoring of the biological contamination on board iss within the h2020 european project biowyse biocontamination integrated control of wet systems for space exploration http biowyse eu aimed at developing a compact automatic and microgravity compatible on board systems for the prevention monitoring and control of microbial load in waters and on wet surfaces fig 2c a humid area sampler was recently developed and patented ref 102018000009137 dated 03 10 2018 detsis et al 2018 guarnieri et al 2019 today commercial kits for quantitative atp metry are available to monitor the microbial biomass level in water and to validate cleaning and disinfection procedures with a wide number of bulk and intracellular atp measurements on microbial communities reported from natural and engineered aquatic environments abushaban et al 2019 fillinger et al 2019 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 vang et al 2014 although the apparent advantages major technical limitations are related to the low sensitivity and result reproducibility at low cell concentration and sample volume 100 μl along with the susceptibility to environmental conditions e g ph temperature occurrence of enzyme inhibitors some drawbacks of the method are partly circumvented by using external and internal standards and by operating under controlled reproducible settings therefore the correlation between intracellular atp content and microbial cell counts will rely on a robust cross calibration with results from other reference methods amalfitano et al 2018b hammes et al 2010 it has been calculated that the average atp per cell content is approximately 1 75 10 10 nmol cell or 6 87 10 17 g atp cell zhang et al 2019a b however the amount of per cell atp can be significantly influenced by the phylogenetic affiliation and the cellular physiological status with diverse atp content reported between either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells from the same cultures bajerski et al 2018 yaginuma et al 2015 4 2 flow cytometry ubiquitously applied from the bio medical research to environmental sciences flow cytometry fcm is considered an unparalleled high throughput technology for single cell analysis robinson and roederer 2015 this generic technology allows the measure metry of the optical properties of cells cyto transported by a liquid sheath flow following sample intake a pressurized laminar flow is generated and suspended particles are individually forced to cross a light source excitation point for scanning and evaluation light scatter and fluorescence signals either with or without a secondary staining with fluorescent dyes are detected at the single cell level and instantly converted into digital information to be shown on multidimensional plots along with real time data analysis and statistics shapiro 2005 flow cytometry is included in the roadmaps of national space agencies worldwide and deemed as a necessary technology for defining and monitoring spaceflight associated requirements since early 80 s owing to the high versatility for diagnostic medicine e g hematology immunology and physiology this technology was so far retained as a prime asset for health monitoring and clinical laboratory diagnostics for astronauts in view of the upcoming deep space exploration missions crucian and sams 2012 a flow cytometry platform was already successfully tested on board the iss to monitor and understand the physiological adaptations of astronauts to microgravity dubeau laramée et al 2014 phipps et al 2014 fig 2d advanced developments of the prototype were based on commercialized flow cytometer with significant additional engineering modifications mostly aimed to generate laminar particle flow distinct from the standard sheath fluid based method and to reduce the significant amount of liquid biohazardous waste and energy operating requirements the laminar flow within the flow chamber was found to be dramatically altered by microgravity in turn the unavoidable elimination of the fluid mechanical setting for particle hydrodynamic focusing was proved to significantly reduce liquid waste and the total system operational load in terms either of instrument size and weight or energy consumption cohen et al 2011 crucian and sams 2005 notwithstanding the recent system design improvements peripheral blood cells has been retained as the only target for first studies in space environments mcmonigal and crucian 2015 since a flow cytometer can provide support to a wide range of scientific applications e g biology microbiology and environmental science it is needless to point out that a spaceflight compatible machine could satisfy the unmet flight requirements for water monitoring and treatment to complete future long duration missions in closed healthy environments the high sensitivity for scanning very small objects i e from virus like particles to prokaryotes to pico and micro eukaryotes and the wide detectable cell concentration range generally between 102 and 107 cells ml 1 without concentrating or diluting the samples represent unmatched features of this technology for water monitoring a broad suite of assays is available for microbial quality assessments in natural and engineered aquatic ecosystems amalfitano et al 2014 boi et al 2016 gasol and morán 2015 van nevel et al 2017 successful applications are reported to provide early warning indications of unexpected water contamination events through the rapid detection of a variety of microbiological threats including pathogenic and potentially toxic microorganisms vital et al 2010 weisse and bergkemper 2018 yang et al 2010 moreover flow cytometric measurements are suitable to evaluate the efficiency of various industrial microbial bioprocesses e g food and pharmaceutical preparations díaz et al 2010 and the performances of engineered systems for water treatment besmer and hammes 2016 safford and bischel 2019 vergine et al 2020 remarkably fcm was also useful to determine the presence of nonliving organic and inorganic substances including nano and micro sized particles suspended solids flocs and aggregates of various origins aulenta et al 2013 casentini et al 2016 liu et al 2016 on going instrumental developments for on site applications are directed to install flow cytometers on either mobile units e g ships and vehicles or fixed locations e g treatment plants marine buoys off shore platforms with the possibility for automatic programmable staining of aquatic microorganisms and remote data transfer buysschaert et al 2018 pomati et al 2011 thyssen et al 2007 leaving aside the high costs of all sophisticated systems the need for specially trained staff is likely to represent a major drawback in the daily scheduled

et al 2013 further work is also required to establish user independent strategies for gating and data handling amalfitano et al 2018a koch et al 2014 one more specific challenge is the lack of phylogenetic resolution despite the enumeration of targeted taxa may rely on specific fluorescence staining procedures couradeau et al 2019 manti et al 2011 neuenschwander et al 2015 the cytometric information characterizing different subpopulations of microbial cells is generally ataxonomic a direct link between cytometric fingerprinting and microbial diversity assessed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was demonstrated in recent studies props et al 2017 2016 however the computational workflows are convoluted and still under development rubbens et al 2019 5 comparative analysis of space relevant technological features the procedural workflows of each of the mature technologies herein entitled for water microbial monitoring in space comprise major steps and provide different types of results the overall time to results can vary from minutes to days largely relying on user dependent manual operations and technological solutions for automation fig 3 standardization efforts have been already adopted in terrestrial studies by including all pre analytical sample preparation analytical instrument setup and post analytical analysis and interpretation steps kalina 2020 however both current and future applications in space will be necessarily bounded by the definition of novel standards of microbial quality i e other than those applied on earth by cultivation dependent approaches amalfitano et al 2018b but also by a compromise between the best analytical performances and detrimental practical issues to cope with during spaceflights the implementation of successful on board workflows will critically rely on the overall water cycle management pickett et al 2020 while fundamental analytical aspects can be constrained by the minimal amount of water available for routine monitoring activities for example technological accuracy and result reproducibility are directly linked to workable water volumes and the constitutive occurrence of microbial targets in the sample e g microbial cell abundance per cell gene copies cell viability volumes required for accurate and reproducible analyses will reasonably range between few tens of microliters e g for flow cytometric assessments and hundreds of milliliters e g for cultivation and nucleic acid based methods as also reported in terrestrial studies safford and bischel 2019 notably sample filtration a major pre treatment step for atp metry and nucleic acid based methods can selectively concentrate the microbial biomass and target microorganisms while minimizing the water loss for analytical needs the filtering surfaces are also suitable for visual inspection e g by microscopy storage and comparative analysis e g on earth however filtration can influence the composition of the dissolved organic matter of the permeate water possibly triggering microbial regrowth in the downstream distribution system park et al 2018 and it will also necessitate additional crew time for manual operations e g filter substitution regeneration disposal sufficient data are not yet available from real space conditions to implement protocol details within the procedural workflows although the selected technologies were demonstratively applied under either simulated or real microgravity conditions their own critical advantages and limitations will require full reconsideration for flight like and space applications from the one hand analytical benefits will necessarily include the time needed to achieve results i e speed to results the accuracy and flexibility in detecting specifically selected microbial targets i e identification depth with reproducible consistent results i e reproducibility and the number and multiple type of achievable results i e herein named multiparametricity on the other hand the operating conditions can be particularly stringent and limiting the direct applicability in space unless addressing critical requirements such as reagent usage waste production operator skills and crew time table 1 using a simplistic pairwise comparison we sought to emphasize that few selected technological features have to be consciously retained from the methodological proof of concept level up to the device deployment instrumental demonstration and routine use in the on board housekeeping program although the comparative scores were assigned subjectively table s1 it is likely evident that the stringent requirements of microbial water monitoring in space cannot be met by a single technological solution 6 system miniaturization and future challenges an important point is that the monitoring technologies can be mission dependent but only those instruments that minimize crew involvement in their end to end operation are likely to be applicable on the long term karouia et al 2017 overall the selected devices have to be compact suitable for automation low power consuming and virtually invisible except when needed limero and wallace 2017 the ground based counterparts have already been miniaturized using microfluidics but the deployment of monitoring effective tools onboard spacecrafts will also require substantial reengineering and instrumental customization the instruments deployed so far have not been yet permanently used in spaceflight water monitoring yet numerous examples of successful international projects and commercial partnerships dedicated to the human space exploration let argue that critical space water related tasks can be operatively accomplished at reasonable costs and times 5 years karouia et al 2017 considerable progress has been made in miniature the onboard instrumentation to assess the water microbiological contamination this also includes microbial cultivation systems such as the aquapad developed by the french cnes space agency augelli 2018 the microfluidic chips that allow cell isolation and incubation have been developed for ground based applications and appear suitable for space uses for example the encapsulation of single cells from a mixed microbial community into small droplet compartments of a water in oil emulsion can offer further opportunities for physiological studies and viability assays e g metabolic by products diffusion resistance to toxicants enzymatic activities on clonal populations isolated into plugs or micro petri dishes boedicker et al 2008 boitard et al 2015 considering the ability of microfluidic systems to efficiently conduct measurements on small volumes of complex fluids without the need for a skilled operator lab on a chip technologies and portable diagnostic devices have gained increased popularity for sensing a wide range of water parameters and microbial pathogens even in the most remote settings mairhofer et al 2009 more recently new qpcr platforms based on microfluidic technologies have been developed allowing the simultaneous analysis of numerous genes and samples in volume chambers of few nanoliters placed at high density on a chip ricchi et al 2017 being less sensitive to inhibitors than qpcr the digital pcr dpcr is mainly applied to monitor gene transcriptions in microbial cells without the need of a standard curve for gene copy quantification devonshire et al 2016 the system miniaturization was also considered the most appealing trait for space applications of the nanopore dna sequencer minion castro wallace et al 2017 by assembling miniaturized and lab on a chip solutions the water monitoring suite developed by nasa represents so far the best performing custom built device applied successfully on the iss to monitor different water quality properties along with the hach colorimeter and the organic water module respectively used for inorganic and organic chemical assessments the hardware suite also includes the pcr based instrument razor ex with customized sample pouch kits containing all pre loaded reagents necessary for sampling sample preparation and real time pcr https www nasa gov mission pages station research experiments explorer investigation html id 1847 however as space exploration progresses toward extended missions to cis lunar space and mars pcr based and multi omics instruments onboard spacecraft should not be considered in separation from other technologies needed for the in flight microbiological research karouia et al 2017 in particular microfluidic platforms developed for the direct cell detection showed promising perspectives because of the potential for precise and easy to use analytical procedures while enhancing analytical performances the system miniaturization presents also the advantages of reduced consumption of reagents and the ability to integrate monitoring and isolation procedures within a single device auroux et al 2002 a simple microfluidic system was successfully tested for rapid and semi automated bacterial enumeration in freshwaters and promising outcomes suggested its applicability to drinking waters under both ground and space conditions yamaguchi et al 2014 moreover both sensitivity and specificity of atp metry and fcm can be also improved by miniaturizing the core systems down to scales closer to the ones of microorganisms a micro fluorescence activated cell sorting μfacs was used to sort out cells of interest by changing the flow direction after cell detection fu et al 1999 an integrated platform that combines two different force fields in a single microfluidic device dielectrophoretic magnetic activated cell sorter idmacs was applied for simultaneous sorting of multiple bacterial targets kim and soh 2009 more recently a high throughput raman flow cytometer was developed on a microfluidic chip for the label free molecular fingerprinting at the single cell level hiramatsu et al 2019 the onboard laboratory miniaturization included also the fluidic components e g pumps valves electronics thus paving the way to the use of advanced biosensors for screening food safety and water quality in space roda et al 2018 following the proofs of concept and wearable technologies suited to monitor astronauts health the biosensing diagnostic instrumentation most reasonably based on electrochemical and optical detectors was argued as a secondary future option for in flight water biochemical analyses choi et al 2018 grigorev et al 2020 limero and wallace 2017 nelson 2011 in particular the amperometric biosensors were proved sensitive to monitor different water analytes chemical contaminants e g pesticides organophosphates carbamates and numerous microbial biomarkers successfully targeted to detect the major microbiological agents food and water borne pathogens e g e coli salmonella l monocytogenes c jejuni b cereus m smegmatis grieshaber et al 2008 velusamy et al 2010 however despite providing concrete benefits for health services and our life on earth and beyond the spectroscopic and biosensing devices are still at a low level of technological readiness for in flight applications garcía descalzo et al 2019 own et al 2019 roda et al 2018 thus falling out of the scopes of this review in general a critical aspect of all microfluidic and lab on a chip solutions is bound to the very limited system reusability most miniaturized devices for terrestrial applications are of single use and in many cases based on disposable cartridges that cannot be safely stowed onboard during long term space missions when cells are delivered to different system compartments for collection there is no clear approach for removal the analyzed samples without compromising the system functioning and risking contamination clogging issues may also interfere with the analyses due to the processing of large sample volumes reusable systems have been tested but their applications in space are likely constrained by the risk of sample carryover reduced analytical performance upon extended reuse and the resources required for cleaning and reactivation procedures in this regard the technological development is highly demanding and still far from being accomplished in a near future 7 conclusions current technologies for water microbial monitoring can satisfy the needs of long term space exploration missions at reasonable costs and times although substantial instrumental reengineering has to be considered the suitable methodological applications at a high technology readiness level i e at least validated in a flight like environment will require reduced space to be allocated and can potentially provide rapid and specific responses regarding the in flight occurrence of the microbiological contamination the advanced biomolecular characterization of water samples from the iss is promoting a better understanding of the onboard levels and patterns of microbial contamination thus contributing to the development of space bound technologies for the rapid and specific identification of microorganisms of health concerns as space exploration progresses toward longer missions pcr based and multi omics approaches can be complemented by real time technologies needed for the in flight microbiological research and suitable for the early warning microbial

require technological advances to promptly identify and counteract contingent events of waterborne microbial contamination posing health risks to astronauts with lowered immune responsiveness the search for bio analytical approaches alternative to those applied on earth by cultivation dependent methods is pushed by the compelling need to limit waste disposal and avoid microbial regrowth from

liquid water is essential for all known earth derived life forms living in space conditions including microbes mckay 2014 the on going space exploration has not yet demonstrated whether the presence of extra terrestrial water could indicate itself the occurrence of microbial life but the prevailing paradigm is that living microorganisms necessitate temporal and spatial proximity with aqueous solutions for their metabolism martín torres et al 2015 merino et al 2019 stevenson et al 2015 in turn the microbial contamination cannot be thoroughly eliminated from earth s waters but only controlled and attenuated on the long term time scale lopez et al 2019 o rourke et al 2020b rettberg et al 2019 since space exploration has been demanding longer lasting missions the analysis of waterborne microorganisms turned out of utmost importance for future human spaceflights planetary outposts and life support systems horneck et al 2010 the prevention of crew infectious waterborne diseases is retained among the highest priorities particularly for long duration missions ott et al 2014 since emergency resupply is unrealistic and recycled water could represent the only suitable source for the on board activities most of the aquatic microorganisms found aboard the international space station iss do not generally constitute a severe hazard for human health blaustein et al 2019 checinska sielaff et al 2019 sobisch et al 2019 however they may threat astronauts with reduced immune response mostly following prolonged microgravity stress conditions garrett bakelman et al 2019 netea et al 2020 ott et al 2016 other concerning issues arise from microbial influences on spacecraft integrity and function owing to the potential corrosion and degradation of stainless steel and other materials associated with the electronic equipment and life support systems horneck et al 2010 yang et al 2018 zea et al 2018 therefore there is an increasing interest to improve the spacecraft water monitoring systems to identify and possibly counteract contingent events of microbial contamination ichijo et al 2020 van houdt et al 2012 yamaguchi et al 2014 the definition identification and test of the microbial monitoring approaches suitable for the on board water quality control are challenged by several technical constraints e g material safety compatibility resistance to launch

et al 2017 liu 2017 moissl eichinger et al 2016 mora et al 2016 yamaguchi et al 2014 in this article we narrow the focus on promising bio analytic technologies for quality assessments of waters in space with the aim to explore advantages and limitations beyond their current applications on earth starting from the rigorous housekeeping program and the consolidated results of water monitoring activity on the iss duncan et al 2008 limero and wallace 2017 we provide a critical overview of the microbial monitoring approaches based on flexible technologies for the identification of microbial components and a total contamination assessment total microbial burden in waters circulating on crewed space vehicles 2 water recycle and microbial monitoring aboard the international space station 2 1 the iss water cycle the water recycling system innovations required to support iss activities have been listed among the major benefits for humanity detsis and detsis 2013 nasa et al 2019 the iss is provided with potable water from different suppliers coordinated by the space agencies of united states national aeronautics and space administration nasa russia russian federal space agency roscosmos europe european space agency esa and japan japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa bruce et al 2005 van houdt et al 2012 all the possible necessary precautions to prevent external contamination are applied throughout water transferring and loading steps over the entire treatment period before the liftoff of supply modules for instance the american and russian waters are produced in conditioned and limited access areas and preparation facilities with no risk of accidental water quality modifications during the production process at the research center of the italian società metropolitana acque torino smat purified waters for space travels are also processed upon selecting well and spring waters that most closely meet the physical chemical and bacteriological quality standards for astronauts lobascio et al 2004 currently on iss waters for direct human consumption are regularly delivered and recovered in order to guarantee approximately 4 l per person per day fig 1 a reserve of potable water up to approx 2000 l is stored in contingency containers to maintain iss operations in response to emergency scenarios carter et al 2018 although routinely monitored and kept constant the overall water mass balance represents a recurrent major challenge owing to the various iss water needs pickett et al 2020 beside the on demand crew consumption on board waters are distributed for different purposes comprising hygiene and cleaning practices urinal flushing oxygen generation via electrolysis life support systems and flexible water based experimental activities e g vegetable and food production systems animal physiology and behavioral adaptation tests baiocco et al 2018 chatani et al 2015 massa et al 2016 niederwieser et al 2018 ronca et al 2019 wolff et al 2018 wastewaters are continuously collected and recycled at high efficiency level pickett et al 2020 in the us segment the water recovery and management system was reported to recuperate up to 85 from crew urine and flush water along with the water content from liquid wastes and humidity condensate from the cabin various containers reservoirs tanks and bellows are also necessary to maintain water pressure and circulation through the distribution network carter et al 2018 since microbial growth is unavoidable in persistent stagnation zones and at varying residence times along the water distribution network lautenschlager et al 2010 ling et al 2018 the pre and in flight addition of biocides is used for residual microbial control molecular iodine is applied in the u s segment while the ionic silver level is amended in russian waters both at low concentrations i e not detrimental for human health artemyeva 2016 lobascio et al 2004 moreover high temperature in the catalytic reactor multifiltration beds within the water processor assembly uv c leds within the co2 concentration assembly of the advanced closed loop system and novel antimicrobial coatings on various iss surfaces were proved effective against potential microbial biomass growth bockstahler et al 2017 carter et al 2018 perrin et al 2018 petala et al 2020 roman et al 2006 sobisch et al 2019 finally the iss is maintained at pressure and oxygen levels very close to those at sea level on earth with a cabin temperature of about 22 c and a relative humidity of about 60 in order to minimize detrimental growth of microbial biofilms on cabin surfaces pierson et al 2013 2 2 on board water monitoring and microbial contamination the achievement and maintenance of water quality standards are evaluated by systematic monitoring procedures limero and wallace 2017 major water physical chemical parameters including conductivity ph total organic total inorganic and total carbon nitrate potassium chloride and ammonium are monitored in flight together with iodine and silver levels artemyeva 2016 moreover a robust monitoring program was implemented to verify that risks of microbial contamination were within acceptable limits in samples collected from different sites of the russian and us segments respectively once every three months and each month pierson et al 2013 van houdt and leys 2012 crewmembers use handheld equipment to monitor iss waters and humidity condensate from surfaces chemical and biological samples are taken concurrently and at a frequency that may change due to real time flight necessities pierson et al 2013 water samples can be processed on board by cultivation based methods using the us supplied water microbiology kit for the quantification of total heterotrophic bacteria and coliforms bruce et al 2005 the maximum total number of aerobic heterotrophic viable bacterial cells counted as colony forming units on a rich agar medium was internationally defined according to the concentration levels that are achievable with the current prevention and monitoring technologies available and applicable for space i e hpc 50 cfu ml microbial quality standards are also set for iss internal surfaces from which humidity condensate is collected maximum bacterial load 10 000 cfu 100 cm2 maximum fungal load 100 cfu 100 cm2 van houdt and leys 2012 along with the on board monitoring activities archival water samples are regularly collected in teflon bags fig 1 preserved and returned to earth approximately every three months for post flight analyses limero and wallace 2017 the microbial contamination level was above the former acceptability limits several times during previous in flight monitoring surveys events of microbial biofilm growth within space vehicles were mainly associated with the water layer covering internal surfaces and life support systems la duc et al 2004 novikova et al 2006 roman et al 2006 thus waters collected from humidity condensate were retained among the major sources of microbiological hazard for potable water quality deterioration horneck et al 2010 several cultivable microbial isolates obtained from spaceflights were mainly affiliated to bacteria and fungi bruce et al 2005 coil et al 2016 novikova et al 2006 o rourke et al 2020b for the purposes of this review it is worth noting that the analysis of the microbial cultivable fraction were likely to provide only a limited snapshot of the highly diverse community found on the iss by cultivation independent methods checinska sielaff et al 2019 coil et al 2016 de middeleer et al 2019 ichijo et al 2016 lang et al 2017 mora et al 2019 morris et al 2012 despite major advantages arise from target specific isolation and characterization of different types of waterborne microorganisms and pathogens in pure culture a number of technical and logistic disadvantages characterizes the space application of cultivation based methods the microgravity conditions provide conflicting results on microbial growth and virulence of opportunistic human pathogens gilbert et al 2020 morrison et al 2017 o rourke et al 2020a b zhang et al 2019 while the analysis of archival samples generates a detrimental time gap for a flight supportive result interpretation huang et al 2018 novikova et al 2006 hpc was proved to be also affected by carbon sources in cultivation media the incubation time and the initial microbial load level amalfitano et al 2018b finally the prompt development and requirement update of alternate bio analytical technologies for microbial monitoring during space exploration is pushed fundamentally by the need to avoid microbial regrowth from analytical wastes wong et al 2017 3 nucleic acid amplification based methods for microbial identification in space waters methods based on nucleic acid amplification offer the advantage of specific and fast detection easy automatization and standardization many of the limitations of cultivation based techniques adopted for bacterial detection and water quality monitoring are overwhelmed by largely reducing the time required for the microbial identification including also viable but not cultivable bacteria and un cultivable pathogens 3 1 sample pre treatments and nucleic acid extraction in space sample pre treatment and nucleic acid extraction are key starting points for most of the molecular approaches and product developments dedicated to microbial water quality monitoring nucleic acids extracted from water samples are amplified to specific markers the extraction and purification of nucleic acids rely on cell lysis and the selective binding of cellular dna and rna to solid surfaces through filtration and column based protocols a fast biomolecular analysis can be conducted in space settings with the in line implementation of optimized protocols for fast dna and rna extraction and sample preparation for sequencing published studies reported new promising field deployable amplification devices and approaches for on board applications boguraev et al 2017 montague et al 2018 fig 2 a and b simplified sample processing and dna purification strategies have currently been tested aboard the international space station iss the wetlab 2 project has already developed and tested on the iss a sample preparation module spm to lyse cells and to provide high quality extraction of nucleic acids by circumventing operational issues related to microgravity surface tension alteration reduced operational space and handling expertise parra et al 2017 numerous commercialized kits for solid phase extraction allow handy and rapid nucleic acid purification procedures in which potential contaminants are removed through sequential washing steps based on centrifugation or dna separation by paramagnetic beads tan and yiap 2009 methods for the direct pcr amplification without dna extraction were also developed williams et al 2017 recent papers reported simplified methods for nucleic acid purification and amplification directly on filtration membranes kaliyappan et al 2012 rodriguez et al 2016 notably a cellulose paper based dipstick was used to efficiently bind wash and elute purified nucleic acids from different matrices without any pipetting or electrical equipment zou et al 2017 nevertheless a major bottleneck for the in flight application of amplification based approaches still lies on the need for time consuming and waste producing sample concentration and dna extraction girones et al 2010 in particular the method sensibility is lowered when amplifying targets present at low levels over the total extracted dna brandt and albertsen 2018 suboptimal dna extraction and purification are known to affect results of biomolecular analysis mainly owing to uncomplete lysis of more resistant bacterial populations and poor removal of dna polymerase inhibitors albertsen et al 2015 girones et al 2010 dna purification requires effective cell disruption inactivation of nucleases and purification of dna from contaminants that might interfere with the amplification efficiency residual extracellular dna could not be easily discriminated from that of viable dangerous microorganisms thus leading to an overestimation of risk for human health girones et al 2010 moreover waterborne substances can concentrate together with dna during sample processing and inhibit polymerase enzymes thus influencing the sensitivity and reliability of the pcr based microbial detection overall the relative accuracy and precision i e repeatability and reproducibility of nucleic acid amplification based methods are affected by sample type and pre treatment methods concentration and dna extraction thus requiring to be evaluated across the whole sample processing hospodsky et al 2010 kralik and ricchi 2017 3 2 target based techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic acids the polymerase chain reaction pcr is widely used for detecting genes and microorganisms of health concern in water ramírez castillo et al 2015 among these target based detection approaches the loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp of nucleic acids was retained as a rapid and sensible option zhao et al 2015 with minimal requirements for the in flight water quality monitoring and pathogen detection ott et al 2014 rubinfien et al 2020 the amplification takes place at isothermal temperature 60 65 c and positive reactions can be visualised by naked eye i e without post amplification steps following the increase of sample turbidity or colour owing to the addition of fluorescent dyes notomi et al 2015 being less sensible than pcr to inhibition and not significantly influenced by non target dna direct lamp assays are currently used with good analytical performances etchebarne et al 2017 samhan et al 2017 low amount of dna can be amplified up to generating 109 copies within 1 h and producing as final amplification product a complex stem loop dna with several inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower like structures commercial kits for the rapid on site detection of water pathogens are already available for terrestrial applications also comprising quantitative real time lamp reverse transcription rt lamp in situ lamp and viable lamp notomi et al 2015 for the scopes of this review it is worth noting that a rapid method for detecting approximately 1 cfu 100 ml of legionella pneumophila in tap water was developed and efficiently applied on field in less than 2 working hours through a direct on filter lamp amplification with live dead propidium monoazide pma differentiation samhan et al 2017 among the target based quantification approaches the quantitative pcr qpcr represents a popular technique for the in flight water quality monitoring oubre et al 2013 the quantification of target sequences is based on the development of a fluorescent signal proportional to the amount of amplified product obtained during the pcr thermal cycles multiplex qpcr can be used for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple pathogens consistently reducing analytical time and costs ibekwe et al 2002 lagier et al 2004 with low detection limits 400 cells per sample and volume requirements 100 μl of sample qpcr assays are routinely applied in monitoring plans for the detection and quantification of waterborne pathogens girones et al 2010 ramírez castillo et al 2015 good repeatability and reproducibility of qpcr outcomes were reported for gene targets of fecal origin and a standardized workflow achieved consistent results with low intra and inter laboratory coefficients of variation median cv 0 1 3 3 and 1 9 7 1 respectively ebentier et al 2013 orin et al 2012 a large body of the scientific literature has documented the development and use of qpcr for pathogenic viruses bacteria protozoa and fungi kralik and ricchi 2017 ramírez castillo et al 2015 through a pre treatment with cell membrane impermeant dna intercalating dyes the so called viable qpcr was applied for discriminating between viable with intact membrane and dead with damaged membrane bacteria allowing the quantification of water and food borne pathogens such as campylobacter e coli o157 h7 legionella pneumophila salmonella cryptosporidium banihashemi et al 2012 brescia et al 2009 delgado viscogliosi et al 2009 given the versatile applications of the numerous available assays both lamp and qpcr have been retained as suitable water monitoring methods for long term exploration missions owing to the high sensitivity specificity and simple post amplification steps to detect the amplified targets lamp was proposed by the japanese aerospace exploration agency as alternative microbial contamination monitoring system for the iss ott et al 2014 for the analysis of crew health related genetic modifications qpcr technologies have been successfully tested on board the iss within the projects gene in space and wet lab2 devoted to definition of a robust user friendly nucleic acid extraction and sequencing approach aboard iss boguraev et al 2017 https www genesinspace org https www nasa gov mission pages station research experiments 1913 html https www nasa gov ames research space biosciences wetlab 2 moreover the razor ex pcr launched on space x 9 july 2016 within water monitoring suite project will allow performing direct pcr amplification from water samples in all current space applications however the selected target based detection and quantification approaches require the use of disposable materials and labour intense protocols which will inevitably reduce their long term applicability in space conditions the general precautions used on earth to limit contamination risks including the most stringent procedures applied in clean rooms rettberg et al 2019 might also represent a limiting practical issue in the small close spacecraft environment since the high sensibility of pcr based detection increases the chance of amplifying carry over contamination with the consequent production of false positive results this is crucial for lamp owing to the limited accessibility to degradation of dna products while a major limitation of qpcr is also the occurrence of inhibitors that can be co concentrated or extracted along with nucleic acids from the target microorganisms gibson et al 2012 the presence of qpcr inhibitors introduces a number of problems ranging from low amplification efficiency and reduced assay sensitivity to complete reaction failure and false negative results radstrom et al 2008 3 3 sequencing based omics approaches for microbial community characterization the high throughput sequencing hts encloses a popular suite of technologies methodological approaches and data elaboration workflows used to characterize the phylogenetic composition of the total microbial community in different aquatic matrices the taxonomic classification is based on the huge amount of sequences generated by either a portion of the cellular nucleic acid content or the whole genome through the so called amplicon and shotgun sequencing approaches respectively peabody et al 2015 the amplicon analysis represents the extension of sequencing based methods of organisms classification defined by specific protocols under the general name of genetic or molecular barcoding hebert and gregory 2005 which is based on the information carried by a single conventional marker such as the 16s rrna for microorganisms the shotgun sequencing consists in generating millions of dna fragments of different lengths from a starting pool of genomes these fragments cover a quote of the original genomes inversely proportional to the genome lengths and taxonomic assignment may be quantitative according to the proportion of fragments classified for each taxon the amplified products are sequenced controlled for quality and assembled in longer contigs the obtained sequences are classified at different taxonomic levels according to the best match with a reference sequence database and following different similarity criteria segata et al 2012 currently the most used sequencing platforms are characterized by different technical principles and include roche 454 gs flx pyrosequencing illumina miseq and hiseq reversible terminator sequencing by synthesis ion pgm semiconductor based sequencing by synthesis and the nanopore gridion and minion check hayden 2015 clooney et al 2016 ghanbari et al 2015 glenn 2011 performance evaluation and standardization of hts workflows are still limited for water microbial community characterization the dna extraction procedures and primers sets were reported to influence the assessment of the bacterial community composition in drinking waters with a generally effective representation of the core abundant taxa at total cell abundance levels of 103 105 cells ml brandt and albertsen 2018 moreover the method sensitivity was detrimentally affected owing to the occurrence of contaminating bacteria in extraction kits and laboratory reagents salter et al 2014 hts based technologies have been already tested under microgravity conditions and directly on the iss burton et al 2020 carr et al 2020 castro wallace et al 2017 mcintyre et al 2016 the most suitable candidate technology to be transported and mounted on the iss was the minion pocket size device fig 2 which can provide rapid identification up to 300 kb with single strand and 60 kb with double strands reads jain et al 2016 the integrity and activity of nanopores in which dna rna molecules pass through during base reading were not adversely affected by storage conditions launch cosmic radiations or handling in microgravity and reusability of flow cells was warranted specific indications to avoid air bubbles interference at the nanopores were implemented castro wallace et al 2017 rizzardi et al 2016 moreover minion performances in sequencing a mixture of genomic dna from a virus a bacterium and of mammal mtdna were comparable to those of minion illumina miseq and pacbio rsii run on ground accuracy respect to miseq and rsii was slightly inferior 89 identity to the reference genome respect to 99 but sufficient for sequence analysis sequencing reads were successfully assigned to the correct reference sequences in 90 of cases likely with the novel improved versions of flow cells the molecular detection of aquatic microorganisms will improve notably kilianski et al 2015 tests also demonstrated that real time metagenomics analysis was also possible by using a laptop device that can be integrated in the iss hardware considering genomic data analysis one of the least demanding platforms has been tested successfully simulating flight conditions and hardware availability onboard of the iss demonstrating its realistic applicability even on a laptop base castro wallace et al 2017 provided the adaptation of hardware and instruments to the spatial and logistic limitations onboard both the shotgun and amplicon approaches can be considered as suitable tools for microbial community characterization and pathogen detection on the iss the amplicon approach requires straightforward pcr amplification protocols downstream bioinformatics and database searches nevertheless this technique is prone to fail to detect unknown or highly divergent 16s rrna gene sequences which may be associated to novel or previously undetected pathogens moreover taxonomic assignment is highly sensitive to the gene region selected as a marker and to the assignment method claesson et al 2010 liu et al 2008 tremblay et al 2015 while accuracy of quantification can be affected by the variability in the number of gene copies shown by microbial taxon and even between individual cells of the same species větrovský and baldrian 2013 finally a common scientific view of suitable markers for viruses is still missing chakraborty et al 2014 in comparison to amplicon analysis the shotgun sequencing offers a wide genome coverage of organisms allowing the detection of unknown contaminants and the possibility to screen for both bacteria and viruses in the field of water quality monitoring the shotgun sequencing was used as benchmark method to assess the occurrence of potential multiple waterborne pathogens novel indicators for human sewage contamination and microbial safety of drinking water in relation to the efficiency of reclamation treatments chao et al 2013 lu et al 2015 mclellan and eren 2014 newton et al 2015 although the possibility to obtain up to a few thousands of base pairs for each read improved the microbial identification specificity non trivial disadvantages include the initial skimming of the huge number of produced reads their quality check and assemblage in contigs useful for classification which require high computational effort and time tan et al 2015 4 real time technologies for early warning microbial monitoring the total contamination assessment total microbial burden through the accurate quantification of microbial cell abundance and viability in waters circulating is a recognized necessity on space crewed vehicles morris et al 2012 different early warning real time methods that target parameters at the single cell level e g cellular biomolecules membrane integrity enzyme activity substrate uptake have been developed for water monitoring but only few can efficiently operate in flight like and space settings with reasonable requirements for analytical standardization 4 1 atp metry an option for real time monitoring of biological contamination in water samples is the analysis of adenosine triphosphate atp cell content the analysis is carried out through the chemical and or enzymatic extraction of this molecule from microbial cells followed by the measurement of light emission derived when the dissolved atp in presence of magnesium reacts with the luciferine substrate luciferase enzyme complex the emitted light intensity is linearly related to the atp concentration easily measurable using a luminometer and gives virtually instant information within minutes of the metabolically active microbial population this peculiarity makes it suitable as an early warning approach for measuring bacterial contamination and monitoring water treatment efficacy in near real time hammes et al 2010 the method is robust easy to perform and suitable to detect both cultivable and uncultivable cells with better estimates of total active microorganisms compared to heterotrophic plate counts the concomitant use of traditional cultivation based approaches showed levels of cultivable cells order of magnitude lower that those estimated by atp siebel et al 2008 zhang et al 2019a b the atp analysis was performed on pre flight and post flight iss water samples and revealed a biological contamination ranging between 0 drinking water and 4 9 104 cells ml humidity condensate bacci et al 2019 la duc et al 2004 recently the viable microbial contamination on board iss was reliably monitored on surface samples by intracellular atp measurement perrin et al 2018 venkateswaran et al 2003 atp assays were also proved effective in monitoring microbial contamination on surfaces from an inflated lunar mars analogous habitat during long term human occupation mayer et al 2016 the total atp content from both dead and live microbes and viable microorganisms intracellular atp content were in the range of 105 106 relative luminescence unit rlu m2 these results were in line with atp data measured directly on board within the experiment t2 carried out during euromir 95 mission guarnieri et al 1997 recently the atp metry was selected for the real time monitoring of the biological contamination on board iss within the h2020 european project biowyse biocontamination integrated control of wet systems for space exploration http biowyse eu aimed at developing a compact automatic and microgravity compatible on board systems for the prevention monitoring and control of microbial load in waters and on wet surfaces fig 2c a humid area sampler was recently developed and patented ref 102018000009137 dated 03 10 2018 detsis et al 2018 guarnieri et al 2019 today commercial kits for quantitative atp metry are available to monitor the microbial biomass level in water and to validate cleaning and disinfection procedures with a wide number of bulk and intracellular atp measurements on microbial communities reported from natural and engineered aquatic environments abushaban et al 2019 fillinger et al 2019 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 vang et al 2014 although the apparent advantages major technical limitations are related to the low sensitivity and result reproducibility at low cell concentration and sample volume 100 μl along with the susceptibility to environmental conditions e g ph temperature occurrence of enzyme inhibitors some drawbacks of the method are partly circumvented by using external and internal standards and by operating under controlled reproducible settings therefore the correlation between intracellular atp content and microbial cell counts will rely on a robust cross calibration with results from other reference methods amalfitano et al 2018b hammes et al 2010 it has been calculated that the average atp per cell content is approximately 1 75 10 10 nmol cell or 6 87 10 17 g atp cell zhang et al 2019a b however the amount of per cell atp can be significantly influenced by the phylogenetic affiliation and the cellular physiological status with diverse atp content reported between either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells from the same cultures bajerski et al 2018 yaginuma et al 2015 4 2 flow cytometry ubiquitously applied from the bio medical research to environmental sciences flow cytometry fcm is considered an unparalleled high throughput technology for single cell analysis robinson and roederer 2015 this generic technology allows the measure metry of the optical properties of cells cyto transported by a liquid sheath flow following sample intake a pressurized laminar flow is generated and suspended particles are individually forced to cross a light source excitation point for scanning and evaluation light scatter and fluorescence signals either with or without a secondary staining with fluorescent dyes are detected at the single cell level and instantly converted into digital information to be shown on multidimensional plots along with real time data analysis and statistics shapiro 2005 flow cytometry is included in the roadmaps of national space agencies worldwide and deemed as a necessary technology for defining and monitoring spaceflight associated requirements since early 80 s owing to the high versatility for diagnostic medicine e g hematology immunology and physiology this technology was so far retained as a prime asset for health monitoring and clinical laboratory diagnostics for astronauts in view of the upcoming deep space exploration missions crucian and sams 2012 a flow cytometry platform was already successfully tested on board the iss to monitor and understand the physiological adaptations of astronauts to microgravity dubeau laramée et al 2014 phipps et al 2014 fig 2d advanced developments of the prototype were based on commercialized flow cytometer with significant additional engineering modifications mostly aimed to generate laminar particle flow distinct from the standard sheath fluid based method and to reduce the significant amount of liquid biohazardous waste and energy operating requirements the laminar flow within the flow chamber was found to be dramatically altered by microgravity in turn the unavoidable elimination of the fluid mechanical setting for particle hydrodynamic focusing was proved to significantly reduce liquid waste and the total system operational load in terms either of instrument size and weight or energy consumption cohen et al 2011 crucian and sams 2005 notwithstanding the recent system design improvements peripheral blood cells has been retained as the only target for first studies in space environments mcmonigal and crucian 2015 since a flow cytometer can provide support to a wide range of scientific applications e g biology microbiology and environmental science it is needless to point out that a spaceflight compatible machine could satisfy the unmet flight requirements for water monitoring and treatment to complete future long duration missions in closed healthy environments the high sensitivity for scanning very small objects i e from virus like particles to prokaryotes to pico and micro eukaryotes and the wide detectable cell concentration range generally between 102 and 107 cells ml 1 without concentrating or diluting the samples represent unmatched features of this technology for water monitoring a broad suite of assays is available for microbial quality assessments in natural and engineered aquatic ecosystems amalfitano et al 2014 boi et al 2016 gasol and morán 2015 van nevel et al 2017 successful applications are reported to provide early warning indications of unexpected water contamination events through the rapid detection of a variety of microbiological threats including pathogenic and potentially toxic microorganisms vital et al 2010 weisse and bergkemper 2018 yang et al 2010 moreover flow cytometric measurements are suitable to evaluate the efficiency of various industrial microbial bioprocesses e g food and pharmaceutical preparations díaz et al 2010 and the performances of engineered systems for water treatment besmer and hammes 2016 safford and bischel 2019 vergine et al 2020 remarkably fcm was also useful to determine the presence of nonliving organic and inorganic substances including nano and micro sized particles suspended solids flocs and aggregates of various origins aulenta et al 2013 casentini et al 2016 liu et al 2016 on going instrumental developments for on site applications are directed to install flow cytometers on either mobile units e g ships and vehicles or fixed

pomati et al 2011 thyssen et al 2007 leaving aside the high costs of all sophisticated systems the need for specially trained staff is likely to represent a major drawback in the daily scheduled

conditions e g temperature time to analysis instrumental settings e g fluidic and signal amplification systems and the source water e g from natural or engineered systems nescerecka et al 2016 prest et al 2013 further work is also required to establish user independent strategies for gating and data handling amalfitano et al 2018a koch et al 2014 one more specific challenge is the lack of phylogenetic resolution despite the enumeration of targeted taxa may rely on specific fluorescence staining procedures couradeau et al 2019 manti et al 2011 neuenschwander et al 2015 the cytometric information characterizing different subpopulations of microbial cells is generally ataxonomic a direct link between cytometric fingerprinting and microbial diversity assessed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was demonstrated in recent studies props et al 2017 2016 however the computational workflows are convoluted and still under development rubbens et al 2019 5 comparative analysis of space relevant technological features the procedural workflows of each of the mature technologies herein entitled for water microbial monitoring in space comprise major steps and provide different types of results the overall time to results can vary from minutes to days largely relying on user dependent manual operations and technological solutions for automation fig 3 standardization efforts have been already adopted in terrestrial studies by including all pre analytical sample preparation analytical instrument setup and post analytical analysis and interpretation steps kalina 2020 however both current and future applications in space will be necessarily bounded by the definition of novel standards of microbial quality i e other than those applied on earth by cultivation dependent approaches amalfitano et al 2018b but also by a compromise between the best analytical performances and detrimental practical issues to cope with during spaceflights the implementation of successful on board workflows will critically rely on the overall water cycle management pickett et al 2020 while fundamental analytical aspects can be constrained by the minimal amount of water available for routine monitoring activities for example technological accuracy and result reproducibility are directly linked to workable water volumes and the constitutive occurrence of microbial targets in the sample e g microbial cell abundance per cell gene copies cell viability volumes required for accurate and reproducible analyses will reasonably range between few tens of microliters e g for flow cytometric assessments and hundreds of milliliters e g for cultivation and nucleic acid based methods as also reported in terrestrial studies safford and bischel 2019 notably sample filtration a major pre treatment step for atp metry and nucleic acid based methods can selectively concentrate the microbial biomass and target microorganisms while minimizing the water loss for analytical needs the filtering surfaces are also suitable for visual inspection e g by microscopy storage and comparative analysis e g on earth however filtration can influence the composition of the dissolved organic matter of the permeate water possibly triggering microbial regrowth in the downstream distribution system park et al 2018 and it will also necessitate additional crew time for manual operations e g filter substitution regeneration disposal sufficient data are not yet available from real space conditions to implement protocol details within the procedural workflows although the selected technologies were demonstratively applied under either simulated or real microgravity conditions their own critical advantages and limitations will require full reconsideration for flight like and space applications from the one hand analytical benefits will necessarily include the time needed to achieve results i e speed to results the accuracy and flexibility in detecting specifically selected microbial targets i e identification depth with reproducible consistent results i e reproducibility and the number and multiple type of achievable results i e herein named multiparametricity on the other hand the operating conditions can be particularly stringent and limiting the direct applicability in space unless addressing critical requirements such as reagent usage waste production operator skills and crew time table 1 using a simplistic pairwise comparison we sought to emphasize that few selected technological features have to be consciously retained from the methodological proof of concept level up to the device deployment instrumental demonstration and routine use in the on board housekeeping program although the comparative scores were assigned subjectively table s1 it is likely evident that the stringent requirements of microbial water monitoring in space cannot be met by a single technological solution 6 system miniaturization and future challenges an important point is that the monitoring technologies can be mission dependent but only those instruments that minimize crew involvement in their end to end operation are likely to be applicable on the long term karouia et al 2017 overall the selected devices have to be compact suitable for automation low power consuming and virtually invisible except when needed limero and wallace 2017 the ground based counterparts have already been miniaturized using microfluidics but the deployment of monitoring effective tools onboard spacecrafts will also require substantial reengineering and instrumental customization the instruments deployed so far have not been yet permanently used in spaceflight water monitoring yet numerous examples of successful international projects and commercial partnerships dedicated to the human space exploration let argue that critical space water related tasks can be operatively accomplished at reasonable costs and times 5 years karouia et al 2017 considerable progress has been made in miniature the onboard instrumentation to assess the water microbiological contamination this also includes microbial cultivation systems such as the aquapad developed by the french cnes space agency augelli 2018 the microfluidic chips that allow cell isolation and incubation have been developed for ground based applications and appear suitable for space uses for example the encapsulation of single cells from a mixed microbial community into small droplet compartments of a water in oil emulsion can offer further opportunities for physiological studies and viability assays e g metabolic by products diffusion resistance to toxicants enzymatic activities on clonal populations isolated into plugs or micro petri dishes boedicker et al 2008 boitard et al 2015 considering the ability of microfluidic systems to efficiently conduct measurements on small volumes of complex fluids without the need for a skilled operator lab on a chip technologies and portable diagnostic devices have gained increased popularity for sensing a wide range of water parameters and microbial pathogens even in the most remote settings mairhofer et al 2009 more recently new qpcr platforms based on microfluidic technologies have been developed allowing the simultaneous analysis of numerous genes and samples in volume chambers of few nanoliters placed at high density on a chip ricchi et al 2017 being less sensitive to inhibitors than qpcr the digital pcr dpcr is mainly applied to monitor gene transcriptions in microbial cells without the need of a standard curve for gene copy quantification devonshire et al 2016 the system miniaturization was also considered the most appealing trait for space applications of the nanopore dna sequencer minion castro wallace et al 2017 by assembling miniaturized and lab on a chip solutions the water monitoring suite developed by nasa represents so far the best performing custom built device applied successfully on the iss to monitor different water quality properties along with the hach colorimeter and the organic water module respectively used for inorganic and organic chemical assessments the hardware suite also includes the pcr based instrument razor ex with customized sample pouch kits containing all pre loaded reagents necessary for sampling sample preparation and real time pcr https www nasa gov mission pages station research experiments explorer investigation html id 1847 however as space exploration progresses toward extended missions to cis lunar space and mars pcr based and multi omics instruments onboard spacecraft should not be considered in separation from other technologies needed for the in flight microbiological research karouia et al 2017 in particular microfluidic platforms developed for the direct cell detection showed promising perspectives because of the potential for precise and easy to use analytical procedures while enhancing analytical performances the system miniaturization presents also the advantages of reduced consumption of reagents and the ability to integrate monitoring and isolation procedures within a single device auroux et al 2002 a simple microfluidic system was successfully tested for rapid and semi automated bacterial enumeration in freshwaters and promising outcomes suggested its applicability to drinking waters under both ground and space conditions yamaguchi et al 2014 moreover both sensitivity and specificity of atp metry and fcm can be also improved by miniaturizing the core systems down to scales closer to the ones of microorganisms a micro fluorescence activated cell sorting μfacs was used to sort out cells of interest by changing the flow direction after cell detection fu et al 1999 an integrated platform that combines two different force fields in a single microfluidic device dielectrophoretic magnetic activated cell sorter idmacs was applied for simultaneous sorting of multiple bacterial targets kim and soh 2009 more recently a high throughput raman flow cytometer was developed on a microfluidic chip for the label free molecular fingerprinting at the single cell level hiramatsu et al 2019 the onboard laboratory miniaturization included also the fluidic components e g pumps valves electronics thus paving the way to the use of advanced biosensors for screening food safety and water quality in space roda et al 2018 following the proofs of concept and wearable technologies suited to monitor astronauts health the biosensing diagnostic instrumentation most reasonably based on electrochemical and optical detectors was argued as a secondary future option for in flight water biochemical analyses choi et al 2018 grigorev et al 2020 limero and wallace 2017 nelson 2011 in particular the amperometric biosensors were proved sensitive to monitor different water analytes chemical contaminants e g pesticides organophosphates carbamates and numerous microbial biomarkers successfully targeted to detect the major microbiological agents food and water borne pathogens e g e coli salmonella l monocytogenes c jejuni b cereus m smegmatis grieshaber et al 2008 velusamy et al 2010 however despite providing concrete benefits for health services and our life on earth and beyond the spectroscopic and biosensing devices are still at a low level of technological readiness for in flight applications garcía descalzo et al 2019 own et al 2019 roda et al 2018 thus falling out of the scopes of this review in general a critical aspect of all microfluidic and lab on a chip solutions is bound to the very limited system reusability most miniaturized devices for terrestrial applications are of single use and in many cases based on disposable cartridges that cannot be safely stowed onboard during long term space missions when cells are delivered to different system compartments for collection there is no clear approach for removal the analyzed samples without compromising the system functioning and risking contamination clogging issues may also interfere with the analyses due to the processing of large sample volumes reusable systems have been tested but their applications in space are likely constrained by the risk of sample carryover reduced analytical performance upon extended reuse and the resources required for cleaning and reactivation procedures in this regard the technological development is highly demanding and still far from being accomplished in a near future 7 conclusions current technologies for water microbial monitoring can satisfy the needs of long term space exploration missions at reasonable costs and times although substantial instrumental reengineering has to be considered the suitable methodological applications at a high technology readiness level i e at least validated in a flight like environment will require reduced space to be allocated and can potentially provide rapid and specific responses regarding the in flight occurrence of the microbiological contamination the advanced biomolecular characterization of water samples from the iss is promoting a better understanding of the onboard levels and patterns of microbial contamination thus contributing to the development of space bound technologies for the rapid and specific identification of microorganisms of health concerns as space exploration progresses toward longer missions pcr based and multi omics approaches can be complemented by real time technologies needed for the in flight microbiological research and suitable for the early warning microbial

17936,occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in natural freshwaters could impair drinking water quality chlorine was often employed as an oxidant to treat algal laden source waters in drinking water treatment plants however previous studies only focused on high viability cyanobacteria at exponential phase whether the change of cell viability of cyanobacteria could affect chlorination was unknown here high and low viability microcystis were collected from a whole life cycle of cyanobacteria in lab scale and effects of chlorination on membrane integrity and toxin fate of high and low viability microcystis were subsequently investigated results showed chlorine exposure was lower for low viability cells than high viability cells with the same initial chlorine dosage but low viability cells were less resistant to chlorination leading to higher rate of membrane damage k loss and intracellular toxin release k i for high viability cells there was no increase of extracellular toxin with sufficient chlorine exposure whereas it showed a continuous increase for low viability cells mainly due to its lower rate of extracellular toxin degradation k e 26 8 m 1 s 1 than intracellular toxin release k i 110 16 m 1 s 1 k e k i besides total toxin could be completely oxidized for high viability cells with sufficient chlorine exposure 30 mg min l 1 whereas chlorination could not work well for low viability cells even with chlorine exposure of as high as 36 mg min l 1 these findings indicated chlorination may not be a feasible option to treat low viability cyanobacteria during decline stage of cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorine cyanobacteria cell viability membrane integrity toxin fate 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophication lakes and reservoirs have increasingly become a major environmental concern worldwide cyanobacterial cells and related metabolites e g cyanotoxins have posed serious threats to drinking water safety and challenged drinking water treatment plants dwtps zamyadi et al 2012a he et al 2016 microcystis species are one of the most common and problematic species and produce a range of microcystins mcs harke et al 2016 to date more than 100 variants of mcs e g mc lr mc yr mc rr were reported among these mcs mc lr is the most common microcystin and has been proven to be potent

1 mc lr in drinking water who 2014 besides the presence of cyanobacteria can also cause process disturbances in dwtps using filtration such as excessive head loss development shorter filter runs and higher coagulant demands mouchet and bonnelye 1998 merel et al 2010 chlorine as the most common disinfectant in dwtps is also employed as an oxidant to treat algal laden source waters direct chlorination of source water inter or post chlorination is widely applied in dwtps in many developing countries e g china and india and north america chlorination could inactivate cyanobacteria via destroying cellular contents leading to cytolysis corrosion and wrinkling of cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane ou et al 2011 besides prior to coagulation chlorination could improve removal efficiency of cyanobacteria by altering cell surface properties to enhance solid liquid separation plummer and edzwald 2002 furthermore chlorination is highly efficient for the oxidation of cyanotoxins under various water quality conditions nicholson et al 1994 acero et al 2005 ho et al 2006 rodriguez et al 2007 merel et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2010 2012b 2013 fan et al 2014 2016 therefore chlorination is a feasible option to prevent the breakthrough of cyanobacteria and toxin into drinking water however some studies reported algal organic matters aoms could be precursors of disinfection by products dbps after chlorination zamyadi et al 2012b 2013 what s worse chlorination could induce membrane damage leading to the release of intracellular toxin daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b fan et al 2013 2014 to address this issue many studies have investigated the kinetics of cell lysis and toxin fate after chlorination and found the susceptibility of cyanobacteria to chlorination is influenced by species morphology cell counts and oxidative conditions e g temperature ph dosages contact time water matrix daly et al 2007 lin et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2012b for example lin et al 2009 reported cell lysis rate of anabaena circianlis 1400 3400 m 1 s 1 was higher than microcystis aeruginosa 790 1100 m 1 s 1 and fan et al 2016 found colonial microcystis were more resistant to chlorination than unicellular cells due to the protection of mucilaginous surrounding cells meanwhile zamyadi et al 2013 and fan et al 2014 demonstrated there was no increase of extracellular toxin after chlorination since the rate of extracellular toxin oxidation was faster than the rate of intracellular toxin release however the majority of these data were gained from chlorination experiments conducted using high viability cyanobacteria at exponential phase actually in natural freshwaters historical observations showed cyanobacterial bloom was a successive process lasting for several months in a year including development maintenance and decay stage guo 2007 tang et al 2018 during maintenance and decay stage tang et al 2018 found the genes of n and p metabolism were down regulated via meta transcriptome analysis of bloom samples from taihu lake china indicating nutrition limitation may induce a decrease of cell viability at this stage for low viability cyanobacteria at maintenance and decay stages tang et al 2018 also found mcye gene was up regulated suggesting toxin would accumulate in these low viability cyanobacteria besides rivasseau et al 1998 and pietsch et al 2002 observed an increase of extracellular toxin in pure culture cyanobacteria at stationary phase and ziegmann et al 2010 also observed the highest ratio of mc lr chl a of m aeruginosa at decline phase these results indicated low viability cells would pose a higher toxin risk than high viability cells the difference of chlorination in treating high and low viability cyanobacteria is not clear and whether chlorination is a feasible option to treat low viability cyanobacteria and control toxin risk is also unknown thus it is of great importance to compare the chlorination process to treat high and low viability cyanobacteria to date no studies have investigated the impact of chlorination on low viability cyanobacteria and related metabolites in this study a whole life cycle of microcystis in lab scale was established to collect high and low viability cells to conduct chlorination experiments the effects of chlorination on membrane integrity loss and toxin release and degradation of high and low viability microcystis were investigated and compared aiming to discuss the appropriateness of chlorination to treat low viability cyanobacteria at decline stage of a successive bloom 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and regents a toxic strain microcystis aeruginosa fachb 915 was purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences it was cultured in bg11 medium at 28 c

treated with lugol s iodine and counted with blood counting chamber qiujing china by microscopy olympus bx43 japan at 400 magnification the growth pattern of microcystis mainly includes three classical growth phases exponential 5 30 d stationary 30 70 d and decline growth phase 70 100 d fig 1 microcystis samples of 10 ml at exponential 15 d stationary phase 50 d and decline phase 90 d were centrifuged at 6000 g for 5 min and cells were collected and washed with double distilled water ddh2o twice cell morphology of microcystis at all three phases were observed using electron microscope techniques as described below moreover photosynthetic yield ϕpsii is an indicator of the photosynthetic performance of phytoplankton and widely used as a sensitive indicator of cell viability hence ϕpsii of microcystis was also measured respectively and the method was described in details below for microcystis at exponential phase intact intracellular structures comprising of nucleus area photosynthetic lamella and gas vesicles were clearly observed in cells fig 2 b most of these cells appeared in pairs fig 2a and cell counts kept increasing with highϕpsii of 0 37 suggesting these cells were reproducing via cell division and maintained high viability after 30 d cultivation microcystis in pairs disappeared and intracellular gas vesicles became reduced fig 2c and d but cell density remained at the maximum of about 1 2 107 cells ml 1 for 40 d andϕpsii of microcystis did not show significant difference between cells at stationary phase and exponential phase p 0 05 figs 1 3 these results suggested the majority of microcystis at stationary stage remained high viability as the same as microcystis at exponential phase in contrast for microcystis at decline phase cell density strikingly declined andϕpsii of microcystis 0 21 was significantly lower than cells at exponential and stationary phase 0 36 0 37 p 0 05 figs 1 3 besides microcystis cells became shrinking yellow arrows or irregular shaped and several cells became severely damaged red arrows with holes on cell surfaces fig 2e intracellular structures in some cells were destroyed to some extent as well fig 2f 2e these results indicated cell viability of microcystis strikingly declined at this stage to achieve the same initial cell density of high and low viability cells microcystis were collected at exponential 15 d and decline phase 90 d to conduct chlorination experiments and these samples could well represent high and low viability of microcystis respectively fig 1 red arrows 2 3 chlorination experiments international joint commission and ohio environmental protection agency epa have set a chlorophyll a threshold of 50 μg l 1 for severe blooms and corresponding cell density was greater than 1 105 cells ml 1 watson and boyer 2013 kasich et al 2014 besides previous studies have performed extensive chlorination experiments for high viability microcystis of 105 106 cells ml 1 daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b 2013 fan et al 2013 2014 qi et al 2016 therefore prior to chlorination experiments initial cell density 7 6 106 cells ml 1 of high and low viability microcystis samples were equally diluted with ddh2o to achieve a final cell density of 1 106 cells ml 1 in addition toxin degradation was highly dependent on ph and could be significantly reduced above 8 nicholson et al 1994 hence cultures were adjusted to ph 7 5 0 1 before chlorination experiments using 0 1 m sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid daly et al 2007 fan et al 2013 2014 a chlorine stock solution was prepared by sodium hypochlorite commercial solutions free chlorine concentration was measured using the n n diethyl pphenylenediamine dpd method apha et al 1998 for chlorination experiments microcystis samples were treated with the desired concentrations 1 2 4 and 8 mg l 1 according to the applied dosages for high viability microcystis at exponential phases in previous studies daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b 2013 fan et al 2013 2014 2016 he and wert 2016 qi et al 2016 all chlorination experiments with 2 l reaction suspension were conducted in 5 l glass conical flasks and incubated in darkness at room temperature 20 2 c during chlorination microcystis samples were taken at specified contact time 0 1 2 4 8 16 32 and 60 min and immediately analyzed to determine the chlorine residual using the dpd fas titration methods apha et al 1998 at each time interval samples with specific volumes were quenched with sodium thiosulfate at a stoichiometric ratio specified in standard methods apha et al

fluorescence immediately prior to the flash is termed as minimum fluorescence of f 0 maxwell and johnson 2000 2 4 3 membrane integrity determination during chlorination microcystis samples of 1 ml were taken at specified contact time 0 1 2 4 8 16 32 and 60 min and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate at each time interval membrane integrity was determined using a visual flow cytometry fcm flowsight meck milipore usa if cellular membrane was destroyed sytox green nucleic acid stain could permeate into cells and bind to dna resulting in bright green fluorescence with emitting a fixed wavelength of 488 nm thus the stain was used to determine damaged cells after chlorination sytox positive green fluorescence as described by daly et al 2007 in contrast there was only red fluorescence for intact cells since sytox green could not permeate into cells and pigments themselves showed red fluorescence with emitting a fixed wavelength of 488 nm using fcm sytox negative red fluorescence each sample 200 μl was incubated for 10 min after adding sytox green nucleic acid stain with a final concentration of 1 μm and run for approximately 2 5 min approximately 10000 events cells were

chlorination high and low viability microcystis samples of 1 106 cells ml 1 with a volume of 10 ml were taken and filtrated with 0 45 μm millipore express pvdf filter german to remove cells this filter could not absorb organic matters and thus it did not affect subsequent doc analysis fig s2 dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured by persulfate wet oxidation technique shimadzu

the standard deviation sd values all data were statistically analyzed using student s t test and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 chlorine decay chlorine of 1 8 mg l 1 was employed to treat high and low viability microcystis and there was a significant difference in chlorine consumption between high and low viability microcystis fig 4 for low viability cells there was no chlorine residual detected in treatments of 1 2 4 mg l 1 after 8 16 60 min while residual concentrations of 0 3 0 8 and 0 5 mg l 1 were detected for high viability cells respectively fig 4 besides with initial highest dosage of 8 mg l 1 a chlorine residual of 0 6 mg l 1 for low viability cells was much lower than that for high viability cells after a contact time of 60 min residual chlorine of 3 5 mg l 1 fig 4 during chlorination chlorine decay showed the same fast slow pattern in all treatments to compare chlorine decay between high and low viability cells fast slow process of chlorine decay were modeled as a parallel first order reaction fig 4 and rate constants of each process was given by k fast and k slow according to equation 3 as described by daly et al 2007 3 c l t c

coefficients r2 were determined to be 0 99 1 00 and residual sum of squares rss were much less than 0 05 suggesting the model fitted well table 1 with the same initial chlorine dosages both k fast and k slow of low viability cells were much higher than that of high viability cells p 0 05 for example k fast of 0 73 0 02 min 1 rss 2 12 10 2 was estimated for low viability cells whereas lower value of 0 48 0 05 min 1 rss 1 48 10 2 was for high viability cells with chlorination of 8 mg l 1 table 1 3 2 membrane integrity loss prior to chlorination about 90 of high viability microcystis remained intact and cellular surface was smooth while over 50 were damaged for low viability cells and damaged cellular membrane was observed in certain low viability cells fig 2 5 without chlorine exposure percentage of intact cells of both low and high viability cells remained constant fig 5 however chlorination of 4 8 mg l 1 caused complete loss of membrane integrity of both low and high viability cells after 2 8 min contact time fig 5 even dosing with low chlorine dosages of 1 2 mg l 1 more than 98 of intact cells were almost destroyed within 32 60 min fig 5 3 3 membrane damage rate to compare the impact of chlorination on membrane damage of high and low viability microcystis modified chick watson model was employed to estimate membrane damage rate k loss by fitting the number of intact cells over chlorine exposure fig s3 as described by daly et al 2007 the equation was shown below equation 4 4 ln n t n 0 k l o s s ct where ct chlorine exposure nt number of intact cells after a given chlorine exposure n0 number of intact cells at ct 0 and k loss rate constant of membrane damage values of ct were calculated from chlorine decay data table 2 showed r2 were between 0 94 and 1 00 and rss 1 66 10 11 1 28 10 2 were less than 0 05 suggesting the model fitted well with the same initial dosages of chlorination k loss of low viability cells was much higher than that of high viability cells p 0 05 table 2 besides average k loss 708 135 m 1 s 1 of low viability cells was also higher than that of high viability cells 486 164 m 1 s 1 p 0 05 table 2 3 4 total toxin degradation prior to chlorination total toxin of low viability cells 170 μg l 1 was much higher than high viability cells 44 μg l 1 p 0 05 but chlorination could effectively oxidize toxin to some extent for both high and low viability cells fig 6 for high viability cells about 6 and 25 μg l 1 of total toxin was present after 60 min with initial low chlorine of 2 and 1 mg l 1 while total toxin was degraded to below detection limits after 32 60 min with high dosage of 4 and 8 mg l 1 fig 6a in contrast total toxin of 68 168 μg l 1 was residual after 60 min with chlorination of 1 8 mg l 1 for low viability cells and the highest degradation percentage of 60 was gained with highest chlorine dose of 8 mg l 1 whist only 7 of total toxin was degraded with chlorine of 1 mg l 1 fig 6b to compare total toxin degradation of high and low viability microcystis after chlorination modified chick watson model was employed to estimate rate constants k total of total toxin degradation over chlorine exposure fig s4 daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b the fitted equation was shown equation 5 5 ln mc t mc 0 k t o t a l ct where ct chlorine exposure mct concentration of total toxin after a given chlorine exposure mc0 concentration of total toxin at ct 0 and k total rate constant of total toxin degradation table 3 showed r2 were between 0 91 and 0 99 and rss 1 63 10 5 1 7 10 3 were much less than 0 05 suggesting the model fitted well with the same initial chlorination k total of low viability cells was much lower than that of high viability cells p 0 05 table 3 moreover average k loss 50 27 m 1 s 1 of low viability cells was also lower than that of high viability cells 98 56 m 1 s 1 p 0 05 table 3 3 5 intracellular toxin release and extracellular toxin degradation both intracellular and extracellular toxin of low viability cells were higher than that of high viability cells before chlorination p 0 05 fig 6 above results revealed chlorine induced membrane damage of both high and low viability microcystis fig 5 and thus about 50 100 of intracellular toxin was released during chlorination within a contact time of 60 min fig 6 meanwhile the released toxin after membrane damage and initial extracellular toxin were degraded via chlorination fig 6 during chlorination for high viability cells extracellular toxin was degraded to below detection limits after 4 min with dosages of 4 and 8 mg l 1 but it increased from initial 3 μg l 1 to 6 and 19 μg l 1 with dosages of 2 and 1 mg l 1 respectively fig 6a in contrast with chlorination of 1 8 mg l 1 for low viability cells extracellular toxin remained at high level during chlorination and increased from 48 μg l 1 to 68 102 μg l 1 after a contact time of 60 min the corresponding increase percentage of 42 113 fig 6b to further compare the process of intracellular toxin release and extracellular toxin degradation with chlorination for high and low viability cells relationship between chlorine exposure toxin release and degradation can be described as a first order process and the process can be considered as consecutive reaction as shown in equation 6 besides concentration of intracellular a and extracellular toxin b are described by equations 7 and 8 jones 1970 zamyadi et al 2013 fan et al 2014 6 a k i b k e c 7 a a 0 e k i c t 8 b b 0 e k e c t a 0 e k e c t e k i c t 1 k e k i where ct chlorine exposure

sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was ranged of 0 72 0 99 demonstrating the model fitted well with the same initial dosages of chlorination k i of low viability cells 90 127 m 1 s 1 was higher than high viability cells 28 102 m 1 s 1 but k e 18 36 m 1 s 1 was much lower than that of high viability cells 33 113 m 1 s 1 p 0 05 table 4 besides with the same treatment k e of high viability cells was higher than its k i k e k i p 0 05 but contrary result was gained for low viability cells k e k i table 4 average values of k e and k i also showed the same pattern for both high and low viability cells table 4 4 discussion 4 1 chlorine decay during chlorination for both high and low viability microcystis chlorine decay was fast in all treatments as the same pattern observed by previous studies ho et al 2006 daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b 2013 however this study found chlorine decay was faster for low viability cells than high viability cells with the same initial chlorine dosage fig 4 table 1 previous studies have noted that presence of natural organic matters noms is the most important factor in chlorine consumption and its concentration and characteristics are known to strongly influence the chlorine reaction since noms contain a higher proportion of conjugated and substituted aromatic moieties is more susceptible to chlorine attack reckhow et al 1990 korshin et al 1997 ho et al 2006 deborde and von gunten 2008 in this study we did not use natural waters as backgrounds to conduct chlorination experiments as done by previous studies ho et al 2006 daly et al 2007 lin et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2012b fan et al 2016 nonetheless these samples of high and low viability cells collected from cultures in bg 11 medium no organic matters could better show the influence of the change of cell viability on water quality backgrounds because cyanobacteria could secrete extracellular organic matters eoms to cultures during growth and some studies found characteristics of eoms were changing at different growth phase and doc increased from exponential to stationary phase henderson et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2014 further analysis of eoms in our samples showed low viability cells exhibited higher extracellular doc and uv254 than high viability cells p 0 05 table 5 uv254 representing the aromatic character has been identified as a potential surrogate measure for doc korshin et al 2009 suggesting higher concentration of eoms accumulated in low viability cells as well as more aromatic groups in eoms thus chlorine consumption for low viability cells was much faster than for high viability cells with the same initial dosages of chlorination suva could describe the nature of noms in the water in terms of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity and a suva 3 illustrates mainly hydrophilic material edzwald and tobiason 1999 here a value of 1 67 and 1 75 l mg 1 m 1 were measured for high and low viability cells respectively table 5 suggesting eoms of these samples mainly contained hydrophilic organic matters however there was no significant difference of suva between high and low viability cells p 0 05 table 5 demonstrating difference in chlorine decay was not correlated with the hydrophilicity of eoms 4 2 membrane integrity loss chlorination of 1 8 mg l 1 could completely destroy membrane integrity of high viability cells fig 5a in agreement with previous studies daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2010 2012b 2013 fan et al 2013 fan et al 2013 found chlorine was the most efficient oxidant to destroy membrane of cyanobacteria at exponential phase compared to other oxidants e g kmno4 h2o2 here with the same initial chlorine dosage chlorine exposure for low viability cells was a lower level than for high viability cells fig 4 but complete loss of membrane integrity of low viability cells was observed in all treatments these results suggested chlorination had strong capacity to inactivate both high and low viability cells via completely destroy membrane integrity besides for low viability cells the membrane damage rate k loss was higher than high viability cells table 2 fan et al 2016 and he and wert 2016 found colonial microcystis was more resistant to chlorination than unicellular microcystis since colonies can be protected by surface amorphous mucilage or sheaths these results suggested cellular surface structures are important barriers for protection from chlorine attack comparing with high viability cells both tem and sem showed cellular surface structures e g sheath of low viability cells were destroyed to some extent resulting in incapacity to maintain its spherical shape fig 2e and f consequently low viability microcystis was less resistant to chlorination leading to higher membrane damage rate k loss than high viability cells 4 3 total toxin degradation total toxin was degraded to some extent 7 100 after chlorination for both high and low viability microcystis depending on chlorine exposure fig 6 as demonstrated by previous studies that chlorination was efficient to oxidize cyanotoxins under various water quality backgrounds nicholson et al 1994 acero et al 2005 2008 ho et al 2006 merel et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2010 2012b 2013 fan et al 2014 2016 for high viability cells chlorination could oxidize total toxin to below detection limits with ct value of 30 mg min l 1 while 6 and 19 μg l 1 of total toxin were present after 60 min with ct value of 1 6 9 6 mg min l 1 fig 4a 6a it suggested sufficient chlorine exposure was important for complete toxin oxidation and nicholson et al 1994 also firstly noted that cyanotoxins were completely destroyed under conditions that a chlorine residual of at least 0 5 mg l 1 was present after a contact time of 30 min however when low viability cells were treated with sufficient chlorine exposure of as high as 36 mg min l 1 68 μg l 1 of total toxin was also present after 60 min even with chlorine residual of 0 6 mg l 1 fig 4b 6b these results indicated incomplete toxin oxidation for low viability cells was not only due to insufficient chlorine exposure actually rate constants of total toxin degradation for low viability cells was much lower than high viability cells table 3 implying incomplete toxin oxidation for low viability cells with sufficient chlorine exposure would attribute to the decrease of k total literatures concluded that chlorination conditions e g temperature ph water matrix would strongly affect cyanotoxin degradation nicholson et al 1994 acero et al 2005 in this study chlorination experiments were conducted at the same temperature and ph but initial concentration of total toxin and reaction backgrounds showed the difference between high and low viability cells fig 6 it is possible that the much higher initial concentration of total toxin in low viability cells 170 μg l 1 than high viability cells 44 μg l 1 would lead to incomplete degradation of total toxin with sufficient chlorine exposure however nicholson et al 1994 and acero et al 2005 reported much higher concentration of mc lr 200 300 μg l 1 could be completely degraded with low chlorine exposure 1 2 mg l 1 for less than 30 min thus it was not the main factor to affect total toxin degradation by chlorination for low viability cells effect of higher initial concentration of doc of low viability cells on chlorine consumption and toxin oxidation could not be ignored in this study he and wert 2016 have tried to employ the ratio of chlorine dosages to initial doc chlorine doc to minimize the effect of initial doc on chlorination to treat cyanobacteria hence we further re evaluated values of chlorine doc in various treatments and found that the k total 25 1 m 1 s 1 of low viability cells was still lower in the treatment with higher value of chlorine doc 0 65 than high viability cells with lower value of chlorine doc 0 39 89 6 m 1 s 1 table s1 these results suggested higher initial concentration of doc could affect chlorine decay but it was not the main factor to decrease k total of low viability cells chlorine could undergo reactions with numerous organic compounds and second order rate constants for chlorination vary over 10 orders of magnitude i e 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 depending on particular sites of organic compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 besides in various water matrix cyanotoxin degradation rate by chlorine was estimated by many studies and varied from 22 to 241 m 1 s 1 table s2 daly et al 2007 and ho et al 2006 reported rate constants was higher in natural waters than ddh2o and ho et al 2006 attributed the differences to noms microcystin interactions in this study decrease of k total for low viability cells might be also attributed to eoms cyanotoxin interactions ziegmann et al 2010 found the highest fluorescence intensity of protein like substances in eoms at decline phase besides m aeruginosa could produce many other cyclic peptides similar to microcystin and some of these peptides had greater reactivity with chlorine than cyanotoxin molecules hureiki et al 1994 ho et al 2006 it suggested that there may be more peptides similar to microcystin present in low viability cells which could inhibit cyanotoxin degradation via competitive reactions nonetheless chlorine reaction with cyanotoxins is a complex interaction with organic matters and characteristics of eoms in low viability cells was not well investigated in this study therefore more studies were required to elucidate eoms cyanotoxin interactions 4 4 intracellular toxin release and extracellular toxin degradation chlorination could completely destroy membrane integrity for both high and low viability cells and thus the release of intracellular toxin could not be avoided when chlorine was applied to treat cyanobacteria in practice above study has demonstrated low viability cells was less resistant to chlorination than high viability cells table 2 indicating its membrane damage would be more serious than high viability cells after chlorination hence its rate constants of intracellular toxin release were higher than high viability cells in line with membrane damage rate constants k loss low viability high viability table 2 4 meanwhile for low viability cells rate constants of extracellular toxin degradation strikingly declined compared to high viability cells table 4 it might also result from eoms cyanotoxin interactions as the same as k total for high viability cells there was no increase of extracellular toxin during chlorination with initial dose of 4 and 8 mg l 1 fig 6a the same results were also observed by zamyadi et al 2013 and fan et al 2014 attributed to the higher rate of extracellular toxin degradation k e than intracellular toxin release k i k e k i in this study k e was also higher than k i table 4 however an increase of extracellular toxin occurred with ct value of 1 6 9 6 mg min l 1 since the released extracellular toxin could not be effectively degraded after 16 32 min without chlorine residual fig 6a in contrast with sufficient chlorine exposure of 30 mg min l 1 extracellular toxin kept decreasing and it was degraded to below the safety guideline of 1 μg l 1 for drinking water by who fig 6a suggesting both k e k i and sufficient chlorine exposure were important for the control of extracellular toxin risk when chlorination was applied to treat high viability cells for low viability cells insufficient chlorine exposure of 0 6 9 6 mg min l 1 could cause an increase of extracellular toxin after chlorination as the same for high viability cells however even with sufficient chlorination exposure of 36 mg min l 1 extracellular toxin remained increasing during chlorination as well fig 4b 6 suggesting the rapid released toxin could not be effectively degraded due to the decrease of k e for low viability cells fig 6b table 4 meanwhile k i of low viability cells was much higher than high viability cells hence for low viability cells continuous increase of extracellular toxin was mainly attributed to its much higher k i than k e k e k i of note initial concentration of extracellular 48 μg l 1 in low viability cells was much higher than high viability cells 3 μg l 1 fig 6 and thus there was much higher concentration of extracellular toxin of 68 137 μg l 1 present after 60 min with chlorination for low viability cells consequently chlorination for low viability cells would pose a high risk of extracellular toxin 4 5 practical implications this study concluded that chlorination could be employed as an oxidant to treat high viability cyanobacteria and prevent the breakthrough of extracellular toxin into drinking water in agreement with previous studies zamyadi et al 2013 fan et al 2014 2016 nonetheless chlorination may not be a feasible option to treat low viability cyanobacteria at decline stage of cyanobacterial blooms these results suggested chlorination application to treat algal laden source waters would be limited by the stage of a successive cyanobacterial bloom therefore monitoring of cell viability of cyanobacteria may be necessary for water suppliers to manage drinking water quality during a successive bloom optimizing chlorination or further evaluating other water treatment processes to treat low viability cyanobacteria would be an important issue in the further work 5 conclusions this study was the first report to show that the change of cell viability of cyanobacteria could challenge chlorination to treat algal laden source waters during a successive bloom some of the key findings were shown below i chlorine exposure was lower for low viability cells than high viability cells with the same initial dosage of chlorine mainly due to faster chlorine consumption resulting from its rise of doc and more aromatic groups in eoms ii low viability cells were less resistant to chlorine oxidation than high viability cells leading to higher rate of membrane damage k loss and intracellular toxin release k i iii total extracellular toxin degradation efficiency k total k e of chlorination for low viability cells strikingly declined and it may be attributed to eoms cyanotoxin interactions iv total toxin could be completely oxidized for high viability cells with sufficient chlorine exposure 30 mg min l 1 but chlorination could not work well for low viability cells even with chlorine exposure of as high as 36 mg min l 1 v extracellular toxin of high viability cells remained decreasing with sufficient chlorine exposure due to k e k i whereas a continuous increase occurred for low viability cells due to the changed pattern of k e k i declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17936,occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in natural freshwaters could impair drinking water quality chlorine was often employed as an oxidant to treat algal laden source waters in drinking water treatment plants however previous studies only focused on high viability cyanobacteria at exponential phase whether the change of cell viability of cyanobacteria could affect chlorination was unknown here high and low viability microcystis were collected from a whole life cycle of cyanobacteria in lab scale and effects of chlorination on membrane integrity and toxin fate of high and low viability microcystis were subsequently investigated results showed chlorine exposure was lower for low viability cells than high viability cells with the same initial chlorine dosage but low viability cells were less resistant to chlorination leading to higher rate of membrane damage k loss and intracellular toxin release k i for high viability cells there was no increase of extracellular toxin with sufficient chlorine exposure whereas it showed a continuous increase for low viability cells mainly due to its lower rate of extracellular toxin degradation k e 26 8 m 1 s 1 than intracellular toxin release k i 110 16 m 1 s 1 k e k i besides total toxin could be completely oxidized for high viability cells with sufficient chlorine exposure 30 mg min l 1 whereas chlorination could not work well for low viability cells even with chlorine exposure of as high as 36 mg min l 1 these findings indicated chlorination may not be a feasible option to treat low viability

chlorination of source water inter or post chlorination is widely applied in dwtps in many developing countries e g china and india and north america chlorination could inactivate cyanobacteria via destroying cellular contents leading to cytolysis corrosion and wrinkling of cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane ou et al 2011 besides prior to coagulation chlorination could improve removal efficiency of cyanobacteria by altering cell surface properties to enhance solid liquid separation plummer and edzwald 2002 furthermore chlorination is highly efficient for the oxidation of cyanotoxins under various water quality conditions nicholson et al 1994 acero et al 2005 ho et al 2006 rodriguez et al 2007 merel et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2010 2012b 2013 fan et al 2014 2016 therefore chlorination is a feasible option to prevent the breakthrough of cyanobacteria and toxin into drinking water however some studies reported algal organic matters aoms could be precursors of disinfection by products dbps after chlorination zamyadi et al 2012b 2013 what s worse chlorination could induce membrane damage leading to the release of intracellular toxin daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b fan et al 2013 2014 to address this issue many studies have investigated the kinetics of cell lysis and toxin fate after chlorination and found the susceptibility of cyanobacteria to chlorination is influenced by species morphology cell counts and oxidative conditions e g temperature ph dosages contact time water matrix daly et al 2007 lin et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2012b for example lin et al 2009 reported cell lysis rate of anabaena circianlis 1400 3400 m 1 s 1 was higher than microcystis aeruginosa 790 1100 m 1 s 1 and fan et al 2016 found colonial microcystis were more resistant to chlorination than unicellular cells due to the protection of mucilaginous surrounding cells meanwhile zamyadi et al 2013 and fan et al 2014 demonstrated there was no increase of extracellular toxin after chlorination since the rate of extracellular toxin oxidation was faster than the rate of intracellular toxin release however the majority of these data were gained from chlorination experiments conducted using high viability cyanobacteria at exponential phase actually in natural freshwaters historical observations showed cyanobacterial bloom was a successive process lasting for several months in a year including development maintenance and decay stage guo 2007 tang et al 2018 during maintenance and decay stage tang et al 2018 found the genes of n and p metabolism were down regulated via meta transcriptome analysis of bloom samples from taihu lake china indicating nutrition limitation may induce a decrease of cell viability at this stage for low viability cyanobacteria at maintenance and decay stages tang et al 2018 also found mcye gene was up regulated suggesting toxin would accumulate in these low viability cyanobacteria besides rivasseau et al 1998 and pietsch et al 2002 observed an increase of extracellular toxin in pure culture cyanobacteria at stationary phase and ziegmann et al 2010 also observed the highest ratio of mc lr chl a of m aeruginosa at decline phase these results indicated low viability cells would pose a higher toxin risk than high viability cells the difference of chlorination in treating high and low viability cyanobacteria is not clear and whether chlorination is a feasible option to treat low viability cyanobacteria and control toxin risk is also unknown thus it is of great importance to compare the chlorination process to treat high and low viability cyanobacteria to date no studies have investigated the impact of chlorination on low viability cyanobacteria and related metabolites in this study a whole life cycle of microcystis in lab scale was established to collect high and low viability cells to conduct chlorination experiments the effects of chlorination on membrane integrity loss and toxin release and degradation of high and low viability microcystis were investigated and compared aiming to discuss the appropriateness of chlorination to treat low viability cyanobacteria at decline stage of a successive bloom 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and regents a toxic strain microcystis aeruginosa fachb 915 was purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences it was cultured in bg11 medium at 28 c under constant light flux 35 μmol of photons m 2 s 1 with a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle in an incubation cabinet equipped with cold light source light emitting diode led gxz 280c china sodium hypochlorite commercial solutions for chlorination experiments were analytical grade sigma german sytox green nucleic acid stain for membrane integrity analysis was purchased from thermo fisher scientific usa mc lr standards methanol and monobasic potassium phosphate for toxin analysis were chromatographically grade and purchased from solarbio china moreover all solutions were prepared using ultra pure water purified to a resistivity of 18 mω cm by a milli q water purification system millipore pty ltd usa 2 2 samples preparation of high and low viability microcystis a whole life cycle of microcystis in lab scale was established in bg 11 medium microcystis growth was monitored for 100 d and cell counts were quantified at each five days during cultivation samples for cell counts were treated with lugol s iodine and counted with blood counting chamber qiujing china by microscopy olympus bx43 japan at 400 magnification the growth pattern of microcystis mainly includes three classical growth phases exponential 5 30 d stationary 30 70 d and decline growth phase 70 100 d fig 1 microcystis samples of 10 ml at exponential 15 d stationary phase 50 d and decline phase 90 d were centrifuged at 6000 g for 5 min and cells were collected and washed with double distilled water ddh2o twice cell morphology of microcystis at all three phases were observed using electron microscope techniques as described below moreover photosynthetic yield ϕpsii is an indicator of the photosynthetic performance of phytoplankton and widely used as a sensitive indicator of cell viability hence ϕpsii of microcystis was also measured respectively and the method was described in details below for microcystis at exponential phase intact intracellular structures comprising of nucleus area photosynthetic lamella and gas vesicles were clearly observed in cells fig 2 b most of these cells appeared in pairs fig 2a and cell counts kept increasing with highϕpsii of 0 37 suggesting these cells were reproducing via cell division and maintained high viability after 30 d cultivation microcystis in pairs disappeared and intracellular gas vesicles became reduced fig 2c and d but cell density remained at the maximum of about 1 2 107 cells ml 1 for 40 d andϕpsii of microcystis did not show significant difference between cells at stationary phase and exponential phase p 0 05 figs 1 3 these results suggested the majority of microcystis at stationary stage remained high viability as the same as microcystis at exponential phase in contrast for microcystis at decline phase cell density strikingly declined andϕpsii of microcystis 0 21 was significantly lower than cells at exponential and stationary phase 0 36 0 37 p 0 05 figs 1 3 besides microcystis cells became shrinking yellow arrows or irregular shaped and several cells became severely damaged red arrows with holes on cell surfaces fig 2e intracellular structures in some cells were destroyed to some extent as well fig 2f 2e these results indicated cell viability of microcystis strikingly declined at this stage to achieve the same initial cell density of high and low viability cells microcystis were collected at exponential 15 d and decline phase 90 d to conduct chlorination experiments and these samples could well represent high and low viability of microcystis respectively fig 1 red arrows 2 3 chlorination experiments international joint commission and ohio environmental protection agency epa have set a chlorophyll a threshold of 50 μg l 1 for severe blooms and corresponding cell density was greater than 1 105 cells ml 1 watson and boyer 2013 kasich et al 2014 besides previous studies have performed extensive chlorination experiments for high viability microcystis of 105 106 cells ml 1 daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b 2013 fan et al 2013 2014 qi et al 2016 therefore prior to chlorination experiments initial cell density 7 6 106 cells ml 1 of high and low viability microcystis samples were equally diluted with ddh2o to achieve a final cell density of 1 106 cells ml 1 in addition toxin degradation was highly dependent on ph and could be significantly reduced above 8 nicholson et al 1994 hence cultures were adjusted to ph 7 5 0 1 before chlorination experiments using 0 1 m sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid daly et al 2007 fan et al 2013 2014 a chlorine stock solution was prepared by sodium hypochlorite commercial solutions free chlorine concentration was measured using the n n diethyl pphenylenediamine dpd method apha et al 1998 for chlorination experiments microcystis samples were treated with the desired concentrations 1 2 4 and 8 mg l 1 according to the applied dosages for high viability microcystis at exponential phases in previous studies daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b 2013 fan et al 2013 2014 2016 he and wert 2016 qi et al 2016 all chlorination experiments with 2 l reaction suspension were conducted in 5 l glass conical flasks and incubated in darkness at room temperature 20 2 c during chlorination microcystis samples were taken at specified contact time 0 1 2 4 8 16 32 and 60 min and immediately analyzed to determine the chlorine residual using the dpd fas titration methods apha et al 1998 at each time interval samples with specific volumes were quenched with sodium thiosulfate at a stoichiometric ratio specified in standard methods apha et al 1998 and prepared for the following analysis of membrane integrity and toxin besides microcystis samples without adding chlorine were conducted as control tests 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 electron microscopes observation microcystis samples of 10 ml were collected at exponential 15 d stationary 50 d and decline phase 90 d centrifuged by 6000 g for 5 min and washed with phosphate buffer saline twice pbs 10 mm ph 7 cellular surface structures of microcystis were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan according to li et al 2019 besides intracellular structures were further observed using a transmission electron microscope tem hitachi h 7650 japan and the details were described in supplementary material text s1 2 4 2 photosynthetic capacity quantification microcystis samples of 10 ml were collected at exponential 15 d stationary 50 d and decline phase 90 d centrifuged by 6000 g for 5 min washed with phosphate buffer saline twice pbs 10 mm ph 7 and then diluted with ddh2o to achieve the same cell density of 1 105 cells ml 1 prior to analysis samples of 5 ml were treated in darkness for 10 min after which photosynthetic yield was measured using phyto pam phytoplankton analyzer walz germany photosynthetic yield ϕpsii also known as quantum yield of psii electron transport can be calculated according to maxwell and johnson 2000 1 ϕ p s i i f m f 0 f

fluorescence immediately prior to the flash is termed as minimum fluorescence of f 0 maxwell and johnson 2000 2 4 3 membrane integrity determination during chlorination microcystis samples of 1 ml were taken at specified contact time 0 1 2 4 8 16 32 and 60 min and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate at each time interval membrane integrity was determined using a visual flow cytometry fcm flowsight meck milipore usa if cellular membrane was destroyed sytox green nucleic acid stain could permeate into cells and bind to dna resulting in bright green fluorescence with emitting a fixed wavelength of 488 nm thus the stain was used to determine damaged cells after chlorination sytox positive green fluorescence as described by daly et al 2007 in contrast there was only red fluorescence for intact cells since sytox green could not permeate into cells and pigments themselves showed red fluorescence with emitting a fixed wavelength of 488 nm using fcm sytox negative red fluorescence each sample 200 μl was incubated for 10 min after adding sytox green nucleic acid stain with a final concentration of 1 μm and run for approximately 2 5 min approximately 10000 events cells were recorded by the flow cytometry and percentage of intact cells was analyzed using flow cytometric analysis software flowsight meck millipore usa 2 4 4 microcystin quantification during chlorination microcystis samples of 100 ml were taken at specified contact time 0 1 2 4 8 16 32 and 60 min and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate at each time interval 50 ml were centrifuged by 6000 g for 5 min to collect cells for intracellular toxin measurement and the remaining 50 ml was for total toxin measurement fan et al 2014 prior to toxin analysis extracted toxin from samples was concentrated by c18 solid phase extraction with supelcleantm envitm 18 spe tubes usa nicholson et al 1994 in this study m aeruginosa fachb 915 only produce mc lr in our culture fig s1 and thus concentration of mc lr was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 usa using uv 238 nm with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 on a bio c18 column sepax usa 4 6 250 mm 5 μm at 25 c mobile phase was consisted of methanol phase a and 0 05 m monobasic potassium phosphate kh2po4 ph 3 phase b with volume ratio of 57 53 2 4 5 dissolved organic carbon characterization prior to chlorination high and low viability microcystis samples of 1 106 cells ml 1 with a volume of 10 ml were taken and filtrated with 0 45 μm millipore express pvdf filter german to remove cells this filter could not absorb organic matters and thus it did not affect subsequent doc analysis fig s2 dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured by persulfate wet oxidation technique shimadzu toc v wp japan besides uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 of these samples was measured using a uv3600 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan with the optical path of 1 cm and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva was calculated via following equation 2 2 suva l mg 1 m 1 uv 254 cm 1 100 doc mg l 1 2 5 statistics analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate and error bars in the plots represented the standard deviation sd values all data were statistically analyzed using student s t test and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 chlorine decay chlorine of 1 8 mg l 1 was employed to treat high and low viability microcystis and there was a significant difference in chlorine consumption between high and low viability microcystis fig 4 for low viability cells there was no chlorine residual detected in treatments of 1 2 4 mg l 1 after 8 16 60 min while residual concentrations of 0 3 0 8 and 0 5 mg l 1 were detected for high viability cells respectively fig 4 besides with initial highest dosage of 8 mg l 1 a chlorine residual of 0 6 mg l 1 for low viability cells was much lower than that for high viability cells after a contact time of 60 min residual chlorine of 3 5 mg l 1 fig 4 during chlorination chlorine decay showed the same fast slow pattern in all treatments to compare chlorine decay between high and low viability cells fast slow process of chlorine decay were modeled as a parallel first order reaction fig 4 and rate constants of each process was given by k fast and k slow according to equation 3 as described by daly et al 2007 3 c l t c

coefficients r2 were determined to be 0 99 1 00 and residual sum of squares rss were much less than 0 05 suggesting the model fitted well table 1 with the same initial chlorine dosages both k fast and k slow of low viability cells were much higher than that of high viability cells p 0 05 for example k fast of 0 73 0 02 min 1 rss 2 12 10 2 was estimated for low viability cells whereas lower value of 0 48 0 05 min 1 rss 1 48 10 2 was for high viability cells with chlorination of 8 mg l 1 table 1 3 2 membrane integrity loss prior to chlorination about 90 of high viability microcystis remained intact and cellular surface was smooth while over 50 were damaged for low viability cells and damaged cellular membrane was observed in certain low viability cells fig 2 5 without chlorine exposure percentage of intact cells of both low and high viability cells remained constant fig 5 however chlorination of 4 8 mg l 1 caused complete loss of membrane integrity of both low and high viability cells after 2 8 min contact time fig 5 even dosing with low chlorine dosages of 1 2 mg l 1 more than 98 of intact cells were almost destroyed within 32 60 min fig 5 3 3 membrane damage rate to compare the impact of chlorination on membrane damage of high and low viability microcystis modified chick watson model was employed to estimate membrane damage rate k loss by fitting the number of intact cells over chlorine exposure fig s3 as described by daly et al 2007 the equation was shown below equation 4 4 ln n t n 0 k l o s s ct where ct chlorine exposure nt number of intact cells after a given chlorine exposure n0 number of intact cells at ct 0 and k loss rate constant of membrane damage values of ct were calculated from chlorine decay data table 2 showed r2 were between 0 94 and 1 00 and rss 1 66 10 11 1 28 10 2 were less than 0 05 suggesting the model fitted well with the same initial dosages of chlorination k loss of low viability cells was much higher than that of high viability cells p 0 05 table 2 besides average k loss 708 135 m 1 s 1 of low viability cells was also higher than that of high viability cells 486 164 m 1 s 1 p 0 05 table 2 3 4 total toxin degradation prior to chlorination total toxin of low viability cells 170 μg l 1 was much higher than high viability cells 44 μg l 1 p 0 05 but chlorination could effectively oxidize toxin to some extent for both high and low viability cells fig 6 for high viability cells about 6 and 25 μg l 1 of total toxin was present after 60 min with initial low chlorine of 2 and 1 mg l 1 while total toxin was degraded to below detection limits after 32 60 min with high dosage of 4 and 8 mg l 1 fig 6a in contrast total toxin of 68 168 μg l 1 was residual after 60 min with chlorination of 1 8 mg l 1 for low viability cells and the highest degradation percentage of 60 was gained with highest chlorine dose of 8 mg l 1 whist only 7 of total toxin was degraded with chlorine of 1 mg l 1 fig 6b to compare total toxin degradation of high and low viability microcystis after chlorination modified chick watson model was employed to estimate rate constants k total of total toxin degradation over chlorine exposure fig s4 daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b the fitted equation was shown equation 5 5 ln mc t mc 0 k t o t a l ct where ct chlorine exposure mct concentration of total toxin after a given chlorine exposure mc0 concentration of total toxin at ct 0 and k total rate constant of total toxin degradation table 3 showed r2 were between 0 91 and 0 99 and rss 1 63 10 5 1 7 10 3 were much less than 0 05 suggesting the model fitted well with the same initial chlorination k total of low viability cells was much lower than that of high viability cells p 0 05 table 3 moreover average k loss 50 27 m 1 s 1 of low viability cells was also lower than that of high viability cells 98 56 m 1 s 1 p 0 05 table 3 3 5 intracellular toxin release and extracellular toxin degradation both intracellular and extracellular toxin of low viability cells were higher than that of high viability cells before chlorination p 0 05 fig 6 above results revealed chlorine induced membrane damage of both high and low viability microcystis fig 5 and thus about 50 100 of intracellular toxin was released during chlorination within a contact time of 60 min fig 6 meanwhile the released toxin after membrane damage and initial extracellular toxin were degraded via chlorination fig 6 during chlorination for high viability cells extracellular toxin was degraded to below detection limits after 4 min with dosages of 4 and 8 mg l 1 but it increased from initial 3 μg l 1 to 6 and 19 μg l 1 with dosages of 2 and 1 mg l 1 respectively fig 6a in contrast with chlorination of 1 8 mg l 1 for low viability cells extracellular toxin remained at high level during chlorination and increased from 48 μg l 1 to 68 102 μg l 1 after a contact time of 60 min the corresponding increase percentage of 42 113 fig 6b to further compare the process of intracellular toxin release and extracellular toxin degradation with chlorination for high and low viability cells relationship between chlorine exposure toxin release and degradation can be described as a first order process and the process can be considered as consecutive reaction as shown in equation 6 besides concentration of intracellular a and extracellular toxin b are described by equations 7 and 8 jones 1970 zamyadi et al 2013 fan et al 2014 6 a k i b k e c 7 a a 0 e k i c t 8 b b 0 e k e c t a 0 e k e c t e k i c t 1 k e k i where ct chlorine exposure

sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was ranged of 0 72 0 99 demonstrating the model fitted well with the same initial dosages of chlorination k i of low viability cells 90 127 m 1 s 1 was higher than high viability cells 28 102 m 1 s 1 but k e 18 36 m 1 s 1 was much lower than that of high viability cells 33 113 m 1 s 1 p 0 05 table 4 besides with the same treatment k e of high viability cells was higher than its k i k e k i p 0 05 but contrary result was gained for low viability cells k e k i table 4 average values of k e and k i also showed the same pattern for both high and low viability cells table 4 4 discussion 4 1 chlorine decay during chlorination for both high and low viability microcystis chlorine decay was fast in all treatments as the same pattern observed by previous studies ho et al 2006 daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012b 2013 however this study found chlorine decay was faster for low viability cells than high viability cells with the same initial chlorine dosage fig 4 table 1 previous studies have noted that presence of natural organic matters noms is the most important factor in chlorine consumption and its concentration and characteristics are known to strongly influence the chlorine reaction since noms contain a higher proportion of conjugated and substituted aromatic moieties is more susceptible to chlorine attack reckhow et al 1990 korshin et al 1997 ho et al 2006 deborde and von gunten 2008 in this study we did not use natural waters as backgrounds to conduct chlorination experiments as done by previous studies ho et al 2006 daly et al 2007 lin et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2012b fan et al 2016 nonetheless these samples of high and low viability cells collected from cultures in bg 11 medium no organic matters could better show the influence of the change of cell viability on water quality backgrounds because cyanobacteria could secrete extracellular organic matters eoms to cultures during growth and some studies found characteristics of eoms were changing at different growth phase and doc increased from exponential to stationary phase henderson et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2014 further analysis of eoms in our samples showed low viability cells exhibited higher extracellular doc and uv254 than high viability cells p 0 05 table 5 uv254 representing the aromatic character has been identified as a potential surrogate measure for doc korshin et al 2009 suggesting higher concentration of eoms accumulated in low viability cells as well as more aromatic groups in eoms thus chlorine consumption for low viability cells was much faster than for high viability cells with the same initial dosages of chlorination suva could describe the nature of noms in the water in terms of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity and a suva 3 illustrates mainly hydrophilic material edzwald and tobiason 1999 here a value of 1 67 and 1 75 l mg 1 m 1 were measured for high and low viability cells respectively table 5 suggesting eoms of these samples mainly contained hydrophilic organic matters however there was no significant difference of suva between high and low viability cells p 0 05 table 5 demonstrating difference in chlorine decay was not correlated with the hydrophilicity of eoms 4 2 membrane integrity loss chlorination of 1 8 mg l 1 could completely destroy membrane integrity of high viability cells fig 5a in agreement with previous studies daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2010 2012b 2013 fan et al 2013 fan et al 2013 found chlorine was the most efficient oxidant to destroy membrane of cyanobacteria at exponential phase compared to other oxidants e g kmno4 h2o2 here with the same initial chlorine dosage chlorine exposure for low viability cells was a lower level than for high viability cells fig 4 but complete loss of membrane integrity of low viability cells was observed in all treatments these results suggested chlorination had strong capacity to inactivate both high and low viability cells via completely destroy membrane integrity besides for low viability cells the membrane damage rate k loss was higher than high viability cells table 2 fan et al 2016 and he and wert 2016 found colonial microcystis was more resistant to chlorination than unicellular microcystis since colonies can be protected by surface amorphous mucilage or sheaths these results suggested cellular surface structures are important barriers for protection from chlorine attack comparing with high viability cells both tem and sem showed cellular surface structures e g sheath of low viability cells were destroyed to some extent resulting in incapacity to maintain its spherical shape fig 2e and f consequently low viability microcystis was less resistant to chlorination leading to higher membrane damage rate k loss than high viability cells 4 3 total toxin degradation total toxin was degraded to some extent 7 100 after chlorination for both high and low viability microcystis depending on chlorine exposure fig 6 as demonstrated by previous studies that chlorination was efficient to oxidize cyanotoxins under various water quality backgrounds nicholson et al 1994 acero et al 2005 2008 ho et al 2006 merel et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2010 2012b 2013 fan et al 2014 2016 for high viability cells chlorination could oxidize total toxin to below detection limits with ct value of 30 mg min l 1 while 6 and 19 μg l 1 of total toxin were present after 60 min with ct value of 1 6 9 6 mg min l 1 fig 4a 6a it suggested sufficient chlorine exposure was important for complete toxin oxidation and nicholson et al 1994 also firstly noted that cyanotoxins were completely destroyed under conditions that a chlorine residual of at least 0 5 mg l 1 was present after a contact time of 30 min however when low viability cells were treated with sufficient chlorine exposure of as high as 36 mg min l 1 68 μg l 1 of total toxin was also present after 60 min even with chlorine residual of 0 6 mg l 1 fig 4b 6b these results indicated incomplete toxin oxidation for low viability cells was not only due to insufficient chlorine exposure actually rate constants of total toxin degradation for low viability cells was much lower than high viability cells table 3 implying incomplete toxin oxidation for low viability cells with sufficient chlorine exposure would attribute to the decrease of k total literatures concluded that chlorination conditions e g temperature ph water matrix would strongly affect cyanotoxin degradation nicholson et al 1994 acero et al 2005 in this study chlorination experiments were conducted at the same temperature and ph but initial concentration of total toxin and reaction backgrounds showed the difference between high and low viability cells fig 6 it is possible that the much higher initial concentration of total toxin in low viability cells 170 μg l 1 than high viability cells 44 μg l 1 would lead to incomplete degradation of total toxin with sufficient chlorine exposure however nicholson et al 1994 and acero et al 2005 reported much higher concentration of mc lr 200 300 μg l 1 could be completely degraded with low chlorine exposure 1 2 mg l 1 for less than 30 min thus it was not the main factor to affect total toxin degradation by chlorination for low viability cells effect of higher initial concentration of doc of low viability cells on chlorine consumption and toxin oxidation could not be ignored in this study he and wert 2016 have tried to employ the ratio of chlorine dosages to initial doc chlorine doc to minimize the effect of initial doc on chlorination to treat cyanobacteria hence we further re evaluated values of chlorine doc in various treatments and found that the k total 25 1 m 1 s 1 of low viability cells was still lower in the treatment with higher value of chlorine doc 0 65 than high viability cells with lower value of chlorine doc 0 39 89 6 m 1 s 1 table s1 these results suggested higher initial concentration of doc could affect chlorine decay but it was not the main factor to decrease k total of low viability cells chlorine could undergo reactions with numerous organic compounds and second order rate constants for chlorination vary over 10 orders of magnitude i e 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 depending on particular sites of organic compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 besides in various water matrix cyanotoxin degradation rate by chlorine was estimated by many studies and varied from 22 to 241 m 1 s 1 table s2 daly et al 2007 and ho et al 2006 reported rate constants was higher in natural waters than ddh2o and ho et al 2006 attributed the differences to noms microcystin interactions in this study decrease of k total for low viability cells might be also attributed to eoms cyanotoxin interactions ziegmann et al 2010 found the highest fluorescence intensity of protein like substances in eoms at decline phase besides m aeruginosa could produce many other cyclic peptides similar to microcystin and some of these peptides had greater reactivity with chlorine than cyanotoxin molecules hureiki et al 1994 ho et al 2006 it suggested that there may be more peptides similar to microcystin present in low viability cells which could inhibit cyanotoxin degradation via competitive reactions nonetheless chlorine reaction with cyanotoxins is a complex interaction with organic matters and characteristics of eoms in low viability cells was not well investigated in this study therefore more studies were required to elucidate eoms cyanotoxin interactions 4 4 intracellular toxin release and extracellular toxin degradation chlorination could completely destroy membrane integrity for both high and low viability cells and thus the release of intracellular toxin could not be avoided when chlorine was applied to treat cyanobacteria in practice above study has demonstrated low viability cells was less resistant to chlorination than high viability cells table 2 indicating its membrane damage would be more serious than high viability cells after chlorination hence its rate constants of intracellular toxin release were higher than high viability cells in line with membrane damage rate constants k loss low viability high viability table 2 4 meanwhile for low viability cells rate constants of extracellular toxin degradation strikingly declined compared to high viability cells table 4 it might also result from eoms cyanotoxin interactions as the same as k total for high viability cells there was no increase of extracellular toxin during chlorination with initial dose of 4 and 8 mg l 1 fig 6a the same results were also observed by zamyadi et al 2013 and fan et al 2014 attributed to the higher rate of extracellular toxin degradation k e than intracellular toxin release k i k e k i in this study k e was also higher than k i table 4 however an increase of extracellular toxin occurred with ct value of 1 6 9 6 mg min l 1 since the released extracellular toxin could not be effectively degraded after 16 32 min without chlorine residual fig 6a in contrast with sufficient chlorine exposure of 30 mg min l 1 extracellular toxin kept decreasing and it was degraded to below the safety guideline of 1 μg l 1 for drinking water by who fig 6a suggesting both k e k i and sufficient chlorine exposure were important for the control of extracellular toxin risk when chlorination was applied to treat high viability cells for low viability cells insufficient chlorine exposure of 0 6 9 6 mg min l 1 could cause an increase of extracellular toxin after chlorination as the same for high viability cells however even with sufficient chlorination exposure of 36 mg min l 1 extracellular toxin remained increasing during chlorination as well fig 4b 6 suggesting the rapid released toxin could not be effectively degraded due to the decrease of k e for low viability cells fig 6b table 4 meanwhile k i of low viability cells was much higher than high viability cells hence for low viability cells continuous increase of extracellular toxin was mainly attributed to its much higher k i than k e k e k i of note initial concentration of extracellular 48 μg l 1 in low viability cells was much higher than high viability cells 3 μg l 1 fig 6 and thus there was much higher concentration of extracellular toxin of 68 137 μg l 1 present after 60 min with chlorination for low viability cells consequently chlorination for low viability cells would pose a high risk of extracellular toxin 4 5 practical implications this study concluded that chlorination could be employed as an oxidant to treat high viability cyanobacteria and prevent the breakthrough of extracellular toxin into drinking water in agreement with previous studies zamyadi et al 2013 fan et al 2014 2016 nonetheless chlorination may not be a feasible option to treat low viability cyanobacteria at decline stage of cyanobacterial blooms these results suggested chlorination application to treat algal laden source waters would be limited by the stage of a successive cyanobacterial bloom therefore monitoring of cell viability of cyanobacteria may be necessary for water suppliers to manage drinking water quality during a successive bloom optimizing chlorination or further evaluating other water treatment processes to treat low viability cyanobacteria would be an important issue in the further work 5 conclusions this study was the first report to show that the change of cell viability of cyanobacteria could challenge chlorination to treat algal laden source waters during a successive bloom some of the key findings were shown below i chlorine exposure was lower for low viability cells than high viability cells with the same initial dosage of chlorine mainly due to faster chlorine consumption resulting from its rise of doc and more aromatic groups in eoms ii low viability cells were less resistant to chlorine oxidation than high viability cells leading to higher rate of membrane damage k loss and intracellular toxin release k i iii total extracellular toxin degradation efficiency k total k e of chlorination for low viability cells strikingly declined and it may be attributed to eoms

17937,this study first compared the efficiencies and mechanisms of the nitrogen removal in an aerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr treating mustard tuber wastewater from high salt 30 gnacl l 1 to ultra high salt 70 gnacl l 1 high efficiency maintaining of nitrification was observed despite of high bod5 tn 5 5 9 distinct denitrification decline for lack of carbon in response to salt stress was observed considering the high concentrations of sulfate in mustard wastewater and the existence of sulfur reducing bacteria srb and sulfur driven denitrifiers dnsob in the aerobic sbbr sulfate reduction sulfur autotrophic denitrification process is a feasible idea to solve this problem by modified to intermittent aeration mode sulfur cycle was developed in sbbr the average removal efficiency of cod tn reached 85 20 and 98 56 respectively by batch activity tests and microbial community analysis ammonia oxidation activity by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa was observed and high abundance of aoa arch amoa aob amoa 2 38 102 together with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob of nitrosomonas halophila 1 23 ensured the high efficient nitrification after running mode change specific sulfur driven no3 n reduction rate increased and the abundance of dominant srb and dnsob rose from 3 95 to 10 79 and 2 22 to 9 95 respectively the sulfate reducing process during anaerobic phase provided electron donors for subsequent autotrophic denitrification making outlet no3 n concentrations reduced from 18 26 mg l 1 to 1 93 mg l 1 the sulfur activity batch test showed that 73 80 80 92 of sulfate were circulation utilized and rest of them conversed to the gaseous h2s and s0 in addition to dnsob anoxic denitrifier of halomonas 22 91 aerobic denitrifier of phaeodactylibacter 2 75 and endogenous denitrifier of defluviicoccus 3 18 were also dominant heterotrophic bacteria all halophilic or halotolerant in the intermittent aeration sbbr batch activity tests and periodic laws have also verified the existence of corresponding denitrification pathways this study shows that the enrichment of special halophilic functional bacteria with multiple nitrogen removal pathways is a good idea for the efficient treatment of high concentrated hypersaline industrial wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords salinity biological nitrogen removal microbial community ammonia oxidizing archaea sulfur cycle 1 introduction industrial saline hypersaline wastewater generated from various industrial processes such as pickling industry mariculture industry petroleum industry tanneries and piggeries corsino et al 2016 2019 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2017a usually containing large amounts of organic compounds and nitrogen they are difficult to treat and threaten to the water environment with high efficiency and low cost biological treatment technology are preferred for practical engineering application however high concentrated inorganic salt ions can destroy the intracellular and extracellular osmotic pressure balance of microorganisms reduce enzyme activities and even cause microbial dehydration and death hosseiniyan khatibi et al 2019 uygur and kargi 2004 to overcome these problems the construction and performance of biological nitrogen and organic matter removal systems treating high salt wastewater under different control conditions treatment processes and salinity acclimation methods have been extensively studied liu et al 2019 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a researchers showed that the efficient degradation of organic matter could be achieved in the range of 0 70 gnacl l 1 nevertheless the problems of low nitrogen removal efficiency and unclear removal mechanisms have not been solved especially for practical hypersaline salinity 50 gnacl l 1 industrial wastewater corsino et al 2016 macedo et al 2019 shi et al 2012 nitrification is widely regarded as the limited step of nitrogen removal in high salt environment since ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are strict autotrophic with low metabolic capacity the energy that can be used to rebalance osmotic pressure impacted by salinity is negligible uygur and kargi 2004 at the same time salt ions directly inhibit enzymatic activity and metabolic system of aob and nob therefore high dissolved oxygen supply promoting metabolic activities and the special halophilic nitrifying bacteria groups may become the key to successful nitrification under high salt condition with the advantages of rich microbial population maintaining good flexibility and stability and the anaerobic anoxia aerobic microenvironment an aerobic sbbr has been successfully applied to biological nitrogen removal at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 in our previous study wang et al 2017a a stable ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency above 90 was obtained whether this system remains efficient treating hypersaline wastewater and which kind of functional flora can be responsible for hypersaline nitrogen removal are worth of further study compared with autotrophic nitrifying bacteria which are more sensitive to extreme environment heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria adapt to saline environment more easily fu et al 2019 lan et al 2018 for instance 100 nitrate removal efficiency was reported at 0 110 gnacl l 1 in several denitrifying reactors with sufficient carbon source miao et al 2015 osaka et al 2008 so efficient denitrification can be achieved theoretically by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in aerobic hypersaline biofilm system however in this kind of reactors denitrification decline after salinity exceeding 50 gnacl l 1 were commonly reported lan et al 2018 shi et al 2012 and this contradiction has not been reasonably explained one presumption is that the oxygen concentrations in hypersaline aerobic biofilm reactors is too high for successful nitrification so that the carbon source is consumed in advance and suppressed denitrification nevertheless this denitrification inhibit phenomenon also appeared in the hypersaline pickling wastewater treatment with high c n ratio 10 in our preliminary research and its internal reason is worth exploring for saline sewage treatment with low c n wang et al 2009 developed the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process efficient carbon and nitrogen removal was demonstrated at present the introduce of sulfur cycle promoting nitrogen removal has also been reported wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b in fact sulfate is widespread in saline industrial wastewater such as pickled wastewater and halophilic srb and sob also existed widely in such environment wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b therefore the establishment of the sulfur cycle may be a promising way to improve the denitrification efficiency in hypersaline wastewater treatment under particular hypersaline environment it is worth studying that whether sulfur cycle can be built and enhanced and which kinds of srb sob could be dominant in this study carbon and nitrogen removal processes under three running mode two aerobic running modes at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 and 70 gnacl l 1 and then a modified intermittent aeration mode at 70 gnacl l 1 were established in a sbbr treating high concentrated mustard tuber wastewater the main purpose is as follows 1 analyze the underlying causes of denitrification inhibition in conventional aerobic sbbr treating hypersaline wastewater 2 exploring appropriate operating mode to realize efficient hypersaline nitrification and denitrification 3 clarifying the underlying pathways and the key functional microorganisms for efficient hypersaline nitrogen removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater characteristics the influent was taken from a pickled mustard tuber factory in chongqing china two types of mustard tuber wastewater were generated from producing processes fig s1 1 pickling wastewater produced from three stage pickling processes containing salt concentrations of 100 200 gnacl l 1 cod of 10000 40000 mg l 1 and tn concentrations of 1000 3000 mg l 1 the quantity of it varied with the raw materials quality product requirements pickling temperature and time 2 processing wastewater produced from elutriation desalination and dehydration processes containing salt concentrations of 25 50 gnacl l 1 cod of 1800 3000 mg l 1 and tn concentrations of 80 300 mg l 1 with 5 7 m3 wastewater per ton of product they were both discharged to a mixed tank with a ratio of 1 7 1 2 5 pickling wastewater to processing wastewater for wastewater treatment in this plant in addition because of small quantity production of domestic sewage 0 5 2 of mustard tuber wastewater the plant also discharged it into the mixed tank the influent in this study was taken from the mixed tank the characteristics of the influent are presented in table 1 2 2 experimental set up and operation strategy the study was carried out in a sbbr the reactor consisted of polyester fiber packing and a circular glass vessel radius 15 0 cm height 20 0 cm with an effective volume of 2 l fig s2 the details of sbbr had been reported in previous paper wang et al 2017a dissolved oxygen was fed through an air pump from the bottom and the reactor was operated in a constant temperature chamber of 30 2 c 30 g of inoculated sludge were added to the reactor which was taken from a steady running sbbr treating pickled mustard tuber wastewater at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 for over one year the operating parameters and removal efficiency of the inoculated sbbr was as follows wang et al 2017a after 60 days of stable aerobic operation at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 aero 3 the salinity was gradually upgraded to 70 gnacl l 1 with a salinity unit of 10 gnacl l 1 and then operated for 90 days at salinity of 70 gnacl l 1 aero 7 and finally began to operate with the intermittent aeration mode intermit 7 the details of three stage operation modes were shown in table s1 2 3 analytical methods effluent water samples were collected at the end of each cycle analytical methods of nutrients c n s and other parameters do salinity etc were in supplementary materials of text s1 2 4 batch activity tests due to the anaerobic anoxia aerobic microenvironment in biofilm and the complicated composition of the mustard tuber wastewater including carbon ammonia nitrate and sulfate at the same time simultaneous conversions of the carbon nitrogen and sulfate might be occur therefore in order to investigate whether the microorganisms in the sbbr have specific nitrification and denitrification functions we have adopted different specific simulate water to conduct batch activity tests the nitrogen batch activity tests were divided into two separate parts the nitrification experiments testⅰ and denitrification experiments testⅱ table s2 exhibited the specific parameters descriptions testⅰwere aiming to determine the potential contribution of nitrification by aoa aob with without atu aob inhibitor testⅱ were aiming to determine the potential aerobic anoxic heterotrophic and sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification process sulfur activity batch test was mainly to detected percentage of sulfur cycle and sulfur components in effluent see the supplementary material text s2 for the specific procedure of these batch tests 2 5 microbial community analysis biofilm samples were collected by scraping the sludge from the biofilm carriers at day 60th 90th and 250th illumina miseq sequencing was used for bacterial communities analyzing the 16 s rrna genes were amplified with the primers 338f 806 r which targeting the hypervariable v3 v4 region q pcr was carried out by a stepone plus system real time pcr system applied biosystems usa aob amoa and arch amoa gene copies were quantified with the primers amoa 1f amoa 2r and amoa 26f amoa 416 r respectively specific steps were the same as described in wang et al 2017b 3 results 3 1 reactor performance from salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 to 70 gnacl l 1 elevated salts showed a significant effect on the nitrogen removal supplementary material text s3 table s3 under aero 7 mode the average concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in effluent were 3 07 mg l 1 0 54 mg l 1 and 18 26 mg l 1 respectively then intermittent aeration mode was applied to improve the sbbr s performance fig 1 shows the carbon nitrogen and sulfate performances under intermit 7 mode for 100 days despite the change of operation condition the degradation of organic matter was not significantly affected after the adaptation of first two stages the aerobic nitrification microorganisms had gradually adapted to the alternating aerobic environment in order to further enhance nitrogen removal efficiency and save aeration energy costs on the 30th day the operating mode was further changed table s1 the outlet nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were rapidly increased on the 41st day ammonia oxidizing capability recovered and nh4 n concentrations in effluent remained stable at 1 04 5 74 mg l 1 the no2 n and no3 n concentrations in effluent rose to the peak 21 22 mg l 1 and 18 92 mg l 1 respectively on the 31st and 33rd day respectively and then gradually decreased on day 42 effluent no3 n concentrations were stable below 2 00 mg l 1 at the same time the effluent concentrations of so4 2 was gradually reduced compared with the conventional aerobic operation mode the average effluent no3 n decreased from 18 26 mg l 1 to 1 93 mg l 1 under the modified strategy the average tn and so4 2 removal efficiencies were increased by 8 79 and 22 38 respectively in modified sbbr the problem of residue nitrate under ultra high salt was basically solved and the sulfate removal efficiency was also improved 3 2 cyclic experiment the nitrogen sulfate concentrations and cod variations in one cyclic experiment at aero 7 are depicted in fig 2 a significant feast and famine phase were observed after organic matter degradation famine phase the oxygen began to rise and nitrate and nitrite accumulated at the same time the reduced sulfur produced at feast phase was re oxidized and the sulfate content gradually recovered after 13 h of reaction the sulfate content was no longer rising and the denitrification also gradually stopped the residual ammonia and nitrite were all oxidized to residual nitrate 19 20 mg l 1 the performance under intermit 7 mode was different fig 2b at stageⅰ anaerobic 5 h organic matters were utilized and after dilution so4 2 concentrations decreased from 319 64 331 86 mg l 1 to 193 43 220 57 mg l 1 at stage ⅱ aerobic 3 h organic matters continued to be consumed dissolved oxygen gradually rose 0 3 67 mg l 1 and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occur at stage ⅲ anoxia 3 h biodegradable organic matters were exhausted and nitrate and sulfate were slightly reduced at stage ⅳ aerobic 3 h the dissolved oxygen rose back above 4 00 mg l 1 ammonia oxidation continued and the nitrate concentrations accumulated to 13 86 16 22 mg l 1 at stage ⅴ anoxic 3 h nitrate decreased to 0 59 1 57 mg l 1 at the 17th hour and the sulfate increased by 18 64 25 75 mg l 1 meanwhile ammonia concentrations rose to 5 44 6 81 mg l 1 at stage ⅵ 18 19 h ammonia oxidation process proceed and nitrate generated again which was then gradually removed in the final stage 3 3 batch activity tests due to the simultaneous conversions of the carbon nitrogen and sulfate as revealed by cyclic experiment it is difficult to directly verify the system s removal pathways therefore to explore the possible pathways in hypersaline environment comparative kinetic analysis among the three operational modes were conducted using specific simulate water 3 3 1 nitrification batch test there are three possible pathways for ammonia removal autotrophic nitrification heterotrophic nitrification and cell assimilation in our previous study there was no evidence for heterotrophic nitrification in the inoculated sbbr wang et al 2017 and the heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria were not detected so the autotrophic nitrification were mainly explored inhibit of ammonia oxidation in hypersaline environment was observed for evident decline of ammonia specific oxidation rate table s4 since aoa and aob were both present in reactor section 3 4 2 atu completely inhibit of bacterial ammonia monooxygenase slightly harmful to archaea was used to explore the contribution of aoa and aob the results showed that when activity of aob was inhibit ammonia oxidizing activities were still detected fig 3 a in aero 3 aero 7 and intermit 7 mode the ratio of ammonia specific oxidation rate after aob inhibition to that before was 0 63 0 59 and 0 42 respectively so it is speculating that the contribution of aoa to ammonia oxidation might be greater over 50 under aerobic conditions in addition in aero 3 aero 7 and intermit 7 mode the ratio of nitrite specific oxidation rate to that of ammonia was 0 49 0 85 and 1 27 respectively table s4 indicating that from saline to hypersaline due to the increase of oxygen supply the system s nitrification pathway gradually converted from short cut to full scale nitrification 3 3 2 denitrification batch test without carbon source limiting the hypersaline sbbr could achieve complete 100 nitrate removal efficiency from salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 to 70 gnacl l 1 the aerobic anoxic snrr decreased from 17 27 22 43 mg l 1 h 1 to 11 64 18 74 mg l 1 h 1 fig 3b indicating that ultra high salts still showed distinct inhibit to snrr despite of nitrate removal efficiency unaffected at the same time no matter under aerobic or intermittent aeration mode aerobic and anoxic denitrification were simultaneously present in the hypersaline sbbr as the anoxic time increased the ratio of anoxic to aerobic snrr increased from 0 81 to 1 61 indicating that dominating denitrification pathway gradually changed from aerobic to anoxic since dnsob was found in sbbr the expression of sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification was explored fig 3c no carbon was added in this batch test in absence of sulfide no degradation of nitrate was observed in contrast with sulfide addition the nitrate concentrations fell blow 1 mg l 1 at 21 h and 14 h in aero 7 and intermit 7 mode respectively indicating that sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification occur under both hypersaline condition as autotrophic denitrifying sob was not acclimated section 3 4 4 nitrate in sbbr at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 was hardly degraded 3 3 3 sulfur activity batch test fig 4 exhibits sulfur balance variation at 0 h 5 h and 24 h in one cycle under aero 7 and intermit 7 mode at the first moment initial sulfate were come from inflow and residual of last cycle after 5 anaerobic hours the maximum observed reduction of so4 2 s accounted for 21 90 2 98 and 44 05 8 87 of total initial sulfur under aero 7 and intermit 7 mode respectively at the end of running 78 34 83 62 and 73 80 80 92 of re oxidizing sulfate was observed under aero 7 and intermit 7 mode respectively thiosulfate and sulfite were both below 1 0 mg d 1 at the three moment among the final removed sulfate gas h2s s was 24 65 2 54 and 37 81 3 86 of the sulfur products in effluent under aero 7 and intermit 7 modes in batch test respectively fig s3 furthermore under intermit 7 mode there was 13 36 3 64 of the sulfate converted to s0 while the proportion of sulfur in the aerobic mode was only 4 50 2 50 and amount of thiosulfate and sulfide under both modes were small furthermore no sulfite was found 3 4 microbial community 3 4 1 bacterial communities to get deeper insight into the bacterial community in the sbbr system three representative biofilm samples s0 at aero 3 s1 at aero 7 and s3 at intermit 7 were analyzed by illumina miseq sequencing ace richness and chao richness of two hypersaline samples were slightly declined table s5 shannon s diversity index and simpson index revealed that diversity increased after operation mode modified form saline to hypersaline environment conventional strains were largely eliminated and the dominant genera of sl and s2 were both concentrated in halophilic bacteria see the supplementary material text s4 for detailed description 3 4 2 nitrifying microorganisms predominant genera related to nitrification and denitrification were displayed in fig 5 b and table s6 the relative abundance of aob and nob in aerobic saline and hypersaline samples were both less than 0 5 by contrast in s2 aob consisted of nitrosococcus 0 01 and nitrosomonas halophila 1 23 and nob consisted of nitrospira 1 24 and nitrolancea 0 41 meanwhile q pcr technology testified the amoa gene copies of aoa and aob table 2 ultra high salt produced severe inhibition of ammonia oxidizing microbes from salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 to 70 gnacl l 1 copies of arch amoa and aob amoa genes both decreased by an order of magnitude meanwhile when salinity roes the ratio of aoa aob amoa gene copies increased from 1 20 103 to 2 47 103 indicating that the salinity inhibition to aoa was less than to aob furthermore with the change of aeration mode the relative abundance of aob increased the ratio of aoa aob amoa gene copies declined from 2 47 103 to 2 38 102 after mode modified 3 4 3 denitrifying microorganisms denitrifying genera are shown in fig 5b and table s6 four kinds of denitrification genera were found at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 and those were all heterotrophic as salinity up to 70 gnacl l 1 the abundance of moderate halophilic denitrifying genus halomonas increased from 7 23 to 74 77 furthermore arcobacter 1 20 and thiohalobacter 1 02 with function of sulfur based autotrophic denitrifying became dominant after operation mode converted two other denitrifying genera defluviicoccus and thioalkalivibrio became dominant further description of sulfur based denitrifiers see section 3 4 4 defluviicoccus accounted for 3 18 in s2 species under this genus are denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms which uses intracellularly synthesized pha as internal carbon source for denitrification in intermittent aeration environment wang et al 2008 this genus was only dominant under intermittent aeration 3 4 4 sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfur oxidizing bacteria there were 7 kinds of srb detected table s7 in s1 the dominant srb with abundance of more than 1 was only desulfotignum 3 95 in s2 the dominant srb rose to three genera desulfotignum 6 93 desulfovibrio 2 47 and desulfatitalea 1 39 although these srb were also detected at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 their abundances were all less than 1 all three srb are mesophilic bacteria and can utilize various organic substances as electron donor and carbon source for sulfate reduction among them desulfotignum plays an important role in the marine sulfur cycle schink et al 2002 the representative strain of desulfatitalea was found in bay sediments strains of desulfovibrio are moderately halophilic bacteria and can grow at salinity range of 0 5 11 0 there were 7 kinds of sobs detected in total table s7 the total abundance of sobs in s1 and s2 were 2 85 and 11 33 respectively in s2 three genera of dnsob thiohalobacter thioalkalivibrio and arcobacter were detected the sequences of the thiohalobacter gen in this study were mostly classified into thiohalo thiocyanaticus species level thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus is a glan negative aerobic moderate halophilic bacterium can grow in salinity ranging from 1 1 to 17 5 sorokin et al 2010 and it is one kind of strictly chemoautotrophic sob capable of oxidizing sulfides elemental sulfur tetrathionates and then reducing nitrates the abundance of this strain in s2 was 6 49 which was 5 47 more than that of aerobic systems it was also the third dominant genus in s2 thioalkalivibrio gen classified into thioalkalivibrio thiocyanodenitrificans species level in the test results is a typical dnsob and able to adapt to extreme environment berben et al 2015 and it was the first time this bacterium discovered in the hypersaline wastewater treatment system arcobacter was detected in a variety of sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification systems liu et al 2016a which is facultative anaerobic and capable of surviving under saline conditions 4 discussion 4 1 key functional microorganisms in efficient hypersaline nitrifying traditional non halotolerant aob and nob are significantly inhibited after salinity exceeding 10 gnacl l 1 gonzalez silva et al 2016 which was the core reason of nitrification failures under saline or hypersaline wastewater environment in most of previous literature aslan and simsek 2012 chen et al 2018 corsino et al 2016 it is reasonable to suggest that the key to successful hypersaline nitrification requires the participation of special halophilic nitrifying bacteria a certain number of nitrosomonas halophila aob and nitrospira nob table s6 were observed at salinity of 70 gnacl l 1 which were often reported as main nitrifying bacteria detected in saline and hypersaline wastewater treatment systems chen et al 2019 corsino et al 2019 liu et al 2019 xia et al 2019 although high sensitivity of nitrospira to salinity was reported xia et al 2019 but the special halophilic stains under this genus such as nitrospira marina were also widely present in saline environments keuter et al 2011 several species in nitrosomonas gen such as nitrosomonas halophila nitrosomonas marina and nitrosomonas europea are able to utilize ammonia under salt stress making them become main force for nitrification under high salt conditions koops et al 1991 different inoculums led to the varieties of aob for example nitrosomonas europea salt tolerant bacteria and can grow in a non salinity environment was one of the most common species reported in saline or non saline systems its inoculums were generally ordinary sewage sludge wu et al 2013 xia et al 2019 no literatures reported it presented at hypersaline condition indicating that this strain cannot complete hypersaline nitrogen removal nitrosomonas halophila detected at all samples in this study has an obligate requirement for salt nitrosomonas also the only detected the aob in seeding saline biofilm wang et al 2017a which determined nitrosomonas halophila came from the inoculums it had a higher abundance at 70 gnacl l 1 and is more suitable to help successful nitrification under ultra high salt compared to nitrosomonas europea in addition due to the limitations of detect technology most of the literatures only reported nitrosomonas and nitrospira at genus level chen et al 2019 corsino et al 2019 certain species performing successful nitrification at ultra high salt remains to be excavated compared with aob aoa are more resilient in extreme environments stahl and de la torre 2012 and were reported to be divergent in deep sea hypersaline basins merlino et al 2018 q pcr results showed that the number of aoa in the hypersaline system far exceeded aob no matter under aerobic or modified operation mode combined with the ammonia oxidation pathway experiment it is proved that the aoa played an important role in nitrification at salinity of 70 gnacl l 1 in recent years several reporters also found aoa existed in wastewater treatment plants and reactors jin et al 2010 park et al 2006 wu et al 2013 the important contribution of aoa to successful nitrification in saline and hypersaline environments should not be neglected although previous literatures fukushima et al 2012 santos et al 2018 and this study all indicate that high concentrations of inorganic salt ions inhibited aob and aoa the degree of inhibition to aoa and aob seemed to be different so far the competition and distribution of aoa and aob in saline wastewater reactors and habitat were still controversial consistent with most reports aoa exhibited more growth superiority and active ammonia oxidation activities than aob in medium and high saline environment he et al 2018 hou et al 2018 liu et al 2016b wu et al 2013 while there were still reports found that aob amoa gene copies was higher than that of aoa in saline nitrogen removing reactors jin et al 2010 ye and zhang 2011 the contradiction may be interpreted as that the distribution of aoa and aob community was a complex result of various environmental factors ecological strategies and microbe microbe interactions he et al 2018 hou et al 2018 in this study the environmental factor of aeration patterns seemed to be more conducive to aob than aoa section 3 4 2 for aoa although environmental factors analyze suggested that lower concentrations of ammonia hou et al 2018 lower or higher temperature he et al 2018 and lower dissolved oxygen auguet et al 2012 might be more conducive to aoa growth there were also reporters demonstrated that salinity was the more important driver for aoa liu et al 2016b santos et al 2018 wu et al 2013 aob was considered more sensitive to parameters changes jin et al 2010 and among them high ammonium instead of salinity showed a more attractant driver for aob fukushima et al 2012 ye and zhang 2011 moreover the salinity reported in literatures generally did not exceed 30 gnacl l 1 to the authors best knowledge the existence and ammonia oxidation activity of aoa at salinity of 70 gnacl l 1 in sbbr is the first time to be discovered in this study the aoa amoa gene copies were high and the 16 s rrna sequencing of archaeal population could not detect any known aoa strains almost all unknown archaea so the results are not shown inferring that there were new special halophilic aoas that had never been discovered under this specific hypersaline condition 4 2 underlying causes of hypersaline denitrifying problems after salinity increased from 30 gnacl l 1 to 70 gnacl l 1 no3 n effluent increased from 7 97 2 13 mg l 1 to 18 26 3 05 mg l 1 this was the main reason for the tn removal efficiency decrease under hypersaline condition previous studies attributed the reason simply to the inhibition of denitrifying microorganisms by salinity lan et al 2018 shi et al 2012 whereas when carbon sources were not restricted 100 of denitrification efficiency still was obtained even at 10 salinity osaka et al 2008 in the batch test it was also proved that although the snrr was declined under ultra high salt nitrate could completely be degraded quickly with excess carbon source at the same time with long term aerobic acclimation the aerobic snrr in the aerobic sbbr was faster than the anoxic snrr indicating that the increase of oxygen supply was not the inhibitor of the denitrification process either in the cyclic experiment under aero 7 mode the nitrate gradually rose to 19 53 mg l 1 after the carbon source consumed suggesting the lack of carbon source led to insufficient denitrification although the influent c n ratio was between 10 16 bod5 tn 5 5 9 the probable reasons for insufficient carbon source in aero 7 compare to aero 3 mode were as follows 1 the complex macromolecules and refractory organics in the actual wastewater were difficult to be decomposed in response to ultra high salt concentrations castillo carvajal et al 2014 the degradation rate and the decomposition degree decline of complex organic matter might cause the carbon source to be more difficult to be utilized for denitrifying bacteria 2 the increased salinity induced the microorganisms to absorb and degrade more organic matter for synthesize energy and compatible solutes and then maintain their intracellular and extracellular osmotic pressure balance at high osmotic pressure russell and cook 1995 therefore after the salinity rose to 70 gnacl l 1 the demand of carbon for heterotrophic microorganisms in the sbbr increased significantly resulting in more intense competition for carbon sources in addition to organics for essential survival the amount of carbon sources that can be used for denitrification were greatly reduced 4 3 potential multiple pathways in efficient denitrifying process 4 3 1 denitrification in aerobic hypersaline sbbr under aerobic running mode combined with sulfur activity analysis and cyclic law figs 2 and 4 obvious sulfur cycle was observed the maximum observed reduction of so4 2 s concentrations were 60 68 72 88 mg d 1 of which 78 34 83 62 was re oxidized in batch test the reduced sulfate product during the feast phase the first 8 h combined with h in wastewater the ph of influent and sbbr was 5 2 5 9 and 6 3 6 7 respectively partially formed hydrogen sulfide gas 9 13 mg d 1 11 44 mg d 1 h2s s and was gradually dissipated by the aeration stripping the remaining sulfide might be electron donor for autotrophic denitrification or be directly oxidized take the high dissolved oxygen concentrations above 6 mg l 1 during stable phase the low sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification rate 1 69 0 35 mg l 1 h 1 and the low abundance of sulfur driven denitrifiers 2 23 into account it could be reasonably speculated that despite sulfur reduction products existed in the aerobic sbbr autotrophic denitrification had only a little contribution to nitrate removal so a certain amount of nitrate remained in effluent nitrate and nitrite removal in aerobic sbbr mainly rely on aerobic and anoxic heterotrophic denitrification 4 3 2 denitrification in modified hypersaline sbbr after change of the operation mode sulfur cycle was enhanced the highest observed reduction of so4 2 s concentrations added up to 71 75 99 84 mg d 1 of which 73 80 80 92 was re oxidized figs 2 and 4 in batch test by illumina miseq sequencing dominant srb rose from one genus desulfotignum to three genera desulfotignum desulfovibrio and desulfatitalea and its total abundance increased from 3 95 to 10 79 dominant sulfur driven denitrifiers rose from two genus arcobacter and thiohalobacter to three genera arcobacter thiohalobacter and thioalkalivibrio and its total abundance increased from 2 22 to 9 95 and the autotrophic snrr in intermittent aeration was 1 57 times that of in aerobic mode as revealed by activity test those results were all proven that performance of sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification and sulfate reduction were enhanced as anoxic time extended according to outlet sulfur components analyses in batch test fig s3 the reduced sulfate anaerobic 5 h finally converted to three kinds of sulfur compound gaseous hydrogen sulfide re oxidizing sulfate and elemental sulfur and these accounted for 12 21 19 81 73 80 80 92 and 3 26 7 52 of the maximum observed reduction sulfide respectively the reason for gaseous hydrogen sulfide produce was the same as that under aerobic running mode most of the sulfide produced at anaerobic phase was directly oxidized at the aerobic section so the abundance of conventional sob increased part of sulfide might be involved in autotrophic denitrification at the non aerated phase so the abundance of dnsob also elevated moreover a small amount of dissolved oxygen 0 5 mg l 1 was reported to enhance autotrophic denitrification process by weakening inhibition of sulfide on denitrifiers zhang et al 2019 in this system at the anoxic phase the residual dissolved oxygen by previous aeration might result in the early existence of micro aerobic environment and then be conducive to the sulfur autotrophic denitrification at the same time the elemental sulfur yield in the effluent increased under intermittent aeration combined with the nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra phenomenon exhibited by cycle experiment the appearance of element sulfur might be the reason that when nitrate content was insufficient as electron acceptor it would be reduced to gaseous nitrogen an et al 2010 or ammonia nitrogen dolejs et al 2015 eq 1 and 2 the production of elemental sulfur indicated that under the modified operation mode the sbbr not only had the ability of highly efficient nitrification and denitrification but also had the potential to remove high concentration sulfate and recover sulfur resources when treating sulfate rich wastewater 1 s2 0 4 no3 2 4 h s0 0 2 n2 1 2 h2o g 0 191 0 kj reaction 95 5 kj e 2 s2 0 25 no3 2 5 h s0 0 25 nh4 0 75 h2o g 0 98 0 kj reaction 49 0 kj e despite ultra high salt inhibit led to ordinary and some salt tolerant bacteria eliminated fig 5b a number of halophilic denitrifying bacteria including sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria succeeded to survival halophilic microorganisms can synthesize compatible solutes and accumulate them in the cell to resist high osmotic pressure environment hosseiniyan khatibi et al 2019 for example halomonas 74 77 in s1 22 91 in s2 the first dominant genus was reported to be able to synthesize a variety of compatible solutes such as ectoine hydroxyectoine nγ acetyldiaminobutyrate and l α glutamate roberts 2005 it is speculated that halophilic microorganisms synthesized compatible solutes in the sbbr and might also provide a portion of them to other microorganisms thus providing a guarantee for the survival of functional microorganisms under ultra high salt therefore under the improved mode a variety of denitrifying microorganisms with functions of aerobic anoxic heterotrophic denitrification endogenous denitrification and sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification were still detected as revealed by activity batch tests the hypersaline sbbr could perform these four pathways illumina miseq sequencing had proven existence of the four corresponding functional microbial groups fig 5b and table s6 they were all abundant genera 1 and were reported played important roles at saline or hypersaline wastewater treatment systems section 3 4 3 in cyclic experiment at phaseⅱ the continued decline of tn confirmed simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occurring the aerobic and anoxic heterotrophic denitrify pathways co exist at phase ⅳ the obvious accumulation of nitrate indicates that the system had no available carbon source to proceed simultaneously denitrification by contrast at phase ⅴ nitrate decreased as the sulfate increased theoretically reduce 13 10 mg l 1 of nitrate average concentrations of reduced nitrate in phase ⅴ by sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification will produce 56 14 mg l 1 of sulfate whereas the average concentrations of sulfate produced was only 25 61 mg l 1 it is speculated that in addition to sulfur autotrophic denitrification happened this time there were other denitrification paths it is worth noting that a denitrifying glycogen accumulating genus defluviicoccus 3 18 only detected in modified sample section 3 4 3 is able to utilize intracellularly pha as internal carbon source for denitrification wang et al 2008 a tentative inference on this result is that endogenous denitrification was also one of the denitrification pathways at this phase introducing the intermittent aeration process to achieve endogenous denitrification by pha was proven to be feasible in low c n wastewater treatment chen et al 2013 wang et al 2013 by this pathway the organics were efficiently utilized and provided sufficient carbon sources for denitrification wang et al 2013 taken together periodic laws indicated that the four pathways actually occurred in the sbbr fig 6 through the improvement of the operation mode multiple pathways by various functional flora could be realized under the super high salt stress efficient and rapid anoxic aerobic heterotrophic denitrification were the basis for successful hypersaline denitrification then the enhancement of sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification reduced the demand for carbon sources and the endogenous denitrification lifted the utilization efficiency of carbon together resolved the hypersaline denitrifying problem thus making a more efficient denitrification process treating hypersaline mustard tuber wastewater 5 conclusion by modified to intermittent aeration mode this study successfully realized efficient removal of nitrogen and carbon in sbbr treating hypersaline mustard tuber wastewater the main conclusions are as follows 1 a sulfur cycle of 73 80 80 92 sulfate was successfully developed in hypersaline sbbr sulfate reducing process at anaerobic phase provided electron donors for subsequent autotrophic denitrification solving the problem of lack of carbon sources for denitrifiers in hypersaline environment 2 the key to efficient nitrification in hypersaline environment is the existence of special halophilic nitrifiers the presence of aoa and its ammonia oxidation activity were observed the halophilic nitrosomonas halophila and aoa together ensured highly efficient nitrification in this study 3 despite severe inhibition of ultra high salt to the ordinary denitrifiers and some of salt torrent denitrifiers there were still abundant denitrification functional flora under specific conditions the multi path coupled denitrification process aerobic anoxic endogenous heterotrophic denitrification and sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification ensured the successful denitrification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

17937,this study first compared the efficiencies and mechanisms of the nitrogen removal in an aerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr treating mustard tuber wastewater from high salt 30 gnacl l 1 to ultra high salt 70 gnacl l 1 high efficiency maintaining of nitrification was observed despite of high bod5 tn 5 5 9 distinct denitrification decline for lack of carbon in response to salt stress was observed considering the high concentrations of sulfate in mustard wastewater and the existence of sulfur reducing bacteria srb and sulfur driven denitrifiers dnsob in the aerobic sbbr sulfate reduction sulfur autotrophic denitrification process is a feasible idea to solve this problem by modified to intermittent aeration mode sulfur cycle was developed in sbbr the average removal efficiency of cod tn reached 85 20 and 98 56 respectively by batch activity tests and microbial community analysis ammonia oxidation activity by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa was observed and high abundance of aoa arch amoa aob amoa 2 38 102 together with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob of nitrosomonas halophila 1 23 ensured the high efficient nitrification after running mode change specific sulfur driven no3 n reduction rate increased and the abundance of dominant srb and dnsob rose from 3 95 to 10 79 and 2 22 to 9 95 respectively the sulfate reducing process during anaerobic phase provided electron donors for subsequent autotrophic denitrification making outlet no3 n concentrations reduced from 18 26 mg l 1 to 1 93 mg l 1 the sulfur activity batch test showed that 73 80 80 92 of sulfate were circulation utilized and rest of them conversed to the gaseous h2s and s0 in addition to dnsob anoxic denitrifier of halomonas 22 91 aerobic denitrifier of phaeodactylibacter 2 75 and endogenous denitrifier of defluviicoccus 3 18 were also dominant heterotrophic bacteria all halophilic or halotolerant in the intermittent aeration sbbr batch activity tests and periodic laws have also verified the existence of corresponding denitrification pathways this study shows that the enrichment of special halophilic functional bacteria with multiple nitrogen removal pathways is a good idea for the efficient treatment of high concentrated hypersaline industrial wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords salinity biological nitrogen removal microbial community ammonia oxidizing archaea sulfur cycle 1 introduction industrial saline hypersaline wastewater generated from various industrial processes such as pickling industry mariculture industry petroleum industry tanneries and piggeries corsino et al 2016 2019 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2017a usually containing large amounts of organic compounds and nitrogen they are difficult to treat and threaten to the water environment with high efficiency and low cost biological treatment technology are preferred for practical engineering application however high concentrated inorganic salt ions can destroy the intracellular and extracellular osmotic pressure balance of microorganisms reduce enzyme activities and even cause microbial dehydration and death hosseiniyan khatibi et al 2019 uygur and kargi 2004 to overcome these problems the construction and performance of biological nitrogen and organic matter removal systems treating high salt wastewater under different control conditions treatment processes and salinity acclimation methods have been extensively studied liu et al 2019 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a researchers showed that the efficient degradation of organic matter could be achieved in the range of 0 70 gnacl l 1 nevertheless the problems of low nitrogen removal efficiency and unclear removal mechanisms have not been solved especially for practical hypersaline salinity 50 gnacl l 1 industrial wastewater corsino et al 2016 macedo et al 2019 shi et al 2012 nitrification is widely regarded as the limited step of nitrogen removal in high salt environment since ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are strict autotrophic with low metabolic capacity the energy that can be used to rebalance osmotic pressure impacted by salinity is negligible uygur and kargi 2004 at the same time salt ions directly inhibit enzymatic activity and metabolic system of aob and nob therefore high dissolved oxygen supply promoting metabolic activities and the special halophilic nitrifying bacteria groups may become the key to successful nitrification under high salt condition with the advantages of rich microbial population maintaining good flexibility and stability and the anaerobic anoxia aerobic microenvironment an aerobic sbbr has been successfully applied to biological nitrogen removal at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 in our previous study wang et al 2017a a stable ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency above 90 was obtained whether this system remains efficient treating hypersaline wastewater and which kind of functional flora can be responsible for hypersaline nitrogen removal are worth of further study compared with autotrophic nitrifying bacteria which are more sensitive to extreme environment heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria adapt to saline environment more easily fu et al 2019 lan et al 2018 for instance 100 nitrate removal efficiency was reported at 0 110 gnacl l 1 in several denitrifying reactors with sufficient carbon source miao et al 2015 osaka et al 2008 so efficient denitrification can be achieved theoretically by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in aerobic hypersaline biofilm system however in this kind of reactors denitrification decline after salinity exceeding 50 gnacl l 1 were commonly reported lan et al 2018 shi et al 2012 and this contradiction has not been reasonably explained one presumption is that the oxygen concentrations in hypersaline aerobic biofilm reactors is too high for successful nitrification so that the carbon source is consumed in advance and suppressed denitrification nevertheless this denitrification inhibit phenomenon also appeared in the hypersaline pickling wastewater treatment with high c n ratio 10 in our preliminary research and its internal reason is worth exploring for saline sewage treatment with low c n wang et al 2009 developed the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process efficient carbon and nitrogen removal was demonstrated at present the introduce of sulfur cycle promoting nitrogen removal has also been reported wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b in fact sulfate is widespread in saline industrial wastewater such as pickled wastewater and halophilic srb and sob also existed widely in such environment wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b therefore the establishment of the sulfur cycle may be a promising way to improve the denitrification efficiency in hypersaline wastewater treatment under particular hypersaline environment it is worth studying that whether sulfur cycle can be built and enhanced and which kinds of srb sob could be dominant in this study carbon and nitrogen removal processes under three running mode two aerobic running modes at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 and 70 gnacl l 1 and then a modified intermittent aeration mode at 70 gnacl l 1 were established in a sbbr treating high concentrated mustard tuber wastewater the main purpose is as follows 1 analyze the underlying causes of denitrification inhibition in conventional aerobic sbbr treating hypersaline wastewater 2 exploring appropriate operating mode to realize efficient hypersaline nitrification and denitrification 3 clarifying the underlying pathways and the key functional microorganisms for efficient hypersaline nitrogen removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater characteristics the influent was taken from a pickled mustard tuber factory in chongqing china two types of mustard tuber wastewater were generated from producing processes fig s1 1 pickling wastewater produced from three stage pickling processes containing salt concentrations of 100 200 gnacl l 1 cod of 10000 40000 mg l 1 and tn concentrations of 1000 3000 mg l 1 the quantity of it varied with the raw materials quality product requirements pickling temperature and time 2 processing wastewater produced from elutriation desalination and dehydration processes containing salt concentrations of 25 50 gnacl l 1 cod of 1800 3000 mg l 1 and tn concentrations of 80 300 mg l 1 with 5 7 m3 wastewater per ton of product they were both discharged to a mixed tank with a ratio of 1 7 1 2 5 pickling wastewater to processing wastewater for wastewater treatment in this plant in addition because of small quantity production of domestic sewage 0 5 2 of mustard tuber wastewater the plant also discharged it into the mixed tank the influent in this study was taken from the mixed tank the characteristics of the influent are presented in table 1 2 2 experimental set up and operation strategy the study was carried out in a sbbr the reactor consisted of polyester fiber packing and a circular glass vessel radius 15 0 cm height 20 0 cm with an effective volume of 2 l fig s2 the details of sbbr had been reported in previous paper wang et al 2017a dissolved oxygen was fed through an air pump from the bottom and the reactor was operated in a constant temperature chamber of 30 2 c 30 g of inoculated sludge were added to the reactor which was taken from a steady running sbbr treating pickled mustard tuber wastewater at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 for over one year the operating parameters and removal efficiency of the inoculated sbbr was as follows wang et al 2017a after 60 days of stable aerobic operation at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 aero 3 the salinity was gradually upgraded to 70 gnacl l 1 with a salinity unit of 10 gnacl l 1 and then operated for 90 days at salinity of 70 gnacl l 1 aero 7 and finally began to operate with the intermittent aeration mode intermit 7 the details of three stage operation modes were shown in table s1 2 3 analytical methods effluent water samples were collected at the end of each cycle analytical methods of nutrients c n s and other parameters do salinity etc were in supplementary materials of text s1 2 4 batch activity tests due to the anaerobic anoxia aerobic microenvironment in biofilm and the complicated composition of the mustard tuber wastewater including carbon ammonia nitrate and sulfate at the same time simultaneous conversions of the carbon nitrogen and sulfate might be occur therefore in order to investigate whether the microorganisms in the sbbr have specific nitrification and denitrification functions we have adopted different specific simulate water to conduct batch activity tests the nitrogen batch activity tests were divided into two separate parts the nitrification experiments testⅰ and denitrification experiments testⅱ table s2 exhibited the specific parameters descriptions testⅰwere aiming to determine the potential contribution of nitrification by aoa aob with without atu aob inhibitor testⅱ were aiming to determine the potential aerobic anoxic heterotrophic and sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification process sulfur activity batch test was mainly to detected percentage of sulfur cycle and sulfur components in effluent see the supplementary material text s2 for the specific procedure of these batch tests 2 5 microbial community analysis biofilm samples were collected by scraping the sludge from the biofilm carriers at day 60th 90th and 250th illumina miseq sequencing was used for bacterial communities analyzing the 16 s rrna genes were amplified with the primers 338f 806 r which targeting the hypervariable v3 v4 region q pcr was carried out by a stepone plus system real time pcr system applied biosystems usa aob amoa and arch amoa gene copies were quantified with the primers amoa 1f amoa 2r and amoa 26f amoa 416 r respectively specific steps were the same as described in wang et al 2017b 3 results 3 1 reactor performance from salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 to 70 gnacl l 1 elevated salts showed a significant effect on the nitrogen removal supplementary material text s3 table s3 under aero 7 mode the average concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in effluent were 3 07 mg l 1 0 54 mg l 1 and 18 26 mg l 1 respectively then intermittent aeration mode was applied to improve the sbbr s performance fig 1 shows the carbon nitrogen and sulfate performances under intermit 7 mode for 100 days despite the change of operation condition the degradation of organic matter was not significantly affected after the adaptation of first two stages the aerobic nitrification microorganisms had gradually adapted to the alternating aerobic environment in order to further enhance nitrogen removal efficiency and save aeration energy costs on the 30th day the operating mode was further changed table s1 the outlet nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were rapidly increased on the 41st day ammonia oxidizing capability recovered and nh4 n concentrations in effluent remained stable at 1 04 5 74 mg l 1 the no2 n and no3 n concentrations in effluent rose to the peak 21 22 mg l 1 and 18 92 mg l 1 respectively on the 31st and 33rd day respectively and then gradually decreased on day 42 effluent no3 n concentrations were stable below 2 00 mg l 1 at the same time the effluent concentrations of so4 2 was gradually reduced compared with the conventional aerobic operation mode the average effluent no3 n decreased from 18 26 mg l 1 to 1 93 mg l 1 under the modified strategy the average tn and so4 2 removal efficiencies were increased by 8 79 and 22 38 respectively in modified sbbr the problem of residue nitrate under ultra high salt was basically solved and the sulfate removal efficiency was also improved 3 2 cyclic experiment the nitrogen sulfate concentrations and cod variations in one cyclic experiment at aero 7 are depicted in fig 2 a significant feast and famine phase were observed after organic matter degradation famine phase the oxygen began to rise and nitrate and nitrite accumulated at the same time the reduced sulfur produced at feast phase was re oxidized and the sulfate content gradually recovered after 13 h of reaction the sulfate content was no longer rising and the denitrification also gradually stopped the residual ammonia and nitrite were all oxidized to residual nitrate 19 20 mg l 1 the performance under intermit 7 mode was different fig 2b at stageⅰ anaerobic 5 h organic matters were utilized and after dilution so4 2 concentrations decreased from 319 64 331 86 mg l 1 to 193 43 220 57 mg l 1 at stage ⅱ aerobic 3 h organic matters continued to be consumed dissolved oxygen gradually rose 0 3 67 mg l 1 and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occur at stage ⅲ anoxia 3 h biodegradable organic matters were exhausted and nitrate and sulfate were slightly reduced at stage ⅳ aerobic 3 h the dissolved oxygen rose back above 4 00 mg l 1 ammonia oxidation continued and the nitrate concentrations accumulated to 13 86 16 22 mg l 1 at stage ⅴ anoxic 3 h nitrate decreased to 0 59 1 57 mg l 1 at the 17th hour and the sulfate increased by 18 64 25 75 mg l 1 meanwhile ammonia concentrations rose to 5 44 6 81 mg l 1 at stage ⅵ 18 19 h ammonia oxidation process proceed and nitrate generated again which was then gradually removed in the final stage 3 3 batch activity tests due to the simultaneous conversions of the carbon nitrogen and sulfate as revealed by cyclic experiment it is difficult to directly verify the system s removal pathways therefore to explore the possible pathways in hypersaline environment comparative kinetic analysis among the three operational modes were conducted using specific simulate water 3 3 1 nitrification batch test there are three possible pathways for ammonia removal autotrophic nitrification heterotrophic nitrification and cell assimilation in our previous study there was no evidence for heterotrophic nitrification in the inoculated sbbr wang et al 2017 and the heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria were not detected so the autotrophic nitrification were mainly explored inhibit of ammonia oxidation in hypersaline environment was observed for evident decline of ammonia specific oxidation rate table s4 since aoa and aob were both present in reactor section 3 4 2 atu completely inhibit of bacterial ammonia monooxygenase slightly harmful to archaea was used to explore the contribution of aoa and aob the results showed that when activity of aob was inhibit ammonia oxidizing activities were still detected fig 3 a in aero 3 aero 7 and intermit 7 mode the ratio of ammonia specific oxidation rate after aob inhibition to that before was 0 63 0 59 and 0 42 respectively so it is speculating that the contribution of aoa to ammonia oxidation might be greater over 50 under aerobic conditions in addition in aero 3 aero 7 and intermit 7 mode the ratio of nitrite specific oxidation rate to that of ammonia was 0 49 0 85 and 1 27 respectively table s4 indicating that from saline to hypersaline due to the increase of oxygen supply the system s nitrification pathway gradually converted from short cut to full scale nitrification 3 3 2 denitrification batch test without carbon source limiting the hypersaline sbbr could achieve complete 100 nitrate removal efficiency from salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 to 70 gnacl l 1 the aerobic anoxic snrr decreased from 17 27 22 43 mg l 1 h 1 to 11 64 18 74 mg l 1 h 1 fig 3b indicating that ultra high salts still showed distinct inhibit to snrr despite of nitrate removal efficiency unaffected at the same time no matter under aerobic or intermittent aeration mode aerobic and anoxic denitrification were simultaneously present in the hypersaline sbbr as the anoxic time increased the ratio of anoxic to aerobic snrr increased from 0 81 to 1 61 indicating that dominating denitrification pathway gradually changed from aerobic to anoxic since dnsob was found in sbbr the expression of sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification was explored fig 3c no carbon was added in this batch test in absence of sulfide no degradation of nitrate was observed in contrast with sulfide addition the nitrate concentrations fell blow 1 mg l 1 at 21 h and 14 h in aero 7 and intermit 7 mode respectively indicating that sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification occur under both hypersaline condition as autotrophic denitrifying sob was not acclimated section 3 4 4 nitrate in sbbr at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 was hardly degraded 3 3 3 sulfur activity batch test fig 4 exhibits sulfur balance variation at 0 h 5 h and 24 h in one cycle under aero 7 and intermit 7 mode at the first moment initial sulfate were come from inflow and residual of last cycle after 5 anaerobic hours the maximum observed reduction of so4 2 s accounted for 21 90 2 98 and 44 05 8 87 of total initial sulfur under aero 7 and intermit 7 mode respectively at the end of running 78 34 83 62 and 73 80 80 92 of re oxidizing sulfate was observed under aero 7 and intermit 7 mode respectively thiosulfate and sulfite were both below 1 0 mg d 1 at the three moment among the final removed sulfate gas h2s s was 24 65 2 54 and 37 81 3 86 of the sulfur products in effluent under aero 7 and intermit 7 modes in batch test respectively fig s3 furthermore under intermit 7 mode there was 13 36 3 64 of the sulfate converted to s0 while the proportion of sulfur in the aerobic mode was only 4 50 2 50 and amount of thiosulfate and sulfide under both modes were small furthermore no sulfite was found 3 4 microbial community 3 4 1 bacterial communities to get deeper insight into the bacterial community in the sbbr system three representative biofilm samples s0 at aero 3 s1 at aero 7 and s3 at intermit 7 were analyzed by illumina miseq sequencing ace richness and chao richness of two hypersaline samples were slightly declined table s5 shannon s diversity index and simpson index revealed that diversity increased after operation mode modified form saline to hypersaline environment conventional strains were largely eliminated and the dominant genera of sl and s2 were both concentrated in halophilic bacteria see the supplementary material text s4 for detailed description 3 4 2 nitrifying microorganisms predominant genera related to nitrification and denitrification were displayed in fig 5 b and table s6 the relative abundance of aob and nob in aerobic saline and hypersaline samples were both less than 0 5 by contrast in s2 aob consisted of nitrosococcus 0 01 and nitrosomonas halophila 1 23 and nob consisted of nitrospira 1 24 and nitrolancea 0 41 meanwhile q pcr technology testified the amoa gene copies of aoa and aob table 2 ultra high salt produced severe inhibition of ammonia oxidizing microbes from salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 to 70 gnacl l 1 copies of arch amoa and aob amoa genes both decreased by an order of magnitude meanwhile when salinity roes the ratio of aoa aob amoa gene copies increased from 1 20 103 to 2 47 103 indicating that the salinity inhibition to aoa was less than to aob furthermore with the change of aeration mode the relative abundance of aob increased the ratio of aoa aob amoa gene copies declined from 2 47 103 to 2 38 102 after mode modified 3 4 3 denitrifying microorganisms denitrifying genera are shown in fig 5b and table s6 four kinds of denitrification genera were found at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 and those were all heterotrophic as salinity up to 70 gnacl l 1 the abundance of moderate halophilic denitrifying genus halomonas increased from 7 23 to 74 77 furthermore arcobacter 1 20 and thiohalobacter 1 02 with function of sulfur based autotrophic denitrifying became dominant after operation mode converted two other denitrifying genera defluviicoccus and thioalkalivibrio became dominant further description of sulfur based denitrifiers see section 3 4 4 defluviicoccus accounted for 3 18 in s2 species under this genus are denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms which uses intracellularly synthesized pha as internal carbon source for denitrification in intermittent aeration environment wang et al 2008 this genus was only dominant under intermittent aeration 3 4 4 sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfur oxidizing bacteria there were 7 kinds of srb detected table s7 in s1 the dominant srb with abundance of more than 1 was only desulfotignum 3 95 in s2 the dominant srb rose to three genera desulfotignum 6 93 desulfovibrio 2 47 and desulfatitalea 1 39 although these srb were also detected at salinity of 30 gnacl l 1 their abundances were all less than 1 all three srb are mesophilic bacteria and can utilize various organic substances as electron donor and carbon source for sulfate reduction among them desulfotignum plays an important role in the marine sulfur cycle schink et al 2002 the representative strain of desulfatitalea was found in bay sediments strains of desulfovibrio are moderately halophilic bacteria and can grow at salinity range of 0 5 11 0 there were 7 kinds of sobs detected in total table s7 the total abundance of sobs in s1 and s2 were 2 85 and 11 33 respectively in s2 three genera of dnsob thiohalobacter thioalkalivibrio and arcobacter were detected the sequences of the thiohalobacter gen in this study were mostly classified into thiohalo thiocyanaticus species level thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus is a glan negative aerobic moderate halophilic bacterium can grow in salinity ranging from 1 1 to 17 5 sorokin et al 2010 and it is one kind of strictly chemoautotrophic sob capable of oxidizing sulfides elemental sulfur tetrathionates and then reducing nitrates the abundance of this strain in s2 was 6 49 which was 5 47 more than that of aerobic systems it was also the third dominant genus in s2 thioalkalivibrio gen classified into thioalkalivibrio thiocyanodenitrificans species level in the test results is a typical dnsob and able to adapt to extreme environment berben et al 2015 and it was the first time this bacterium discovered in the hypersaline wastewater treatment system arcobacter was detected in a variety of sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification systems liu et al 2016a which is facultative anaerobic and capable of surviving under saline conditions 4 discussion 4 1 key functional microorganisms in efficient hypersaline nitrifying traditional non halotolerant aob and nob are significantly inhibited after salinity exceeding 10 gnacl l 1 gonzalez silva et al 2016 which was the core reason of nitrification failures under saline or hypersaline wastewater environment in most of previous literature aslan and simsek 2012 chen et al 2018 corsino et al 2016 it is reasonable to suggest that the key to successful hypersaline nitrification requires the participation of special halophilic nitrifying bacteria a certain number of nitrosomonas halophila aob and nitrospira nob table s6 were observed at salinity of 70 gnacl l 1 which were often reported as main nitrifying bacteria detected in saline and hypersaline wastewater treatment systems chen et al 2019 corsino et al 2019 liu et al 2019 xia et al 2019 although high sensitivity of nitrospira to salinity was reported xia et al 2019 but the special halophilic stains under this genus such as nitrospira marina were also widely present in saline environments keuter et al 2011 several species in nitrosomonas gen such as nitrosomonas halophila nitrosomonas marina and nitrosomonas europea are able to utilize ammonia under salt stress making them become main force for nitrification under high salt conditions koops et al 1991 different inoculums led to the varieties of aob for example nitrosomonas europea salt tolerant bacteria and can grow in a non salinity environment was one of the most common species reported in saline or non saline systems its inoculums were generally ordinary sewage sludge wu et al 2013 xia et al 2019 no literatures reported it presented at hypersaline condition indicating that this strain cannot complete hypersaline nitrogen removal nitrosomonas halophila detected at all samples in this study has an obligate requirement for salt nitrosomonas also the only detected the aob in seeding saline biofilm wang et al 2017a which determined nitrosomonas halophila came from the inoculums it had a higher abundance at 70 gnacl l 1 and is more suitable to help successful nitrification under ultra high salt compared to nitrosomonas europea in addition due to the limitations of detect technology most of the literatures only reported nitrosomonas and nitrospira at genus level chen et al 2019 corsino et al 2019 certain species performing successful nitrification at ultra high salt remains to be excavated compared with aob aoa are more resilient in extreme environments stahl and de la torre 2012 and were reported to be divergent in deep sea hypersaline basins merlino et al 2018 q pcr results showed that the number of aoa in the hypersaline system far exceeded aob no matter under aerobic or modified operation mode combined with the ammonia oxidation pathway experiment it is proved that the aoa played an important role in nitrification at salinity of 70 gnacl l 1 in recent years several reporters also found aoa existed in wastewater treatment plants and reactors jin et al 2010 park et al 2006 wu et al 2013 the important contribution of aoa to successful nitrification in saline and hypersaline environments should not be neglected although previous literatures fukushima et al 2012 santos et al 2018 and this study all indicate that high concentrations of inorganic salt ions inhibited aob and aoa the degree of inhibition to aoa and aob seemed to be different so far the competition and distribution of aoa and aob in saline wastewater reactors and habitat were still controversial consistent with most reports aoa exhibited more growth superiority and active ammonia oxidation activities than aob in medium and high saline environment he et al 2018 hou et al 2018 liu et al 2016b wu et al 2013 while there were still reports found that aob amoa gene copies was higher than that of aoa in saline nitrogen removing reactors jin et al 2010 ye and zhang 2011 the contradiction may be interpreted as that the distribution of aoa and aob community was a complex result of various environmental factors ecological strategies and microbe microbe interactions he et al 2018 hou et al 2018 in this study the environmental factor of aeration patterns seemed to be more conducive to aob than aoa section 3 4 2 for aoa although environmental factors analyze suggested that lower concentrations of ammonia hou et al 2018 lower or higher temperature he et al 2018 and lower dissolved oxygen auguet et al 2012 might be more conducive to aoa growth there were also reporters demonstrated that salinity was the more important driver for aoa liu et al 2016b santos et al 2018 wu et al 2013 aob was considered more sensitive to parameters changes jin et al 2010 and among them high ammonium instead of salinity showed a more attractant driver for aob fukushima et al 2012 ye and zhang 2011 moreover the salinity reported in literatures generally did not exceed 30 gnacl l 1 to the authors best knowledge the existence and ammonia oxidation activity of aoa at salinity of 70 gnacl l 1 in sbbr is the first time to be discovered in this study the aoa amoa gene copies were high and the 16 s rrna sequencing of archaeal population could not detect any known aoa strains almost all unknown archaea so the results are not shown inferring that there were new special halophilic aoas that had never been discovered under this specific hypersaline condition 4 2 underlying causes of hypersaline denitrifying problems after salinity increased from 30 gnacl l 1 to 70 gnacl l 1 no3 n effluent increased from 7 97 2 13 mg l 1 to 18 26 3 05 mg l 1 this was the main reason for the tn removal efficiency decrease under hypersaline condition previous studies attributed the reason simply to the inhibition of denitrifying microorganisms by salinity lan et al 2018 shi et al 2012 whereas when carbon sources were not restricted 100 of denitrification efficiency still was obtained even at 10 salinity osaka et al 2008 in the batch test it was also proved that although the snrr was declined under ultra high salt nitrate could completely be degraded quickly with excess carbon source at the same time with long term aerobic acclimation the aerobic snrr in the aerobic sbbr was faster than the anoxic snrr indicating that the increase of oxygen supply was not the inhibitor of the denitrification process either in the cyclic experiment under aero 7 mode the nitrate gradually rose to 19 53 mg l 1 after the carbon source consumed suggesting the lack of carbon source led to insufficient denitrification although the influent c n ratio was between 10 16 bod5 tn 5 5 9 the probable reasons for insufficient carbon source in aero 7 compare to aero 3 mode were as follows 1 the complex macromolecules and refractory organics in the actual wastewater were difficult to be decomposed in response to ultra high salt concentrations castillo carvajal et al 2014 the degradation rate and the decomposition degree decline of complex organic matter might cause the carbon source to be more difficult to be utilized for denitrifying bacteria 2 the increased salinity induced the microorganisms to absorb and degrade more organic matter for synthesize energy and compatible solutes and then maintain their intracellular and extracellular osmotic pressure balance at high osmotic pressure russell and cook 1995 therefore after the salinity rose to 70 gnacl l 1 the demand of carbon for heterotrophic microorganisms in the sbbr increased significantly resulting in more intense competition for carbon sources in addition to organics for essential survival the amount of carbon sources that can be used for denitrification were greatly reduced 4 3 potential multiple pathways in efficient denitrifying process 4 3 1 denitrification in aerobic hypersaline sbbr under aerobic running mode combined with sulfur activity analysis and cyclic law figs 2 and 4 obvious sulfur cycle was observed the maximum observed reduction of so4 2 s concentrations were 60 68 72 88 mg d 1 of which 78 34 83 62 was re oxidized in batch test the reduced sulfate product during the feast phase the first 8 h combined with h in wastewater the ph of influent and sbbr was 5 2 5 9 and 6 3 6 7 respectively partially formed hydrogen sulfide gas 9 13 mg d 1 11 44 mg d 1 h2s s and was gradually dissipated by the aeration stripping the remaining sulfide might be electron donor for autotrophic denitrification or be directly oxidized take the high dissolved oxygen concentrations above 6 mg l 1 during stable phase the low sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification rate 1 69 0 35 mg l 1 h 1 and the low abundance of sulfur driven denitrifiers 2 23 into account it could be reasonably speculated that despite sulfur reduction products existed in the aerobic sbbr autotrophic denitrification had only a little contribution to nitrate removal so a certain amount of nitrate remained in effluent nitrate and nitrite removal in aerobic sbbr mainly rely on aerobic and anoxic heterotrophic denitrification 4 3 2 denitrification in modified hypersaline sbbr after change of the operation mode sulfur cycle was enhanced the highest observed reduction of so4 2 s concentrations added up to 71 75 99 84 mg d 1 of which 73 80 80 92 was re oxidized figs 2 and 4 in batch test by illumina miseq sequencing dominant srb rose from one genus desulfotignum to three genera desulfotignum desulfovibrio and desulfatitalea and its total abundance increased from 3 95 to 10 79 dominant sulfur driven denitrifiers rose from two genus arcobacter and thiohalobacter to three genera arcobacter thiohalobacter and thioalkalivibrio and its total abundance increased from 2 22 to 9 95 and the autotrophic snrr in intermittent aeration was 1 57 times that of in aerobic mode as revealed by activity test those results were all proven that performance of sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification and sulfate reduction were enhanced as anoxic time extended according to outlet sulfur components analyses in batch test fig s3 the reduced sulfate anaerobic 5 h finally converted to three kinds of sulfur compound gaseous hydrogen sulfide re oxidizing sulfate and elemental sulfur and these accounted for 12 21 19 81 73 80 80 92 and 3 26 7 52 of the maximum observed reduction sulfide respectively the reason for gaseous hydrogen sulfide produce was the same as that under aerobic running mode most of the sulfide produced at anaerobic phase was directly oxidized at the aerobic section so the abundance of conventional sob increased part of sulfide might be involved in autotrophic denitrification at the non aerated phase so the abundance of dnsob also elevated moreover a small amount of dissolved oxygen 0 5 mg l 1 was reported to enhance autotrophic denitrification process by weakening inhibition of sulfide on denitrifiers zhang et al 2019 in this system at the anoxic phase the residual dissolved oxygen by previous aeration might result in the early existence of micro aerobic environment and then be conducive to the sulfur autotrophic denitrification at the same time the elemental sulfur yield in the effluent increased under intermittent aeration combined with the nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra phenomenon exhibited by cycle experiment the appearance of element sulfur might be the reason that when nitrate content was insufficient as electron acceptor it would be reduced to gaseous nitrogen an et al 2010 or ammonia nitrogen dolejs et al 2015 eq 1 and 2 the production of elemental sulfur indicated that under the modified operation mode the sbbr not only had the ability of highly efficient nitrification and denitrification but also had the potential to remove high concentration sulfate and recover sulfur resources when treating sulfate rich wastewater 1 s2 0 4 no3 2 4 h s0 0 2 n2 1 2 h2o g 0 191 0 kj reaction 95 5 kj e 2 s2 0 25 no3 2 5 h s0 0 25 nh4 0 75 h2o g 0 98 0 kj reaction 49 0 kj e despite ultra high salt inhibit led to ordinary and some salt tolerant bacteria eliminated fig 5b a number of halophilic denitrifying bacteria including sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria succeeded to survival halophilic microorganisms can synthesize compatible solutes and accumulate them in the cell to resist high osmotic pressure environment hosseiniyan khatibi et al 2019 for example halomonas 74 77 in s1 22 91 in s2 the first dominant genus was reported to be able to synthesize a variety of compatible solutes such as ectoine hydroxyectoine nγ acetyldiaminobutyrate and l α glutamate roberts 2005 it is speculated that halophilic microorganisms synthesized compatible solutes in the sbbr and might also provide a portion of them to other microorganisms thus providing a guarantee for the survival of functional microorganisms under ultra high salt therefore under the improved mode a variety of denitrifying microorganisms with functions of aerobic anoxic heterotrophic denitrification endogenous denitrification and sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification were still detected as revealed by activity batch tests the hypersaline sbbr could perform these four pathways illumina miseq sequencing had proven existence of the four corresponding functional microbial groups fig 5b and table s6 they were all abundant genera 1 and were reported played important roles at saline or hypersaline wastewater treatment systems section 3 4 3 in cyclic experiment at phaseⅱ the continued decline of tn confirmed simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occurring the aerobic and anoxic heterotrophic denitrify pathways co exist at phase ⅳ the obvious accumulation of nitrate indicates that the system had no available carbon source to proceed simultaneously denitrification by contrast at phase ⅴ nitrate decreased as the sulfate increased theoretically reduce 13 10 mg l 1 of nitrate average concentrations of reduced nitrate in phase ⅴ by sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification will produce 56 14 mg l 1 of sulfate whereas the average concentrations of sulfate produced was only 25 61 mg l 1 it is speculated that in addition to sulfur autotrophic denitrification happened this time there were other denitrification paths it is worth noting that a denitrifying glycogen accumulating genus defluviicoccus 3 18 only detected in modified sample section 3 4 3 is able to utilize intracellularly pha as internal carbon source for denitrification wang et al 2008 a tentative inference on this result is that endogenous denitrification was also one of the denitrification pathways at this phase introducing the intermittent aeration process to achieve endogenous denitrification by pha was proven to be feasible in low c n wastewater treatment chen et al 2013 wang et al 2013 by this pathway the organics were efficiently utilized and provided sufficient carbon sources for denitrification wang et al 2013 taken together periodic laws indicated that the four pathways actually occurred in the sbbr fig 6 through the improvement of the operation mode multiple pathways by various functional flora could be realized under the super high salt stress efficient and rapid anoxic aerobic heterotrophic denitrification were the basis for successful hypersaline denitrification then the enhancement of sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification reduced the demand for carbon sources and the endogenous denitrification lifted the utilization efficiency of carbon together resolved the hypersaline denitrifying problem thus making a more efficient denitrification process treating hypersaline mustard tuber wastewater 5 conclusion by modified to intermittent aeration mode this study successfully realized efficient removal of nitrogen and carbon in sbbr treating hypersaline mustard tuber wastewater the main conclusions are as follows 1 a sulfur cycle of 73 80 80 92 sulfate was successfully developed in hypersaline sbbr sulfate reducing process at anaerobic phase provided electron donors for subsequent autotrophic denitrification solving the problem of lack of carbon sources for denitrifiers in hypersaline environment 2 the key to efficient nitrification in hypersaline environment is the existence of special halophilic nitrifiers the presence of aoa and its ammonia oxidation activity were observed the halophilic nitrosomonas halophila and aoa together ensured highly efficient nitrification in this study 3 despite severe inhibition of ultra high salt to the ordinary denitrifiers and some of salt torrent denitrifiers there were still abundant denitrification functional flora under specific conditions the multi path coupled denitrification process aerobic anoxic endogenous heterotrophic denitrification and sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification ensured the successful denitrification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

17938,the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh during the chlorination of air saturated solutions of different hydroxyphenols hydroquinone resorcinol catechol gallic and tannic acids at ph 7 has been determined by the formation of phenol in presence of benzene in excess or 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid in presence of terephthalic acid formation of oh was only detected during the chlorination of o or p hydroxyphenols compounds that react with chlorine by electron transfer forming the corresponding semiquinones quinones in aerated solutions oxygen is reduced by the semiquinone to the superoxide radical o2 which reacts with hocl to oh compared to the studied o hydroxyphenols the lower reactivity of hydroquinone towards chlorine favours the reaction between chlorine and o2 and its oh formation potential is 50 times higher the extent of oh generated increased with the concentration of the hydroxyphenol and chlorine but the oh yield moles formed per mole of hydroxyphenol eliminated decreased due to the formation of the quinone that acts as o2 scavenger the yield was almost not affected by the ph 6 ph 7 5 whereas a strong impact of dissolved o2 was observed the oh production was null in absence of o2 and 2 5 3 times higher at oxygen saturated conditions compared to air saturated contrary to chlorination during bromination of hydroquinone oh was not formed which can be attributable to a much faster consumption of the oxidant with no chance for o2 to react with bromine formation of oh during the chlorination of different nom extracts srha srfa plfa and nordic lake nom and water from lake greifensee switzerland was also studied using terephthalic acid as oh scavenger for srha srfa and nordic lake nom all of allochthonous origin and presenting high electron donating capacity edc oh yields expressed as moles formed per mole of doc0 were between 1 1 and 2 0 similar to that of hydroquinone 1 5 for plfa and lake greifensee water autochthonous lower edc much lower oh yields were observed 0 1 0 3 both chlorination rate and edc the later favouring the formation stabilization of o2 seem to be key factors involved in oh generation during the chlorination of nom a mechanism for

tetranitromethane tpa terephthalic acid 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is typically the main sink for oxidants commonly applied in drinking water treatment wenk et al 2013 von gunten 2018 the oxidants react with electron rich functional groups such as phenolic moieties amines olefines etc partially leading to the formation of low molecular weight organic disinfection byproducts dbps lee et al 2007 bond et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 le roux et al 2016 among the different structures present in dom phenolic moieties are highly reactive towards many different oxidants the content of aromatic moieties in dom has been usually measured in terms of the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 weishaar et al 2003 however recently more specific measurements such as the electron donating capacity edc are being used as a proxy of the phenolic content aeschbacher et al 2012 walpen et al 2016 önnby et al 2018 although in general phenolic structures react with chlorine by electrophilic aromatic substitution eas forming chlorophenols recent studies have demonstrated that chlorination of ortho and para hydroxyphenols occurs via an electron transfer et with the formation of the corresponding quinones these reactions are likely responsible for the high initial hypohalous acid consumption by dom through et reactions criquet et al 2015 the chemistry of o and p hydroxyphenols in water is complex according to eyer 1991 hydroquinone hq can be oxidized by dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution through the following mechanism based on the hydroquinone semiquinone benzoquinone hq sq bq equilibria 1 h q o 2 k 1 o 2 s q 2 h 2 s q o 2 k 2 k 2 b q o 2 3 h q b q k 3 k 3 2 s q 2 h 4 h o 2 k 4 o 2 h 5 2 h 2 o 2 k 5 h 2 o 2 o 2 6 h o 2 o 2 k 6 h o 2 o 2 at ph 7 equilibrium 1 is almost completely displaced to the left k1 10 14 at ph 7 room temperature and air saturated eyer 1991 and the oxidation of hq to sq by o2 with generation of superoxide radical o2 is minimal if sq were formed it would be quickly oxidized by o2 to bq reaction 2 k 2 5 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and room temperature eyer 1991 under formation of more o2 bq could then react with hq k 3 58 m 1 s 1 k 3 8 107 m 1s 1 at ph 7 yamazaki and ohnishi 1966 and also with o2 k 2 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 eyer 1991 both reactions leading to sq with a pka 4 8 for equilibrium 4 bielski et al 1985 at ph 7 the formation of hydroperoxyl radical ho2 from superoxide protonation is expected to be very low whereas o2 disproportionation to h2o2 reaction 5 is slow leading to a certain stability of o2 in solution under these conditions sheng et al 2014 although the reaction between ho2 and o2 to ho2 has a high second order rate constant k 6 9 7 107 m 1 s 1 sheng et al 2014 at ph 7 this reaction is not favored due to the low concentration of ho2 0 6 of o2 in the above mechanism the possible reaction between hq and o2 was not considered for this reaction a second order rate constant of 1 7 107 m 1 s 1 was reported by rao and hayon 1975 in disagreement with the findings of nadezhdin and dunford 1979 among others who determined a second order rate constant of 1 7 104 m 1s 1 for the hq ho2 reaction since ho2 is a stronger oxidant than o2 the rate constant of hq o2 reaction is expected to be 1 7 104 m 1 s 1 according to the mechanism provided in reactions 1 6 superoxide radical will not be formed in absence of dissolved o2 and its steady state concentration will be very low in an aerated medium at ph 7 the presence of an agent that can oxidize hq to bq could promote the formation of sq through reaction 3 and hence the generation of o2 reaction 2 as stated before criquet et al 2015 determined that chlorine and bromine react with o and p hydroxyphenols hq among them via et with formation of the corresponding quinones in the case of hq the apparent second order rate constant of its reaction with free available chlorine fac sum of hocl and clo at ph 7 reaction 7 k 7 21 6 m 1 s 1 measured in terms of bq formation is comparable to that of reaction 3 hence depending on the experimental conditions as bq is formed some sq can be generated reaction 3 thereby promoting the formation of o2 also the oxidation of sq by hocl with formation of hocl reaction 8 cannot be ruled out 7 h o c l h q k 7 b q c l 8 h o c l s q k 8 b q h o c l according to candeias et al 1993 superoxide reacts with hocl to form oh reaction 9 k 9 7 5 106 m 1 s 1 determined by monitoring the decay of o2 long and bielski 1980 9 h o c l o 2 k 9 o h c l o 2 therefore if during hq chlorination sq and hence o2 is generated hydroxyl radicals could be formed through reaction 9 also if reaction 8 develops hocl would lead to oh formation through reaction 10 k 10 6 1 109 s 1 and k 10 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 jayson et al 1973 10 h o c l k 10 k 10 o h c l a previous study revealed that an initial bromination of natural organic matter nom mainly occurs through et instead of eas criquet et al 2015 hence with the presence of phenols being structural moieties of nom and in analogy to bromination formation of sq during chlorination of nom with a concomitant formation of hocl and or o2 and subsequently oh cannot be ruled out because of the short lifetime of hydroxyl radicals it is common to use scavengers to determine their formation flyunt et al 2003 rodríguez et al 2015 moreover if the product from the reaction between oh and a scavenger is known and can be measured the extent of the formation of oh can be estimated in addition it is also important to exclude reactions of the scavenger and or the reaction products with other substances present in the reaction medium reagents and or intermediates and or products therefore the following criteria need to be considered for the selection of a scavenger to quantify oh formation i the reactivity of the scavenger the organic surrogate hydroxyphenols or nom in this case and the oxidant chlorine in this study towards the radical species ii the nature of the products formed from the reaction between the scavenger and the radical stability reactivity towards oxidants etc iii easy detection and quantification of the products and iv the reactivity of the scavenger the transformation products and the organic surrogate towards the oxidant furthermore the scavenger has to be present in a sufficiently high concentration so that a fraction of 95 of the oh is scavenged even though the product from the reaction between the scavenger and oh is an indicator of the generation of this species there are some uncertainties on its quantification due to possible effects of the reaction conditions on the product yield moles of product formed per mole of oh generated in this study to investigate the formation of oh dimethyl sulfoxide dmso tert butyl alcohol tba

von sonntag 1979 cederbaum et al 1983 flyunt et al 2003 neither tba nor fal reacts with hocl the reactivity stability of other reaction products is unknown in aqueous solution and in presence of

formed by photolysis of aerated no3 to produce oh at ph 6 the molar phenol yield was 95 deister et al 1990 an average value of 85 has been adopted by different authors dong and rosario ortiz 2012

yield of about 85 in presence of dissolved oxygen as the only oxidant this radical intermediate reacts with o2 generating 2 hydroxyterephtalic acid htpa and o2 ho2 fang et al 1996 the molar yield of htpa based on moles of oh produced is 30 at ph 7 and 25 c and slightly increasing with increasing ph and temperature charbouillot et al 2011 the reactivity of the cyclohexadienyl type radical formed from the tpa oh reaction with o2 is 30 times lower than that of the radical formed from bz oh reaction fang et al 1995 because of that in presence of a stronger oxidant such as ircl6 2 the htpa yield can increase to up to 85 without formation of o2 ho2 fang et al 1996 since there are no data in literature about the reactivity of tpa nor htpa towards fac the corresponding apparent second order rate constants ph 7 and 25 c have been experimentally determined in this study the above mechanism reactions 1 10 suggests that oh might be formed during the chlorination of hydroxy phenolic compounds

obtain the desired concentrations in a final volume of 20 ml 22 ml amber glass vials in the case of lg water only the scavenger solution was added decreasing the ph from 8 37 to 7 85 after mixing different volumes of a fac stock solution were added to each vial while stirring and the vials were closed a control sample was always prepared under the same conditions but without adding fac the mixtures were allowed to react at room temperature for 1 72 h depending on the nature of the surrogate and the concentration of reactants and then analysed by hplc in some cases bromine instead of chlorine was added to establish the initial concentrations of all reagents the reactivity of the oh scavenger the organic surrogates and fac towards oh was taken into account to ensure that more than 95 of the generated oh f o h 0 95 is captured by the oh scavenger according to the following equation 11 f o h k oh scavenger oh scavenger k oh scavenger oh scavenger k oh hydroxyphenol hydroxyphenol k oh hocl hocl k oh clo clo where k oh scavenger represents the second order rate constant for the reaction between oh and the selected scavenger table 1 k oh hydroxyphenol the second order rate constant for the reaction between oh and the phenolic surrogate table 2 k oh hocl 1 21 109 m 1s 1 bulman et al 2019 and k oh clo 6 37 109 m 1 s 1 bulman et al 2019 are the second order rate constants for the reactions of oh with hocl and clo respectively the oh scavenger hydroxyphenol hocl and clo are the initial molar concentrations of each reactant the last two determined taking into account the ph of the medium equilibrium 12 and the concentration of fac fac hocl clo since the second order rate constants for the reactions between oh and h2po4 hpo4 2 are extremely low 2 104 and 1 5 105 m 1 s

ratios 2 5 and ph 7 5 50 mm tba 10 mm bz and 4 mm tpa were used to fulfill a 95 scavenging criteria for f oh according to equation 11 see table s2 in si for calculated values to investigate the participation of o2 a similar procedure was applied by adding different amounts of a 15 mm bq stock solution pure tnm or 20 mm mn ii as mncl2 4h2o in the latter case filtering the samples 0 45 μm nylon filter before the hplc analysis when needed the dissolved o2 concentration in the reaction medium was increased or reduced by purging with pure o2 or n2 respectively when bz was used bubbling was performed before adding the scavenger to avoid losses by stripping 2 3 2 determination of chlorine demand 72 h of nom extracts and lg water in a series of 22 ml amber glass vials 0 4 ml of 0 5 m pbs ph 7 and a fixed volume of nom extract stock solutions were added thereafter diluted to 20 ml with ultrapurified water after mixing to obtain different fac 0 doc 0 molar ratios a predetermined volume of a fac stock solution was added to each vial while stirring and the vials were closed the mixtures were allowed to react at room temperature in the dark and after 72 h the residual fac was analysed for lg water the procedure was the same but without adding pbs or ultrapurified water once the chlorine demand μm of each nom solution was determined the specific chlorine demand was calculated by dividing this value by the doc0 μm content 2 3 3 determination of the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions between chlorine and tpa htpa or bq at ph 7 10 mm pbs and 25 c apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of tpa htpa or bq with chlorine at ph 7 10 mm pbs 25 c were determined in excess of fac pseudo first order conditions see experimental conditions in fig s1 si by measuring the evolution of the parent compounds tpa and htpa by hplc dad fluorescence bq by the decrease of the absorbance at 247 nm in all cases but bq residual chlorine was quenched before the analysis by adding a few μl of a concentrated solution of na2s2o3 0 5 m for tpa experiments in excess of tpa 4 mm were also performed measuring the evolution of residual fac fac 0 45 μm for bq a competition kinetics method was also applied using phenol as competitor k fac phen 18 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 25 c gallard and von gunten 2002 in this case vials containing bq 50 μm and phen 5 10 μm 10 mm pbs ph 7 at 25 c were dosed with different volumes of a fac stock solution to obtain fac 0 in the range of 0 50 μm the samples were mixed and after a reaction time of 3 h the final concentrations of bq and phen were determined by hplc in all cases control samples were prepared in absence of chlorine all the experiments were carried out at least in duplicate 2 3 4 modelling of oh generation during chlorination of hq the kinetics of the formation of oh during hq chlorination at ph 7 25 c and air saturated conditions concentration of dissolved oxygen assumed to be 3 10 4 m was modeled by the tenua kinetic simulator http bililite com tenua 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of oh formation from hydroquinone chlorination 3 1 1 influence of the nature of the selected oh scavengers on hq chlorination in a first series of experiments chlorination of an air saturated hq solution 62 5 μm doc 4 5 mg l 1 at ph 7 pbs 10 mm and room temperature 22 2 c was carried out using different molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios in absence presence of the selected oh scavengers tba 50 mm bz 10 mm or tpa 4 mm fig 1 under these experimental conditions and as expected due to their low reactivity towards fac see table 1 and fig s1 si the scavengers had practically no effect on the extent of hq oxidation thus for a given fac 0 hq 0 ratio the extent of hq abatement after 1 5 h contact time fig 1a was very similar regardless of the presence of a scavenger furthermore the hq abatement solid symbols corresponded well with the bq formed open symbols i e the bq yields were close to 1 mole per mole of hq oxidized for fac 0 hq 0 ratios 1 5 a decrease in the final bq concentration is observed most probably due to its reaction with fac k fac bq 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 25 c obtained in this study fig s1 si also as the dose of fac increased the bq concentration was higher in presence of a scavenger which could indicate that under these conditions some bq abatement is prevented the apparent global stoichiometry of the chlorine hq reaction was close to 2 mol of chlorine per mole of hq consumed fig 1b which is consistent with previous observations criquet et al 2015 3 1 2 influence of the nature of the scavenger on oh quantification in fig 2 a the concentrations of fal from tba phen from bz or htpa from tpa formed from chlorination 1 5 h contact time of air saturated hq 62 5 μm solution ph 7 for different fac 0 hq 0 molar ratios are shown in absence of fac control fal phen or htpa were not detected the fal concentration was much lower than phen or htpa results that cannot be attributable to the low fal yield of the tba oh reaction 25 flyunt et al 2003 moreover the fal concentration initially increased with increasing molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios and decreased for ratios 0 5 these results indicate that for the tested conditions fal and acetone not shown are not stable in solution due to unknown secondary reactions therefore in the further experiments the formation of fal from tba was not considered to determine the formation of oh from hq chlorination for molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios 0 5 the phen and htpa concentrations were similar despite the different yields of phen from bz oh and htpa from tpa oh reported in air saturated and neutral ph conditions 85 and 30 respectively as it will be discussed in the kinetics section this could indicate that in presence of chlorine similarly to what was observed in presence of ircl6 2 fang et al 1996 the yield of htpa is higher than when using o2 as the only oxidant for fac 0 hq 0 1 the extent of phen formation was clearly lower than for htpa and it was negligible for fac 0 hq 0 2 undoubtedly these results are related to the reactivity of phen towards hocl which is about 100 times higher than for htpa k fac htpa 0 15 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and 25 c table 2 and fig s1 si the yield of phen or htpa as moles formed per mole of hq eliminated is shown in fig 2b for the lowest molar fac 0 hq 0 ratio yields of phen and htpa were 20 and 15 respectively as the fac 0 hq 0 ratios increased both yields decreased in case of phen to 5 for molar ratios 1 5 potentially due to the reaction of phen with chlorine for htpa as will be discussed later the decrease in the yield is probably related to a superoxide scavenging effect of the formed bq and remained almost constant at about 9 for molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios 0 5 for the conditions tested the compliance with equation 11 f o h 0 95 was also experimentally corroborated as shown in fig s2 si as an example where the influence of the tpa concentration on htpa formation from hq chlorination hq 0 62 5 μm fac 0 93 7 μm at ph 7 and room temperature is presented as observed a constant htpa concentration was determined when tpa 3 mm was added the fact that both phen and htpa are detected implies that under the applied experimental conditions chlorination of hq leads to the formation of oh moreover to suppress the oh tpa reaction the formation of htpa was also tested in presence of high tba concentrations the results fig s3 si indicate that tba drastically inhibited the formation of htpa therefore it is very likely that oh is the main species involved in htpa formation and the same can be assumed for phen when bz was used as a scavenger 3 1 3 influence of the initial concentration of hq the influence of the initial hq concentration on oh formation at ph 7 for tpa as oh scavenger is shown in fig 3 as presented in fig 3a for hq 0 15 μm the concentration of htpa increased almost linearly as fac 0 hq 0 increased whereas for higher hq 0 a linearity can only be observed for low fac 0 hq 0 ratios with htpa concentrations approaching a plateau for higher values the molar htpa yields based on moles of hq abated fig 3b decrease with increasing hq 0 approaching constant values at higher molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios similar results have been obtained for the phen yields when bz was used as scavenger fig s4 si these observations could be at least partly explained by the nature of the intermediates and or products formed during hq chlorination bq which reacts very fast with o2 k 2 109 m 1s 1 could compete with hocl k 9 7 5 106 m 1 s 1 for o2 thereby lowering the oh yield to test this bq 0 60 μm was added to samples containing 62 5 μm hq and 10 mm bz under these conditions bq did not impact the f oh of the scavenger table s2 si the mixtures were chlorinated and phen was measured fig 4 shows the evolution of the phen yields as a function of fac 0 hq 0 for experiments performed with without initial bq see also fig s5 si for low molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios and therefore low bq formation from hq chlorination the addition of bq clearly reduced the phen yield for increasing molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios this effect was compensated by the bq formed from hq oxidation hence it can be hypothesized that bq can become a superoxide scavenger reaction 2 lowering the oh yield in absence of fac control samples the concentration of hq varied very slightly during the reaction time considered between 1 5 and 4 h indicating that a contribution of reaction 1 hq autooxidation to o2 and sq formation was likely negligible this means that bq is mainly formed from hq chlorination reaction 7 allowing the formation of sq through reaction 3 depending on the experimental conditions the sq formed could be further oxidized to bq by o2 reaction 2 with concomitant generation of o2 and or hocl reaction 8 to hocl which could also contribute to oh generation through reaction 10 to test the potential role of superoxide radicals experiments were performed with tnm or mn ii as o2 scavengers unfortunately due to the reactivity of tnm and mn ii towards hq that at the conditions tested was oxidized to bq by these reagents in absence of chlorine their use as o2 scavenger seems to be impossible for this system for further information see text s2 si 3 1 4 influence of ph to test the influence of speciation of chlorine on oh production from hq chlorination experiments were performed in the ph range 6 7 5 pbs 10 mm hq 0 62 5 μm air saturated using tpa as oh scavenger at ph 7 5 hq is not stable in solution due to its fast oxidation by o2 james et al 1938 who 1994 criquet et al 2015 at ph 7 5 the formation of a bq 1 5 μm was determined in the control sample absence of chlorine attributable to partial hq autooxidation by o2 through reactions 1 2 fig 5 depicts htpa concentrations and yields at different ph values for different molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios a slight increase in the extent of htpa formation with increasing ph is observed for higher fac 0 hq 0 ratios fig 5a however since the extent of hq oxidized per mole of fac also slightly increased with increasing ph the differences in terms of htpa yield are negligible fig 5b in presence of oxygen as the only oxidant an increase of ph causes a slight increase in the yield of htpa formed from tpa oh from 28 at ph 6 to 33 at ph 7 5 at 25 c charbouillot et al 2011 although k 3 also increases with increasing ph 58 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 yamazaki and ohnishi 1966 570 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 4 eyer 1991 which could favor the formation of o2 an increase in k 7 is also expected counteracting this effect 3 1 5 influence of dissolved oxygen concentration in contrast to hocl reaction 8 the formation of o2 requires the presence of oxygen reaction 2 hence if this species is mainly responsible for oh generation during hq chlorination the formation of htpa or phen must strongly depend on the o2 concentration in addition it is important to note that in absence of other oxidants the mechanisms of htpa and phen formation from the tpa oh or bz oh reactions also require the presence of o2 mathews 1980 fang et al 1996 pan et al 1993 the reactions of the radical intermediates with o2 leading to phen or htpa could also produce molar equivalents of o2 which could contribute to the oh formation by reaction 9 in absence of o2 products different than htpa or phen could be formed all these aspects will be discussed in more detail in the section on reaction kinetics to investigate the effect of o2 air saturated o2 300 μm oxygen saturated o2 1200 μm and n2 saturated o2 purged by stripping with n2 solutions containing 62 5 μm hq were chlorinated ph 7 and room temperature using tpa as oh scavenger the results in fig 6 show that htpa is not formed in absence of o2 both htpa concentrations fig 6a and yields fig 6b increased with increasing o2 levels for oxygen saturated conditions the o2 concentration increased four fold compared to air saturation htpa concentrations were 2 3 times higher and the yield increased 3 4 times the latter due to the lower efficiency of hq abatement for increasing o2 concentrations fig 6c overall an increase in o2 favors the formation of o2 through reaction 2 and at the same time the chlorine consumption by reaction 9 from these results it seems quite evident that o2 participates in the generation of oh moreover the strong influence of o2 levels on htpa and phen generation would indicate that a contribution of hocl to oh production through reaction 8 is less important similar results were obtained for the influence of o2 on phen formation and yields when bz was used as oh scavenger however in this case to avoid bz volatilization the level of o2 in the samples could only be partially reduced or increased fig s6 si the possible contribution to oh formation from superoxide that can be generated from bz oh or tpa oh reactions will also be discussed in the kinetics section 3 1 6 bromination of hydroquinone similar to chlorine bromine oxidizes hq to bq with a significantly higher second order rate constant for this reaction at ph 7 compared to fac k hobr hq 6 4 104 m 1 s 1 vs k fac hq 21 6 m 1 s 1 criquet et al 2015 the second order rate constant for the reaction between hobr and o2 reaction 13 is also about three orders of magnitude higher than for hocl reaction 9 k 13 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 schwarz and bielski 1986 and leads to hobr that further evolves to oh through reaction 14 k 14 3 3 107 m 1 s 1 and k 14 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 zehavi and rabani 1972 and also to br and oh through reaction 15 k 15 4 2 106 m 1 s 1 and k 15 1 3 1010 m 1 s 1 zehavi and rabani 1972 ross et al 1998 13 h o b r o 2 k 13 h o b r o 2 14 h o b r k 14 k 14 o h b r 15 h o b r k 15 k 15 b r o h the experiments were performed at ph 7 pbs 10 mm air saturated with 62 5 μm hq 0 using 4 mm tpa as a scavenger and molar hobr 0 hq 0 ratios between 0 and 1 5 the apparent stoichiometry of hobr hq reaction was 1 1 fig s7 si in agreement with criquet et al 2015 in these experiments htpa was not detected a plausible explanation for this observation could be the much higher value of k hobr hq compared to that of k fac hq wherefore hobr would be quickly and totally consumed by hq with no chance to react with o2 so neither hobr nor oh would be generated in this reaction system 3 2 oh formation from chlorination of different hydroxyphenols at ph 7 the behavior of other hydroxyphenols cat res gal and tan was investigated to explore the applicability of our findings to a wider range of compounds their structures and reactivities towards different species fac oh and o2 are summarised in table 2 at ph 7 all of these compounds except res lead to the formation of quinones upon chlorination and have higher fac reactivities than hq criquet et al 2015 the experimental procedure was the same as for hq i e chlorination in 10 mm pbs air saturated at ph 7 using 4 mm tpa as scavenger with cat 0 res 0 or gal 0 being 62 5 μm and tan 0 6 25 μm hence doc0 as hydroxyphenol was 375 μm for cat and res and 475 μm for gal and tan relative htpa yields normalized to doc0 are shown in fig 7 a for comparative purposes htpa yields corresponding to hq0 62 5 μm doc0 375 μm are also included and were much higher than for the rest of the tested compounds squares right y axis in fig 7a in absence of fac control runs formation of htpa was negligible as expected htpa was not formed when res was chlorinated stars in fig 7a unlike the other selected hydroxyphenols due to the m position of the two oh substituents res chlorination proceeds through eas with chlorine addition instead of et criquet et al 2015 since there is no quinone semiquinone formation neither o2 nor hocl can be generated in contrast for cat gal and tan formation of htpa was detected although the yields were significantly lower than for hq again in line to what was proposed in the case of hq bromination a possible explanation could be the higher reactivity of these o hydroxyphenols with fac compared to hq table 2 since fac is consumed more quickly its reaction with o2 can take place to a much lower extent previously it was shown that the presence of borate buffer decreased the reactivity of o hydroxyphenols towards chlorine through the formation of a borate complex criquet et al 2015 to test if the reactivity of these compounds with chlorine is a key parameter for o2 formation solutions containing 60 μm cat were chlorinated at ph 7 in 10 mm pbs ph 8 in 25 mm pbs and ph 8 in 50 mm borate buffer with 4 mm tpa as oh scavenger fig 7b shows that the presence of borate leads to a much higher normalized htpa yield this supports the hypothesis that the rate of reaction 7 is important for generation of oh through reaction 9 taking into account the complexity of these reaction systems the reactivity between fac and the hydroxyphenol reaction 7 is probably not the only factor affecting oh formation for example both the relative position of the oh groups and the presence of electron donating withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring can affect the standard reduction potentials e0 of the quinone semiquinone pairs and therefore reaction 2 and the stability of o2 song and buettner 2010 to test this methylhydroquinone mehq with higher electron donating properties than hq due to the presence of the methyl group was chlorinated at ph 7 alone mehq 0 60 μm or in combination with hq mehq 0 hq 0 30 μm and the concentration of hq mehq and htpa were determined although the reactivity of mehq towards fac was higher than for hq as expected see fig s8 si the htpa yields were very similar and close to hq 0 60 μm fig s8 si these results can be explained by the influence of the methyl group on e0 quinone semiquinone and hence the ratio of k 2 k 2 for mehq k 2 1 1 106 m 1s 1 and k 2 k 2 1 4 10 3 whereas for hq k 2 5 104 m 1s 1 and k 2 k 2 5 10 5 song and buettner 2010 this means that the presence of the methyl group favors the formation stabilization of o2 counteracting the negative effect of its higher reactivity towards fac 3 3 oh formation from chlorination of different nom extracts at ph 7 the formation of oh during the chlorination of nom extracts srha srfa plfa and nl nom table s1 si was investigated in presence of tpa and the formation of htpa was measured after 72 h the doc 0 of the nom extracts was 375 μm srha 392 μm srfa 442 μm plfa and 248 μm nl nom the specific chlorine demand of each extract ph 7 72 h contact time was determined and resulted to be 0 49 0 34 0 38 and 0 36 moles of fac per mole of doc0 for srha srfa plfa and nl nom respectively fig s9 si the doc0 normalized yields of htpa mol mol are shown in fig 8 as a function of the specific chlorine dose the maximum htpa yields followed the order plfa 0 3 srfa 1 1 srha 1 6 nl nom 2 0 they were achieved for specific chlorine doses slightly higher than the corresponding specific chlorine demands which is due to some fac consumption by tpa under these conditions after reaching these maxima higher chlorine doses led to lower htpa yields probably due to its reaction with fac k fac htpa 0 15 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and 25 c this study it has to be mentioned that htpa was also formed in very low concentrations in absence of fac control runs this means that the nom extracts can generate oh in aqueous solution in the dark this effect was also observed previously during aeration of different anoxic lake waters and attributed to the development of fenton like reactions that involve hq sq and or fe ii minella et al 2015 after 72 h the htpa yields mol htpa mol doco of the control samples were about 2 orders of magnitude smaller but following the same sequence as for chlorination 0 002 plfa 0 006 srfa 0 02 srha 0 03 nl nom among the selected extracts plfa autochthonous nom presents the lowest suva254 edc aromatic c and phenolic content table s1 in si and references therein plfa has the lowest oh yield which seems to indicate that phenolic structures in nom are involved in oh formation during chlorination of nom with the exception of plfa the doc normalized htpa yields for the selected noms were close or even higher than for hq fig 7a thus in case hydroxyphenols in nom are the main source of oh during chlorination hq moieties with higher oh formation potential than hq must be present this points towards the presence of hq like structures in nom with lower reactivity with fac than hq thus allowing fac to react with o2 alternatively this could be explained by the presence or formation of quinone structures with higher k 2 and k 2 k 2 values than hq that is structures with low e0 quinone semiquinone favoring the formation stabilization of o2 also nom moieties different from phenols could be responsible for oh formation upon chlorination based on the information in table s1 si n containing structures are probably not involved since plfa has the lowest oh formation potential but contains 4 10 times more n than the other extracts and finally the higher the iron content the higher the amount of oh produced to this end a study by santana casiano et al 2010 carried out in seawater demonstrated that fe iii cat complexes are formed followed by fe iii reduction to fe ii and cat oxidation to sq with generation of o2 hence the enhancement of oh formation due to iron complexes in nom cannot be disregarded water from lake greifensee lg switzerland was also chlorinated doc0 250 μm ph 7 85 after the addition of tpa specific chlorine demand 0 22 moles of fac per mole of doc and the formation of htpa was measured in absence of fac control runs after 72 h contact time the molar doc normalized htpa yield was 0 003 the results obtained see fig s10 si indicate that dom in lg water was capable of producing oh when chlorinated however the maximum doc normalized htpa formation was low 0 1 mol mol doc0 1 similar to plfa also of autochthonous origin wenk et al 2011 and more than ten times lower than for hq and the other investigated nom extracts 3 4 modelling of the kinetics of oh formation during hq chlorination at ph 7 in the last part of the study the formation of oh during hq chlorination at ph 7 has been modeled based on the experimental results and the kinetic data available all the reactions considered and their rate constants are compiled in table s3 in si the kinetic model is based on reactions 1 3 and 7 assuming values of 10 7 and 107 m 1 s 1 for k 1 and k 1 respectively k1 10 14 eyer 1991 at ph 7 k 5 is very low sheng et al 2014 and from equilibrium 4 the contribution of reaction 6 can be disregarded see below also due to the strong effect of o2 concentration on htpa and phen formation see section 3 1 5 keeping in mind that reactions 8 and 10 are oxygen independent the contributions of these reactions to oh formation is expected to be minimal and they have not been considered for reaction 7 according to the experimental results a molar stoichiometry 2 1 fac hq has been assumed see fig 1b and also fig s11 si according to the pka of fac 7 49 equilibrium 12 at ph 7 the molar fractions of hocl and clo are 0 756 and 0 244 respectively since clo does not react with o2 long and bielski 1980 reaction 9 can be rewritten in terms of fac with an apparent second order rate constant k 9b 5 6 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 long and bielski 1980 9b f a c o 2 k 9 b c l o h o 2 in presence of bz

fang et al 1995 and p1bz another final product other than phen since the rate constant of chdhpt decrease is 800 s 1 fang et al 1995 by assuming a yield of 85 for phen and 15 for p1bz dong and rosario ortiz 2012 k 18 and k 19 values have been assumed to be 680 s 1 and 120 s 1 respectively in presence of tpa as oh scavenger the following reactions have been considered fang et al 1996 20 o h t p a k 20 p 1 t p a 21 o h t p a k 21 c h d t 22a c h d t o 2 k 22 a k 22 a c h d h p t 22b f a c 2 c h d t k 22 b 2 h t p a c l 23 c h d h p t k 23 h t p a o 2 24 c h d h p t k 24 p 2 t p a where p1tpa and p2tpa represent products different from htpa and chdt the cyclohexadienyl type radical formed when oh was added to the ortho position of tpa from the overall rate constant of the tpa oh reaction 4 4 109 m 1s 1 page et al 2010 and the corresponding yields 85 for chdt and 15 for p1tpa fang et al 1996 values of 0 66 109 m 1s 1 and 3 74 109 m 1 s 1 have been assigned for k 20 and k 21 respectively according to fang et al 1995 k 22a 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 and k 22a 3 4 103 s 1 whereas the rate constant of chdhpt decomposition reactions 23 and 24 is 390 s 1 by considering a global yield of 30 for htpa and 55 for p2tpa k 23 and k 24 values were assumed to be 138 s 1 and 252 s 1 respectively similarly to what was observed by fang et al 1995 during the tpa oh reaction in presence of ircl6 2 another possible scenario in which fac can also oxidize chdt directly and irreversibly to htpa without formation of chdhpt or o2 has been considered reaction 22b initially assuming the same rate constant for this reaction as for reaction 21 that is k 22b 3 74 109 m 1s 1 finally the reactions of fac and oh with other compounds have also been introduced in the mechanism reactions 25 28 and 29 34 respectively see table s3 si however since at the experimental conditions applied in this study f oh 0 95 for tpa and bz table s1 si reactions 29 34 are expected to be negligible a comparison between experimental and modeled final concentrations of phen and htpa for chlorination of hq 62 5 μm for different fac 0 hq 0 molar ratios is shown in fig 9 a symbols experimental results lines model calculations when tpa was used as oh scavenger the two possible scenarios that is without with participation of 22b were considered in the latter case initially assuming k 22b k 21 as indicated before in fig 9a a good agreement between experimental and modeled data is observed for phen whereas in the case of htpa its formation through the o2 dependent mechanism reactions 22a and 23 without participation of 22b clearly underestimate the experimental values fig 9a dotted line in contrast when reaction 22b is also considered the experimental calculated htpa agree within the experimental errors fig 9a solid line to further investigate the role of reaction 22b the two scenarios were tested for lower hq0 and fac0 conditions again initially assuming k 22b k 21 from the evolution of experimental and modeled htpa as a function of the fac concentration see fig s12 si it seems that for fac 0 1 mg l 1 reaction 22b solid lines is the main source of htpa and hence 0 85 moles of htpa are formed per mole of oh generated at lower fac doses 1 mg l the participation of the o2 based mechanism reactions 22a and 23 increases with htpa yields in the range of 30 85 the fact that in presence of fac the yield of htpa formation from the tpa oh reaction is higher than 30 would explain why the experimental concentrations and yields of phen and htpa were similar for fac 0 hq 0 molar ratios 1 see fig 2 the value for k 22b was optimized by various model calculations to minimize the differences between experimental and calculated htpa for different initial hq and fac concentrations the optimized value is k 22b 108 m 1s 1 see fig s13 si which was then applied for all model calculations in any case the yields of both htpa from the tpa oh reaction and phen from the bz oh reaction are lower than 100 this implies that the total formation potential of oh ohfp is higher than the measured phen or htpa concentrations the ohfps of hq 62 5 μm as a function of fac 0 hq 0 at ph 7 in presence of bz 10 mm or tpa 4 mm were modeled as shown in fig 9b the total production of oh in presence of bz dashed line is higher than for tpa solid line attributable to the o2 generated through reaction 18 the calculated relative contribution of o2 formed from reactions 18 or 23 to ohfp is also indicated in fig 9b reaction 18 dashed line reaction 23 solid line for tpa this contribution was minimal lower than 1 whereas for bz it decreased from 22 to 10 as the fac dose increased at the conditions tested and as expected the introduction of equilibrium 4 and reaction 6 in the mechanism did not cause any change the presence of fac and or bq in the reaction medium together with the low concentration of o2 and ho2 in solution 10 11 and 10 13 m respectively prevent the formation of ho2 through 6 the effect of the initial hq concentration on the experimental htpa yield that is for a given fac 0 hq 0 the htpa yield decreases with increasing hq 0 see fig 3 is also well predicted by the proposed mechanisms fig s14 si the negative effect of bq on ohfp experimentally observed see fig 4 is also corroborated by this mechanism as an example fig s15 si shows the modeled reduction of the ohfp during the chlorination of hq 62 5 μm ph 7 air saturated in presence of different concentrations of bq with 4 mm tpa or 10 mm bz as scavengers as observed the higher the initial bq concentration the higher the reduction of the ohfp for a given bq 0 this effect is attenuated by the bq formed from hq chlorination as the fac 0 increases thus the formation of bq from the hq chlorine reaction seems to be the main reason why for a given hq 0 ohfp and hence htpa or phen yields decreases as the dose of fac increases bq acting as o2 scavenger finally the role of dissolved o2 on oh generation and hence htpa formation is also well predicted by the proposed mechanisms as shown in fig s16 si for the experiments performed using tpa as oh scavenger fig s16a si shows that for o2 saturated conditions o2 1200 μm reaction 22b seems to be the main source of htpa although in this case the model for the optimized k 22b value dashed line slightly underestimates the actual htpa concentrations however the model fit is still very good considering the significant number of reactions fig s16b si shows the ohfp predicted at air saturated conditions ohfp air sat being o2 air sat 300 μm for hq 62 5 μm chlorination as a function of fac dose together with the evolution of the predicted ohfp ohfp air sat ratio for different o2 concentrations as observed for dissolved oxygen concentrations 50 100 and 200 μm that is o2 o2 air sat values 0 17 0 33 and 0 67 respectively the ohfp ohfp air sat is 0 21 0 39 and 0 71 whereas at o2 saturation conditions o2 o2 air sat 4 it results to be 2 5 3 in agreement with the experimental results the relationship between o2 concentration and the ohfp is not linear based on the findings of this study a mechanism for oh formation during hq chlorination is proposed in fig 10 the mechanism depicted in fig 10 shows that in a first step bq is formed from the reaction of hq with chlorine hq and bq react to two semiquinone radicals which then react with molecular oxygen to form superoxide radical finally hocl reacts with superoxide to form hydroxyl radical bq can also react with superoxide leading back to molecular oxygen therefore the bq concentration can affect the hydroxyl radical yield significantly 4 conclusions with the aid of different scavengers the generation of hydroxyl radical oh during the chlorination of o and p hydroxyphenols at neutral ph conditions has been demonstrated the mechanism of oh generation requires the formation of semiquinones capable of reducing dissolved oxygen to superoxide radical which further reacts with hocl to oh for p hydroxyphenols the oh yield in terms of moles formed per mole of doc0 was clearly higher and comparable to that of srha srfa and nl nom all these extracts presenting high electron donating capacities according to the results obtained a low reactivity towards chlorine and a high presence formation of quinone structures with low e0 favor the formation stabilization of o2 thereby increasing the potential of oh formation during the chlorination of nom from the combination of experimental results with kinetic modelling a mechanism for hydroquinone chlorination at ph 7 has been proposed which can explain the findings well declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17938,the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh during the chlorination of air saturated solutions of different hydroxyphenols hydroquinone resorcinol catechol gallic and tannic acids at ph 7 has been determined by the formation of phenol in presence of benzene in excess or 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid in presence of terephthalic acid formation of oh was only detected during the chlorination of o or p hydroxyphenols compounds that react with chlorine by electron transfer forming the corresponding semiquinones quinones in aerated solutions oxygen is reduced by the semiquinone to the superoxide radical o2 which reacts with hocl to oh compared to the studied o hydroxyphenols the lower reactivity of hydroquinone towards chlorine favours the reaction between chlorine and o2 and its oh formation potential is 50 times higher the extent of oh generated increased with the concentration of the hydroxyphenol and chlorine but the oh yield moles formed per mole of hydroxyphenol eliminated decreased due to the formation of the quinone that acts as o2 scavenger the yield was almost not affected by the ph 6 ph 7 5 whereas a strong impact of dissolved o2 was observed the oh production was null in absence of o2 and 2 5 3 times higher at oxygen saturated conditions compared to air saturated contrary to chlorination during bromination of hydroquinone oh was not formed which can be attributable to a much faster consumption of the oxidant with no chance for o2 to react with bromine formation of oh during the chlorination of different nom extracts srha srfa plfa and nordic lake nom and water from lake greifensee switzerland was also studied using terephthalic acid as oh scavenger for srha srfa and nordic lake nom all of allochthonous origin and presenting high electron donating capacity edc oh yields expressed as moles formed per mole of doc0 were between 1 1 and 2 0 similar to that of hydroquinone 1 5 for plfa and lake greifensee water autochthonous lower edc much lower oh yields were observed 0 1 0 3 both chlorination rate and edc the later favouring the formation stabilization of o2 seem to be key factors involved in oh generation during the chlorination of nom a mechanism for

tetranitromethane tpa terephthalic acid 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is typically the main sink for oxidants commonly applied in drinking water treatment wenk et al 2013 von gunten 2018 the oxidants react with electron rich functional groups such as phenolic moieties amines olefines etc partially leading to the formation of low molecular weight organic disinfection byproducts dbps lee et al 2007 bond et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 le roux et al 2016 among the different structures present in dom phenolic moieties are highly reactive towards many different oxidants the content of aromatic moieties in dom has been usually measured in terms of the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 weishaar et al 2003 however recently more specific measurements such as the electron donating capacity edc are being used as a proxy of the phenolic content aeschbacher et al 2012 walpen et al 2016 önnby et al 2018 although in general phenolic structures react with chlorine by electrophilic aromatic substitution eas forming chlorophenols recent studies have demonstrated that chlorination of ortho and para hydroxyphenols occurs via an electron transfer et with the formation of the corresponding quinones these reactions are likely responsible for the high initial hypohalous acid consumption by dom through et reactions criquet et al 2015 the chemistry of o and p hydroxyphenols in water is complex according to eyer 1991 hydroquinone hq can be oxidized by dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution through the following mechanism based on the hydroquinone semiquinone benzoquinone hq sq bq equilibria 1 h q o 2 k 1 o 2 s q 2 h 2 s q o 2 k 2 k 2 b q o 2 3 h q b q k 3 k 3 2 s q 2 h 4 h o 2 k 4 o 2 h 5 2 h 2 o 2 k 5 h 2 o 2 o 2 6 h o 2 o 2 k 6 h o 2 o 2 at ph 7 equilibrium 1 is almost completely displaced to the left k1 10 14 at ph 7 room temperature and air saturated eyer 1991 and the oxidation of hq to sq by o2 with generation of superoxide radical o2 is minimal if sq were formed it would be quickly oxidized by o2 to bq reaction 2 k 2 5 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and room temperature eyer 1991 under formation of more o2 bq could then react with hq k 3 58 m 1 s 1 k 3 8 107 m 1s 1 at ph 7 yamazaki and ohnishi 1966 and also with o2 k 2 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 eyer 1991 both reactions leading to sq with a pka 4 8 for equilibrium 4 bielski et al 1985 at ph 7 the formation of hydroperoxyl radical ho2 from superoxide protonation is expected to be very low whereas o2 disproportionation to h2o2 reaction 5 is slow leading to a certain stability of o2 in solution under these conditions sheng et al 2014 although the reaction between ho2 and o2 to ho2 has a high second order rate constant k 6 9 7 107 m 1 s 1 sheng et al 2014 at ph 7 this reaction is not favored due to the low concentration of ho2 0 6 of o2 in the above mechanism the possible reaction between hq and o2 was not considered for this reaction a second order rate constant of 1 7 107 m 1 s 1 was reported by rao and hayon 1975 in disagreement with the findings of nadezhdin and dunford 1979 among others who determined a second order rate constant of 1 7 104 m 1s 1 for the hq ho2 reaction since ho2 is a stronger oxidant than o2 the rate constant of hq o2 reaction is expected to be 1 7 104 m 1 s 1 according to the mechanism provided in reactions 1 6 superoxide radical will not be formed in absence of dissolved o2 and its steady state concentration will be very low in an aerated medium at ph 7 the presence of an agent that can oxidize hq to bq could promote the formation of sq through reaction 3 and hence the generation of o2 reaction 2 as stated before criquet et al 2015 determined that chlorine and bromine react with o and p hydroxyphenols hq among them via et with formation of the corresponding quinones in the case of hq the apparent second order rate constant of its reaction with free available chlorine fac sum of hocl and clo at ph 7 reaction 7 k 7 21 6 m 1 s 1 measured in terms of bq formation is comparable to that of reaction 3 hence depending on the experimental conditions as bq is formed some sq can be generated reaction 3 thereby promoting the formation of o2 also the oxidation of sq by hocl with formation of hocl reaction 8 cannot be ruled out 7 h o c l h q k 7 b q c l 8 h o c l s q k 8 b q h o c l according to candeias et al 1993 superoxide reacts with hocl to form oh reaction 9 k 9 7 5 106 m 1 s 1 determined by monitoring the decay of o2 long and bielski 1980 9 h o c l o 2 k 9 o h c l o 2 therefore if during hq chlorination sq and hence o2 is generated hydroxyl radicals could be formed through reaction 9 also if reaction 8 develops hocl would lead to oh formation through reaction 10 k 10 6 1 109 s 1 and k 10 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 jayson et al 1973 10 h o c l k 10 k 10 o h c l a previous study revealed that an initial bromination of natural organic matter nom mainly occurs through et instead of eas criquet et al 2015 hence with the presence of phenols being structural moieties of nom and in analogy to bromination formation of sq during chlorination of nom with a concomitant formation of hocl and or o2 and subsequently oh cannot be ruled out because of the short lifetime of hydroxyl radicals it is common to use scavengers to determine their formation flyunt et al 2003 rodríguez et al 2015 moreover if the product from the reaction between oh and a scavenger is known and can be measured the extent of the formation of oh can be estimated in addition it is also important to exclude reactions of the scavenger and or the reaction products with other substances present in the reaction medium reagents and or intermediates and or products therefore the following criteria need to be considered for the selection of a scavenger to quantify oh formation i the reactivity of the scavenger the organic surrogate hydroxyphenols or nom in this case and the oxidant chlorine in this study towards the radical species ii the nature of the products formed from the reaction between the scavenger and the radical stability reactivity towards oxidants etc iii easy detection and quantification of the products and iv the reactivity of the scavenger the transformation products and the organic surrogate towards the oxidant furthermore the scavenger has to be present in a sufficiently high concentration so that a fraction of 95 of the oh is scavenged even though the product from the reaction between the scavenger and oh is an indicator of the generation of this species there are some uncertainties on its quantification due to possible effects of the reaction conditions on the product yield moles of product formed per mole of oh generated in this study to investigate the formation of oh dimethyl sulfoxide dmso tert butyl alcohol tba benzene bz and terephthalic acid tpa were initially selected as scavengers however dmso that reacts with oh to form methane sulfinic acid msi k oh dmso 4 5 109 m 1 s 1 bardouki et al 2002 also has a

von sonntag 1979 cederbaum et al 1983 flyunt et al 2003 neither tba nor fal reacts with hocl the reactivity stability of other reaction products is unknown in aqueous solution and in presence of

reacts with o2 to mainly phenol pan et al 1993 the molar phenol yields were found in the range of 53 93 depending on the ph and o2 ho2 small amounts of various aldehydes and formic acid were also formed by photolysis of aerated no3 to produce oh at ph 6 the molar phenol yield was 95 deister et al 1990 an average value of 85 has been adopted by different authors dong and rosario ortiz 2012

yield of about 85 in presence of dissolved oxygen as the only oxidant this radical intermediate reacts with o2 generating 2 hydroxyterephtalic acid htpa and o2 ho2 fang et al 1996 the molar yield of htpa based on moles of oh produced is 30 at ph 7 and 25 c and slightly increasing with increasing ph and temperature charbouillot et al 2011 the reactivity of the cyclohexadienyl type radical formed from the tpa oh reaction with o2 is 30 times lower than that of the radical formed from bz oh reaction fang et al 1995 because of that in presence of a stronger oxidant such as ircl6 2 the htpa yield can increase to up to 85 without formation of o2 ho2 fang et al 1996 since there are no data in literature about the reactivity of tpa nor htpa towards fac the corresponding apparent second order rate constants ph 7 and 25 c have been experimentally determined in this study the above mechanism reactions 1 10 suggests that oh might be formed during the chlorination of hydroxy phenolic compounds however so far there is no experimental evidence for this process the main objective of this study was to determine whether chlorination of nom leads to oh formation and identify the main nom structures involved to this end different o m and p hydroxyphenols hydroquinone catechol resorcinol gallic and tannic acid and nom extracts humic and fulvic acids were chlorinated and the formation of oh and the role of o2 were investigated with the aid of multiple radical scavengers the influences of hydroxyphenol nom fac and dissolved oxygen concentrations as well as ph on oh production were also studied from the results obtained a kinetic model for oh formation during hydroquinone chlorination at ph 7 was developed to support the proposed mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals with

during chlorination 0 4 ml phosphate buffer pbs 0 5 m ph 6 7 5 and fixed volumes of hydroxyphenol solutions or nom solutions radical scavenger stock solutions and ultrapurified water were added to obtain the desired concentrations in a final volume of 20 ml 22 ml amber glass vials in the case of lg water only the scavenger solution was added decreasing the ph from 8 37 to 7 85 after mixing different volumes of a fac stock solution were added to each vial while stirring and the vials were closed a control sample was always prepared under the same conditions but without adding fac the mixtures were allowed to react at room temperature for 1 72 h depending on the nature of the surrogate and the concentration of reactants and then analysed by hplc in some cases bromine instead of chlorine was added to establish the initial concentrations of all reagents the reactivity of the oh scavenger the organic surrogates and fac towards oh was taken into account to ensure that more than

participation of o2 a similar procedure was applied by adding different amounts of a 15 mm bq stock solution pure tnm or 20 mm mn ii as mncl2 4h2o in the latter case filtering the samples 0 45 μm nylon filter before the hplc analysis when needed the dissolved o2 concentration in the reaction medium was increased or reduced by purging with pure o2 or n2 respectively when bz was used bubbling was performed before adding the scavenger to avoid losses by stripping 2 3 2 determination of chlorine demand 72 h of nom extracts and lg water in a series of 22 ml amber glass vials 0 4 ml of 0 5 m pbs ph 7 and a fixed volume of nom extract stock solutions were added thereafter diluted to 20 ml with ultrapurified water after mixing to obtain different fac 0 doc 0 molar ratios a predetermined volume of a fac stock solution was added to each vial while stirring and the vials were closed the mixtures were allowed to react at room temperature in the dark and after 72 h the residual fac was analysed for lg water the procedure was the same but without adding pbs or ultrapurified water once the chlorine demand μm of each nom solution was determined the specific chlorine demand was calculated by dividing this value by the doc0 μm content 2 3 3 determination of the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions between chlorine and tpa htpa or bq at ph 7 10 mm pbs and 25

conditions in fig s1 si by measuring the evolution of the parent compounds tpa and htpa by hplc dad fluorescence bq by the decrease of the absorbance at 247 nm in all cases but bq residual chlorine was quenched before the analysis by adding a few μl of a concentrated solution of na2s2o3 0 5 m for tpa experiments in excess of tpa 4 mm were also performed measuring the evolution of residual fac fac 0 45 μm for bq a competition kinetics method was also applied using phenol as competitor k fac phen 18 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 25 c gallard and von gunten 2002 in this case vials containing bq 50 μm and phen 5 10 μm 10 mm pbs ph 7 at 25 c were dosed with different volumes of a fac stock solution to obtain fac 0 in the range of 0 50 μm the samples were mixed and after a reaction time of 3 h the final concentrations of bq and phen were determined by hplc in all cases control samples were prepared in absence of chlorine all the experiments were carried out at least in duplicate 2 3 4 modelling of oh generation during chlorination of hq the kinetics of the formation of oh during hq chlorination at ph 7 25 c and air saturated conditions concentration of dissolved oxygen assumed to be 3 10 4 m was modeled by the tenua kinetic simulator http bililite com tenua 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of oh formation from hydroquinone chlorination 3 1 1 influence of the nature of the selected oh scavengers on hq chlorination in a first series of experiments chlorination of an air saturated hq solution 62 5 μm doc 4 5 mg l 1 at ph 7 pbs 10 mm and room temperature 22 2 c was carried out using different molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios in absence presence of the selected oh scavengers tba 50 mm bz 10 mm or tpa 4 mm fig 1 under these experimental conditions and as expected due to their low reactivity towards fac see table 1 and fig s1 si the scavengers had practically no effect on the extent of hq oxidation thus for a given fac 0 hq 0 ratio the extent of hq abatement after 1 5 h contact time fig 1a was very similar regardless of the presence of a scavenger furthermore the hq abatement solid symbols corresponded well with the bq formed open symbols i e the bq yields were close to 1 mole per mole of hq oxidized for fac 0 hq 0 ratios 1 5 a decrease in the final bq concentration is observed most probably due to its reaction with fac k fac bq 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 25 c obtained in this study fig s1 si also as the dose of fac increased the bq concentration was higher in presence of a scavenger which could indicate that under these conditions some bq abatement is prevented the apparent global stoichiometry of the chlorine hq reaction was close to 2 mol of chlorine per mole of hq consumed fig 1b which is consistent with previous observations criquet et al 2015 3 1 2 influence of the nature of the scavenger on oh quantification in fig 2 a the concentrations of fal from tba phen from bz or htpa from tpa formed from chlorination 1 5 h contact time of air saturated hq 62 5 μm solution ph 7 for different fac 0 hq 0 molar ratios are shown in absence of fac control fal phen or htpa were not detected the fal concentration was much lower than phen or htpa results that cannot be attributable to the low fal yield of the tba oh reaction 25 flyunt et al 2003 moreover the fal concentration initially increased with increasing molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios and decreased for ratios 0 5 these results indicate that for the tested conditions fal and acetone not shown are not stable in solution due to unknown secondary reactions therefore in the further experiments the formation of fal from tba was not considered to determine the formation of oh from hq chlorination for molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios 0 5 the phen and htpa concentrations were similar despite the different yields of phen from bz oh and htpa from tpa oh reported in air saturated and neutral ph conditions 85 and 30 respectively as it will be discussed in the kinetics section this could indicate that in presence of chlorine similarly to what was observed in presence of ircl6 2 fang et al 1996 the yield of htpa is higher than when using o2 as the only oxidant for fac 0 hq 0 1 the extent of phen formation was clearly lower than for htpa and it was negligible for fac 0 hq 0 2 undoubtedly these results are related to the reactivity of phen towards hocl which is about 100 times higher than for htpa k fac htpa 0 15 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and 25 c table 2 and fig s1 si the yield of phen or htpa as moles formed per mole of hq eliminated is shown in fig 2b for the lowest molar fac 0 hq 0 ratio yields of phen and htpa were 20 and 15 respectively as the fac 0 hq 0 ratios increased both yields decreased in case of phen to 5 for molar ratios 1 5 potentially due to the reaction of phen with chlorine for htpa as will be discussed later the decrease in the yield is probably related to a superoxide scavenging effect of the formed bq and remained almost constant at about 9 for molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios 0 5 for the conditions tested the compliance with equation 11 f o h 0 95 was also experimentally corroborated as shown in fig s2 si as an example where the influence of the tpa concentration on htpa formation from hq chlorination hq 0 62 5 μm fac 0 93 7 μm at ph 7 and room temperature is presented as observed a constant htpa concentration was determined when tpa 3 mm was added the fact that both phen and htpa are detected implies that under the applied experimental conditions chlorination of hq leads to the formation of oh moreover to suppress the oh tpa reaction the formation of htpa was also tested in presence of high tba concentrations the results fig s3 si indicate that tba drastically inhibited the formation of htpa therefore it is very likely that oh is the main species involved in htpa formation and the same can be assumed for phen when bz was used as a scavenger 3 1 3 influence of the initial concentration of hq the influence of the initial hq concentration on oh formation at ph 7 for tpa as oh scavenger is shown in fig 3 as presented in fig 3a for hq 0 15 μm the concentration of htpa increased almost linearly as fac 0 hq 0 increased whereas for higher hq 0 a linearity can only be observed for low fac 0 hq 0 ratios with htpa concentrations approaching a plateau for higher values the molar htpa yields based on moles of hq abated fig 3b decrease with increasing hq 0 approaching constant values at higher molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios similar results have been obtained for the phen yields when bz was used as scavenger fig s4 si these observations could be at least partly explained by the nature of the intermediates and or products formed during hq chlorination bq which reacts very fast with o2 k 2 109 m 1s 1 could compete with hocl k 9 7 5 106 m 1 s 1 for o2 thereby lowering the oh yield to test this bq 0 60 μm was added to samples containing 62 5 μm hq and 10 mm bz under these conditions bq did not impact the f oh of the scavenger table s2 si the mixtures were chlorinated and phen was measured fig 4 shows the evolution of the phen yields as a function of fac 0 hq 0 for experiments performed with without initial bq see also fig s5 si for low molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios and therefore low bq formation from hq chlorination the addition of bq clearly reduced the phen yield for increasing molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios this effect was compensated by the bq formed from hq oxidation hence it can be hypothesized that bq can become a superoxide scavenger reaction 2 lowering the oh yield in absence of fac control samples the concentration of hq varied very slightly during the reaction time considered between 1 5 and 4 h indicating that a contribution of reaction 1 hq autooxidation to o2 and sq formation was likely negligible this means that bq is mainly formed from hq chlorination reaction 7 allowing the formation of sq through reaction 3 depending on the experimental conditions the sq formed could be further oxidized to bq by o2 reaction 2 with concomitant generation of o2 and or hocl reaction 8 to hocl which could also contribute to oh generation through reaction 10 to test the potential role of superoxide radicals experiments were performed with tnm or mn ii as o2 scavengers unfortunately due to the reactivity of tnm and mn ii towards hq that at the conditions tested was oxidized to bq by these reagents in absence of chlorine their use as o2 scavenger seems to be impossible for this system for further information see text s2 si 3 1 4 influence of ph to test the influence of speciation of chlorine on oh production from hq chlorination experiments were performed in the ph range 6 7 5 pbs 10 mm hq 0 62 5 μm air saturated using tpa as oh scavenger at ph 7 5 hq is not stable in solution due to its fast oxidation by o2 james et al 1938 who 1994 criquet et al 2015 at ph 7 5 the formation of a bq 1 5 μm was determined in the control sample absence of chlorine attributable to partial hq autooxidation by o2 through reactions 1 2 fig 5 depicts htpa concentrations and yields at different ph values for different molar fac 0 hq 0 ratios a slight increase in the extent of htpa formation with increasing ph is observed for higher fac 0 hq 0 ratios fig 5a however since the extent of hq oxidized per mole of fac also slightly increased with increasing ph the differences in terms of htpa yield are negligible fig 5b in presence of oxygen as the only oxidant an increase of ph causes a slight increase in the yield of htpa formed from tpa oh from 28 at ph 6 to 33 at ph 7 5 at 25 c charbouillot et al 2011 although k 3 also increases with increasing ph 58 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 yamazaki and ohnishi 1966 570 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 4 eyer 1991 which could favor the formation of o2 an increase in k 7 is also expected counteracting this effect 3 1 5 influence of dissolved oxygen concentration in contrast to hocl reaction 8 the formation of o2 requires the presence of oxygen reaction 2 hence if this species is mainly responsible for oh generation during hq chlorination the formation of htpa or phen must strongly depend on the o2 concentration in addition it is important to note that in absence of other oxidants the mechanisms of htpa and phen formation from the tpa oh or bz oh reactions also require the presence of o2 mathews 1980 fang et al 1996 pan et al 1993 the reactions of the radical intermediates with o2 leading to phen or htpa could also produce molar equivalents of o2 which could contribute to the oh formation by reaction 9 in absence of o2 products different than htpa or phen could be formed all these aspects will be discussed in more detail in the section on reaction kinetics to investigate the effect of o2 air saturated o2 300 μm oxygen saturated o2 1200 μm and n2 saturated o2 purged by stripping with n2 solutions containing 62 5 μm hq were chlorinated ph 7 and room temperature using tpa as oh scavenger the results in fig 6 show that htpa is not formed in absence of o2 both htpa concentrations fig 6a and yields fig 6b increased with increasing o2 levels for oxygen saturated conditions the o2 concentration increased four fold compared to air saturation htpa concentrations were 2 3 times higher and the yield increased 3 4 times the latter due to the lower efficiency of hq abatement for increasing o2 concentrations fig 6c overall an increase in o2 favors the formation of o2 through reaction 2 and at the same time the chlorine consumption by reaction 9 from these results it seems quite evident that o2 participates in the generation of oh moreover the strong influence of o2 levels on htpa and phen generation would indicate that a contribution of hocl to oh production through reaction 8 is less important similar results were obtained for the influence of o2 on phen formation and yields when bz was used as oh scavenger however in this case to avoid bz volatilization the level of o2 in the samples could only be partially reduced or increased fig s6 si the possible contribution to oh formation from superoxide that can be generated from bz oh or tpa oh reactions will also be discussed in the kinetics section 3 1 6 bromination of hydroquinone similar to chlorine bromine oxidizes hq to bq with a significantly higher second order rate constant for this reaction at ph 7 compared to fac k hobr hq 6 4 104 m 1 s 1 vs k fac hq 21 6 m 1 s 1 criquet et al 2015 the second order rate constant for the reaction between hobr and o2 reaction 13 is also about three orders of magnitude higher than for hocl reaction 9 k 13 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 schwarz and bielski 1986 and leads to hobr that further evolves to oh through reaction 14 k 14 3 3 107 m 1 s 1 and k 14 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 zehavi and rabani 1972 and also to br and oh through reaction 15 k 15 4 2 106 m 1 s 1 and k 15 1 3 1010 m 1 s 1 zehavi and rabani 1972 ross et al 1998 13 h o b r o 2 k 13 h o b r o 2 14 h o b r k 14 k 14 o h b r 15 h o b r k 15 k 15 b r o h the experiments were performed at ph 7 pbs 10 mm air saturated with 62 5 μm hq 0 using 4 mm tpa as a scavenger and molar hobr 0 hq 0 ratios between 0 and 1 5 the apparent stoichiometry of hobr hq reaction was 1 1 fig s7 si in agreement with criquet et al 2015 in these experiments htpa was not detected a plausible explanation for this observation could be the much higher value of k hobr hq compared to that of k fac hq wherefore hobr would be quickly and totally consumed by hq with no chance to react with o2 so neither hobr nor oh would be generated in this reaction system 3 2 oh formation from chlorination of different hydroxyphenols at ph 7 the behavior of other hydroxyphenols cat res gal and tan was investigated to explore the applicability of our findings to a wider range of compounds their structures and reactivities towards different species fac oh and o2 are summarised in table 2 at ph 7 all of these compounds except res lead to the formation of quinones upon chlorination and have higher fac reactivities than hq criquet et al 2015 the experimental procedure was the same as for hq i e chlorination in 10 mm pbs air saturated at ph 7 using 4 mm tpa as scavenger with cat 0 res 0 or gal 0 being 62 5 μm and tan 0 6 25 μm hence doc0 as hydroxyphenol was 375 μm for cat and res and 475 μm for gal and tan relative htpa yields normalized to doc0 are shown in fig 7 a for comparative purposes htpa yields corresponding to hq0 62 5 μm doc0 375 μm are also included and were much higher than for the rest of the tested compounds squares right y axis in fig 7a in absence of fac control runs formation of htpa was negligible as expected htpa was not formed when res was chlorinated stars in fig 7a unlike the other selected hydroxyphenols due to the m position of the two oh substituents res chlorination proceeds through eas with chlorine addition instead of et criquet et al 2015 since there is no quinone semiquinone formation neither o2 nor hocl can be generated in contrast for cat gal and tan formation of htpa was detected although the yields were significantly lower than for hq again in line to what was proposed in the case of hq bromination a possible explanation could be the higher reactivity of these o hydroxyphenols with fac compared to hq table 2 since fac is consumed more quickly its reaction with o2 can take place to a much lower extent previously it was shown that the presence of borate buffer decreased the reactivity of o hydroxyphenols towards chlorine through the formation of a borate complex criquet et al 2015 to test if the reactivity of these compounds with chlorine is a key parameter for o2 formation solutions containing 60 μm cat were chlorinated at ph 7 in 10 mm pbs ph 8 in 25 mm pbs and ph 8 in 50 mm borate buffer with 4 mm tpa as oh scavenger fig 7b shows that the presence of borate leads to a much higher normalized htpa yield this supports the hypothesis that the rate of reaction 7 is important for generation of oh through reaction 9 taking into account the complexity of these reaction systems the reactivity between fac and the hydroxyphenol reaction 7 is probably not the only factor affecting oh formation for example both the relative position of the oh groups and the presence of electron donating withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring can affect the standard reduction potentials e0 of the quinone semiquinone pairs and therefore reaction 2 and the stability of o2 song and buettner 2010 to test this methylhydroquinone mehq with higher electron donating properties than hq due to the presence of the methyl group was chlorinated at ph 7 alone mehq 0 60 μm or in combination with hq mehq 0 hq 0 30 μm and the concentration of hq mehq and htpa were determined although the reactivity of mehq towards fac was higher than for hq as expected see fig s8 si the htpa yields were very similar and close to hq 0 60 μm fig s8 si these results can be explained by the influence of the methyl group on e0 quinone semiquinone and hence the ratio of k 2 k 2 for mehq k 2 1 1 106 m 1s 1 and k 2 k 2 1 4 10 3 whereas for hq k 2 5 104 m 1s 1 and k 2 k 2 5 10 5 song and buettner 2010 this means that the presence of the methyl group favors the formation stabilization of o2 counteracting the negative effect of its higher reactivity towards fac 3 3 oh formation from chlorination of different nom extracts at ph 7 the formation of oh during the chlorination of nom extracts srha srfa plfa and nl nom table s1 si was investigated in presence of tpa and the formation of htpa was measured after 72 h the doc 0 of the nom extracts was 375 μm srha 392 μm srfa 442 μm plfa and 248 μm nl nom the specific chlorine demand of each extract ph 7 72 h contact time was determined and resulted to be 0 49 0 34 0 38 and 0 36 moles of fac per mole of doc0 for srha srfa plfa and nl nom respectively fig s9 si the doc0 normalized yields of htpa mol mol are shown in fig 8 as a function of the specific chlorine dose the maximum htpa yields followed the order plfa 0 3 srfa 1 1 srha 1 6 nl nom 2 0 they were achieved for specific chlorine doses slightly higher than the corresponding specific chlorine demands which is due to some fac consumption by tpa under these conditions after reaching these maxima higher chlorine doses led to lower htpa yields probably due to its reaction with fac k fac htpa 0 15 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and 25 c this study it has to be mentioned that htpa was also formed in very low concentrations in absence of fac control runs this means that the nom extracts can generate oh in aqueous solution in the dark this effect was also observed previously during aeration of different anoxic lake waters and attributed to the development of fenton like reactions that involve hq sq and or fe ii minella et al 2015 after 72 h the htpa yields mol htpa mol doco of the control samples were about 2 orders of magnitude smaller but following the same sequence as for chlorination 0 002 plfa 0 006 srfa 0 02 srha 0 03 nl nom among the selected extracts plfa autochthonous nom presents the lowest suva254 edc aromatic c and phenolic content table s1 in si and references therein plfa has the lowest oh yield which seems to indicate that phenolic structures in nom are involved in oh formation during chlorination of nom with the exception of plfa the doc normalized htpa yields for the selected noms were close or even higher than for hq fig 7a thus in case hydroxyphenols in nom are the main source of oh during chlorination hq moieties with higher oh formation potential than hq must be present this points towards the presence of hq like structures in nom with lower reactivity with fac than hq thus allowing fac to react with o2 alternatively this could be explained by the presence or formation of quinone structures with higher k 2 and k 2 k 2 values than hq that is structures with low e0 quinone semiquinone favoring the formation stabilization of o2 also nom moieties different from phenols could be responsible for oh formation upon chlorination based on the information in table s1 si n containing structures are probably not involved since plfa has the lowest oh formation potential but contains 4 10 times more n than the other extracts and finally the higher the iron content the higher the amount of oh produced to this end a study by santana casiano et al 2010 carried out in seawater demonstrated that fe iii cat complexes are formed followed by fe iii reduction to fe ii and cat oxidation to sq with generation of o2 hence the enhancement of oh formation due to iron complexes in nom cannot be disregarded water from lake greifensee lg switzerland was also chlorinated doc0 250 μm ph 7 85 after the addition of tpa specific chlorine demand 0 22 moles of fac per mole of doc and the formation of htpa was measured in absence of fac control runs after 72 h contact time the molar doc normalized htpa yield was 0 003 the results obtained see fig s10 si indicate that dom in lg water was capable of producing oh when chlorinated however the maximum doc normalized htpa formation was low 0 1 mol mol doc0 1 similar to plfa also of autochthonous origin wenk et al 2011 and more than ten times lower than for hq and the other investigated nom extracts 3 4 modelling of the kinetics of oh formation during hq chlorination at ph 7 in the last part of the study the formation of oh during hq chlorination at ph 7 has been modeled based on the experimental results and the kinetic data available all the reactions considered and their rate constants are compiled in table s3 in si the kinetic model is based on reactions 1 3 and 7 assuming values of 10 7 and 107 m 1 s 1 for k 1 and k 1 respectively k1 10 14 eyer 1991 at ph 7 k 5 is very low sheng et al 2014 and from equilibrium 4 the contribution of reaction 6 can be disregarded see below also due to the strong effect of o2 concentration on htpa and phen formation see section 3 1 5 keeping in mind that reactions 8 and 10 are oxygen independent the contributions of these reactions to oh formation is expected to be minimal and they have not been considered for reaction 7 according to the experimental results a molar stoichiometry 2 1 fac hq has been assumed see fig 1b and also fig s11 si according to the pka of fac 7 49 equilibrium 12 at ph 7 the molar fractions of hocl and clo are 0 756 and 0 244 respectively since clo does not react with o2 long and bielski 1980 reaction 9 can be rewritten in terms of fac with an apparent second order rate constant k 9b 5 6 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 long and bielski 1980 9b f a c o 2 k 9 b c l o h o 2 in presence of bz

fang et al 1995 and p1bz another final product other than phen since the rate constant of chdhpt decrease is 800 s 1 fang et al 1995 by assuming a yield of 85 for phen and 15 for p1bz dong and rosario ortiz 2012 k 18 and k 19 values have been assumed to be 680 s 1 and 120 s 1 respectively in presence of tpa as oh scavenger the following reactions have been considered fang et al 1996 20 o h t p a k

p2tpa represent products different from htpa and chdt the cyclohexadienyl type radical formed when oh was added to the ortho position of tpa from the overall rate constant of the tpa oh reaction 4 4 109 m 1s 1 page et al 2010 and the corresponding yields 85 for chdt and 15 for p1tpa fang et al 1996 values of 0 66 109 m 1s 1 and 3 74 109 m 1 s 1 have been assigned for k 20 and k 21 respectively according to fang et al 1995 k 22a 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 and k 22a 3 4 103 s 1 whereas the rate constant of chdhpt decomposition reactions 23 and 24 is 390 s 1 by considering a global yield of 30 for htpa and 55 for p2tpa k 23 and k 24 values were assumed to be 138 s 1 and 252 s 1 respectively similarly to what was observed by fang et al 1995 during the tpa oh reaction in presence of ircl6 2 another possible scenario in which fac can also oxidize chdt directly and irreversibly to htpa without formation of chdhpt or o2 has been considered reaction 22b initially assuming the same rate constant for this reaction as for reaction 21 that is k 22b 3 74 109 m 1s 1 finally the reactions of fac and oh with other compounds have also been introduced in the mechanism reactions 25 28 and 29 34 respectively see table s3 si however since at the experimental conditions applied in this study f oh 0 95 for tpa and bz table s1 si reactions 29 34 are expected to be negligible a comparison between experimental and modeled final concentrations of phen and htpa for chlorination of hq 62 5 μm for different fac 0 hq 0 molar ratios is shown in fig 9 a symbols experimental results lines model calculations when tpa was used as oh scavenger the two possible scenarios that is without with participation of 22b were considered in the latter case initially assuming k 22b k 21 as indicated before in fig 9a a good agreement between experimental and modeled data is observed for phen whereas in the case of htpa its formation through the o2 dependent mechanism reactions 22a and 23 without participation of 22b clearly underestimate the experimental values fig 9a dotted line in contrast when reaction 22b is also considered the experimental calculated htpa agree within the experimental errors fig 9a solid line to further investigate the role of reaction 22b the two scenarios were tested for lower hq0 and fac0 conditions again initially assuming k 22b k 21 from the evolution of experimental and modeled htpa as a function of the fac concentration see fig s12 si it seems that for fac 0 1 mg l 1 reaction 22b solid lines is the main source of htpa and hence 0 85 moles of htpa are formed per mole of oh generated at lower fac doses 1 mg l the participation of the o2 based mechanism reactions 22a and 23 increases with htpa yields in the range of 30 85 the fact that in presence of fac the yield of htpa formation from the tpa oh reaction is higher than 30 would explain why the experimental concentrations and yields of phen and htpa were similar for fac 0 hq 0 molar ratios 1 see fig 2 the value for k 22b was optimized by various model calculations to minimize the differences between experimental and calculated htpa for different initial hq and fac concentrations the optimized value is k 22b 108 m 1s 1 see fig s13 si which was then applied for all model calculations in any case the yields of both htpa from the tpa oh reaction and phen from the bz oh reaction are lower than 100 this implies that the total formation potential of oh ohfp is higher than the measured phen or htpa concentrations the ohfps of hq 62 5 μm as a function of fac 0 hq 0 at ph 7 in presence of bz 10 mm or tpa 4 mm were modeled as shown in fig 9b the total production of oh in presence of bz dashed line is higher than for tpa solid line attributable to the o2 generated through reaction 18 the calculated relative contribution of o2 formed from reactions 18 or 23 to ohfp is also indicated in fig 9b reaction 18 dashed line reaction 23 solid line for tpa this contribution was minimal lower than 1 whereas for bz it decreased from 22 to 10 as the fac dose increased at the conditions tested and as expected the introduction of equilibrium 4 and reaction 6 in the mechanism did not cause any change the presence of fac and or bq in the reaction medium together with the low concentration of o2 and ho2 in solution 10 11 and 10 13 m respectively prevent the formation of ho2 through 6 the effect of the initial hq concentration on the experimental htpa yield that is for a given fac 0 hq 0 the htpa yield decreases with increasing hq 0 see fig 3 is also well predicted by the proposed mechanisms fig s14 si the negative effect of bq on ohfp experimentally observed see fig 4 is also corroborated by this mechanism as an example fig s15 si shows the modeled reduction of the ohfp during the chlorination of hq 62 5 μm ph 7 air saturated in presence of different concentrations of bq with 4 mm tpa or 10 mm bz as scavengers as observed the higher the initial bq concentration the higher the reduction of the ohfp for a given bq 0 this effect is attenuated by the bq formed from hq chlorination as the fac 0 increases thus the formation of bq from the hq chlorine reaction seems to be the main reason why for a given hq 0 ohfp and hence htpa or phen yields decreases as the dose of fac increases bq acting as o2 scavenger finally the role of dissolved o2 on oh generation and hence htpa formation is also well predicted by the proposed mechanisms as shown in fig s16 si for the experiments performed using tpa as oh scavenger fig s16a si shows that for o2 saturated conditions o2 1200 μm reaction 22b seems to be the main source of htpa although in this case the model for the optimized k 22b value dashed line slightly underestimates the actual htpa concentrations however the model fit is still very good considering the significant number of reactions fig s16b si shows the ohfp predicted at air saturated conditions ohfp air sat being o2 air sat 300 μm for hq 62 5 μm chlorination as a function of fac dose together with the evolution of the predicted ohfp ohfp air sat ratio for different o2 concentrations as observed for dissolved oxygen concentrations 50 100 and 200 μm that is o2 o2 air sat values 0 17 0 33 and 0 67 respectively the ohfp ohfp air sat is 0 21 0 39 and 0 71 whereas at o2 saturation conditions o2 o2 air sat 4 it results to be 2 5 3 in agreement with the experimental results the relationship between o2 concentration and the ohfp is not linear based on the findings of this study a mechanism for oh formation during hq chlorination is proposed in fig 10 the mechanism depicted in fig 10 shows that in a first step bq is formed from the reaction of hq with chlorine hq and bq react to two semiquinone radicals which then react with molecular oxygen to form superoxide radical finally hocl reacts with superoxide to form hydroxyl radical bq can also react with superoxide leading back to molecular oxygen therefore the bq concentration can affect the hydroxyl radical yield significantly 4 conclusions with the aid of different scavengers the generation of hydroxyl radical oh during the chlorination of o and p hydroxyphenols at neutral ph conditions has been demonstrated the mechanism of oh generation requires the formation of semiquinones capable of reducing dissolved oxygen to superoxide radical which further reacts with hocl to oh for p hydroxyphenols the oh yield in terms of moles formed per mole of doc0 was clearly higher and comparable to that of srha srfa and nl nom all these extracts presenting high electron donating capacities according to the results obtained a low reactivity towards chlorine and a high presence formation of quinone structures with low e0 favor the formation stabilization of o2 thereby increasing the potential of oh formation during the chlorination of nom from the combination of experimental results with kinetic modelling a mechanism for hydroquinone chlorination at ph 7 has been proposed which can explain the findings well declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

substantial seasonal fluctuation kitajima et al 2018 thus it has been proposed as a water pollution indicator kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009b the low concentration of virions in water samples makes them difficult to detect and requires the use of concentration methods during the sample preparation process different concentration approaches and sample preparation modifications can be used to increase the sensitivity of virus detection in wastewater haramoto et al 2018 hjelmsø et al 2017 convective interaction media cim monoliths have shown to be a fast and efficient tool for concentration of viral particles and free nucleic acids from high volume water samples pointing to cim monoliths as a promising tool for sample preparation in water virome studies gutiérrez aguirre et

mohiuddin and schellhorn 2015 metagenomic approaches reveal an unprecedented spectrum of viral nucleic acids in water samples however confirming the infectivity of the viruses discovered through sequencing analysis is essential to assess the relevance of such findings although infectious plant viruses have been isolated from various types of water e g rivers ponds irrigation and drainage canals in different locations worldwide jeżewska et al 2018 koenig 1986 mehle et al 2018 their survival and direct transmission through water is still largely unknown none of the studies to date have approached infectivity testing for plant viruses detected in wastewater most probably due to the low viral concentrations in combination with the low sensitivity and time intensive test plant bioassays used for the confirmation of plant virus infectivity to identify the potential of reclaimed water as a reservoir and transmission source for infective plant viruses we focus this study on the presence of plant viruses in influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp coupling cim monolithic chromatography concentration hts based shotgun metagenomics and biological infectivity tests fig 1 the combination of fast and efficient virus concentration and metagenomics enables us to study the population of plant viruses in wastewater highlighting the presence of important plant pathogenic viruses some of which were not previously detected in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and description of wwtp water samples 5 l of wwtp influents and effluents were sampled in summer 2016 and 2017 the selected wwtp located in central slovenia central wwtp domžale kamnik slovenia is a conventional two stage activated sludge plant upgraded with four

average daily inflow of approximately 20 000 m3 the facility collects municipal wastewater rainwater and industrial wastewater from five communities including households farms and industry the recipient of treated water from the plant is the kamniška bistrica river 2 2 concentration of wastewater samples for viral detection before concentration all samples were filtered through filter paper and cellulose acetate membranes with a pore size of 0 8 μm sartorius goettingen germany the concentration of each sample was done using cim quaternary amine qa 8 ml monolithic column bia separations ajdovščina slovenia on a fast protein liquid chromatography system akta purifier 100 ge healthcare chicago il usa influent and effluent samples were loaded at 80 ml min flow rate onto the cim qa column after the column loading and a washing step using 50 mm hepes buffer ph 7 we applied either i step gradient elution concentration approach supplementary fig 2a where an abrupt change in concentration of salt in the elution buffer was used or ii linear gradient elution concentration approach supplementary fig 2b where a gradually increasing concentration of salt in the elution buffer was introduced the protocol used for concentration of viruses was described previously gutiérrez aguirre et al 2011 2009 and outlined in detail in supplementary materials and methods 1 2 3 detection of viruses in wastewater samples using rt qpcr rt qpcr was used to assess the performance of chromatographic concentration procedures by determining the presence and viral nucleic acids recoveries of two selected plant viruses pmmov and cucumber green mild mottle virus cgmmv for step gradient elution inf16 step and linear gradient elution inf17 lin extraction of nucleic acids for rt qpcr analysis was done following the cim concentration from a 140 μl aliquot using a qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen germantown md usa rt qpcr was performed using published assays for pmmov haramoto et al 2013 and cgmmv zhao et al 2015 using agpath id one step rt qpcr kit life technologies carlsbad ca usa on a 7900ht fast real time pcr system applied biosystems foster city ca usa the average cq obtained for each elution fraction was normalized to the external luciferase control and used to estimate the virus recovery in the fractions relative to the original sample via the standard curve approach as described in previous studies balasubramanian et al 2016 gutiérrez aguirre et al 2009 2 4 metagenomic analysis of wastewater samples for the metagenomic analysis of wastewater samples nucleic acids

constructed using sequenase 2 0 thermo fisher scientific ma usa to obtain sufficient dna for library preparation a pcr amplification step using primer b 5 gtttcccagtcacgata 3 and amplitaqgold life technologies ca usa was performed pcr products were cleaned and concentrated using agencourt ampure xp beckman coulter in usa step gradient elution of samples from 2016 influent and effluent and 2017 effluent resulted in two elution fractions step e1 and step e2 that were separately extracted and sequenced for influent and effluent samples year 2017 nucleic acids from the linear gradient elution fractions selected in three different parts of the gradient were separately extracted before sequencing nucleic acids from the elution fractions were pooled together to three fraction groups lina linb

negative control of isolation was spiked with luciferase rna promega wi usa and was also sent for sequencing as a control for contamination in the isolation process and sample cross talk during sequencing we sent isolated rna or preamplification products for reverse transcription library preparation and sequencing to seqmatic llc fremont ca usa nextera xt dna library prep kit illumina san diego ca usa was used to construct the sequencing libraries which were shotgun sequenced using an illumina miseq illumina san diego ca usa resulting in 1 million to 3 4 million 2 250 bp reads per sample the remains of sequencing adaptors and primer sequences in the case of preamplified samples were trimmed and resulting reads were further filtered by using quality filter limit 0 01 no ambiguous nucleotide allowed and by size reads shorter than 25 bp were discarded in clc genomics workbench 11 qiagen bioinformatics redwood city ca usa in order to normalize samples according to the number of reads random subsampling was done and all the samples were normalized to 926 418 reads which was the minimum number of reads obtained among the samples trimmed size and quality filtered normalized reads subsets were exported from clc genomics workbench and compared for similarity with a complete ncbi nr database june 2018 using diamond buchfink et al 2015 with default parameters the results of the diamond classifications were used as an input for the taxonomic classification of the reads using megan metagenome analyzer version 6 12 0 huson et al 2016 with the following parameters for the lowest common ancestor algorithm min score 50 0 max expected 0 01 top percent 10 0 min support percent 0 min support 1 and lca percent 100 0 the obtained megan outputs were used to present an overview of taxonomic classification of the sequencing reads to compare viromes of differently concentrated samples single stranded ss rna viral reads were exported as a biom file differential heat trees of pairwise comparisons between samples were constructed by metacoder r package foster et al 2017 where the relationships between viral taxons presented in the trees are inferred from ncbi taxonomy hierarchy all plant infecting viruses whose genomes were detected in metagenomes of wastewater samples were listed in fig 3 and the corresponding viral species richness number of observed viral species was presented in table 1 the reads classified as plant viruses were manually inspected and some reads were manually reassigned or left unclassified on the species level to ensure the correct classification of plant virus species for this we used an approach that combined blastn ncbi nt database september 2018 and blastx ncbi nr database september 2018 determination of sequence identity to the most similar sequences in the respective databases with detailed review of each identified taxon reads with lower identity than defined by ictv species demarcation criteria were classified only on the genus level 2 5 infectivity tests and detection of infective plant viruses nicotiana occidentalis and nicotiana benthamiana plants that are susceptible to infection by a wide range of viruses including most of the detected tobamoviruses wylie et al 2015 were selected to test the infectivity of plant viruses after the concentration of wastewater samples using cim monolithic chromatography before inoculation of test plants selected elution fractions were desalted using pd 10 desalting columns ge healthcare il usa following the manufacturer s instructions and using inoculation buffer 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 6 with 2 pvp m 10000 sigma tokyo japan as an equilibration buffer inoculation of test plants with influent sample included eight separate linear gradient elution fractions f16 f23 and a negative control of inoculation where plants were inoculated only with inoculation buffer inoculation of test plants with effluent sample included a step gradient elution fraction ef17 step e1 and a negative control of inoculation supplementary fig 1 all fractions that were used for inoculation of test plants originated from the same concentration experiment as the fractions that were sequenced to ensure the consistency and comparability with metagenomics analysis supplementary fig 1 sampling concentration process desalting and inoculation of test plants were all done in the same day to avoid freezing of the samples and prevent the possible negative influence of concentrated substances on stability of viral particles we inoculated each selected elution fraction on eight plants of each tobacco species nicotiana occidentalis and nicotiana benthamiana we mechanically inoculated two to three leaves per plant using carborundum 0 062 mm vwr international radnor pa usa that was put on each leaf and the elution fraction approximately 50 μl per leave was gently rubbed over it additional plants inoculated only with inoculation buffer served as negative controls during the 4 week period following the mechanical inoculation we observed plants for the appearance of symptomatic changes we sampled plant material of non inoculated leaves every week after inoculation for detection of viruses using transmission electronic microscopy tem and small s rna sequencing analysis we collected pooled samples of leaf tissue non inoculated leaves approximately 1 cm2 per leave separately for different test plants inoculated with different cim fractions but exhibiting similar disease symptoms we also sampled non inoculated leaves of asymptomatic plants see supplementary fig 1 for details plant material samples were further used to isolate total rna using trizol reagent thermo fisher scientific ma usa as a control we included a sample of phaseolus vulgaris plant material infected with an endornavirus kindly provided by mike rott canadian food inspection agency dartmouth canada in the sequencing experiment srna deep sequencing was used as a generic detection method which enable detection of all the different types of viruses different rna and dna viruses infecting plants at the same time pecman et al 2017 total rna was sent to seqmatic llc fremont ca usa for srna library preparation tailormix mirna sample preparation kit seqmatic llc usa and sequencing the samples were multiplexed in one run of a nextseq illumina ca usa in 1 100 bp mode reads were further analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline for virus detection from hts data as described in a previous study pecman et al 2017 shortly trimmed and size selected reads were first mapped to the ncbi viral refseq database containing representatives of all viral genomes with completely sequenced genomes results of the mapping were manually inspected in parallel de novo assembly of trimmed and size selected reads was performed assembled contigs were compared for similarity against all viral sequences deposited in the ncbi genbank nt database using blastn and blastx the presence of suspected viral sequences was confirmed and complete consensus genome sequence was generated by mapping the reads to the complete viral genome sequences of the most similar viral isolates from the ncbi genbank database 2 6 tem analysis of viruses a sample 25 μl of the chromatographic fractions was applied to formvar coated agar scientific stansted uk carbon stabilized copper grids that were negatively stained using a 1 w v aqueous solution of uranyl acetate spi supplies west chester pa usa selected elution fractions from year 2 influent linear gradient fraction 17 and 18 were ultracentrifugated using airfuge beckman coulter inc brea ca usa onto tem grids before negative staining as described previously hammond et al 1981 all samples were examined with tem philips cm 100 netherlands as described in a previous study ruščić et al 2015 plant material of randomly selected plants inoculated with wastewater samples exhibiting distinctive symptoms was also examined using tem homogenates of plant material 20 μl were applied to formvar coated carbon stabilized copper grids and negatively stained using a 1 w v aqueous solution of uranyl acetate spi supplies pa usa followed by visualization by tem 3 results to examine the virome composition of wastewater we determined the metagenomes of the influent and effluent samples of a wwtp with special emphasis on plant viruses viruses were first concentrated using cim monolithic chromatography using either i step gradient elution concentration approach supplementary fig 2a or ii linear gradient elution concentration approach supplementary fig 2b after linear gradient elution we selected sequenced and separately analyzed three fraction groups based on the abundance of pmmov and cgmmv determined by rt qpcr supplementary fig 2b supplementary table 1 selected fraction groups cover the initial lina middle linb and final linc part of the elution gradient 3 1 overview of the highly diverse wastewater virome reveals understudied group of plant viruses to provide a trustworthy representation of viral species rodriguez brazzarola et al 2018 we analyzed hts data obtained by sequencing wastewater samples table 1 using reads based protein similarity searches taxonomic classification showed that a substantial fraction of reads in each metagenome 20 85 had no matches to known organisms table 1 fig 2 a this is similar to previous studies in which the majority of the sequences in wastewater samples had no similarity to known genes or proteins aw et al 2014 bibby and peccia 2013 a large fraction of reads 10 50 in influent and effluent samples belonged to bacteria fig 2a a smaller fraction of reads was classified as eukaryotic organisms and archaea fig 2a eukaryotic reads were abundantly present in non concentrated samples 5 13 and were classified mostly as genomes of plants aquatic arthropods rodents and enteric parasites data not shown in the same non concentrated influent and effluent samples the percentage of viral reads was less than 1 0 1 0 7 however it increased to 7 7 in cim concentrated samples table 1 fig 2a by analyzing metagenomes of the 12 samples table 1 we detected members of 56 different viral families including those with double stranded ds dna ssdna dsrna and ssrna genomes fig 2b examination of wastewater samples by tem also revealed a diversity of virion morphologies with filamentous viral particles and phage like virions supplementary fig 3 as previously shown the viromes of wwtp influents and effluents contain high abundance of dsdna bacteriophages crassphage sequences originally identified from metagenomic analysis of human feces dutilh et al 2014 were abundantly detected in influent samples supplementary table 3 gut associated bacteroides phage b124 14 that can be used to distinguish human gut contaminated metagenomes ogilvie et al 2018 and few reads of circular rep encoding single stranded dna cress dna viruses recently reported in wastewater effluents rosario et al 2019 were also detected in a majority of the samples supplementary table 3 important human pathogens such as norovirus sapovirus enterovirus rotavirus a hepatitis e virus and jc polyomavirus a were also detected in wastewater viromes supplementary table 3 pathogenic viruses of other hosts such as sequences of members of picornavirales order belonging to dicistroviridae family were detected mainly in influent samples we also detected bee viruses belonging to iflaviridae family and picornavirales order in both influent and effluent samples supplementary table 3 in influent inf17 linb and effluent ef17 linb linear gradient elution fractions we detected representatives of more than 20 families of ssrna viruses plant viral genomes mostly consist of ssrna 75 of all plant viruses hull and bustamante 1998 and were therefore mostly detected in analyzed wastewater samples as sequences classified as ssrna viruses with exception of the dsrna pepper cryptic virus fig 3 the most commonly found viruses recovered before and after wastewater treatment belonged to the family virgaviridae with all of the reads corresponding to the tobamovirus genus fig 2c most abundantly represented by sequences of pmmov tobacco mild green mosaic virus tmgmv tomato mosaic virus tomv and cgmmv fig 3 we also detected sequences of tomato brown rugose fruit virus tobrfv which was not found in the country before and is an emerging tobamovirus that has recently brought concern to plant health authorities worldwide representatives of less abundant families such as potyviridae betaflexiviridae and tymoviridae were mostly present in the influent samples and were rarely detected after the wastewater treatment in the effluent samples fig 2c sequences belonging to bromoviridae family were detected abundantly in samples from 2016 and only few reads were detected in samples from 2017 fig 2c whilst tobamoviruses were numerically dominant plant viruses in the samples fig 2c the list fig 3 of detected potentially pathogenic plant viruses includes 47 species from 19 genera including the economically important viruses such as cucumber mosaic virus cmv potato virus y pvy and pepino mosaic virus pepmv with in depth analysis of reads assigned to plant viral families sequences with low similarity to known plant viruses were also detected that could only be classified at the genus level and probably represent previously undescribed viral species fig 3 3 2 optimized viral concentration enables more detailed insight into diversity of plant viruses while hts is a powerful tool for uncovering viruses in the environment sample and molecular processing steps can alter the distribution of viral groups in the concentrated samples this is why we have compared non concentrated and differently concentrated wastewater samples we analyzed fractions obtained by either step gradient elution or linear gradient elution with rt qpcr for presence and relative concentrations of two tobamoviruses pmmov cgmmv calculated their recoveries supplementary fig 2 and compared the virome composition of differently concentrated samples we were able to efficiently concentrate pmmov and cgmmv for approximately two orders of magnitude according to rt qpcr results supplementary fig 2 supplementary table 1 supplementary table 2 we observed a higher fraction of viral reads in both step linear gradient concentrated influent and effluent samples compared to non concentrated ones table 1 fig 2a the enrichment for viral sequences was most noticeable in linb linear gradient samples table 1 fig 2a the fractions at the peak of absorbance linb have very high recoveries according to rt qpcr for selected tobamoviruses cgmmv and pmmov and contain the highest number of reads belonging to ssrna viruses fig 2b inf17 linb ef17 linb mostly due to the high abundance of viral reads classified as tobamoviruses fig 2c next we aimed to get a detailed insight into the plant virus abundance and diversity differences between different concentrations of the same sample thus we visualized pairwise comparisons of taxa abundances for ssrna viral reads of differently concentrated effluent sample from year 2017 as differential abundance heat trees fig 4 overall enrichment of virgaviridae family in ef17 linb effluent sample was pronounced fig 4 in summary we detected higher number of plant viral species in concentrated influent and effluent samples compared to non concentrated ones especially in linb fractions table 1 both concentration approaches step and linear allowed us to focus on the diversity of ssrna viruses with the linear gradient having the potential to study specific viral groups namely tobamoviruses in more detail 3 3 plant viruses in wastewater are infective and survive wastewater treatment to determine if the plant viruses detected by hts have a potential to be transmitted to plants by wastewater we performed biological infectivity tests inoculation with non concentrated wastewater in a preliminary experiment resulted in no detectable infection results not shown therefore in subsequent experiments we mechanically inoculated test plants using fractions concentrated by either linear influent or step effluent gradient elution and monitored the plants for symptom development using srna hts a non targeted plant virus detection approach we detected high number of reads assigned to tobamoviruses in pools of symptomatic and also asymptomatic plants table 2 complete genome sequences of detected viruses were covered by srna reads and consensus viral genomes of infecting viruses have been reconstructed four weeks after inoculation with influent linear gradient elution fractions from year 2017 see supplementary fig 1 some n benthamiana plants showed reduction in size curling and mottling of the leaves fig 5 a srna sequencing of the pooled plant samples with similar symptoms table 2 identified pmmov in the pool n occidentalis plants inoculated with the same fractions showed two different types of symptomatic changes again we confirmed pmmov infection in pool of n occidentalis samples with the symptoms of curling and mottling fig 5b table 2 moreover in the pool of n occidentalis plants exhibiting curling and necrotic spots fig 5c table 2 we detected mixed infection with pmmov and tomv finally also in the pool of n occidentalis plants not showing any distinct disease symptoms at the time of sampling we detected pmmov table 2 to assess the effect of the wastewater treatment on plant virus infectivity we also inoculated test plants with the effluent of the wwtp from year 2017 which is released directly into the river for mechanical inoculation we used step gradient elution fraction e1 for details see supplementary fig 1 n benthamiana plants again showed disease symptoms with reduction of the size of the plant and curling which were linked with pmmov infection fig 5d table 2 using srna sequencing of pooled symptomatic plant material additionally a pool of n occidentalis plants with mosaic symptoms fig 5e as well as pool of asymptomatic n benthamiana plants were shown to be infected with tmgmv table 2 all of the influent and effluent fractions that successfully infected test plants contained high number of reads of the detected infective viruses fig 3 tem examination of symptomatic plant material samples revealed the presence of filamentous virus particles of about 300 nm in length typical for tobamoviruses fig 5f and g 4 discussion in this study we explore the diversity of viruses in wastewater focusing on highly economically relevant ssrna plant viruses we described the presence of such viruses in influent and effluent samples of wwtp and confirmed the infectivity of some plant viruses thus proving their biological significance in wastewater these results implicate the flux of infective pathogenic plant viruses from anthropogenic environments into environmental waters and open important questions about the role of wastewater in the spread of viral diseases of plants in this study we detected members of 11 families of plant pathogenic ssrna viruses fig 3 tobamoviruses which were the most abundant plant viruses detected in analyzed samples are considered a major risk to a range of agriculturally important plant species belonging to the solanaceae cucurbitaceae and other plant families their sequences were previously detected in different environmental waters including ballast water kim et al 2015 irrigation systems boben et al 2007 drinking water haramoto et al 2013 and raw and urban sewage cantalupo et al 2011 fernandez cassi et al 2018 viruses from this group are known to have extremely stable virions that can resist high temperatures bawden and pirie 1959 mutombo et al 1992 tobacco tomato and pepper are known hosts for tomv tmgmv and pmmov smith 2017 all three found to be present in wastewater as infective particles in this study we detected reads belonging to cgmmv which is the most economically important cucurbit infecting tobamovirus and currently considered a significant threat to the production of cucumber melon watermelon gherkin and pumpkin smith 2017 we also detected sequences of tobrfv first identified in tomatoes in jordan in 2015 mansour and falk 2016 outbreaks of this emerging virus are causing major concerns for growers of tomato and pepper in different countries worldwide eppo 2019a the virus is easily transmitted which together with the lack of tobrfv resistant tomato varieties generates a significant threat for tomato production worldwide luria et al 2017 the detection of tobrfv sequences in wastewater in slovenia a country where it has not been reported yet thus raises questions about its origin possibility of unnoticed presence and risks of its water mediated transmission from the bromoviridae family cmv sequences were detected in the majority of the samples cmv is known to infect over 1200 plant species including important vegetable crops and ornamentals zitter and murphey 2009 in the past it was isolated from river water mehle and ravnikar 2012 piazzolla 1986 we detected sequences of melon necrotic spot virus mnsv from tombusviridae family in all analyzed wastewater samples mnsv affecting species of the cucurbitaceae family is transmitted mainly by attaching itself to the outer layer of the aquatic zoospores of the fungus olpidium bornovanus gosalvez et al 2003 sequences of potato viruses such as carlaviruses potato virus s and potato virus m and potyvirus pvy which are on the list of quarantine pests in some countries eppo 2019b were also detected pvy is the most important viral pathogen in potato worldwide with different strains of pvy causing diseases in tobacco potato pepper and tomato tsedaley 2015 pepmv potexvirus alphaflexiviridae sequences were found in some influent and effluent samples pepmv causes great concern in the greenhouse tomato industry and is considered as a pest recommended for regulation as quarantine pest eppo 2019b experiments using a hydroponic system showed that pepmv and pvy can be released from plant roots into the nutrient solution and can infect healthy plants through their roots mehle et al 2014 recent studies demonstrated the usage of wastewater metagenomics for detection of viral outbreaks in human populations fernandez cassi et al 2018 xagoraraki and brien 2019 in the present study we confirmed previous observations that wastewaters metagenomics can also provide a comprehensive view into the presence and abundance of plant viruses possibly reflecting the diversity of local plants as well as the plants consumed by local residents and animals ng et al 2012 we detected nucleic acids of many viruses which were never reported in slovenia before fig 3 suggesting that wastewater might provide a pathway for the dissemination and gradual globalization of plant viruses however the number of sequences detected for specific viruses varied from very low to high while metagenomics studies of plant viruses in wastewater collected from different sources in the region provide an insight into the diversity of plant viruses circulating in a given environment including emerging ones it needs to be followed by systematic tests for specific viruses especially in terms of their infectivity the availability of an effective concentration method is crucial for metagenomic detection of viral pathogens for aquatic surveillance purposes fernandez cassi et al 2018 the cim monolithic gradient elution enables both concentration and fractionation of the wastewater virome resulting in tobamovirus reads being most abundant in specific fraction groups inf17 linb ef17 linb figs 3c and 4 the ability of the cim chromatographic sample preparation step to increase viral concentration and at the same time to remove impurities present in the sample rupar et al 2013 likely contributed to the success of infectivity tests confirming biological significance of viral sequences detected in hts based surveillance of wastewater in the past infectious plant viruses have been isolated from various types of environmental water in different locations around the world koenig 1986 mehle et al 2018 mehle and ravnikar 2012 including irrigation and drainage canals jeżewska et al 2018 however infectivity of plant viruses was never studied in influents and effluents of wwtp even though using reclaimed wastewater for irrigation purposes is becoming a widespread practice pedrero et al 2010 the combination of cim concentration of wastewater samples and mechanical inoculation of selected test plants used here enabled us to observe symptomatic changes in selected test plants and confirm the infectivity of viruses detected by the metagenomic analysis of both treated and untreated wastewater using srna sequencing that enables generic detection of rna snd dna viruses and is widely used in plant virus discovery pecman et al 2017 roossinck et al 2015 we were able to detect three infective tobamoviruses pmmov tomv and tmgmv table 2 high diversity of plant viral sequences and confirmed infectivity of some important pathogenic plant viruses in both treated and untreated wastewater call for the broad consideration of the use of reclaimed water for irrigation purposes since it poses a risk of disease spread to irrigated plants and plants grown in hydroponic systems this consideration is especially relevant for highly stable and mechanically transmissible viruses such as the ones detected in this study although virus removal in water was studied and can be achieved by careful selection of treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation ozonation microfiltration canh et al 2019 kato et al 2018 there are still needs for the development of new cost effective and environmentally friendly technologies for efficient virus inactivation this study suggests that plant viruses especially tobamoviruses can potentially circulate between urban environment and croplands from infected plants through human and animal consumption and excreta to wastewater from where they could be transmitted back to plants through e g irrigation with reclaimed wastewater the release of infective plant viruses into environment through wastewater might have consequences in rapid transmission of pathogenic viruses to new areas which cannot be reached by other vectors hypothetically through such process the global incidence of diseases and their impact on the ecosystem can increase more rapidly for a broad range of crops mehle et al 2018 wastewater based epidemiology has the potential to predict critical locations and critical moments for viral disease onset xagoraraki and brien 2019 however it has not yet been applied to predict and prevent plant viral disease outbreaks the results and methodology used in this study provides a baseline for monitoring reclaimed water for the presence of pathogenic viruses and to monitor and improve wastewater treatment processes for efficient removal or inactivation of viruses 5 conclusions high throughput sequencing analysis of wastewater metagenomes confirmed a high diversity and abundance of plant viruses in wastewater treatment plant influents and effluents highly stable tobamoviruses were the dominant representatives of plant viruses in wastewater nucleic acids of plant pathogenic viruses not previously detected in the region were present in both untreated and treated wastewater including emerging and quarantine viruses this indicates the applicability of wastewater based epidemiology for early detection and monitoring of economically important plant viruses however detection of nucleic acids needs to be coupled with specific follow up studies especially concerning virus infectivity wastewater contained infective plant viruses which remained infective after conventional wastewater treatment this indicates the flux of plant viruses from the urban environment to the ecosystem the presence of infective plant viruses in wastewater can also have consequences in rapid transmission of pathogenic viruses to new areas especially when wastewater or reclaimed water is used for irrigation data availability all sequencing data that support the findings of this study are

17939,viruses represent one of the most important threats to agriculture several viral families include highly stable pathogens which remain infective and can be transported long distances in water

treatment efficiency on plant virus inactivation are lacking even though reclaimed water use for irrigation is being increasingly introduced worldwide pedrero et al 2010 thebo et al 2017 global estimates of the extent to which irrigated croplands are influenced by wastewater both treated and untreated are 35 9 mha 17 of all irrigated croplands of which the majority are located in countries where less than 75 of wastewater is treated thebo et al 2017 it was hypothesized that the surface wash out of infected decaying plant residues and the related soil surface layer can bring plant viruses into water mehle and ravnikar 2012 and they may be washed away by rainwater reaching drainage water and wastewater additionally a number of plant viruses have been found in raw sewage cantalupo et al 2011 and human feces shkoporov et al 2018 zhang et al 2006 e g pepper mild mottle virus pmmov can survive the transit through the human digestive tract zhang et al 2006 and is released into wastewater after consumption of pepper products symonds et al 2019 pmmov is globally distributed and present in various water sources in greater abundance than human pathogenic viruses without substantial seasonal fluctuation kitajima et al 2018 thus it has been proposed as a water pollution indicator kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009b the low concentration of virions in water samples makes them difficult to detect and requires the use of concentration methods during the sample preparation process different concentration approaches and sample preparation modifications can be used to increase the sensitivity of virus detection in wastewater haramoto et al 2018 hjelmsø et al 2017 convective interaction media cim monoliths have shown to be a fast and efficient tool for concentration of viral particles and free nucleic acids from high volume water samples pointing to cim monoliths as a promising tool for sample preparation in water virome studies gutiérrez aguirre et

mohiuddin and schellhorn 2015 metagenomic approaches reveal an unprecedented spectrum of viral nucleic acids in water samples however confirming the infectivity of the viruses discovered through sequencing analysis is essential to assess the relevance of such findings although infectious plant viruses have been isolated from various types of water e g rivers ponds irrigation and drainage canals in different locations worldwide jeżewska et al 2018 koenig 1986 mehle et al 2018 their survival and direct transmission through water is still largely unknown none of the studies to date have approached infectivity testing for plant viruses detected in wastewater most probably due to the low viral concentrations in combination with the low sensitivity and time intensive test plant bioassays used for the confirmation of plant virus infectivity to identify the potential of reclaimed water as a reservoir and transmission source for infective plant viruses we focus this study on the presence of plant viruses in influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp coupling cim monolithic chromatography concentration hts based shotgun metagenomics and biological infectivity tests fig 1 the combination of fast and efficient virus concentration and metagenomics enables us to study the population of plant viruses in wastewater highlighting the presence of important plant pathogenic viruses some of which were not previously detected in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and description of wwtp water samples 5 l of wwtp influents and effluents were sampled in summer 2016 and 2017 the selected wwtp located in central slovenia central wwtp domžale kamnik slovenia is a conventional two stage activated sludge plant upgraded with four

negative control of isolation was spiked with luciferase rna promega wi usa and was also sent for sequencing as a control for contamination in the isolation process and sample cross talk during sequencing we sent isolated rna or preamplification products for reverse transcription library preparation and sequencing to seqmatic llc fremont ca usa nextera xt dna library prep kit illumina san diego ca usa was used to construct the sequencing libraries which were shotgun sequenced using an illumina miseq illumina san diego ca usa resulting in 1 million to 3 4 million 2 250 bp reads per sample the remains of sequencing adaptors and primer sequences in the case of preamplified samples were trimmed and resulting reads were further filtered by using quality filter limit 0 01 no ambiguous nucleotide allowed and by size reads shorter than 25 bp were discarded in clc genomics workbench 11 qiagen bioinformatics redwood city ca usa in order to normalize samples according to the number of reads random subsampling was done and all the samples were normalized to 926 418 reads which was the minimum number of reads obtained among the samples trimmed size and quality filtered normalized reads subsets were exported from clc genomics workbench and compared for similarity with a complete ncbi nr database june 2018 using diamond buchfink et al 2015 with default parameters the results of the diamond classifications were used as an input for the taxonomic classification of the reads using megan metagenome analyzer version 6 12 0 huson et al 2016 with the following parameters for the lowest common ancestor algorithm min score 50 0 max expected 0 01 top percent 10 0 min support percent 0 min support 1 and lca percent 100 0 the obtained megan outputs were used to present an overview of taxonomic classification of the sequencing reads to compare viromes of differently concentrated samples single stranded ss rna viral reads were exported as a biom file differential heat trees of pairwise comparisons between samples were constructed by metacoder r package foster et al 2017 where the relationships between viral taxons presented in the trees are inferred from ncbi taxonomy hierarchy all plant infecting viruses whose genomes were detected in metagenomes of wastewater samples were listed in fig 3 and the corresponding viral species richness number of observed viral species was presented in table 1 the reads classified as plant viruses were manually inspected and some reads were manually reassigned or left unclassified on the species level to ensure the correct classification of plant virus species for this we used an approach that combined blastn ncbi nt database september 2018 and blastx ncbi nr database september 2018 determination of sequence identity to the most similar sequences in the respective databases with detailed review of each identified taxon reads with lower identity than defined by ictv species demarcation criteria were classified only on the genus level 2 5 infectivity tests and detection of infective plant viruses nicotiana occidentalis and nicotiana benthamiana plants that are susceptible to infection by a wide range of viruses including most of the detected tobamoviruses wylie et al 2015 were selected to test the infectivity of plant viruses after the concentration of wastewater samples using cim monolithic chromatography before inoculation of test plants selected elution fractions were desalted using pd 10 desalting columns ge healthcare il usa following the manufacturer s instructions and using inoculation buffer 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 6 with 2 pvp m 10000 sigma tokyo japan as an equilibration buffer inoculation of test plants with influent sample included eight separate linear gradient elution fractions f16 f23 and a negative control of inoculation where plants were inoculated only with inoculation buffer inoculation of test plants with effluent sample included a step gradient elution fraction ef17 step e1 and a negative control of inoculation supplementary fig 1 all fractions that were used for inoculation of test plants originated from the same concentration experiment as the fractions that were sequenced to ensure the consistency and comparability with metagenomics analysis supplementary fig 1 sampling concentration process desalting and inoculation of test plants were all done in the same day to avoid freezing of the samples and prevent the possible negative influence of concentrated substances on stability of viral particles we inoculated each selected elution fraction on eight plants of each tobacco species nicotiana occidentalis and nicotiana benthamiana we mechanically inoculated two to three leaves per plant using carborundum 0 062 mm vwr international radnor pa usa that was put on each leaf and the elution fraction approximately 50 μl per leave was gently rubbed over it additional plants inoculated only with inoculation buffer served as negative controls during the 4 week period following the mechanical inoculation we observed plants for the appearance of symptomatic changes we sampled plant material of non inoculated leaves every week after inoculation for detection of viruses using transmission electronic microscopy tem and small s rna sequencing analysis we collected pooled samples of leaf tissue non inoculated leaves approximately 1 cm2 per leave separately for different test plants inoculated with different cim fractions but exhibiting similar disease symptoms we also sampled non inoculated leaves of asymptomatic plants see supplementary fig 1 for details plant material samples were further used to isolate total rna using trizol reagent thermo fisher scientific ma usa as a control we included a sample of phaseolus vulgaris plant material infected with an endornavirus kindly provided by mike rott canadian food inspection agency dartmouth canada in the sequencing experiment srna deep sequencing was used as a generic detection method which enable detection of all the different types of viruses different rna and dna viruses infecting plants at the same time pecman et al 2017 total rna was sent to seqmatic llc fremont ca usa for srna library preparation tailormix mirna sample preparation kit seqmatic llc usa and sequencing the samples were multiplexed in one run of a nextseq illumina ca usa in 1 100 bp mode reads were further analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline for virus detection from hts data as described in a previous study pecman et al 2017 shortly trimmed and size selected reads were first mapped to the ncbi viral refseq database containing representatives of all viral genomes with completely sequenced genomes results of the mapping were manually inspected in parallel de novo assembly of trimmed and size selected reads was performed assembled contigs were compared for similarity against all viral sequences deposited in the ncbi genbank nt database using blastn and blastx the presence of suspected viral sequences was confirmed and complete consensus genome sequence was generated by mapping the reads to the complete viral genome sequences of the most similar viral isolates from the ncbi genbank database 2 6 tem analysis of viruses a sample 25 μl of the chromatographic fractions was applied to formvar coated agar scientific stansted uk carbon stabilized copper grids that were negatively stained using a 1 w v aqueous solution of uranyl acetate spi supplies west chester pa usa selected elution fractions from year 2 influent linear gradient fraction 17 and 18 were ultracentrifugated using airfuge beckman coulter inc brea ca usa onto tem grids before negative staining as described previously hammond et al 1981 all samples were examined with tem philips cm 100 netherlands as described in a previous study ruščić et al 2015 plant material of randomly selected plants inoculated with wastewater samples exhibiting distinctive symptoms was also examined using tem homogenates of plant material 20 μl were applied to formvar coated carbon stabilized copper grids and negatively stained using a 1 w v aqueous solution of uranyl acetate spi supplies pa usa followed by visualization by tem 3 results to examine the virome composition of wastewater we determined the metagenomes of the influent and effluent samples of a wwtp with special emphasis on plant viruses viruses were first concentrated using cim monolithic chromatography using either i step gradient elution concentration approach supplementary fig 2a or ii linear gradient elution concentration approach supplementary fig 2b after linear gradient elution we selected sequenced and separately analyzed three fraction groups based on the abundance of pmmov and cgmmv determined by rt qpcr supplementary fig 2b supplementary table 1 selected fraction groups cover the initial lina middle linb and final linc part of the elution gradient 3 1 overview of the highly diverse wastewater virome reveals understudied group of plant viruses to provide a trustworthy representation of viral species rodriguez brazzarola et al 2018 we analyzed hts data obtained by sequencing wastewater samples table 1 using reads based protein similarity searches taxonomic classification showed that a substantial fraction of reads in each metagenome 20 85 had no matches to known organisms table 1 fig 2 a this is similar to previous studies in which the majority of the sequences in wastewater samples had no similarity to known genes or proteins aw et al 2014 bibby and peccia 2013 a large fraction of reads 10 50 in influent and effluent samples belonged to bacteria fig 2a a smaller fraction of reads was classified as eukaryotic organisms and archaea fig 2a eukaryotic reads were abundantly present in non concentrated samples 5 13 and were classified mostly as genomes of plants aquatic arthropods rodents and enteric parasites data not shown in the same non concentrated influent and effluent samples the percentage of viral reads was less than 1 0 1 0 7 however it increased to 7 7 in cim concentrated samples table 1 fig 2a by analyzing metagenomes of the 12 samples table 1 we detected members of 56 different viral families including those with double stranded ds dna ssdna dsrna and ssrna genomes fig 2b examination of wastewater samples by tem also revealed a diversity of virion morphologies with filamentous viral particles and phage like virions supplementary fig 3 as previously shown the viromes of wwtp influents and effluents contain high abundance of dsdna bacteriophages crassphage sequences originally identified from metagenomic analysis of human feces dutilh et al 2014 were abundantly detected in influent samples supplementary table 3 gut associated bacteroides phage b124 14 that can be used to distinguish human gut contaminated metagenomes ogilvie et al 2018 and few reads of circular rep encoding single stranded dna cress dna viruses recently reported in wastewater effluents rosario et al 2019 were also detected in a majority of the samples supplementary table 3 important human pathogens such as norovirus sapovirus enterovirus rotavirus a hepatitis e virus and jc polyomavirus a were also detected in wastewater viromes supplementary table 3 pathogenic viruses of other hosts such as sequences of members of picornavirales order belonging to dicistroviridae family were detected mainly in influent samples we also detected bee viruses belonging to iflaviridae family and picornavirales order in both influent and effluent samples supplementary table 3 in influent inf17 linb and effluent ef17 linb linear gradient elution fractions we detected representatives of more than 20 families of ssrna viruses plant viral genomes mostly consist of ssrna 75 of all plant viruses hull and bustamante 1998 and were therefore mostly detected in analyzed wastewater samples as sequences classified as ssrna viruses with exception of the dsrna pepper cryptic virus fig 3 the most commonly found viruses recovered before and after wastewater treatment belonged to the family virgaviridae with all of the reads corresponding to the tobamovirus genus fig 2c most abundantly represented by sequences of pmmov tobacco mild green mosaic virus tmgmv tomato mosaic virus tomv and cgmmv fig 3 we also detected sequences of tomato brown rugose fruit virus tobrfv which was not found in the country before and is an emerging tobamovirus that has recently brought concern to plant health authorities worldwide representatives of less abundant families such as potyviridae betaflexiviridae and tymoviridae were mostly present in the influent samples and were rarely detected after the wastewater treatment in the effluent samples fig 2c sequences belonging to bromoviridae family were detected abundantly in samples from 2016 and only few reads were detected in samples from 2017 fig 2c whilst tobamoviruses were numerically dominant plant viruses in the samples fig 2c the list fig 3 of detected potentially pathogenic plant viruses includes 47 species from 19 genera including the economically important viruses such as cucumber mosaic virus cmv potato virus y pvy and pepino mosaic virus pepmv with in depth analysis of reads assigned to plant viral families sequences with low similarity to known plant viruses were also detected that could only be classified at the genus level and probably represent previously undescribed viral species fig 3 3 2 optimized viral concentration enables more detailed insight into diversity of plant viruses while hts is a powerful tool for uncovering viruses in the environment sample and molecular processing steps can alter the distribution of viral groups in the concentrated samples this is why we have compared non concentrated and differently concentrated wastewater samples we analyzed fractions obtained by either step gradient elution or linear gradient elution with rt qpcr for presence and relative concentrations of two tobamoviruses pmmov cgmmv calculated their recoveries supplementary fig 2 and compared the virome composition of differently concentrated samples we were able to efficiently concentrate pmmov and cgmmv for approximately two orders of magnitude according to rt qpcr results supplementary fig 2 supplementary table 1 supplementary table 2 we observed a higher fraction of viral reads in both step linear gradient concentrated influent and effluent samples compared to non concentrated ones table 1 fig 2a the enrichment for viral sequences was most noticeable in linb linear gradient samples table 1 fig 2a the fractions at the peak of absorbance linb have very high recoveries according to rt qpcr for selected tobamoviruses cgmmv and pmmov and contain the highest number of reads belonging to ssrna viruses fig 2b inf17 linb ef17 linb mostly due to the high abundance of viral reads classified as tobamoviruses fig 2c next we aimed to get a detailed insight into the plant virus abundance and diversity differences between different concentrations of the same sample thus we visualized pairwise comparisons of taxa abundances for ssrna viral reads of differently concentrated effluent sample from year 2017 as differential abundance heat trees fig 4 overall enrichment of virgaviridae family in ef17 linb effluent sample was pronounced fig 4 in summary we detected higher number of plant viral species in concentrated influent and effluent samples compared to non concentrated ones especially in linb fractions table 1 both concentration approaches step and linear allowed us to focus on the diversity of ssrna viruses with the linear gradient having the potential to study specific viral groups namely tobamoviruses in more detail 3 3 plant viruses in wastewater are infective and survive wastewater treatment to determine if the plant viruses detected by hts have a potential to be transmitted to plants by wastewater we performed biological infectivity tests inoculation with non concentrated wastewater in a preliminary experiment resulted in no detectable infection results not shown therefore in subsequent experiments we mechanically inoculated test plants using fractions concentrated by either linear influent or step effluent gradient elution and monitored the plants for symptom development using srna hts a non targeted plant virus detection approach we detected high number of reads assigned to tobamoviruses in pools of symptomatic and also asymptomatic plants table 2 complete genome sequences of detected viruses were covered by srna reads and consensus viral genomes of infecting viruses have been reconstructed four weeks after inoculation with influent linear gradient elution fractions from year 2017 see supplementary fig 1 some n benthamiana plants showed reduction in size curling and mottling of the leaves fig 5 a srna sequencing of the pooled plant samples with similar symptoms table 2 identified pmmov in the pool n occidentalis plants inoculated with the same fractions showed two different types of symptomatic changes again we confirmed pmmov infection in pool of n occidentalis samples with the symptoms of curling and mottling fig 5b table 2 moreover in the pool of n occidentalis plants exhibiting curling and necrotic spots fig 5c table 2 we detected mixed infection with pmmov and tomv finally also in the pool of n occidentalis plants not showing any distinct disease symptoms at the time of sampling we detected pmmov table 2 to assess the effect of the wastewater treatment on plant virus infectivity we also inoculated test plants with the effluent of the wwtp from year 2017 which is released directly into the river for mechanical inoculation we used step gradient elution fraction e1 for details see supplementary fig 1 n benthamiana plants again showed disease symptoms with reduction of the size of the plant and curling which were linked with pmmov infection fig 5d table 2 using srna sequencing of pooled symptomatic plant material additionally a pool of n occidentalis plants with mosaic symptoms fig 5e as well as pool of asymptomatic n benthamiana plants were shown to be infected with tmgmv table 2 all of the influent and effluent fractions that successfully infected test plants contained high number of reads of the detected infective viruses fig 3 tem examination of symptomatic plant material samples revealed the presence of filamentous virus particles of about 300 nm in length typical for tobamoviruses fig 5f and g 4 discussion in this study we explore the diversity of viruses in wastewater focusing on highly economically relevant ssrna plant viruses we described the presence of such viruses in influent and effluent samples of wwtp and confirmed the infectivity of some plant viruses thus proving their biological significance in wastewater these results implicate the flux of infective pathogenic plant viruses from anthropogenic environments into environmental waters and open important questions about the role of wastewater in the spread of viral diseases of plants in this study we detected members of 11 families of plant pathogenic ssrna viruses fig 3 tobamoviruses which were the most abundant plant viruses detected in analyzed samples are considered a major risk to a range of agriculturally important plant species belonging to the solanaceae cucurbitaceae and other plant families their sequences were previously detected in different environmental waters including ballast water kim et al 2015 irrigation systems boben et al 2007 drinking water haramoto et al 2013 and raw and urban sewage cantalupo et al 2011 fernandez cassi et al 2018 viruses from this group are known to have extremely stable virions that can resist high temperatures bawden and pirie 1959 mutombo et al 1992 tobacco tomato and pepper are known hosts for tomv tmgmv and pmmov smith 2017 all three found to be present in wastewater as infective particles in this study we detected reads belonging to cgmmv which is the most economically important cucurbit infecting tobamovirus and currently considered a significant threat to the production of cucumber melon watermelon gherkin and pumpkin smith 2017 we also detected sequences of tobrfv first identified in tomatoes in jordan in 2015 mansour and falk 2016 outbreaks of this emerging virus are causing major concerns for growers of tomato and pepper in different countries worldwide eppo 2019a the virus is easily transmitted which together with the lack of tobrfv resistant tomato varieties generates a significant threat for tomato production worldwide luria et al 2017 the detection of tobrfv sequences in wastewater in slovenia a country where it has not been reported yet thus raises questions about its origin possibility of unnoticed presence and risks of its water mediated transmission from the bromoviridae family cmv sequences were detected in the majority of the samples cmv is known to infect over 1200 plant species including important vegetable crops and ornamentals zitter and murphey 2009 in the past it was isolated from river water mehle and ravnikar 2012 piazzolla 1986 we detected sequences of melon necrotic spot virus mnsv from tombusviridae family in all analyzed wastewater samples mnsv affecting species of the cucurbitaceae family is transmitted mainly by attaching itself to the outer layer of the aquatic zoospores of the fungus olpidium bornovanus gosalvez et al 2003 sequences of potato viruses such as carlaviruses potato virus s and potato virus m and potyvirus pvy which are on the list of quarantine pests in some countries eppo 2019b were also detected pvy is the most important viral pathogen in potato worldwide with different strains of pvy causing diseases in tobacco potato pepper and tomato tsedaley 2015 pepmv potexvirus alphaflexiviridae sequences were found in some influent and effluent samples pepmv causes great concern in the greenhouse tomato industry and is considered as a pest recommended for regulation as quarantine pest eppo 2019b experiments using a hydroponic system showed that pepmv and pvy can be released from plant roots into the nutrient solution and can infect healthy plants through their roots mehle et al 2014 recent studies demonstrated the usage of wastewater metagenomics for detection of viral outbreaks in human populations fernandez cassi et al 2018 xagoraraki and brien 2019 in the present study we confirmed previous observations that wastewaters metagenomics can also provide a comprehensive view into the presence and abundance of plant viruses possibly reflecting the diversity of local plants as well as the plants consumed by local residents and animals ng et al 2012 we detected nucleic acids of many viruses which were never reported in slovenia before fig 3 suggesting that wastewater might provide a pathway for the dissemination and gradual globalization of plant viruses however the number of sequences detected for specific viruses varied from very low to high while metagenomics studies of plant viruses in wastewater collected from different sources in the region provide an insight into the diversity of plant viruses circulating in a given environment including emerging ones it needs to be followed by systematic tests for specific viruses especially in terms of their infectivity the availability of an effective concentration method is crucial for metagenomic detection of viral pathogens for aquatic surveillance purposes fernandez cassi et al 2018 the cim monolithic gradient elution enables both concentration and fractionation of the wastewater virome resulting in tobamovirus reads being most abundant in specific fraction groups inf17 linb ef17 linb figs 3c and 4 the ability of the cim chromatographic sample preparation step to increase viral concentration and at the same time to remove impurities present in the sample rupar et al 2013 likely contributed to the success of infectivity tests confirming biological significance of viral sequences detected in hts based surveillance of wastewater in the past infectious plant viruses have been isolated from various types of environmental water in different locations around the world koenig 1986 mehle et al 2018 mehle and ravnikar 2012 including irrigation and drainage canals jeżewska et al 2018 however infectivity of plant viruses was never studied in influents and effluents of wwtp even though using reclaimed wastewater for irrigation purposes is becoming a widespread practice pedrero et al 2010 the combination of cim concentration of wastewater samples and mechanical inoculation of selected test plants used here enabled us to observe symptomatic changes in selected test plants and confirm the infectivity of viruses detected by the metagenomic analysis of both treated and untreated wastewater using srna sequencing that enables generic detection of rna snd dna viruses and is widely used in plant virus discovery pecman et al 2017 roossinck et al 2015 we were able to detect three infective tobamoviruses pmmov tomv and tmgmv table 2 high diversity of plant viral sequences and confirmed infectivity of some important pathogenic plant viruses in both treated and untreated wastewater call for the broad consideration of the use of reclaimed water for irrigation purposes since it poses a risk of disease spread to irrigated plants and plants grown in hydroponic systems this consideration is especially relevant for highly stable and mechanically transmissible viruses such as the ones detected in this study although virus removal in water was studied and can be achieved by careful selection of treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation ozonation microfiltration canh et al 2019 kato et al 2018 there are still needs for the development of new cost effective and environmentally friendly technologies for efficient virus inactivation this study suggests that plant viruses especially tobamoviruses can potentially circulate between urban environment and croplands from infected plants through human and animal consumption and excreta to wastewater from where they could be transmitted back to plants through e g irrigation with reclaimed wastewater the release of infective plant viruses into environment through wastewater might have consequences in rapid transmission of pathogenic viruses to new areas which cannot be reached by other vectors hypothetically through such process the global incidence of diseases and their impact on the ecosystem can increase more rapidly for a broad range of crops mehle et al 2018 wastewater based epidemiology has the potential to predict critical locations and critical moments for viral disease onset xagoraraki and brien 2019 however it has not yet been applied to predict and prevent plant viral disease outbreaks the results and methodology used in this study provides a baseline for monitoring reclaimed water for the presence of pathogenic viruses and to monitor and improve wastewater treatment processes for efficient removal or inactivation of viruses 5 conclusions high throughput sequencing analysis of wastewater metagenomes confirmed a high diversity and abundance of plant viruses in wastewater treatment plant influents and effluents highly stable tobamoviruses were the dominant representatives of plant viruses in wastewater nucleic acids of plant pathogenic viruses not previously detected in the region were present in both untreated and treated wastewater including emerging and quarantine viruses this indicates the applicability of wastewater based epidemiology for early detection and monitoring of economically important plant viruses however detection of nucleic acids needs to be coupled with specific follow up studies especially concerning virus infectivity wastewater contained infective plant viruses which remained infective after conventional wastewater treatment this indicates the flux of plant viruses from the urban environment to the ecosystem the presence of infective plant viruses in wastewater can also have consequences in rapid transmission of pathogenic viruses to new areas especially when wastewater or reclaimed water is used for irrigation data availability all sequencing data that support the findings of this study are
