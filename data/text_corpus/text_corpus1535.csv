7675,study region guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area urban agglomeration gba study focus existing water evaluation and planning system weap lacks consideration of regional and industrial water distribution priority this study proposes an improved weap model by integrating regional and industrial water distribution priority determined by water supply safety the logistic curve model was introduced for water supply safety evaluation the improved weap model was applied to the water resources allocation of gba in the year of 2019 and 2030 and the effects of water allocation schemes with different regional and industrial water distribution priorities were compared new hydrological insights of the region the results indicate that the water supply safety of each city in the gba varies with region and industry guangzhou shenzhen and dongguan have lower degree of domestic and industrial water supply safety river and reservoir connections are essential to the water supply safety of gba the water demands of shenzhen and dongguan cannot be satisfied during dry period in 2019 while perfectly satisfied during the dry period in 2030 due to the operation of water transfer projects the improved weap model obtained more reasonable water allocation results improving the water satisfaction rates of regions with low water supply safety the research demonstrates the advantage of the improved weap model considering regional and industries priority enhancing the applicability of the weap model graphical abstract ga1 keywords water distribution priority water supply safety water evaluation and planning system model guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area urban agglomeration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water resources are the key resources for social and economic development deng et al 2021 sheffield et al 2018 with the development of society and the expansion of population the need of water resources is rapidly increasing cheng et al 2018 however due to the limitation of water resources water demand cannot be satisfied totally in some areas which is aggravated by the climate change and the increase of drought events keune and miralles 2019 the conflict between water supply and demand has been deepened and became one of the main barriers to the world s sustainable development jun et al 2022 which also hinders the development of urban agglomerations especially in the developing countries zhao et al 2021 thus as an effective way of easing the conflict between water supply and demand water resources allocation is important and necessary xiao et al 2021 water resources allocation models have provided scientific support for the optimal water allocation schemes yaykiran et al 2019 water evaluation and planning system weap model is a flexible high visible and user friendly model which can help administrators to evaluate water resources by setting scenarios based on different input variables ashofteh et al 2017 in recent years the weap model has been used widely in the water resources allocation of different countries alamanos et al 2019 hund et al 2018 miraji et al 2019 and showed the applicability in water resources evaluation at basin scale amin et al 2018 khazaipoul et al 2019 calculated the monthly water distribution as the key variable of reservoir multi objective irrigation optimization using the weap model bhave et al 2020 applied the weap model to simulate the response of water resources to climate change in malawi shire basin and found that the weap model could better simulate runoff and the water level s change khalil et al 2018 applied the weap model to evaluate the relationship between water supply and demand suggesting the weap model could provide support for the effective management of water resources at basin scale in summary the weap model can not only satisfy the water resources allocation demand from different study areas but also make different allocation schemes based on the demand from researchers or truly development therefore the weap model is an important tool for rational allocation and management of regional water resources under the changing environment in the default setting of the weap model the water distribution priority of each demand point is equal and all the demand points get the same satisfaction rate when water resources could not satisfy all the demand however the water demand of important water industries has been prioritized for many places in reality wei et al 2020 also different water industries have different tolerances for water shortage for example the water shortage of agriculture has little impact on the society while the water shortage of domestic would cause heavy damage to the society at the same time as for the urban agglomeration the aim of development function positioning the level of economic and social development for each city are different therefore the water distribution priority of the same water use sector in different cities should be different and the determination of water distribution priority should fully consider the above factors the water allocation results considering the water distribution priority have been proved to be more reasonable and the water allocation scheme has been more operational safavi et al 2016 analyzed the water allocations in zayandehrud river basin and gave the key assumption for which urban demand was assigned the first priority while other demands were assigned the second priority men et al 2019 rank the priority of domestic first industry second agriculture third ecologic last in water supply during water shortage some studies set water distribution priority in the weap model for instance kou et al 2018 set domestic first industry second ecologic last as the water distribution priority in the weap model hassan et al 2019 set priority first for domestic demand and second for agricultural demand in the weap model the existing research on water distribution priority is based on the solving of the water demand of important water industry without the consideration of the social development diversity inner urban agglomeration or region moreover the existing water distribution priority applied in the weap model is usually subjectively determined and cannot properly reflect the objective situation of regional water resources exploitation as a widely used water allocation model the weap model lacks of objective water distribution priority which would affect the reliability of water allocation results especially in the urban agglomeration with different functional positioning and development goals therefore it is essential to develop a quantitative assessment method for quantifying such water distribution priority in the weap model which can develop the model for better application the water allocation of complex basin and urban agglomeration the logistic curve model is an objective growth model meadows et al 1972 and the model s characteristics can well reflect the impact of evaluation indicators on industrial water supply safety the logistic curve model has been widely used in the prediction of natural and social indicators and it has the potential to verify the reliability in the water resources safety evaluation song et al 2016 hao et al 2018 the exponential smoothing es model is a time series analysis and forecasting method proposed in the late 1950 s brown 1959 which has the advantages of simple calculation and convenient use mi et al 2018 the es model has been widely used in forecasting research and has shown its reliability yapar et al 2017 smyl 2020 given this this study aims to improve the weap model via adding the water distribution priority of region and industry for each water demand point considering the diversity and priority of regional economic social development and water use sectors and the improvement of the rationality of the water allocation schemes the logistic curve model was introduced to calculate the degree of water supply safety for determining the water distribution priority and the es model was used to predict future water demands and economic social indicators based on the water distribution priority of region and industry different water allocation schemes were obtained and compared to verify the advantage and effectiveness of the improved weap model guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area urban agglomeration gba is economically developed and densely populated and plays an important role in the national development of china the cities inner the gba are clear functional positioning and division of labor and the levels of economic social development and water use in gba show significant spatial differences meanwhile due to the dual influence of upstream runoff uncertainty and downstream salt tide intrusion the water supply safety of gba faces severe challenges particularly in dry periods yao et al 2016 moreover the pearl river delta prd water transfer project is expected to run in 2030 which would change the pattern of water supply in gba in the future and may influence the effect of water distribution priority therefore due to the rising water demand of gba and the change caused by water transfer project the improved weap model was demonstrated in water resources allocation of the gba so as to provide technical support for the rational water resources allocation of gba under the changing environment 2 methodology 2 1 weap model the weap model was developed by stockholm environment institute s u s center in 1988 it s a model used to evaluate the supply demand and allocation of water resources for region in certain space time hollermann et al 2010 yates et al 2005 in the weap model the water demand in each region can be generalized into the demand points of domestic dm industrial id agricultural ag and off stream ecological environment eco the weap model includes the waypoints like river reservoir groundwater and demand points constructs regional water resources relationship between supply demand and allocation networks by transporting water from water resources waypoints to demand waypoints through transport links and reflow meanwhile the weap model can set up different schemes according to administrators request to reveal the influences of policy change social development and water conservation on water resources allocation in the weap model any node and link should obey the water balance equation 1 w s q i q o q l where w s represents the actual water supply at each demand point q i represents the total water intake of the node q o represents the total water output from the node q l represents the loss of water consumption due to evaporation leakage and others during transportation the weap model would set satisfaction rate for each demand point 2 c r q i r r where r r represents water consumption at each demand point c r represents the water satisfaction rate of each demand point there is a competition among demand points reservoir and the flow requirement of river and the rationality of water allocation result would be influenced by the same satisfaction rate of demand points reservoir and the flow requirement of river due to the same water distribution priority in the current study four schemes were set up to demonstrate the advantage of the improved weap model fig 1 scheme 1 applied the default water distribution priority of the weap model in scheme 2 the river ecological flow requirement was given the highest water distribution priority and the demand points used the same water distribution priority scheme 3 kept the highest water distribution priority of the river ecological flow requirement and arranges the descending water distribution priority from dm id ag to eco water demand points based on scheme 3 scheme 4 further considered the regional water distribution priority of each water demand point which is determined by the water supply safety degree calculated by the logistic curve model 2 2 the construction of index evaluation system the construction of index evaluation system for each industry is built based on the principles of synthesis representativeness and data availability table 1 the vif collinearity test was made by spss software water supply safety involves the aspects of both water supply capacity and water use efficiency in the current study water resources endowment wre indicator was used to characterize water supply capacity and dm id ag and eco water use indicators were applied to characterize water use efficiency the classification standard of each indicator was determined according to the indicator data of the prefecture level cities in gba from 2010 to 2019 and the 5 35 65 and 95 quantiles value were selected as the four thresholds finally the indicator data was divided into 5 grades according to these four thresholds respectively 2 3 the logistic curve model as an objective evaluation model the logistic curve model is a generalized regression model which was firstly used to study the law of population growing verhulst 1838 leach 1981 in general the influences of population growth gdp growth and other commonly used evaluation indicators in water supply safety would not present the approximate linear relationship all the time when the evaluation indicators increase to a certain extent water resources carrying capacity would face bottleneck due to great water supply pressure which led to smaller variation of water supply safety than before even though the indicators were still growing therefore the relationship between evaluation indicators and water supply safety cannot be simply analyzed by general linear model the form of the logistic curve model is a curve with slow growth at the upper and lower bounds and a fast growth in the middle which can better express the above laws in addition compared with other evaluation models zhu and chang 2020 liu et al 2021 xiang et al 2022 the logistic curve model is concise and does not need to build more evaluation functions it can also avoid the negative impact from subjective judgement and require fewer parameter estimation therefore the current study applied the logistic curve model to evaluate the water supply safety of each region and industry for determining water distribution priority due to the different unit and orders of magnitude the original indicator should be normalized to being the input for the logistic curve model the equations of the normalization are expressed as follows 3 x ij x ij x min x max x min if the index is positive 4 x ij x max x i j x max x min if the index is negative where x ij represents the original data of indicator i for city j x max and x min respectively represent the maximum and minimum value of the original indicator x i j represents the normalized indicator i for city j the functional expression of the logistic curve model is expressed as follows 5 y ij k 1 a e b x i j where a represents the integration constant b represents the growth rate factor on request k represents the function limit value in the current study k was set to 1 which was referenced to the study of water security evaluation cai et al 2020 chang zhu 2021 y ij represents the logistic curve index value of the indicator i for city j parameters a b can be estimated using the least squares method expressed as follows 6 q a b m 1 m y m k 1 a e b x m 2 where m represents the number of grading thresholds in the evaluation index system m 4 x m represents the standardized indicator grading threshold y m represents the target value of the hierarchical initial logistic curve indicator in the current study y 1 0 2 y 2 0 4 y 3 0 6 y 4 0 8 which were according to the threshold value setting from the studies of water ecological security evaluation li et al 2022 wang bao 2021 the parameters a b are determined by eqs 7 and 8 7 b x m ln k y m 1 1 m ln k y m 1 x m x m x m 2 8 a e ln k y m 1 b x m the weight of each indicator is determined by the coefficient of variation method expressed as follows 9 ω i v i i 1 n v i where ω i represents the weight of each indicator v i represents the coefficient of variation of each indicator expression of the comprehensive indicator for the evaluation of water supply safety is expressed as follows 10 s j t i 1 n ω i y ijt where s j t represents city j s water supply safety for industry t t 1 2 3 4 which denotes dm id ag and eco the smaller the value of the city s water supply safety the worse the water supply safety situation and the more the city needs to be given the priority in the allocation of water resources in the urban agglomeration 2 4 the exponential smoothing the es model is a weighted average model which uses dynamic weight coefficients for weighing the original data and shows greater suitableness for the prediction of economic social indicators wang 2019 seong and lee 2021 according to the exponential times the es model could be divided into single es double es and triple es models respectively in the current study the double and triple es models were applied to predict economic social indicators and water demands in the planning period of 2030 the predicted evaluation indicators were used for calculating water supply safety via the logistic curve model while the predicted water demands were the inputs of water resources allocation in the weap model the model with smaller rmse would be finally selected and applied to predict indicators and water demands the double es is expressed as follows 11 y ˆ t h t l t h b t h 1 2 12 l t α y t 1 a l t 1 b t 1 13 b t β l t l t 1 1 β b t 1 where l t represents the smoothed value of the series at time

b t s t h m k 1 h 1 2 15 l t α y t s t m 1 a l t 1 b t 1 16 b t β l t l t 1 1 β b t 1 17 s t γ y t l t 1 b t 1 1 γ s t m where k represents the integer part of h 1 m and m denotes the frequency of the seasonality the equation of rmse is expressed as follows 18 rmse 1 n t n fcst t 2 ogn t 2 2 where n represents the number of time series fcst represents the simulated value ogn represents the observed value 2 5 water distribution gini coefficient to demonstrate the rationality of water allocation by the improved weap model the current study calculated water distribution gini coefficient of each water allocation scheme according to eqs 19 to 20 water distribution gini coefficient reflects the synchronization between water distribution priority and water satisfaction rate the water demand points at the front back of the water distribution priority have higher lower water satisfaction rate which means strong synchronization otherwise means weak synchronization like general gini coefficient the smaller water distribution gini coefficient means more reasonable regional water distribution scheme water distribution gini coefficient is expressed as follows 19 g 1 j 1 j p jt p jt

represents the water demand satisfaction rate for demand point in industry t of city j 3 study area and data located in the middle south of guangdong province guangdong hong kong mo greater bay area gba including nine cities of the peral river delta prd i e guangzhou gz shenzhen sz zhuhai zh foshan fs jiangmen jm zhaoqing zq dongguan dg huizhou hz zhongshan zs hong kong hk and macao mo is one of the three largest coastal urban agglomerations in china he et al 2021 fig 2 the area and population of gba only account for 1 and 5 of the whole country while its gdp accounts for 12 ma et al 2019 moreover the per capital gdp in gba only account from 20 to 50 toward other three largest bay areas in the world therefore for the further development of economic and society gba has strongly relied in water resources with the heavy development pressure and the highly request of water supply safety the per capita local water resource in gba is only 802 m3 less than 50 of the national average and the per capita water resources of the core cities like sz hk and mo are less than 200 m3 water use of gba are highly depend on river supply shi et al 2018 and more severe and frequent drought events had occurred in gba in recent years deng et al 2018 besides the uncertainty of upstream runoff and downstream saltwater intrusion cause dual negative influences on the water supply of gba therefore water supply safety in gba is facing huge challenge during dry period liu et al 2018 according to the document outline development plan for the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area issued by central committee of the communist party of china and the state council in 2019 in order to build the international first class bay area it s necessary to strength the unified scheduling of water resources of the pearl river basin therefore a scientific and rational allocation of water resources is an important support for ensuring the water supply safety in gba the current study took the 9 prefecture level cities of the prd as the research unit and set 2010 2019 as the basis period and 2030 as the planning period industries water demand social and economic statistic data were downloaded from guangdong province water resources bulletin guangdong statistical yearbook prefecture level cities water resources bulletin and statistical yearbook due to the different aims of development and the statistic method the industrial water classification and social economic statistic of hk and mo are quite different from those of the prefecture level cities in the prd meanwhile ensuring water supply safety to hk and mo is a political requirement therefore the current study would not evaluate the water supply safety of hk and mo and the water distribution priority of the two cities would be higher than the most important water demand points in prefecture level cities 4 results 4 1 water supply safety of dm id ag and eco in each city and industry in gba the parameter values a 4 5789 b 3 0429 were obtained according to eqs 7 and 8 thus the logistic curve model of water supply safety was shown as 23 y i j 1 1 4 5789 e 3 0429 x i the grading value of each indicator was firstly standardized and then substituted into eq 23 the four grading threshold values of the logistic curve were respectively calculated as 0 2027 0 3878 0 6122 0 7973 and they were substituted into eq 10 to calculate the four grading threshold values of water supply safety evaluation unsafe s 0 2027 less safe 0 2027 s 0 3878 normal 0 3878 s 0 6122 more safe 0 6122 s 0 7973 safe s 0 7973 the relative error analysis of the calculated graded logistic curve index values and the graded initial logistic curve index target values were 1 37 3 04 2 03 and 0 34 respectively indicating the reliability of the calculated logistic curve index model the logistic curve index values of water resources background conditions were calculated with the logistic curve index values of water use in dm id ag and eco the water supply safety of dm id ag and eco in each city from 2010 to 2019 were obtained according to eq 10 from 2010 2019 the annual average of the dm water supply safety of gba fig 3 was 0 486 which was in the normal range the dm water supply safeties of gz sz and dg were in a relatively less safe range all year round with the average values of 0 331 0 358 and 0 375 respectively it showed that the per capita surface water resources of the three cities are lower than the average level of gba and their water resources endowments are poor together with huge dm water use pressure caused by large urban population compared with gz and sz dg s population growth was relatively slow and the daily per capita dm water demand was decreasing year by year therefore the dm water supply pressure was relieved to a certain extent the upward trend indicated that the dm water supply safety of dg had gradually improved gz and sz should consider controlling the population and improving dm water use efficiency in the future to ease dm water supply pressure the annual average of the id water supply safety of gba fig 4 was 0 534 which was also in the normal range the id water supply safety of sz dropped from 0 440 in 2010 0 356 in 2019 and the level changed from normal to less safe it showed that sz s id output value ranked first among the 9 cities and it has been in a state of rapid growth for a long time moreover sz s id water consumption rate was relatively high resulting in continuous deterioration of id water supply safety the id water supply safety of dg dropped from 0 451 in 2010 0 414 in 2019 which was close to a less safe range the reason is that the id output value of dg also increased significantly from 2010 to 2018 and its id water consumption rate was higher than other cities indicating limited id water saving capacity in dg the id water supply safety of gz increased from 0 362 in 2010 0 456 in 2019 and the level changed from less safe to normal this result indicated that the level of id water supply safety of gz has been increased due to the synergism of the slowdown in the growth of id scale and the improvement of id water use efficiency as to the ag water supply safety of gba fig 5 the annual average was still in the normal range and there were no cities with less safe or unsafe range all the year round the ag water supply safety of zq dropped from 0 452 in 2010 0 359 in 2019 and the level changed from normal to less safe mainly due to the large increased output value of agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery and the average per mu water consumption of farmland irrigation the ag structure of zq could be adjusted appropriately such as planting crops with low water demand and high economic value in order to seek a balance between ag economic development and water supply security the output value of agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery as well as the per mu water demand of farmland irrigation in zh was low thus it has been in a relatively safe range for a long time the annual average water supply safety of eco in gba fig 6 was in the normal range and there were no cities with less safe and unsafe range the annual average water supply safety of eco in jm and zq were 0 697 and 0 741 respectively which were close to the safe range that was because the two cities had less eco water demand and more surface water resources and the eco water demand was easy to meet in gz sz fs and dg the eco water demand was relatively large and the amount of surface water resources was relatively small thus the eco water supply safety was relatively low the eco water supply safety in sz dropped from 0 421 in 2010 0 362 in 2019 and the grade changed from normal to less safe therefore there is a certain risk in the future water supply safety of eco in sz and it is necessary to rationally manage eco water demand to sum up the water supply safety degree of gba varies with regions and water industries for example sz and dg have low water supply safety of dm and id while high water supply safety of ag zq has low water supply safety in ag while high water supply safety of id and eco the four water industries in gz are all low in water supply safety in recent years drought events have occurred frequently in the prd and gba faces a more severe challenge of water supply security tu et al 2017 zhou et al 2022 it is of practical significance to ensure water supply security of the important water use sectors in the key cities of gba 4 2 the prediction results by the es model the water demands of the nine cities in 2030 were predicted by the es model table 2 as shown in table 2 the total water demands of the nine cities are lower than the request of the limitation set by the government the total water demands of gz and sz are obviously higher than the limitation target while zh and zs are lightly higher than the limitation target given this the cities could consider the water rights transaction and the cities with water surplus sell the water rights to the cities with water shortage xu et al 2019 the total water demands and evaluation indicator data of the nine cities predicted by the es model were used to calculate water supply safety and determine water distribution priority offset in the weap model in 2030 4 3 setting of the weap model the observed water use in 2019 and predicted water demand in 2030 for each city were used to carry out the water allocation in gba during dry year based on the water source conditions and water supply relationship of each city a total of 38 water demand points were set up among which each city was divided into 4 water demand points dm id ag and eco hk and mo were respectively generalized into 1 total water demand point each demand point was connected to the water source including west river north river east river water transfer projects wtp and reservoirs res in various cities the number and water supply s ability of wtp were different in 2019 and 2030 in 2019 only two wtp of gz existed while in 2030 there will be four wtp including the prd water resources allocation engineering the minimize flow requirements of rivers were set in the weap model for north river and east river the flow requirements were the minimized ecological flow for west river the flow requirement not only includes ecological flow but also includes the critical upstream runoff for withstanding salt tide intrusion which allows the pumping station could draw fresh water for the coastal cities like zh and mo the generalized water allocation map of gba by the weap model was shown in fig 7 under the same water industry the lower regional water supply safety the higher water distribution priority of water industry demand point in this region considering the stable water supply to hk and mo in scheme 4 the river ecological flow requirement would be satisfied first hk and mo were the second after that the water distribution priority for each region and water industry was determined by sorting the water supply safety of gba evaluated by the logistic curve model table 3 4 4 the comparison and analysis of the four water allocation schemes from scheme1 the water satisfaction rate of each city was above 90 in 2019 and 99 in 2030 fig 8 however the flow requirements of west river and north river were not satisfied 99 2 in 2019 99 4 in 2030 and the flow requirements of east river was also not satisfied 92 9 in 2019 the reason for the unsatisfied flow requirements is the same priority of flow requirements and demand points under the default water distribution priority setting therefore the weap model would distribute the same water satisfaction rate for all the demand points and river s flow requirement with the same priority when water demands could not be totally satisfied scheme 2 prioritized the river flow requirement and the flow requirements of three rivers were fully satisfied fig 9 compared with scheme 1 the water satisfaction rate of each city was decreased gz sz and dg s domestic and hk s total water satisfaction rate were 88 2 in 2019 that was because water resources could not satisfy all the water demands in the dry period and the water distribution priority of dm in gz sz and dg are in the same order as id ag and eco water demand points resulting in the same water satisfaction rate of different water industry demand points in 2030 the water satisfaction rate of dm demand points in fs zh and zs were 92 7 in mo was 94 0 while other dm demand points were higher than 99 as shown in scheme 3 fig 10 in 2019 water satisfaction rate of dm of gz sz and dg and hk increased from 88 2 to 100 99 6 99 6 99 6 while in 2030 water satisfaction rate of dm of fs zh and zs and mo were increased from 92 7 92 7 92 7 and 94 0 94 8 therefore based on the water distribution priority determined by the importance of water industry the weap model can allocate more water to domestic water industry and raise its water satisfaction rate meanwhile in 2019 hz and zq s id water satisfaction were increasing from 96 9 99 4 100 while in 2030 water satisfaction rate of id of zq increased from 99 4 100 which also indicated that the weap model could allocate residual water to the secondary important water industry on the premise that the most important water industry has been satisfied the water industry water demand would be satisfied in order of industry importance according to the water allocation results of scheme 3 fig 11 in 2019 due to the increase of water distribution priority water satisfaction rate of hk and mo increased from 99 6 96 1 100 while water satisfaction rate of mo increased from 94 8 to 100 in 2030 similarly in 2019 water satisfaction rate of dm of sz and fs increased from 99 6 96 1 100 98 2 and water satisfaction rate of id of sz increased from 75 2 to 75 5 water satisfaction rate of ag of gz hz and zq water satisfaction increased from 76 9 94 8 99 3 79 2 95 3 100 while water satisfaction rate of dm of fs increased from 94 8 to 96 8 in 2030 however due to the total limitation of river supply although the order was higher water satisfaction rates of dg s dm and id of gz decreased from 98 9 77 4 95 5 and 76 9 in 2019 as shown in fig 11 some cities water satisfaction rates of ag and eco were the same in scheme 4 the reason is that the rivers flow would be more distributed to the regions dm demand points with higher water distribution priority thus the regions dm demand points with lower water distribution priority or id demand points would more rely on the water supply from the cities res and the ag and eco demand points could not be supplied during dry period since the cities respective res are not connected to other cities expect zh res which is connected to mo for emergency water resource and river water mainly satisfies the dm water demand points during the dry period the water distribution gini coefficient and the dm water satisfied by river supply were calculated and from schemes 1 4 the water distribution gini coefficient of scheme 4 was 0 276 in 2019 and 0 337 in 2030 which are smaller than 0 294 0 303 0 279 2019 0 351 0 360 0 339 2030 of schemes 1 3 the results showed that the improved weap model has a certain improvement effect and its rationality has been improved the reason for the small difference in water distribution gini coefficients of schemes 3 and 4 is that the rivers have limitation of water supply in the dry period thus the cities with higher dm water distribution priority do not have much improvement in the water satisfaction rate of dm also some cities with lower dm water distribution priority have less dm water consumption or weak dependence on river water supply in this case the water satisfaction rate would be less influenced when the river water supply decreases 5 discussion 5 1 future improvement of water supply in gba as can be seen from schemes 1 4 water satisfaction rates of jm zq and hz were higher in both 2019 and 2030 the reason is the urban res in the three cities have larger storage capacity which can better satisfy the water demand during dry period indicating that the res connection projects can be considered for efficiently using the larger water storage capacity of the urban res to supply water with other cities in the future as for the plans of building new urban res and filling res s storage in flood period cautions are required as an important region of national economic development gba faces with the shortage of land resources and it s hard to build more res in short term hu et al 2019 during flood period gba faces flood disasters caused by heavy rainfall and typhoon rain for many years to avoid flood disaster the res has to give timely flood discharge for reservoirs and surrounding areas safety and therefore it is unable to store as much water as possible during the flood period affecting water supply during the dry period therefore besides the res connection projects introducing information management system to accurately arrange res water storage and flood discharge may be the suitable way of easing the gba s water shortage in dry period 5 2 the advantage about the use of water distribution priority of region and industry scheme 4 shows that the request of important water industry in key cities can be preferentially satisfied by the improved weap model and the allocation results also reveal the importance of the prd water resources allocation engineering as important economically developed cities the water supply of sz and dg has long depended on the flow of east river however when the flow of east river is low during dry period sz and dg s dm and id could not be better simultaneously satisfied in 2019 even they have the higher order of water distribution priority from the water allocation results of gba in 2030 with the water supply from west river through the prd water resources allocation engineering water demands of sz and dg have been perfectly satisfied the water shortage problem of the two cities during dry period would be eased by more abundant water supplies the water shortage in 2030 could be solved by the engineering of wtp as well as the optimal water allocation scheme considering the water distribution priority the engineering of wtp is the solution from water supply side while the water distribution priority focuses water allocation from the water demand side which is the replenish of the wtp meanwhile the wtp usually involves huge number of constructions like the building of reservoirs channels and pumping stations sun et al 2021 which challenges the finances and building capacity for country or region although the function of the wtp is to improve the water supply safety it may also bring complex potential risk for both the donor and receiving areas tian et al 2019 thus the feasibility of the wtp should be evaluated based on related standards before its construction compared with the wtp water distribution priority can guarantee the water demand of important water industry in key regions based on the available water resources and water utilities minimizing the lost caused by water shortage and providing reasonable water allocation scheme which is the advantage of the improved weap model using the water distribution priority of region and industry 5 3 prospects and shortcomings in recent years with the social development and the limited water resources the water use conflicts between regions or countries surrounding transboundary rivers have been more frequent and intense avarideh et al 2017 rajosoa et al 2021 despite the distribution and sharing of water across regions and borders will involve many factors like policy the improved weap model would provide more refined and scientific water allocation schemes considering the diversity of regional economic social development and water demand this may give a scientific support for the negotiation for national or international water conflicts in the current study the logistic curve model and coefficient of variation method used in the water supply safety evaluation are both objective methods how to determine water distribution priority by adopting both subjective and objective methods can be further studied 6 conclusion in the current study the weap model was improved by considering regional and industrial water distribution priority the improved weap model was demonstrated by the water allocation of gba the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the water supply safety of gba varies with regions and water industries the economically developed cities such as sz and dg have lower water supply safety of dm and id while higher water supply safety of ag in contrast the less developed city such as zq has higher water supply safety of dm and id while lower water supply safety of ag 2 the water distribution scheme considering the regional and industrial water distribution priority can achieve higher water satisfaction rate for the important water use sectors in the key cities as well as the best fairness of water distribution and more reasonable water allocation results 3 water transfer project including water resources allocation engineering of the prd and res connection project is necessary and would greatly ease water shortage

7675,study region guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area urban agglomeration gba study focus existing water evaluation and planning system weap lacks consideration of regional and industrial water distribution priority this study proposes an improved weap model by integrating regional and industrial water distribution priority determined by water supply safety the logistic curve model was introduced for water supply safety evaluation the improved weap model was applied to the water resources allocation of gba in the year of 2019 and 2030 and the effects of water allocation schemes with different regional and industrial water distribution priorities were compared new hydrological insights of the region the results indicate that the water supply safety of each city in the gba varies with region and industry guangzhou shenzhen and dongguan have lower degree of domestic and industrial water supply safety river and reservoir connections are essential to the water supply safety of gba the water demands of shenzhen and dongguan cannot be satisfied during dry period in 2019 while perfectly satisfied during the dry period in 2030 due to the operation of water transfer projects the improved weap model obtained more reasonable water allocation results improving the water satisfaction rates of regions with low water supply safety the research demonstrates the advantage of the improved weap model considering regional and industries priority enhancing the applicability of the weap model graphical abstract ga1 keywords water distribution priority water supply safety water evaluation and planning system model guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area urban agglomeration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water resources are the key resources for social and economic development deng et al 2021 sheffield et al 2018 with the development of society and the expansion of population the need of water resources is rapidly increasing cheng et al 2018 however due to the limitation of water resources water demand cannot be satisfied totally in some areas which is aggravated by the climate change and the increase of drought events keune and miralles 2019 the conflict between water supply and demand has been deepened and became one of the main barriers to the world s sustainable development jun et al 2022 which also hinders the development of urban agglomerations especially in the developing countries zhao et al 2021 thus as an effective way of easing the conflict between water supply and demand water resources allocation is important and necessary xiao et al 2021 water resources allocation models have provided scientific support for the optimal water allocation schemes yaykiran et al 2019 water evaluation and planning system weap model is a flexible high visible and user friendly model which can help administrators to evaluate water resources by setting scenarios based on different input variables ashofteh et al 2017 in recent years the weap model has been used widely in the water resources allocation of different countries alamanos et al 2019 hund et al 2018 miraji et al 2019 and showed the applicability in water resources evaluation at basin scale amin et al 2018 khazaipoul et al 2019 calculated the monthly water distribution as the key variable of reservoir multi objective irrigation optimization using the weap model bhave et al 2020 applied the weap model to simulate the response of water resources to climate change in malawi shire basin and found that the weap model could better simulate runoff and the water level s change khalil et al 2018 applied the weap model to evaluate the relationship between water supply and demand suggesting the weap model could provide support for the effective management of water resources at basin scale in summary the weap model can not only satisfy the water resources allocation demand from different study areas but also make different allocation schemes based on the demand from researchers or truly development therefore the weap model is an important tool for rational allocation and management of regional water resources under the changing environment in the default setting of the weap model the water distribution priority of each demand point is equal and all the demand points get the same satisfaction rate when water resources could not satisfy all the demand however the water demand of important water industries has been prioritized for many places in reality wei et al 2020 also different water industries have different tolerances for water shortage for example the water shortage of agriculture has little impact on the society while the water shortage of domestic would cause heavy damage to the society at the same time as for the urban agglomeration the aim of development function positioning the level of economic and social development for each city are different therefore the water distribution priority of the same water use sector in different cities should be different and the determination of water distribution priority should fully consider the above factors the water allocation results considering the water distribution priority have been proved to be more reasonable and the water allocation scheme has been more operational safavi et al 2016 analyzed the water allocations in zayandehrud river basin and gave the key assumption for which urban demand was assigned the first priority while other demands were assigned the second priority men et al 2019 rank the priority of domestic first industry second agriculture third ecologic last in water supply during water shortage some studies set water distribution priority in the weap model for instance kou et al 2018 set domestic first industry second ecologic last as the water distribution priority in the weap model hassan et al 2019 set priority first for domestic demand and second for agricultural demand in the weap model the existing research on water distribution priority is based on the solving of the water demand of important water industry without the consideration of the social development diversity inner urban agglomeration or region moreover the existing water distribution priority applied in the weap model is usually subjectively determined and cannot properly reflect the objective situation of regional water resources exploitation as a widely used water allocation model the weap model lacks of objective water distribution priority which would affect the reliability of water allocation results especially in the urban agglomeration with different functional positioning and development goals therefore it is essential to develop a quantitative assessment method for quantifying such water distribution priority in the weap model which can develop the model for better application the water allocation of complex basin and urban agglomeration the logistic curve model is an objective growth model meadows et al 1972 and the model s characteristics can well reflect the impact of evaluation indicators on industrial water supply safety the logistic curve model has been widely used in the prediction of natural and social indicators and it has the potential to verify the reliability in the water resources safety evaluation song et al 2016 hao et al 2018 the exponential smoothing es model is a time series analysis and forecasting method proposed in the late 1950 s brown 1959 which has the advantages of simple calculation and convenient use mi et al 2018 the es model has been widely used in forecasting research and has shown its reliability yapar et al 2017 smyl 2020 given this this study aims to improve the weap model via adding the water distribution priority of region and industry for each water demand point considering the diversity and priority of regional economic social development and water use sectors and the improvement of the rationality of the water allocation schemes the logistic curve model was introduced to calculate the degree of water supply safety for determining the water distribution priority and the es model was used to predict future water demands and economic social indicators based on the water distribution priority of region and industry different water allocation schemes were obtained and compared to verify the advantage and effectiveness of the improved weap model guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area urban agglomeration gba is economically developed and densely populated and plays an important role in the national development of china the cities inner the gba are clear functional positioning and division of labor and the levels of economic social development and water use in gba show significant spatial differences meanwhile due to the dual influence of upstream runoff uncertainty and downstream salt tide intrusion the water supply safety of gba faces severe challenges particularly in dry periods yao et al 2016 moreover the pearl river delta prd water transfer project is expected to run in 2030 which would change the pattern of water supply in gba in the future and may influence the effect of water distribution priority therefore due to the rising water demand of gba and the change caused by water transfer project the improved weap model was demonstrated in water resources allocation of the gba so as to provide technical support for the rational water resources allocation of gba under the changing environment 2 methodology 2 1 weap model the weap model was developed by stockholm environment institute s u s center in 1988 it s a model used to evaluate the supply demand and allocation of water resources for region in certain space time hollermann et al 2010 yates et al 2005 in the weap model the water demand in each region can be generalized into the demand points of domestic dm industrial id agricultural ag and off stream ecological environment eco the weap model includes the waypoints like river reservoir groundwater and demand points constructs regional water resources relationship between supply demand and allocation networks by transporting water from water resources waypoints to demand waypoints through transport links and reflow meanwhile the weap model can set up different schemes according to administrators request to reveal the influences of policy change social development and water conservation on water resources allocation in the weap model any node and link should obey the water balance equation 1 w s q i q o q l where w s represents the actual water supply at each demand point q i represents the total water intake of the node q o represents the total water output from the node q l represents the loss of water consumption due to evaporation leakage and others during transportation the weap model would set satisfaction rate for each demand point 2 c r q i r r where r r represents water consumption at each demand point c r represents the water satisfaction rate of each demand point there is a competition among demand points reservoir and the flow requirement of river and the rationality of water allocation result would be influenced by the same satisfaction rate of demand points reservoir and the flow requirement of river due to the same water distribution priority in the current study four schemes were set up to demonstrate the advantage of the improved weap model fig 1 scheme 1 applied the default water distribution priority of the weap model in scheme 2 the river ecological flow requirement was given the highest water distribution priority and the demand points used the same water distribution priority scheme 3 kept the highest water distribution priority of the river ecological flow requirement and arranges the descending water distribution priority from dm id ag to eco water demand points based on scheme 3 scheme 4 further considered the regional water distribution priority of each water demand point which is determined by the water supply safety degree calculated by the logistic curve model 2 2 the construction of index evaluation system the construction of index evaluation system for each industry is built based on the principles of synthesis representativeness and data availability table 1 the vif collinearity test was made by spss software water supply safety involves the aspects of both water supply capacity and water use efficiency in the current study water resources endowment wre indicator was used to characterize water supply capacity and dm id ag and eco water use indicators were applied to characterize water use efficiency the classification standard of each indicator was determined according to the indicator data of the prefecture level cities in gba from 2010 to 2019 and the 5 35 65 and 95 quantiles value were selected as the four thresholds finally the indicator data was divided into 5 grades according to these four thresholds respectively 2 3 the logistic curve model as an objective evaluation model the logistic curve model is a generalized regression model which was firstly used to study the law of population growing verhulst 1838 leach 1981 in general the influences of population growth gdp growth and other commonly used evaluation indicators in water supply safety would not present the approximate linear relationship all the time when the evaluation indicators increase to a certain extent water resources carrying capacity would face bottleneck due to great water supply pressure which led to smaller variation of water supply safety than before even though the indicators were still growing therefore the relationship between evaluation indicators and water supply safety cannot be simply analyzed by general linear model the form of the logistic curve model is a curve with slow growth at the upper and lower bounds and a fast growth in the middle which can better express the above laws in addition compared with other evaluation models zhu and chang 2020 liu et al 2021 xiang et al 2022 the logistic curve model is concise and does not need to build more evaluation functions it can also avoid the negative impact from subjective judgement and require fewer parameter estimation therefore the current study applied the logistic curve model to evaluate the water supply safety of each region and industry for determining water distribution priority due to the different unit and orders of magnitude the original indicator should be normalized to being the input for the logistic curve model the equations of the normalization are expressed as follows 3 x ij x ij x min x max x min if the index is positive 4 x ij x max x i j x max x min if the index is negative where x ij represents the original data of indicator i for city j x max and x min respectively represent the maximum and minimum value of the original indicator x i j represents the normalized indicator i for city j the functional expression of the logistic curve model is expressed as follows 5 y ij k 1 a e b x i j where a represents the integration constant b represents the growth rate factor on request k represents the function limit value in the current study k was set to 1 which was referenced to the study of water security evaluation cai et al 2020 chang zhu 2021 y ij represents the logistic curve index value of the indicator i for city j parameters a b can be estimated using the least squares method expressed as follows 6 q a b m 1 m y m k 1 a e b x m 2 where m represents the number of grading thresholds in the evaluation index system m 4 x m represents the standardized indicator grading threshold y m represents the target value of the hierarchical initial logistic curve indicator in the current study y 1 0 2 y 2 0 4 y 3 0 6 y 4 0 8 which were according to the threshold value setting from the studies of water ecological security evaluation li et al 2022 wang bao 2021 the parameters a b are determined by eqs 7 and 8 7 b x m ln k y m 1 1 m ln k y m 1 x m x m x m 2 8 a e ln k y m 1 b x m the weight of each indicator is determined by the coefficient of variation method expressed as follows 9 ω i v i i 1 n v i where ω i represents the weight of each indicator v i represents the coefficient of variation of each indicator expression of the comprehensive indicator for the evaluation of water supply safety is expressed as follows 10 s j t i 1 n ω i y ijt where s j t represents city j s water supply safety for industry t t 1 2 3 4 which denotes dm id ag and eco the smaller the value of the city s water supply safety the worse the water supply safety situation and the more the city needs to be given the priority in the allocation of water resources in the urban agglomeration 2 4 the exponential smoothing the es model is a weighted average model which uses dynamic weight coefficients for weighing the original data and shows greater suitableness for the prediction of economic social indicators wang 2019 seong and lee 2021 according to the exponential times the es model could be divided into single es double es and triple es models respectively in the current study the double and triple es models were applied to predict economic social indicators and water demands in the planning period of 2030 the predicted evaluation indicators were used for calculating water supply safety via the logistic curve model while the predicted water demands were the inputs of water resources allocation in the weap model the model with smaller rmse would be finally selected and applied to predict indicators and water demands the double es is expressed as follows 11 y ˆ t h t l t h b t h 1 2 12 l t α y t 1 a l t 1 b t 1 13 b t β l t l t 1 1 β b t 1 where l t represents the smoothed value of the series at time

b t s t h m k 1 h 1 2 15 l t α y t s t m 1 a l t 1 b t 1 16 b t β l t l t 1 1 β b t 1 17 s t γ y t l t 1 b t 1 1 γ s t m where k represents the integer part of h 1 m and m denotes the frequency of the seasonality the equation of rmse is expressed as follows 18 rmse 1 n t n fcst t 2 ogn t 2 2 where n represents the number of time series fcst represents the simulated value ogn represents the observed value 2 5 water distribution gini coefficient to demonstrate the rationality of water allocation by the improved weap model the current study calculated water distribution gini coefficient of each water allocation scheme according to eqs 19 to 20 water distribution gini coefficient reflects the synchronization between water distribution priority and water satisfaction rate the water demand points at the front back of the water distribution priority have higher lower water satisfaction rate which means strong synchronization otherwise means weak synchronization like general gini coefficient the smaller water distribution gini coefficient means more reasonable regional water distribution scheme water distribution gini coefficient is expressed as follows 19 g 1 j 1 j p jt p jt

represents the water demand satisfaction rate for demand point in industry t of city j 3 study area and data located in the middle south of guangdong province guangdong hong kong mo greater bay area gba including nine cities of the peral river delta prd i e guangzhou gz shenzhen sz zhuhai zh foshan fs jiangmen jm zhaoqing zq dongguan dg huizhou hz zhongshan zs hong kong hk and macao mo is one of the three largest coastal urban agglomerations in china he et al 2021 fig 2 the area and population of gba only account for 1 and 5 of the whole country while its gdp accounts for 12 ma et al 2019 moreover the per capital gdp in gba only account from 20 to 50 toward other three largest bay areas in the world therefore for the further development of economic and society gba has strongly relied in water resources with the heavy development pressure and the highly request of water supply safety the per capita local water resource in gba is only 802 m3 less than 50 of the national average and the per capita water resources of the core cities like sz hk and mo are less than 200 m3 water use of gba are highly depend on river supply shi et al 2018 and more severe and frequent drought events had occurred in gba in recent years deng et al 2018 besides the uncertainty of upstream runoff and downstream saltwater intrusion cause dual negative influences on the water supply of gba therefore water supply safety in gba is facing huge challenge during dry period liu et al 2018 according to the document outline development plan for the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area issued by central committee of the communist party of china and the state council in 2019 in order to build the international first class bay area it s necessary to strength the unified scheduling of water resources of the pearl river basin therefore a scientific and rational allocation of water resources is an important support for ensuring the water supply safety in gba the current study took the 9 prefecture level cities of the prd as the research unit and set 2010 2019 as the basis period and 2030 as the planning period industries water demand social and economic statistic data were downloaded from guangdong province water resources bulletin guangdong statistical yearbook prefecture level cities water resources bulletin and statistical yearbook due to the different aims of development and the statistic method the industrial water classification and social economic statistic of hk and mo are quite different from those of the prefecture level cities in the prd meanwhile ensuring water supply safety to hk and mo is a political requirement therefore the current study would not evaluate the water supply safety of hk and mo and the water distribution priority of the two cities would be higher than the most important water demand points in prefecture level cities 4 results 4 1 water supply safety of dm id ag and eco in each city and industry in gba the parameter values a 4 5789 b 3 0429 were obtained according to eqs 7 and 8 thus the logistic curve model of water supply safety was shown as 23 y i j 1 1 4 5789 e 3 0429 x i the grading value of each indicator was firstly standardized and then substituted into eq 23 the four grading threshold values of the logistic curve were respectively calculated as 0 2027 0 3878 0 6122 0 7973 and they were substituted into eq 10 to calculate the four grading threshold values of water supply safety evaluation unsafe s 0 2027 less safe 0 2027 s 0 3878 normal 0 3878 s 0 6122 more safe 0 6122 s 0 7973 safe s 0 7973 the relative error analysis of the calculated graded logistic curve index values and the graded initial logistic curve index target values were 1 37 3 04 2 03 and 0 34 respectively indicating the reliability of the calculated logistic curve index model the logistic curve index values of water resources background conditions were calculated with the logistic curve index values of water use in dm id ag and eco the water supply safety of dm id ag and eco in each city from 2010 to 2019 were obtained according to eq 10 from 2010 2019 the annual average of the dm water supply safety of gba fig 3 was 0 486 which was in the normal range the dm water supply safeties of gz sz and dg were in a relatively less safe range all year round with the average values of 0 331 0 358 and 0 375 respectively it showed that the per capita surface water resources of the three cities are lower than the average level of gba and their water resources endowments are poor together with huge dm water use pressure caused by large urban population compared with gz and sz dg s population growth was relatively slow and the daily per capita dm water demand was decreasing year by year therefore the dm water supply pressure was relieved to a certain extent the upward trend indicated that the dm water supply safety of dg had gradually improved gz and sz should consider controlling the population and improving dm water use efficiency in the future to ease dm water supply pressure the annual average of the id water supply safety of gba fig 4 was 0 534 which was also in the normal range the id water supply safety of sz dropped from 0 440 in 2010 0 356 in 2019 and the level changed from normal to less safe it showed that sz s id output value ranked first among the 9 cities and it has been in a state of rapid growth for a long time moreover sz s id water consumption rate was relatively high resulting in continuous deterioration of id water supply safety the id water supply safety of dg dropped from 0 451 in 2010 0 414 in 2019 which was close to a less safe range the reason is that the id output value of dg also increased significantly from 2010 to 2018 and its id water consumption rate was higher than other cities indicating limited id water saving capacity in dg the id water supply safety of gz increased from 0 362 in 2010 0 456 in 2019 and the level changed from less safe to normal this result indicated that the level of id water supply safety of gz has been increased due to the synergism of the slowdown in the growth of id scale and the improvement of id water use efficiency as to the ag water supply safety of gba fig 5 the annual average was still in the normal range and there were no cities with less safe or unsafe range all the year round the ag water supply safety of zq dropped from 0 452 in 2010 0 359 in 2019 and the level changed from normal to less safe mainly due to the large increased output value of agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery and the average per mu water consumption of farmland irrigation the ag structure of zq could be adjusted appropriately such as planting crops with low water demand and high economic value in order to seek a balance between ag economic development and water supply security the output value of agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery as well as the per mu water demand of farmland irrigation in zh was low thus it has been in a relatively safe range for a long time the annual average water supply safety of eco in gba fig 6 was in the normal range and there were no cities with less safe and unsafe range the annual average water supply safety of eco in jm and zq were 0 697 and 0 741 respectively which were close to the safe range that was because the two cities had less eco water demand and more surface water resources and the eco water demand was easy to meet in gz sz fs and dg the eco water demand was relatively large and the amount of surface water resources was relatively small thus the eco water supply safety was relatively low the eco water supply safety in sz dropped from 0 421 in 2010 0 362 in 2019 and the grade changed from normal to less safe therefore there is a certain risk in the future water supply safety of eco in sz and it is necessary to rationally manage eco water demand to sum up the water supply safety degree of gba varies with regions and water industries for example sz and dg have low water supply safety of dm and id while high water supply safety of ag zq has low water supply safety in ag while high water supply safety of id and eco the four water industries in gz are all low in water supply safety in recent years drought events have occurred frequently in the prd and gba faces a more severe challenge of water supply security tu et al 2017 zhou et al 2022 it is of practical significance to ensure water supply security of the important water use sectors in the key cities of gba 4 2 the prediction results by the es model the water demands of the nine cities in 2030 were predicted by the es model table 2 as shown in table 2 the total water demands of the nine cities are lower than the request of the limitation set by the government the total water demands of gz and sz are obviously higher than the limitation target while zh and zs are lightly higher than the limitation target given this the cities could consider the water rights transaction and the cities with water surplus sell the water rights to the cities with water shortage xu et al 2019 the total water demands and evaluation indicator data of the nine cities predicted by the es model were used to calculate water supply safety and determine water distribution priority offset in the weap model in 2030 4 3 setting of the weap model the observed water use in 2019 and predicted water demand in 2030 for each city were used to carry out the water allocation in gba during dry year based on the water source conditions and water supply relationship of each city a total of 38 water demand points were set up among which each city was divided into 4 water demand points dm id ag and eco hk and mo were respectively generalized into 1 total water demand point each demand point was connected to the water source including west river north river east river water transfer projects wtp and reservoirs res in various cities the number and water supply s ability of wtp were different in 2019 and 2030 in 2019 only two wtp of gz existed while in 2030 there will be four wtp including the prd water resources allocation engineering the minimize flow requirements of rivers were set in the weap model for north river and east river the flow requirements were the minimized ecological flow for west river the flow requirement not only includes ecological flow but also includes the critical upstream runoff for withstanding salt tide intrusion which allows the pumping station could draw fresh water for the coastal cities like zh and mo the generalized water allocation map of gba by the weap model was shown in fig 7 under the same water industry the lower regional water supply safety the higher water distribution priority of water industry demand point in this region considering the stable water supply to hk and mo in scheme 4 the river ecological flow requirement would be satisfied first hk and mo were the second after that the water distribution priority for each region and water industry was determined by sorting the water supply safety of gba evaluated by the logistic curve model table 3 4 4 the comparison and analysis of the four water allocation schemes from scheme1 the water satisfaction rate of each city was above 90 in 2019 and 99 in 2030 fig 8 however the flow requirements of west river and north river were not satisfied 99 2 in 2019 99 4 in 2030 and the flow requirements of east river was also not satisfied 92 9 in 2019 the reason for the unsatisfied flow requirements is the same priority of flow requirements and demand points under the default water distribution priority setting therefore the weap model would distribute the same water satisfaction rate for all the demand points and river s flow requirement with the same priority when water demands could not be totally satisfied scheme 2 prioritized the river flow requirement and the flow requirements of three rivers were fully satisfied fig 9 compared with scheme 1 the water satisfaction rate of each city was decreased gz sz and dg s domestic and hk s total water satisfaction rate were 88 2 in 2019 that was because water resources could not satisfy all the water demands in the dry period and the water distribution priority of dm in gz sz and dg are in the same order as id ag and eco water demand points resulting in the same water satisfaction rate of different water industry demand points in 2030 the water satisfaction rate of dm demand points in fs zh and zs were 92 7 in mo was 94 0 while other dm demand points were higher than 99 as shown in scheme 3 fig 10 in 2019 water satisfaction rate of dm of gz sz and dg and hk increased from 88 2 to 100 99 6 99 6 99 6 while in 2030 water satisfaction rate of dm of fs zh and zs and mo were increased from 92 7 92 7 92 7 and 94 0 94 8 therefore based on the water distribution priority determined by the importance of water industry the weap model can allocate more water to domestic water industry and raise its water satisfaction rate meanwhile in 2019 hz and zq s id water satisfaction were increasing from 96 9 99 4 100 while in 2030 water satisfaction rate of id of zq increased from 99 4 100 which also indicated that the weap model could allocate residual water to the secondary important water industry on the premise that the most important water industry has been satisfied the water industry water demand would be satisfied in order of industry importance according to the water allocation results of scheme 3 fig 11 in 2019 due to the increase of water distribution priority water satisfaction rate of hk and mo increased from 99 6 96 1 100 while water satisfaction rate of mo increased from 94 8 to 100 in 2030 similarly in 2019 water satisfaction rate of dm of sz and fs increased from 99 6 96 1 100 98 2 and water satisfaction rate of id of sz increased from 75 2 to 75 5 water satisfaction rate of ag of gz hz and zq water satisfaction increased from 76 9 94 8 99 3 79 2 95 3 100 while water satisfaction rate of dm of fs increased from 94 8 to 96 8 in 2030 however due to the total limitation of river supply although the order was higher water satisfaction rates of dg s dm and id of gz decreased from 98 9 77 4 95 5 and 76 9 in 2019 as shown in fig 11 some cities water satisfaction rates of ag and eco were the same in scheme 4 the reason is that the rivers flow would be more distributed to the regions dm demand points with higher water distribution priority thus the regions dm demand points with lower water distribution priority or id demand points would more rely on the water supply from the cities res and the ag and eco demand points could not be supplied during dry period since the cities respective res are not connected to other cities expect zh res which is connected to mo for emergency water resource and river water mainly satisfies the dm water demand points during the dry period the water distribution gini coefficient and the dm water satisfied by river supply were calculated and from schemes 1 4 the water distribution gini coefficient of scheme 4 was 0 276 in 2019 and 0 337 in 2030 which are smaller than 0 294 0 303 0 279 2019 0 351 0 360 0 339 2030 of schemes 1 3 the results showed that the improved weap model has a certain improvement effect and its rationality has been improved the reason for the small difference in water distribution gini coefficients of schemes 3 and 4 is that the rivers have limitation of water supply in the dry period thus the cities with higher dm water distribution priority do not have much improvement in the water satisfaction rate of dm also some cities with lower dm water distribution priority have less dm water consumption or weak dependence on river water supply in this case the water satisfaction rate would be less influenced when the river water supply decreases 5 discussion 5 1 future improvement of water supply in gba as can be seen from schemes 1 4 water satisfaction rates of jm zq and hz were higher in both 2019 and 2030 the reason is the urban res in the three cities have larger storage capacity which can better satisfy the water demand during dry period indicating that the res connection projects can be considered for efficiently using the larger water storage capacity of the urban res to supply water with other cities in the future as for the plans of building new urban res and filling res s storage in flood period cautions are required as an important region of national economic development gba faces with the shortage of land resources and it s hard to build more res in short term hu et al 2019 during flood period gba faces flood disasters caused by heavy rainfall and typhoon rain for many years to avoid flood disaster the res has to give timely flood discharge for reservoirs and surrounding areas safety and therefore it is unable to store as much water as possible during the flood period affecting water supply during the dry period therefore besides the res connection projects introducing information management system to accurately arrange res water storage and flood discharge may be the suitable way of easing the gba s water shortage in dry period 5 2 the advantage about the use of water distribution priority of region and industry scheme 4 shows that the request of important water industry in key cities can be preferentially satisfied by the improved weap model and the allocation results also reveal the importance of the prd water resources allocation engineering as important economically developed cities the water supply of sz and dg has long depended on the flow of east river however when the flow of east river is low during dry period sz and dg s dm and id could not be better simultaneously satisfied in 2019 even they have the higher order of water distribution priority from the water allocation results of gba in 2030 with the water supply from west river through the prd water resources allocation engineering water demands of sz and dg have been perfectly satisfied the water shortage problem of the two cities during dry period would be eased by more abundant water supplies the water shortage in 2030 could be solved by the engineering of wtp as well as the optimal water allocation scheme considering the water distribution priority the engineering of wtp is the solution from water supply side while the water distribution priority focuses water allocation from the water demand side which is the replenish of the wtp meanwhile the wtp usually involves huge number of constructions like the building of reservoirs channels and pumping stations sun et al 2021 which challenges the finances and building capacity for country or region although the function of the wtp is to improve the water supply safety it may also bring complex potential risk for both the donor and receiving areas tian et al 2019 thus the feasibility of the wtp should be evaluated based on related standards before its construction compared with the wtp water distribution priority can guarantee the water demand of important water industry in key regions based on the available water resources and water utilities minimizing the lost caused by water shortage and providing reasonable water allocation scheme which is the advantage of the improved weap model using the water distribution priority of region and industry 5 3 prospects and shortcomings in recent years with the social development and the limited water resources the water use conflicts between regions or countries surrounding transboundary rivers have been more frequent and intense avarideh et al 2017 rajosoa et al 2021 despite the distribution and sharing of water across regions and borders will involve many factors like policy the improved weap model would provide more refined and scientific water allocation schemes considering the diversity of regional economic social development and water demand this may give a scientific support for the negotiation for national or international water conflicts in the current study the logistic curve model and coefficient of variation method used in the water supply safety evaluation are both objective methods how to determine water distribution priority by adopting both subjective and objective methods can be further studied 6 conclusion in the current study the weap model was improved by considering regional and industrial water distribution priority the improved weap model was demonstrated by the water allocation of gba the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the water supply safety of gba varies with regions and water industries the economically developed cities such as sz and dg have lower water supply safety of dm and id while higher water supply safety of ag in contrast the less developed city such as zq has higher water supply safety of dm and id while lower water supply safety of ag 2 the water distribution scheme considering the regional and industrial water distribution priority can achieve higher water satisfaction rate for the important water use sectors in the key cities as well as the best fairness of water distribution and more reasonable water allocation results 3 water transfer project including water resources allocation engineering of the prd and res connection project is necessary and would greatly ease water shortage

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 need for precipitation and streamflow data for west africa water resources across the globe are under significant pressure due to rapid demographic increases with strong demand for economic activities agriculture industry leisure depending on the standard of living and quite simply subsistence according to the united nations world report on the development of water resources 2021 the consumption of blue gold will increase at a rate of approximately 1 per year until 2050 when it will be 20 30 above current levels burek et al 2016 wada et al 2016 on top of the demographic pressure there is that of climate change in west africa and central africa annual accumulations on 2011 2019 are stable relative to the 1981 2010 normal state of the climate in africa 2019 however the number of extreme events has been increasing in recent years this results in the loss of human lives and the destruction of material goods including crops in rural areas and infrastructure which is already scarce and mainly concentrated in the few urban areas located in developing countries world meteorological organization 2021 to control these risks it is important to better understand the hazard and its impact in other words it is necessary to master rainfall information in the african space in order to face the challenge of forecasting the evolution of water resources and extreme events the frequency of which has increased over the past two decades the task is all the tougher however because the observation networks rainfall stations are under equipped vandalized sparse and sometimes poorly maintained ekeu wei et al 2018 ekeu wei and blackburn 2018 according to the world meteorological organization the current observation network in africa is at one eighth of the ideal density with only 22 of stations in 2019 meeting the requirements of the global climate observing system gcos versus 57 in 2011 state of the climate in africa 2019 in addition to the problems mentioned there is the problem of access to data managed by meteorological services especially for the academic world due to their high acquisition cost bodian et al 2020 panthou et al 2014 tramblay et al 2021 1 2 state of the art there has been an increase in the design evaluation and improvement of gridded precipitation estimates gpes covering various spatio temporal windows which appear as a response to the lack of data in certain countries satgé et al 2021 2020 viana et al 2021 these products fall under three categories based on the sources of information used individually or in combination to generate them ground observation outputs of the numerical model of the globe or re analyses and estimates by satellite remote sensing the first category of gpes is obtained by spatial interpolation of rainfall measurements from several rainfall stations using kriging methods inverse distance weighting and many other methods for interpolation between rain gauges harris et al 2020 schneider et al 2014 gpes based on retrospective analyses or re analyses which make up the second category combine outputs of a numerical model with observations through data assimilation satellite observations mainly but also ground observation data are fed into atmospheric general circulation models agcms for forecasts over the few hours preceding current weather or the chosen reference period gelaro et al 2017 estimates corrected with observational data are fed back into the agcms this progressive data assimilation process produces time series fairly representative of the dynamics of certain climatic parameters such as precipitation temperature evapotranspiration etc reichle et al 2017 finally the third category of rainfall grid contains satellite precipitation estimates that are extracted from infrared and microwave recordings indeed infrared recordings make it possible to deduce the temperature of the clouds and to estimate the quantity of precipitated water on the other side satellite microwave sensors allow precipitation estimation through measuring the microwave radiation emitted or reflected by the atmosphere and earth s surface in addition to the analysis of cloud dynamics there are satellite estimates again using the infrared and microwaves of soil surface temperature and even soil humidity martens et al 2017 machine learning methods such as neural networks make it possible to take better advantage of this mass of data hsu et al 1999 1997 sun et al 2018 furthermore the ground based gpes and bias correction procedures based on physiographic indices ensure the design of more robust composite gpes that take into account satellite estimates ashouri et al 2016 2015 funk et al 2015 many studies focus on the evaluation and improvement of these various products mostly for asia and latin america and increasingly for africa this is done through direct comparisons between the precipitation series

consisting of gpcc cpc unified chirps persiann cdr mswep v1 0 jra55 ncep cfsr era i and era5 series in the context of climate change in 850 african basins tarek et al 2020 it emerges from these two types of studies that products incorporating various sources of information in particular based on ground measurements data perform better than simple ground based raw satellite based or raw re analysis products in addition products derived entirely from satellite estimates or re analyses show large biases with respect to local ground measurements timeseries these deviations have a negative impact on the modeling of crops and flows in certain geographical contexts 1 3 objectives this article aims to assess different types of gridded precipitation estimates products ground based satellite based re analysis and combined products through rainfall runoff modeling at a monthly time step and on a regional scale including basins from both west and central africa specifically this involves an evaluation of the performance of a set of 15 precipitation estimation products at a monthly time step using a hydrological calibration validation procedure our study contribution to the former ones relies on the combination of a large dataset with a wider regional scale in fact the previous studies on africa mentioned above apart from tarek et al 2020 focused on short number of isolated or transboundary basins either on west africa or central africa but not both areas at once this study includes also 9 additional gpes to the products assessed by tarek et al 2020 among which a newer version of mswep v2 2 since ground data is often scarce in these regions this evaluation is enriched with an analysis of the reliability and robustness of these products in the context of ungauged basins via a regionalization method 2 study area and data 2 1 study area our study area is made up of nineteen main basins some of which cross national boundaries the largest is the basin of the niger river which is 4200 km long and runs through guinea mali niger burkina faso benin and finally nigeria where it flows into the atlantic ocean in this region straddling tropical and equatorial area the seasons and the division into climatic categories are mainly governed by rain fig 1 the rainfall regimes vary from a desert regime in the far north in the sahara zone to more humid regimes towards the atlantic ocean and as we approach central africa cameroon congo at the same time annual accumulations vary from less than 200 mm year to more than 5000 mm year abiodun et al 2012 akinsanola et al 2017 2 2 observed streamflow dataset the flow data comes from the sierem database http www hydrosciences fr sierem developed by researchers and technicians at hydrosciences montpellier boyer et al 2006 it consists of monthly flows observed at hydrometric stations 348 stations distributed over the study area these timeseries contain different rate of gaps with majority of end dates in the 1990 s and early 2000 s ouermi et al 2019 paturel et al 2010 2 3 meteorological datasets the rainfall dataset consists of gpes based on satellite estimates arc 2 chirp v 2 chirps v 2 persiann cdr mswep v2 2

was led by the temporal coverage of sierem flow dataset table 1 summarizes the characteristics of these products by specifying the origins of the data used to create each precipitation grid and its spatial and temporal resolution there is an order of importance in the data source column the first item listed is the preponderant source of rainfall information r s g means that the estimation product comes from re analysis r reinforced by satellite estimates s and corrected with ground based data g this column makes it possible to identify and compare the various types of gpes selected for this study for hydrological modeling purposes the potential evapotranspiration data pet is taken from the cru ts v 4 00 product harris et al 2020 and is calculated by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 for modelling process both rainfall and evapotranspiration timeseries for each of the basins selected are extracted from weighted average of values of the pixels overlaying their areas for instance the weight of a pixel fully include in the basin is 1 while the weight is 0 5 for the pixel for which only mid part is inside the basin this extraction was made using scripts in r language on rstudio and java scripts on google earth engine in cases where there is only one pixel that concerns the basin the value of this pixel is directly taken as the average rainfall of the basin this latter procedure is justified by the fact that gr2m lumped model uses catchment mean areal rainfall mouelhi et al 2006 and the basins considered in this study are at least of medium size indeed the areas of the selected basins ranged from 1 279 km² to 600 000 km² 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological model this study uses the gr2m model mouelhi et al 2006 integrated into the airgr package coron et al 2017 developed in r by the french institute named institut national de recherche pour l agriculture l alimentation et l environnement inrae fig 2 this model was chosen because it has shown its robustness in many studies and is widely used by the scientific community in west and central africa kouassi et al 2013 2012 ouermi et al 2019 paturel et al 2010 sambou et al 2020 vamoryba et al 2019 3 2 gr2m model gr2m is a monthly timestep lumped model with two parameters x1 and x2 related to the production function and the transfer function respectively x1 is the storage capacity in mm while x2 is the underground exchange coefficient the input variables are the rainfall and the pet observed over the catchment area and expressed in mm the output variable of the model is the simulated flow for more details on the intermediate calculation stages of the production and transfer functions see mouelhi 2003 3 3 calibration validation method the calibration validation method makes it possible to avoid a random choice for the division of the data series klemeš 1986 our approach is based on the split sample test sst method which stipulates that the data series should be split into two parts of equal length if the series is long enough as was done in this paper initially the first 50 of the data is used for calibration and the remaining 50 for validation then the last 50 is used for calibration and the first 50 for validation the model warm up considers the year preceding the calibration sub period the longest period of availability of both hydrometric data and precipitation estimates over this study area of interest is 1984 2005 with regards to the scarcity of ground data in our area of interest 21 years appear as a quite long timeseries likewise while 21 years may seem short in a climate perspective with a climate normal computed on 30 years several studies have shown that as little as 8 years could be sufficient to calibrate a hydrological model arsenault et al 2018 singh and bárdossy 2012 other authors in the same region only used 10 years for calibration of hydrological models for instance dembélé et al 2020 poméon et al 2017 then to limit the impact of gaps in hydrometric series on the modelling the selection of hydrometric stations was based on a maximum gap rate of 50 over the periods 1986 1995 and 1996 2005 table 2 based on this gap threshold 68 hydrometric stations were retained for the calibration validation procedure using the granddam database tramblay et al 2021 we made sure that the basins corresponding to the selected hydrometric stations were not or only slightly impacted by dams or human activities both 1985 and 1995 data are used for the model warm up for respectively sst1 and sst2 periods the spatial visualization of these stations and corresponding basins can be found in the fig 3 fig 4 shows temporality of the available data for the different hydrometric stations selected 3 4 model calibration criteria kge2 according to its name in the airgr package a modified formulation of the kling and gupta efficiency criteria kge was chosen as the criterion function for evaluating the performance of hydrological models kling et al 2012 1 kge 2 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 with r i 1 n s i μ s o i μ o i 1 n s i μ s 2 i 1 n o i μ o 2 β μ s μ o γ cv s cv o σ s μ s σ o μ o s i stand for simulated flow for month i and o i for observed flow for the same month i r is the correlation coefficient between the simulated flows and the observed flows β is the bias ratio between the mean of the simulated flows μs and the mean of the observed flows μo in mm γ is the variability ratio between the coefficients of variation cv o resp cv s represents the coefficient of variation of the observed flow resp simulated flow σ o resp σ s represents the standard deviation of the observed flow resp simulated flow in mm the use of the variability ratio as a replacement for the standard deviation ratio initially included in the formulation of the kge gupta et al 2009 makes it possible to remove the cross correlation between the factors β and γ the interpretation of kge2 differs from that of nse nash sutcliffe efficiency if s i μ o nse 0 whereas kge 0 41 kge2 must therefore be interpreted from the point of view of its components r β and γ knoben et al 2019 it makes possible to evaluate the capacity of a model to reproduce the temporal dynamics parameter r and the conservation of the duration of the flows parameters β and γ in addition kge2 tends towards the smallest of the triplet of factors r β γ thus allowing a hydrological interpretation of the results for example if kge2 0 85 this means that the smallest of the factors r β or γ is close to or slightly above 0 85 the calculation of the kge2 criterion was carried out using the square root of the flows in order to give the same weight to the different parts of the flood hydrograph low water high water and mean water 3 5 model performance evaluation first of all the performance of the precipitation products was measured by the hydrological model performance over the calibration period three elements were then considered to judge the performance of the products these are the median of the kge2 values the min max distance difference between the maximum value of kge2 and the minimum value of kge2 over all the catchments for a given rainfall product and the interquartile distance iq q3 q1 q1 first quartile q3 third quartile unlike kge2 the best value of which must be close to 1 the min max and interquartile distances must be as close as possible to 0 for better model performance then the validation performance was evaluated using the robustness ratio dakhlaoui et al 2017 in addition to the previous elements via the following formula 2 robustness ratio kge 2 val receiver kge 2 cal receiiver kge 2 cal receiver where kge 2 val receiver designates the validation performance over the receiver validation period period using the parameters resulting from the calibration over the donor calibration period period and kge 2 cal receiver is the calibration performance over the receiver period ouermi et al 2019 the advantage of this formula in the context of our study area is to minimize the influence of the differences in monthly flow gaps between the calibration and validation periods on the performance of the models since the ratios are mostly negative the median and 3rd quartile absolute values of the ratios were retained for our analysis the more the ratio tends towards 0 the more robust the model similarly the more the median and 3rd quartile absolute values of the ratio tend towards 0 the more robust the model 3 6 regionalization adaptation of oudin s method since hydroclimatic data is often very incomplete in west and central africa regionalization techniques could be a good alternative for hydrological modeling on ungauged and data scarce basins siderius et al 2018 vamoryba et al 2019 our objective is to determine whether a regionalization method coupled with satellite products makes it possible to preserve the performance of hydrological modeling the regionalization method oudin et al 2008 chosen is based on the selection of sets of parameters from the calibration on neighboring basins geographical neighborhood or other which are used in turn for the validation on the target basin the final flow is the mean of the various simulated flows based on the work of defrance et al 2014 we chose the three closest geographical neighbors by considering the centroid of the basins in order to spatially assess the performance of the regionalization method an index was calculated for each basin 3 variation kge 2 regionalisation kge 2 local kge 2 local 4 results 4 1 overall performance of precipitation datasets the calibration and validation of the gr2m model was carried out for each of the pairs of periods listed in table 2 fig 5 presents the violins of the values of the kge2 score of the 15 rainfall products for the pairs of calibration validation periods sst1 and sst2 hereinafter respectively denoted pair sst1 and pair sst2 and the 68 stations selected the rainfall products are arranged from left to right according to decreasing median value of kge2 in calibration cal for calibration and val for validation the violins are read like a boxplot min max median and 1st and 3rd quartiles but with additional information the width of the violins is proportional to the number of values and thus transcribes the distribution of values to determine which is the best product we decided to use various indicators related to kge2 in calibration and validation and the robustness criterion in calibration the median min max and interquartile distances iqr of the kge2 values were considered in validation the median kge2 and the median and 3rd quartile of the absolute values of the robustness ratio were used we emphasize more on kge2 value in calibration than its value in validation because we assume that if the good performance of the model is carried over from calibration to validation period the model is likely to have a better temporal transferability for future application fig 5 illustrates the interest of a determination based on criteria other than just the median value of kge2 in calibration or in validation a product that is good in calibration is not necessarily good in validation for example chirp merra 2 prectot and prectotcorr era5 and cpc and vice versa also the difference between the median values of kge2 in calibration cal and validation val for these gpes is very important this demonstrates the interest of taking robustness into account eq 2 in addition the iqr and min max of the kge2 values make it possible to determine whether the modeling performance of the gpes products carries over to a variety of catchment areas and incidentally to various geographical and climatic zones fig 5 also shows that the shape of the violins is not symmetrical in calibration just like the box there are more high values than low values this implies that for most of the basins selected the gr2m model integrates the various rainfall products well even if these products are very different from each other in validation the shape of the violins is more symmetrical we then implemented a ranking grid that assigns a number of points according to the rank obtained the better the rank of a product the more points the product is given 150 points for the best product 10 points for the worst for example table 3 indicates the number of points allocated to rainfall products according to the rank of the median value of kge2 obtained in calibration for the pair sst1 when comparing the pairs sst1 and sst2 the ranking of the rainfall products is not the same but we still generally find the same products in the first half and in the second half of the results there is also a diversity of performances for the same type of product some are good others are not on the other hand the gpes resulting from re analyses alone are poor for both pairs of periods table 4 summarizes the scores of each rainfall product according to the 6 criteria chosen in our approach the following lessons can be learned the best calibration product is chirps which combines ground re analysis and satellite data with a total of 770 900 it is ranked ahead of products like cru 680 900 and gpcc 670 900 which are based on ground observations alone the best product in validation is wfdei cru combination of re analysis and ground data with a total of 820 900 ahead of tamsat 810 900 and persiann cdr 800 900 which are combinations of satellite and ground data chirps 770 900 and cru 700 900 are ranked 4th and 5th in validation the worst products are merra era 5 re analysis and re analysis ground data and cpc ground data chirp satellite and re analysis unlike the version corrected with ground data chirps has poor results only 4 other products are less effective products based only on re analyses or only on satellite outputs or composites of the two are not very effective chirp era5 merra overall the best products are either composites of ground re analysis satellite data or based on ground data only which shows the importance of ground data the poor performance of the cpc product may be linked to the low density of the stations that were used to generate it for our study area since the robustness ratio reflects a deviation from kge2 in calibration it is essential that the value of kge2 in calibration be good to take this into account we have established a definitive ranking based on a mean between the performance in calibration and that in validation reduced to a score out of 20 table 5 table 5 confirms the observations made for table 4 chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations is the best product followed by wfdei cru and cru there is a big difference between the chirps product and the raw chirp version without ground data products based on ground data alone except cpc are always well ranked among the satellite ground re analysis composite products chirps clearly stands out from the other 4 in particular mswep and arc2 of the two products dedicated to africa tamsat and arc2 only the first is up to expectations with a good position of 4th out of 15 versus 10th place for arc2 4 2 spatial performance of precipitation datasets spatial analysis shows whether satellite products systematically lead to poor good model performance in a given geographical area it also makes it possible to determine the influence of the size of the basins on the performance of the gpes associated with the gr2m model our analysis is based on a subdivision of our study area into two subsets west africa wa and northern central africa ca fig 6 presents the mean values of kge2 in validation for the two pairs sst1 and sst2 we have chosen the threshold of 0 6 as the minimum acceptable value kling et al 2012 this figure exhibits a balanced performance of the gr2m model for a given rainfall product among the 7 best gridded precipitation estimates table 5 between wa and ca areas in fact colors observed on wa are quite the same over ca this balanced result is not observed with poorly ranked rainfall products such as merra2 prectot and prectotcorr era5 and cpc these latter products performances seem worst over ca as colors are fully red and dark red apart from cpc kge2 0 7 while on wa yellow and blue colors can be observed on few basins kge2 0 7 however singularities appear for certain basins for which almost all the rainfall products lead to poor model performance kge2 0 6 there can be many reasons for this and a more detailed analysis of the data and results provides some explanations the data is too incomplete or the mouelhi gr2m model cannot be adapted to the basins because the hydrological regime of these basins is of a complex nature often the case of large basins that cover multiple rainfall regimes or because the basin is heavily anthropized these basins in question are cossi and baranama medium sized basins on the niger and niamey a bigger basin located downstream of the inner niger delta ind logone gana on the chari and soubré on the sassandra located downstream of the buyo hydroelectric dam in côte d ivoire fig 7 provides a comparative summary of the minimum maximum quartiles and means of kge2 obtained over west africa wa and northern central africa ca for the pairs sst1 and sst2 this figure is subdivided into 8 blocks on the basis of 3 pieces of information the study area wa or ca the calibration validation period pairs sst1 and sst2 and the processing phase calibration or validation the results presented in fig 7 are summarized in table 6 for the entire set of gpes comparisons of kge2 values shows slight differences depending on statistical specifications analyzed min max 1st and 3rd quartiles and median indeed there is globally a slight drop of mean values of kge2 in calibration from sst1 to sst2 for both areas wa median of the means going from 0 86 to 0 84 for the top 7 from 0 81 to 0 78 for the others and ca median of the means going from 0 81 to 0 78 for the top 7 range of means from 0 75 to 079 0 70 077 for the 8 others gpes this drop is also observed in validation on both wa from range of means 0 69 0 74 0 68 0 74 for top 7 gpes from median of means 0 56 0 54 for the 8 remaining and ca from 0 54 to 0 48 for the 8 bottom gpes it is only in validation phase for the 7 best products that kge2 mean values are slightly increasing from median 0 66 0 68 from sst1 to sst2 over ca such overall drop from sst1 to sst2 is also observed for median and 3rd quartiles with little exceptions min and max values are more mixed besides kge2 values in calibration and validation are globally higher on wa than in ca this fact is stressed by the important number of values in bold for wa related columns in table 6 it finally appears that there are more differences between ca and wa than between the ssts fig 8 presents the values of the quartiles of kge2 according to the size of the basins in the sst period pairs table 7 is a summary of the results presented by fig 8 the performance of the gr2m models in terms of quartiles according to the size of the basins resembles a flat bell curve the best values are obtained for the 2 intermediate classes of surface area of the basins studied the products ranked in our top 7 for overall performance table 5 still have better results than the remaining 8 4 3 regionalization adaptation of oudin s method fig 9 presents violin graphs of the kge2 values obtained by the regionalization procedure reg2 oudin et al 2008 in comparison to an in situ calibration local as expected the regionalization method generally leads to a loss of performance while preserving the median kge2 above 0 5 for the majority of satellite products increases in performance can be seen when it comes to the lower rated rainfall products however the performance criteria remain low much lower than those obtained with the best rainfall products the five best rainfall products for the pairs sst1 and sst2 are four mixed products with a main satellite component tamsat chirps arc2 and persiann cdr and a wfdei cru corrected re analysis product among these five best products three were in the previous top five chirps wfdei cru and tamsat and two were lower in the ranking persiann cdr and arc2 the summary presented by table 8 is an adaptation of the performance assessment method proposed above table 4 it shows according to the criterion of median kge2 a relative conservation of the ranking in terms of overall performance of the precipitation products it should be noted however that the product arc2 which was ranked 10th in table 5 now went up 6 places in the ranking table 9 persiann cdr and tamsat only went up two and three places respectively in addition the min max and interquartile distance criteria confirm that the regionalization presents a sharp drop in performance in certain basins as shown in fig 8 this is even the case for well ranked products such as cru and gpcc which are now in 7th and 9th place table 9 fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of the mean rate of variation between the kge2s in local validation and the kge2s resulting from the regionalization procedure for the sst1 and sst2 pairs the results are globally balanced between wa and ca also there is bluer variation 0 1 for the gpes ranked lower in table 5 this reflects a positive impact of regionalization on the performance of these products the result is reversed for the good gpes based only on ground observations cru and gpcc with an increase in the interquartile distance q1 q3 of the kge2 values table 8 due to a drop in the kge2 value of more than 20 for the majority of basins fig 10 variation 0 2 5 discussion 5 1 importance of bias correction and the quality of data source in gpes performances the mixed product chirps satellite re analysis and ground data appears to be the best product overall in our study area when using the gr2m model mouelhi version it is followed by products based on ground observations and products based on re analysis and satellite coupled with ground observations it is therefore noted that the integration of ground observation data strongly influences the ability of a rainfall product to reproduce good validation with the gr2m model the comparison of the chirps product to its raw chirp version free of ground data is explicit from this point of view the differences between the raw version and the version adjusted using ground observations are more nuanced with the re analysis products merra 2 prectotcorr and merra 2 prectot this result highlights the ineffectiveness of the bias correction method of the corrected version merra 2 prectotcorr on our study area it is also important to note that no raw re analysis or satellite product could obtain an overall score greater than or equal to 12 in our ranking table 5 mixed products seem more appropriate for good modeling of the rainfall runoff relationship however the density of the climate stations and the quality of the raw satellite data are sources of sometimes significant differences between satellite based gpes even in the top five p datasets furthermore specificities of algorithms and observed rainfall datasets for algorithms calibration or bias correction of output timeseries amplify these differences among the gpes despite both tamsat and chirps approaches are mainly based on cold cloud duration ccd rainfall estimates from satellite thermal infrared recording chirps has a better performance especially tamsat relies on meteosat tir imagery provided by the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat while chirps relies on two geosynchronous tir archives the 1981 2008 globally gridded satellite grisat archive produced by noaa s national climate data center and the 2000 present noaa climate prediction center dataset cpc tir however the asset of chirps is that it also includes tropical rainfall measuring mission 2b31 microwave precipitation estimates cmorph microwave plus infrared based precipitation estimates monthly mean geostationary infrared brightness temperatures and land surface temperature estimates in addition to a wider meteorological database funk et al 2015 maidment et al 2017 likewise wfdei cru and wfdei gpcc rely on watch forcing data methodology applied to the reanalysis era interim data nevertheless cru data have a higher spatial resolution 0 5 compared to gpcc 1 linked with a better density of ground stations providing observed rainfall weedon et al 2014 as a result wfdei cru resp cru shows better performances for rainfall runoff modelling than wfdei gpcc resp gpcc on the basins considered in this study the arc2 product developed especially for the african continent does not perform well in hydrological modeling the tamsat product also developed for the african continent did better 4th place in our overall ranking if both products are based on eumetsat ir database tamsat includes 30 min prior to july 2006 and 15 min till july 2006 tir imagery unlike arc2 which includes 3 hourly ir data algorithms employed are also different novella and thiaw 2013 among the ground observation products cpc performs much worse than cru and gpcc this is probably related to the spatial density of the stations over west and central africa which are involved in the design of these ground observation data based gpes this study focused on old products due to the availability of the data before the year 2000 new emerging products of the same type as chirp raw satellite estimates not corrected with ground data like gpm imerg early and late run and gsmap real time seem to show less differences with respect to their corrected versions than observed between chirp and chirps the corrected version for instance dembele et al 2020 obtain results similar to ours with the same precipitation estimates products but with a different hydrological model mhm operating with a daily timestep over the volta basin in africa on the other hand jiang and bauer gottwein using the hbv model with a daily timestep on basins in china show that the performance of the imerg e raw and imerg f corrected versions is similar jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 they also show that imerg e has advantages over trmm 3b42 even though the latter is adjusted with gpcc data the quality of gpm imerg products can be attributed to the coupling of various satellite sources and sensors microwave and infrared with fine temporal resolution precipitation data from synoptic stations gsmap rt has also showed a better performance to estimate rainfall at daily timestep over west africa when compared to its gauge corrected version satgé et al 2020 5 2 spatial and temporal consistency of performance of rainfall estimation products following the overall analysis of the performance of the gr2m model on both sst period pairs and the associated basins with the gridded precipitation estimates as forcing data a study of the spatial performance was carried out the first objective was to see the effectiveness of the estimation products in the two major geographical areas of west africa with a greater number of basins and central africa which is less represented it appears while taking into account the asymmetry in terms of number that the overall performance of gpes is better on wa with higher values compared to ca fig 6 this fact is shown in fig 6 by a greater density of blue coloring over wa also kge2 values are globally greater in sst1 than in sst2 nevertheless slight variations are observed depending on the quartile and the gpe considered fig 7 shows an increase in kge2 min and max values in calibration and validation on the sst2 period pair for the wa zone compared to sst1 period pair for the top seven p datasets that is more mitigated for ca zone in order to better understand the impact of the choice of the study period on the performance of the gr2m model a study of the statistical characteristics of the precipitation data was undertaken but not presented here the cru rainfall product was used as reference data for the study of the stationary or non stationary nature of the time series as well as for the detection of possible breaks in the mean this study shows that 82 of the series are non stationary in wa versus 43 in ca breaks are detected in the non stationary series around 1990 1994 the year of rupture is generally 1993 and there are more ruptures in the wa zone 56 for wa 47 for ca the post 1993 period is wetter than 1980 1993 period unlike wa the ca zone is under the influence of the equatorial regime resulting in a mixed hydrological regime 2 maxima and 2 minima per year thus mean biases of the top 7 gpes over sahel region in wa evaluated by satgé et al 2020 in the range 0 85 1 15 are better compensated by gr2m when calibrating the model on 1996 2005 and validating on 1986 1995 the analysis of fig 8 highlights an influence of the surface area of the basins on the performance of the gr2m model characterized by a slight drop in performance below 8300 km² and above 80 000 km² for both sst period pairs we can conclude that the influence of the catchment area is not a major factor in the performance of the gr2m model unlike the choice of the calibration validation period the latter criterion leads to greater variations in performance than the former 5 3 regionalization efficiency the application of a regionalization method leads to a different ranking of the p datasets than that observed previously the performance of satellite products like arc2 persiann cdr tamsat and mswep improves this observation testifies to the fact that the regionalization reduces the impact of the biases in these precipitation series on flow simulation these biases are often linked to tendencies of gpes to overestimate or underestimate rainfall amount in certain localities satgé et al 2020 in addition the results in the inner niger delta are improved following the calibration on the 1996 2005 wet period and the validation on the 1986 1995 dry period for the majority of the precipitation estimation products the cause could be the strong influence of precipitation and runoff upstream on the hydrological conditions of the ind which is accentuated in the wet period indeed since rainfall is low there 500 mm year it has a very slight or delayed influence on runoff in the region although the decrease in robustness of the observation products is in agreement with previous work on regionalization the cru product is better than the gpcc product the reason for this difference must lie in the larger mesh of the observation stations involved in the design of cru ts v4 00 harris et al 2020 in our study area in our work we have limited ourselves to the use of an adaptation of the method of spatial proximity of basin centroids according to oudin et al 2008 the use of other methods based on krige and multicriteria similarity among basins could improve the positive effect of regionalization on rainfall runoff model performance goswami et al 2007 6 conclusion our work made it possible to evaluate a set of 15 p datasets three based only on ground observation data cpc v 1 cru ts v 4 00 and gpcc v 7 six based on reanalysis era5 jra 55 adj merra 2 prectot merra 2 prectotcorr wfdei cru wfdei gpcc and six based on satellite data arc v 2 chirp v 2 chirps v 2 persiann cdr mswep v2 2 tamsat v3 0 the approach used is based on the outputs of the gr2m hydrological model fed with gpes as forcing data as well as on a regionalization according to the near neighbor spatial method the results prove the usefulness of ground observation data insofar as the best p datasets are those corrected with ground data such as gpcc gpcp and cru of course the gpcc and cru observation based gpes performed well on the majority of the basins as for the poor performance of the cpc observation product it highlights the need for a good mesh of rainfall stations for the constitution of gridded precipitation estimates the blended product chirps combines ground observations from great international and national meteorological databases with re analysis timeseries and satellite estimates furthermore from a spatial point of view the chirps results are balanced over ca and wa regionalization by the near neighbor method defrance et al 2014 oudin et al 2008 shows that some previously poorly ranked products such as tamsat persiann cdr and arc2 become usable more complex regionalization methods could further improve model outputs for a larger number of gpes the period of availability of both hydrometric data and p datasets led us to limit ourselves to 15 p datasets over the period 1985 2005 it would be advantageous however to look into the use of more recent products which are promising according to the recent bibliography in certain regions of the world particularly in asia such as cmorph gsmap and gpm imerg for hydrological modeling in the wa and ca zone even in their raw version without ground observation these products manage to reproduce what is observed on the ground well credit authorship contribution statement christopher kouakou developed the

the method of regionalization by spatial proximity causes an overall drop in the ability of the various precipitation products to reproduce discharge most notably with wfdei gpcc and gpcc chirps remains the best product in terms of kge2 values in regionalization graphical abstract ga1 keywords gridded precipitation estimates gr2m west africa central africa re analysis observed data data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 need for precipitation and streamflow data for west africa water resources across the globe are under significant pressure due to rapid demographic increases with strong demand for economic activities agriculture industry leisure depending on the standard of living and quite simply subsistence according to the united nations world report on the development of water resources 2021 the consumption of blue gold will increase at a rate of approximately 1 per year until 2050 when it will be 20 30 above current levels burek et al 2016 wada et al 2016 on top of the demographic pressure there is that of climate change in west africa and central africa annual accumulations on 2011 2019 are stable relative to the 1981 2010 normal state of the climate in africa 2019 however the number of extreme events has been increasing in recent years this results in the loss of human lives and the destruction of material goods including crops in rural areas and infrastructure which is already scarce and mainly concentrated in the few urban areas located in developing countries world meteorological organization 2021 to control these risks it is important to better understand the hazard and its impact in other words it is necessary to master rainfall information in the african space in order to face the challenge of forecasting the evolution of water resources and extreme events the frequency of which has increased over the past two decades the task is all the tougher however because the observation networks rainfall stations are under equipped vandalized sparse and sometimes poorly maintained ekeu wei et al 2018 ekeu wei and blackburn 2018 according to the world meteorological organization the current observation network in africa is at one eighth of the ideal density with only 22 of stations in 2019 meeting the requirements of the global climate observing system gcos versus 57 in 2011 state of the climate in africa 2019 in addition to the problems mentioned there is the problem of access to data managed by meteorological services especially for the academic world due to their high acquisition cost bodian et al 2020 panthou et al 2014 tramblay et al 2021 1 2 state of the art there has been an increase in the design evaluation and improvement of gridded precipitation estimates gpes covering various spatio temporal windows which appear as a response to the lack of data in certain countries satgé et al 2021 2020 viana et al 2021 these products fall under three categories based on the sources of information used individually or in combination to generate them ground observation outputs of the numerical model of the globe or re analyses and estimates by satellite remote sensing the first category of gpes is obtained by spatial interpolation of rainfall measurements from several rainfall stations using kriging methods inverse distance weighting and many other methods for interpolation between rain gauges harris et al 2020 schneider et al 2014 gpes based on retrospective analyses or re analyses which make up the second category combine outputs of a numerical model with observations through data assimilation satellite observations mainly but also ground observation data are fed into atmospheric general circulation models agcms for forecasts over the few hours preceding current weather or the chosen reference period gelaro et al 2017 estimates corrected with observational data are fed back into the agcms this progressive data assimilation process produces time series fairly representative of the dynamics of certain climatic parameters such as precipitation temperature evapotranspiration etc reichle et al 2017 finally the third category of rainfall grid contains satellite precipitation estimates that are extracted from infrared and microwave recordings indeed infrared recordings make it possible to deduce the temperature of the clouds and to estimate the quantity of precipitated water on the other side satellite microwave sensors allow precipitation estimation through measuring the microwave radiation emitted or reflected by the atmosphere and earth s surface in addition to the analysis of cloud dynamics there are satellite estimates again using the infrared and microwaves of soil surface temperature and even soil humidity martens et al 2017 machine learning methods such as neural networks make it possible to take better advantage of this mass of data hsu et al 1999 1997 sun et al 2018 furthermore the ground based gpes and bias correction procedures based on physiographic indices ensure the design of more robust composite gpes that take into account satellite estimates ashouri et al 2016 2015 funk et al 2015 many studies focus on the evaluation and improvement of these various products mostly for asia and latin america and increasingly for africa this is done through direct comparisons between the precipitation series

consisting of gpcc cpc unified chirps persiann cdr mswep v1 0 jra55 ncep cfsr era i and era5 series in the context of climate change in 850 african basins tarek et al 2020 it emerges from these two types of studies that products incorporating various sources of information in particular based on ground measurements data perform better than simple ground based raw satellite based or raw re analysis products in addition products derived entirely from satellite estimates or re analyses show large biases with respect to local ground measurements timeseries these deviations have a negative impact on the modeling of crops and flows in certain geographical contexts 1 3 objectives this article aims to assess different types of gridded precipitation estimates products ground based satellite based re analysis and combined products through rainfall runoff modeling at a monthly time step and on a regional scale including basins from both west and central africa specifically this involves an evaluation of the performance of a set of 15 precipitation estimation products at a monthly time step using a hydrological calibration validation procedure our study contribution to the former ones relies on the combination of a large dataset with a wider regional scale in fact the previous studies on africa mentioned above apart from tarek et al 2020 focused on short number of isolated or transboundary basins either on west africa or central africa but not both areas at once this study includes also 9 additional gpes to the products assessed by tarek et al 2020 among which a newer version of mswep v2 2 since ground data is often scarce in these regions this evaluation is enriched with an analysis of the reliability and robustness of these products in the context of ungauged basins via a regionalization method 2 study area and data 2 1 study area our study area is made up of nineteen main basins some of which cross national boundaries the largest is the basin of the niger river which is 4200 km long and runs through guinea mali niger burkina faso benin and finally nigeria where it flows into the atlantic ocean in this region straddling tropical and equatorial area the seasons and the division into climatic categories are mainly governed by rain fig 1 the rainfall regimes vary from a desert regime in the far north in the sahara zone to more humid regimes towards the atlantic ocean and as we approach central africa cameroon congo at the same time annual accumulations vary from less than 200 mm year to more than 5000 mm year abiodun et al 2012 akinsanola et al 2017 2 2 observed streamflow dataset the flow data comes from the sierem database http www hydrosciences fr sierem developed by researchers and technicians at hydrosciences montpellier boyer et al 2006 it consists of monthly flows observed at hydrometric stations 348 stations distributed over the study area these timeseries contain different rate of gaps with majority of end dates in the 1990 s and early 2000 s ouermi et al 2019 paturel et al 2010 2 3 meteorological datasets the rainfall dataset consists of gpes based on satellite estimates arc 2 chirp v 2 chirps v 2 persiann cdr mswep v2 2

was led by the temporal coverage of sierem flow dataset table 1 summarizes the characteristics of these products by specifying the origins of the data used to create each precipitation grid and its spatial and temporal resolution there is an order of importance in the data source column the first item listed is the preponderant source of rainfall information r s g means that the estimation product comes from re analysis r reinforced by satellite estimates s and corrected with ground based data g this column makes it possible to identify and compare the various types of gpes selected for this study for hydrological modeling purposes the potential evapotranspiration data pet is taken from the cru ts v 4 00 product harris et al 2020 and is calculated by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 for modelling process both rainfall and evapotranspiration timeseries for each of the basins selected are extracted from weighted average of values of the pixels overlaying their areas for instance the weight of a pixel fully include in the basin is 1 while the weight is 0 5 for the pixel for which only mid part is inside the basin this extraction was made using scripts in r language on rstudio and java scripts on google earth engine in cases where there is only one pixel that concerns the basin the value of this pixel is directly taken as the average rainfall of the basin this latter procedure is justified by the fact that gr2m lumped model uses catchment mean areal rainfall mouelhi et al 2006 and the basins considered in this study are at least of medium size indeed the areas of the selected basins ranged from 1 279 km² to 600 000 km² 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological model this study uses the gr2m model mouelhi et al 2006 integrated into the airgr package coron et al 2017 developed in r by the french institute named institut national de recherche pour l agriculture l alimentation et l environnement inrae fig 2 this model was chosen because it has shown its robustness in many studies and is widely used by the scientific community in west and central africa kouassi et al 2013 2012 ouermi et al 2019 paturel et al 2010 sambou et al 2020 vamoryba et al 2019 3 2 gr2m model gr2m is a monthly timestep lumped model with two parameters x1 and x2 related to the production function and the transfer function respectively x1 is the storage capacity in mm while x2 is the underground exchange coefficient the input variables are the rainfall and the pet observed over the catchment area and expressed in mm the output variable of the model is the simulated flow for more details on the intermediate calculation stages of the production and transfer functions see mouelhi 2003 3 3 calibration validation method the calibration validation method makes it possible to avoid a random choice for the division of the data series klemeš 1986 our approach is based on the split sample test sst method which stipulates that the data series should be split into two parts of equal length if the series is long enough as was done in this paper initially the first 50 of the data is used for calibration and the remaining 50 for validation then the last 50 is used for calibration and the first 50 for validation the model warm up considers the year preceding the calibration sub period the longest period of availability of both hydrometric data and precipitation estimates over this study area of interest is 1984 2005 with regards to the scarcity of ground data in our area of interest 21 years appear as a quite long timeseries likewise while 21 years may seem short in a climate perspective with a climate normal computed on 30 years several studies have shown that as little as 8 years could be sufficient to calibrate a hydrological model arsenault et al 2018 singh and bárdossy 2012 other authors in the same region only used 10 years for calibration of hydrological models for instance dembélé et al 2020 poméon et al 2017 then to limit the impact of gaps in hydrometric series on the modelling the selection of hydrometric stations was based on a maximum gap rate of 50 over the periods 1986 1995 and 1996 2005 table 2 based on this gap threshold 68 hydrometric stations were retained for the calibration validation procedure using the granddam database tramblay et al 2021 we made sure that the basins corresponding to the selected hydrometric stations were not or only slightly impacted by dams or human activities both 1985 and 1995 data are used for the model warm up for respectively sst1 and sst2 periods the spatial visualization of these stations and corresponding basins can be found in the fig 3 fig 4 shows temporality of the available data for the different hydrometric stations selected 3 4 model calibration criteria kge2 according to its name in the airgr package a modified formulation of the kling and gupta efficiency criteria kge was chosen as the criterion function for evaluating the performance of hydrological models kling et al 2012 1 kge 2 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 with r i 1 n s i μ s o i μ o i 1 n s i μ s 2 i 1 n o i μ o 2 β μ s μ o γ cv s cv o σ s μ s σ o μ o s i stand for simulated flow for month i and o i for observed flow for the same month i r is the correlation coefficient between the simulated flows and the observed flows β is the bias ratio between the mean of the simulated flows μs and the mean of the observed flows μo in mm γ is the variability ratio between the coefficients of variation cv o resp cv s represents the coefficient of variation of the observed flow resp simulated flow σ o resp σ s represents the standard deviation of the observed flow resp simulated flow in mm the use of the variability ratio as a replacement for the standard deviation ratio initially included in the formulation of the kge gupta et al 2009 makes it possible to remove the cross correlation between the factors β and γ the interpretation of kge2 differs from that of nse nash sutcliffe efficiency if s i μ o nse 0 whereas kge 0 41 kge2 must therefore be interpreted from the point of view of its components r β and γ knoben et al 2019 it makes possible to evaluate the capacity of a model to reproduce the temporal dynamics parameter r and the conservation of the duration of the flows parameters β and γ in addition kge2 tends towards the smallest of the triplet of factors r β γ thus allowing a hydrological interpretation of the results for example if kge2 0 85 this means that the smallest of the factors r β or γ is close to or slightly above 0 85 the calculation of the kge2 criterion was carried out using the square root of the flows in order to give the same weight to the different parts of the flood hydrograph low water high water and mean water 3 5 model performance evaluation first of all the performance of the precipitation products was measured by the hydrological model performance over the calibration period three elements were then considered to judge the performance of the products these are the median of the kge2 values the min max distance difference between the maximum value of kge2 and the minimum value of kge2 over all the catchments for a given rainfall product and the interquartile distance iq q3 q1 q1 first quartile q3 third quartile unlike kge2 the best value of which must be close to 1 the min max and interquartile distances must be as close as possible to 0 for better model performance then the validation performance was evaluated using the robustness ratio dakhlaoui et al 2017 in addition to the previous elements via the following formula 2 robustness ratio kge 2 val receiver kge 2 cal receiiver kge 2 cal receiver where kge 2 val receiver designates the validation performance over the receiver validation period period using the parameters resulting from the calibration over the donor calibration period period and kge 2 cal receiver is the calibration performance over the receiver period ouermi et al 2019 the advantage of this formula in the context of our study area is to minimize the influence of the differences in monthly flow gaps between the calibration and validation periods on the performance of the models since the ratios are mostly negative the median and 3rd quartile absolute values of the ratios were retained for our analysis the more the ratio tends towards 0 the more robust the model similarly the more the median and 3rd quartile absolute values of the ratio tend towards 0 the more robust the model 3 6 regionalization adaptation of oudin s method since hydroclimatic data is often very incomplete in west and central africa regionalization techniques could be a good alternative for hydrological modeling on ungauged and data scarce basins siderius et al 2018 vamoryba et al 2019 our objective is to determine whether a regionalization method coupled with satellite products makes it possible to preserve the performance of hydrological modeling the regionalization method oudin et al 2008 chosen is based on the selection of sets of parameters from the calibration on neighboring basins geographical neighborhood or other which are used in turn for the validation on the target basin the final flow is the mean of the various simulated flows based on the work of defrance et al 2014 we chose the three closest geographical neighbors by considering the centroid of the basins in order to spatially assess the performance of the regionalization method an index was calculated for each basin 3 variation kge 2 regionalisation kge 2 local kge 2 local 4 results 4 1 overall performance of precipitation datasets the calibration and validation of the gr2m model was carried out for each of the pairs of periods listed in table 2 fig 5 presents the violins of the values of the kge2 score of the 15 rainfall products for the pairs of calibration validation periods sst1 and sst2 hereinafter respectively denoted pair sst1 and pair sst2 and the 68 stations selected the rainfall products are arranged from left to right according to decreasing median value of kge2 in calibration cal for calibration and val for validation the violins are read like a boxplot min max median and 1st and 3rd quartiles but with additional information the width of the violins is proportional to the number of values and thus transcribes the distribution of values to determine which is the best product we decided to use various indicators related to kge2 in calibration and validation and the robustness criterion in calibration the median min max and interquartile distances iqr of the kge2 values were considered in validation the median kge2 and the median and 3rd quartile of the absolute values of the robustness ratio were used we emphasize more on kge2 value in calibration than its value in validation because we assume that if the good performance of the model is carried over from calibration to validation period the model is likely to have a better temporal transferability for future application fig 5 illustrates the interest of a determination based on criteria other than just the median value of kge2 in calibration or in validation a product that is good in calibration is not necessarily good in validation for example chirp merra 2 prectot and prectotcorr era5 and cpc and vice versa also the difference between the median values of kge2 in calibration cal and validation val for these gpes is very important this demonstrates the interest of taking robustness into account eq 2 in addition the iqr and min max of the kge2 values make it possible to determine whether the modeling performance of the gpes products carries over to a variety of catchment areas and incidentally to various geographical and climatic zones fig 5 also shows that the shape of the violins is not symmetrical in calibration just like the box there are more high values than low values this implies that for most of the basins selected the gr2m model integrates the various rainfall products well even if these products are very different from each other in validation the shape of the violins is more symmetrical we then implemented a ranking grid that assigns a number of points according to the rank obtained the better the rank of a product the more points the product is given 150 points for the best product 10 points for the worst for example table 3 indicates the number of points allocated to rainfall products according to the rank of the median value of kge2 obtained in calibration for the pair sst1 when comparing the pairs sst1 and sst2 the ranking of the rainfall products is not the same but we still generally find the same products in the first half and in the second half of the results there is also a diversity of performances for the same type of product some are good others are not on the other hand the gpes resulting from re analyses alone are poor for both pairs of periods table 4 summarizes the scores of each rainfall product according to the 6 criteria chosen in our approach the following lessons can be learned the best calibration product is chirps which combines ground re analysis and satellite data with a total of 770 900 it is ranked ahead of products like cru 680 900 and gpcc 670 900 which are based on ground observations alone the best product in validation is wfdei cru combination of re analysis and ground data with a total of 820 900 ahead of tamsat 810 900 and persiann cdr 800 900 which are combinations of satellite and ground data chirps 770 900 and cru 700 900 are ranked 4th and 5th in validation the worst products are merra era 5 re analysis and re analysis ground data and cpc ground data chirp satellite and re analysis unlike the version corrected with ground data chirps has poor results only 4 other products are less effective products based only on re analyses or only on satellite outputs or composites of the two are not very effective chirp era5 merra overall the best products are either composites of ground re analysis satellite data or based on ground data only which shows the importance of ground data the poor performance of the cpc product may be linked to the low density of the stations that were used to generate it for our study area since the robustness ratio reflects a deviation from kge2 in calibration it is essential that the value of kge2 in calibration be good to take this into account we have established a definitive ranking based on a mean between the performance in calibration and that in validation reduced to a score out of 20 table 5 table 5 confirms the observations made for table 4 chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations is the best product followed by wfdei cru and cru there is a big difference between the chirps product and the raw chirp version without ground data products based on ground data alone except cpc are always well ranked among the satellite ground re analysis composite products chirps clearly stands out from the other 4 in particular mswep and arc2 of the two products dedicated to africa tamsat and arc2 only the first is up to expectations with a good position of 4th out of 15 versus 10th place for arc2 4 2 spatial performance of precipitation datasets spatial analysis shows whether satellite products systematically lead to poor good model performance in a given geographical area it also makes it possible to determine the influence of the size of the basins on the performance of the gpes associated with the gr2m model our analysis is based on a subdivision of our study area into two subsets west africa wa and northern central africa ca fig 6 presents the mean values of kge2 in validation for the two pairs sst1 and sst2 we have chosen the threshold of 0 6 as the minimum acceptable value kling et al 2012 this figure exhibits a balanced performance of the gr2m model for a given rainfall product among the 7 best gridded precipitation estimates table 5 between wa and ca areas in fact colors observed on wa are quite the same over ca this balanced result is not observed with poorly ranked rainfall products such as merra2 prectot and prectotcorr era5 and cpc these latter products performances seem worst over ca as colors are fully red and dark red apart from cpc kge2 0 7 while on wa yellow and blue colors can be observed on few basins kge2 0 7 however singularities appear for certain basins for which almost all the rainfall products lead to poor model performance kge2 0 6 there can be many reasons for this and a more detailed analysis of the data and results provides some explanations the data is too incomplete or the mouelhi gr2m model cannot be adapted to the basins because the hydrological regime of these basins is of a complex nature often the case of large basins that cover multiple rainfall regimes or because the basin is heavily anthropized these basins in question are cossi and baranama medium sized basins on the niger and niamey a bigger basin located downstream of the inner niger delta ind logone gana on the chari and soubré on the sassandra located downstream of the buyo hydroelectric dam in côte d ivoire fig 7 provides a comparative summary of the minimum maximum quartiles and means of kge2 obtained over west africa wa and northern central africa ca for the pairs sst1 and sst2 this figure is subdivided into 8 blocks on the basis of 3 pieces of information the study area wa or ca the calibration validation period pairs sst1 and sst2 and the processing phase calibration or validation the results presented in fig 7 are summarized in table 6 for the entire set of gpes comparisons of kge2 values shows slight differences depending on statistical specifications analyzed min max 1st and 3rd quartiles and median indeed there is globally a slight drop of mean values of kge2 in calibration from sst1 to sst2 for both areas wa median of the means going from 0 86 to 0 84 for the top 7 from 0 81 to 0 78 for the others and ca median of the means going from 0 81 to 0 78 for the top 7 range of means from 0 75 to 079 0 70 077 for the 8 others gpes this drop is also observed in validation on both wa from range of means 0 69 0 74 0 68 0 74 for top 7 gpes from median of means 0 56 0 54 for the 8 remaining and ca from 0 54 to 0 48 for the 8 bottom gpes it is only in validation phase for the 7 best products that kge2 mean values are slightly increasing from median 0 66 0 68 from sst1 to sst2 over ca such overall drop from sst1 to sst2 is also observed for median and 3rd quartiles with little exceptions min and max values are more mixed besides kge2 values in calibration and validation are globally higher on wa than in ca this fact is stressed by the important number of values in bold for wa related columns in table 6 it finally appears that there are more differences between ca and wa than between the ssts fig 8 presents the values of the quartiles of kge2 according to the size of the basins in the sst period pairs table 7 is a summary of the results presented by fig 8 the performance of the gr2m models in terms of quartiles according to the size of the basins resembles a flat bell curve the best values are obtained for the 2 intermediate classes of surface area of the basins studied the products ranked in our top 7 for overall performance table 5 still have better results than the remaining 8 4 3 regionalization adaptation of oudin s method fig 9 presents violin graphs of the kge2 values obtained by the regionalization procedure reg2 oudin et al 2008 in comparison to an in situ calibration local as expected the regionalization method generally leads to a loss of performance while preserving the median kge2 above 0 5 for the majority of satellite products increases in performance can be seen when it comes to the lower rated rainfall products however the performance criteria remain low much lower than those obtained with the best rainfall products the five best rainfall products for the pairs sst1 and sst2 are four mixed products with a main satellite component tamsat chirps arc2 and persiann cdr and a wfdei cru corrected re analysis product among these five best products three were in the previous top five chirps wfdei cru and tamsat and two were lower in the ranking persiann cdr and arc2 the summary presented by table 8 is an adaptation of the performance assessment method proposed above table 4 it shows according to the criterion of median kge2 a relative conservation of the ranking in terms of overall performance of the precipitation products it should be noted however that the product arc2 which was ranked 10th in table 5 now went up 6 places in the ranking table 9 persiann cdr and tamsat only went up two and three places respectively in addition the min max and interquartile distance criteria confirm that the regionalization presents a sharp drop in performance in certain basins as shown in fig 8 this is even the case for well ranked products such as cru and gpcc which are now in 7th and 9th place table 9 fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of the mean rate of variation between the kge2s in local validation and the kge2s resulting from the regionalization procedure for the sst1 and sst2 pairs the results are globally balanced between wa and ca also there is bluer variation 0 1 for the gpes ranked lower in table 5 this reflects a positive impact of regionalization on the performance of these products the result is reversed for the good gpes based only on ground observations cru and gpcc with an increase in the interquartile distance q1 q3 of the kge2 values table 8 due to a drop in the kge2 value of more than 20 for the majority of basins fig 10 variation 0 2 5 discussion 5 1 importance of bias correction and the quality of data source in gpes performances the mixed product chirps satellite re analysis and ground data appears to be the best product overall in our study area when using the gr2m model mouelhi version it is followed by products based on ground observations and products based on re analysis and satellite coupled with ground observations it is therefore noted that the integration of ground observation data strongly influences the ability of a rainfall product to reproduce good validation with the gr2m model the comparison of the chirps product to its raw chirp version free of ground data is explicit from this point of view the differences between the raw version and the version adjusted using ground observations are more nuanced with the re analysis products merra 2 prectotcorr and merra 2 prectot this result highlights the ineffectiveness of the bias correction method of the corrected version merra 2 prectotcorr on our study area it is also important to note that no raw re analysis or satellite product could obtain an overall score greater than or equal to 12 in our ranking table 5 mixed products seem more appropriate for good modeling of the rainfall runoff relationship however the density of the climate stations and the quality of the raw satellite data are sources of sometimes significant differences between satellite based gpes even in the top five p datasets furthermore specificities of algorithms and observed rainfall datasets for algorithms calibration or bias correction of output timeseries amplify these differences among the gpes despite both tamsat and chirps approaches are mainly based on cold cloud duration ccd rainfall estimates from satellite thermal infrared recording chirps has a better performance especially tamsat relies on meteosat tir imagery provided by the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat while chirps relies on two geosynchronous tir archives the 1981 2008 globally gridded satellite grisat archive produced by noaa s national climate data center and the 2000 present noaa climate prediction center dataset cpc tir however the asset of chirps is that it also includes tropical rainfall measuring mission 2b31 microwave precipitation estimates cmorph microwave plus infrared based precipitation estimates monthly mean geostationary infrared brightness temperatures and land surface temperature estimates in addition to a wider meteorological database funk et al 2015 maidment et al 2017 likewise wfdei cru and wfdei gpcc rely on watch forcing data methodology applied to the reanalysis era interim data nevertheless cru data have a higher spatial resolution 0 5 compared to gpcc 1 linked with a better density of ground stations providing observed rainfall weedon et al 2014 as a result wfdei cru resp cru shows better performances for rainfall runoff modelling than wfdei gpcc resp gpcc on the basins considered in this study the arc2 product developed especially for the african continent does not perform well in hydrological modeling the tamsat product also developed for the african continent did better 4th place in our overall ranking if both products are based on eumetsat ir database tamsat includes 30 min prior to july 2006 and 15 min till july 2006 tir imagery unlike arc2 which includes 3 hourly ir data algorithms employed are also different novella and thiaw 2013 among the ground observation products cpc performs much worse than cru and gpcc this is probably related to the spatial density of the stations over west and central africa which are involved in the design of these ground observation data based gpes this study focused on old products due to the availability of the data before the year 2000 new emerging products of the same type as chirp raw satellite estimates not corrected with ground data like gpm imerg early and late run and gsmap real time seem to show less differences with respect to their corrected versions than observed between chirp and chirps the corrected version for instance dembele et al 2020 obtain results similar to ours with the same precipitation estimates products but with a different hydrological model mhm operating with a daily timestep over the volta basin in africa on the other hand jiang and bauer gottwein using the hbv model with a daily timestep on basins in china show that the performance of the imerg e raw and imerg f corrected versions is similar jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 they also show that imerg e has advantages over trmm 3b42 even though the latter is adjusted with gpcc data the quality of gpm imerg products can be attributed to the coupling of various satellite sources and sensors microwave and infrared with fine temporal resolution precipitation data from synoptic stations gsmap rt has also showed a better performance to estimate rainfall at daily timestep over west africa when compared to its gauge corrected version satgé et al 2020 5 2 spatial and temporal consistency of performance of rainfall estimation products following the overall analysis of the performance of the gr2m model on both sst period pairs and the associated basins with the gridded precipitation estimates as forcing data a study of the spatial performance was carried out the first objective was to see the effectiveness of the estimation products in the two major geographical areas of west africa with a greater number of basins and central africa which is less represented it appears while taking into account the asymmetry in terms of number that the overall performance of gpes is better on wa with higher values compared to ca fig 6 this fact is shown in fig 6 by a greater density of blue coloring over wa also kge2 values are globally greater in sst1 than in sst2 nevertheless slight variations are observed depending on the quartile and the gpe considered fig 7 shows an increase in kge2 min and max values in calibration and validation on the sst2 period pair for the wa zone compared to sst1 period pair for the top seven p datasets that is more mitigated for ca zone in order to better understand the impact of the choice of the study period on the performance of the gr2m model a study of the statistical characteristics of the precipitation data was undertaken but not presented here the cru rainfall product was used as reference data for the study of the stationary or non stationary nature of the time series as well as for the detection of possible breaks in the mean this study shows that 82 of the series are non stationary in wa versus 43 in ca breaks are detected in the non stationary series around 1990 1994 the year of rupture is generally 1993 and there are more ruptures in the wa zone 56 for wa 47 for ca the post 1993 period is wetter than 1980 1993 period unlike wa the ca zone is under the influence of the equatorial regime resulting in a mixed hydrological regime 2 maxima and 2 minima per year thus mean biases of the top 7 gpes over sahel region in wa evaluated by satgé et al 2020 in the range 0 85 1 15 are better compensated by gr2m when calibrating the model on 1996 2005 and validating on 1986 1995 the analysis of fig 8 highlights an influence of the surface area of the basins on the performance of the gr2m model characterized by a slight drop in performance below 8300 km² and above 80 000 km² for both sst period pairs we can conclude that the influence of the catchment area is not a major factor in the performance of the gr2m model unlike the choice of the calibration validation period the latter criterion leads to greater variations in performance than the former 5 3 regionalization efficiency the application of a regionalization method leads to a different ranking of the p datasets than that observed previously the performance of satellite products like arc2 persiann cdr tamsat and mswep improves this observation testifies to the fact that the regionalization reduces the impact of the biases in these precipitation series on flow simulation these biases are often linked to tendencies of gpes to overestimate or underestimate rainfall amount in certain localities satgé et al 2020 in addition the results in the inner niger delta are improved following the calibration on the 1996 2005 wet period and the validation on the 1986 1995 dry period for the majority of the precipitation estimation products the cause could be the strong influence of precipitation and runoff upstream on the hydrological conditions of the ind which is accentuated in the wet period indeed since rainfall is low there 500 mm year it has a very slight or delayed influence on runoff in the region although the decrease in robustness of the observation products is in agreement with previous work on regionalization the cru product is better than the gpcc product the reason for this difference must lie in the larger mesh of the observation stations involved in the design of cru ts v4 00 harris et al 2020 in our study area in our work we have limited ourselves to the use of an adaptation of the method of spatial proximity of basin centroids according to oudin et al 2008 the use of other methods based on krige and multicriteria similarity among basins could improve the positive effect of regionalization on rainfall runoff model performance goswami et al 2007 6 conclusion our work made it possible to evaluate a set of 15 p datasets three based only on ground observation data cpc v 1 cru ts v 4 00 and gpcc v 7 six based on reanalysis era5 jra 55 adj merra 2 prectot merra 2 prectotcorr wfdei cru wfdei gpcc and six based on satellite data arc v 2 chirp v 2 chirps v 2 persiann cdr mswep v2 2 tamsat v3 0 the approach used is based on the outputs of the gr2m hydrological model fed with gpes as forcing data as well as on a regionalization according to the near neighbor spatial method the results prove the usefulness of ground observation data insofar as the best p datasets are those corrected with ground data such as gpcc gpcp and cru of course the gpcc and cru observation based gpes performed well on the majority of the basins as for the poor performance of the cpc observation product it highlights the need for a good mesh of rainfall stations for the constitution of gridded precipitation estimates the blended product chirps combines ground observations from great international and national meteorological databases with re analysis timeseries and satellite estimates furthermore from a spatial point of view the chirps results are balanced over ca and wa regionalization by the near neighbor method defrance et al 2014 oudin et al 2008 shows that some previously poorly ranked products such as tamsat persiann cdr and arc2 become usable more complex regionalization methods could further improve model outputs for a larger number of gpes the period of availability of both hydrometric data and p datasets led us to limit ourselves to 15 p datasets over the period 1985 2005 it would be advantageous however to look into the use of more recent products which are promising according to the recent bibliography in certain regions of the world particularly in asia such as cmorph gsmap and gpm imerg for hydrological modeling in the wa and ca zone even in their raw version without ground observation these products manage to reproduce what is observed on the ground well credit authorship contribution statement christopher kouakou developed the

7677,study region a deep reservoir between xiluodu xld dam and xiangjiaba xjb dam located in the lower reaches of jinsha river study focus dam construction especially high dam construction normally caused the supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg downstream of the dam and reduced the flow velocity of the reservoir which hindered the safe migration of fish in this research an eco friendly reservoir operation model with a multi objective optimization method was established to reduce supersaturated tdg level and increase reservoir flow velocity in this key ecological zone to restore fish migration pathways the model consisted of three modules supersaturated tdg prediction module reservoir velocity prediction module and multi objective optimization module in order to re establish suitable migratory habitat for fish migration ecological constraints were added to the reservoir multi objective operational method including minimum supersaturated tdg level and maximum reservoir flow velocity and a 2 d tdg transport diffusion model was adopted to verify the effectiveness of eco friendly reservoir operation results the study aims to re establish fish migration channel of large reservoirs by using eco friendly reservoir operation methods new hydrological insights the proposed reservoir operation model was efficient in reducing the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg and increasing the reservoir flow velocity the area between xiluodu xld dam and xiangjiaba xjb dam was used as a studying case to analyze the usability of the developed method the best simulation result was obtained under the scenario with comprehensive consideration of power generation and ecological objectives and the maximum residence time of 140 supersaturated tdg level was 4 h which was consistent with the designed worst mean lethal time lt 50 of 4 h for fish the worst simulation result was obtained in the pattern targeting power generation only with a maximum residence time of 8 h for supersaturated tdg level at 140 which exceeded the corresponding lt 50 of fish under all three scenarios the xld hydropower station was generating at full capacity and the minimum flow velocity in the xjb reservoir would be above 0 2 m s overall this study provides an opportunity to reconstruct the fish migration habitat in the reservoir area graphical abstract ga1 keywords tdg fish migration habitat surrogate model dammed rivers data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dams and reservoirs were widely built to achieve multi objectives such as flood control power generation and water supply saab et al 2022 humankind has obtained much from the construction of dams in terms of economic and social benefits but these infrastructures also caused a series of negative impacts on river ecosystems fernandez et al 2022 wan et al 2022 for example supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg that can result in gas bubble disease gbd and fish mortality in the river reaches downstream of the dam which is recognized as a severe problem downstream of high dam spillways moreover supersaturated tdg may accumulate between the cascade hydropower stations shen et al 2019 damaging fish migration habitats xu et al 2017 hydropower development proposed severe negative impacts on fish migration by breaking the longitudinal connection of rivers and changing their hydrological conditions zarri et al 2022 although fishways that bypass dams facilitate fish passage altering natural flow conditions intensively threatens fish migration xu et al 2017 therefore to ensure the safety of fish migration measures including the physiological effects of supersaturated tdg on fish and ecological scheduling techniques for guiding fish migration by flow velocity need to be researched flood discharge can entrain air and generate tdg supersaturated water under pressure li et al 2009 wan et al 2021a the effects of supersaturated tdg on fish were studied abroad for a long time supersaturated tdg in the columbia river was highlighted as a potential hazard to fish as early as 1965 ebel 1969 based on this background many investigations were established to explain that supersaturated tdg could induce gbd death in fish geist et al 2013 politano et al 2007 stenberg et al 2022 in china supersaturated tdg caused by the flood discharge of the xiluodu xld hydropower station resulted in over 40 tons of fish death in july 2014 wan et al 2021b therefore to ensure the safe migration of fish measures need to be taken to reduce the impact of high supersaturated tdg level generated by the flood discharge on fish in migration habitats according to previous research engineering measures and reservoir operation were commonly used to reduce the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish li et al 2022 yuan et al 2020 spillway deflectors and baffle blocks as representative of engineering measures had significant roles in reducing the level of supersaturated tdg caused by the flood discharge politano et al 2007 the resrarch indicates that the level of supersaturated tdg could be reduced by installing flow deflectors on the spillway face for low head or medium head dams the reason was that the flow deflector could redirect the plunging flow towards the surface of the water body thereby minimizing bubble transport to depth and bubble dissipation wang et al 2019 the level of supersaturated tdg could also be reduced by placing baffle blocks downstream of the spillway of the high dam in the spillway basin to redirect the transport bubbles to an area near the water surface huang et al 2021 however engineering measures to reduce the level of supersaturated tdg generated by low head or medium head dams might be impractical for high dams that require overflow structures e g ski jump spillways to deal with monsoon level discharges shen et al 2019 therefore researchers tried to solve the problem through changing the flood discharge process in numerous studies the interval discharge pattern was considered the most effective and operational method to mitigate the effects of supersaturated tdg on fish based on the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg feng et al 2014 ma et al 2019 wan et al 2021b reducing the physiological impact of supersaturated tdg on fish is a prerequisite for ensuring the safe migration of fish therefore it is urgent and necessary to develop effective and operational ecological scheduling methods to reduce the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish migration however few studies have considered reducing the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish during migration period the construction of dams disrupts river connectivity turning formerly torrential rivers into still or semi still reservoirs resulting in the inability of fish to migrate liermann et al 2012 studies indicated that flow velocity is the primary directional cue for fish migration baigun et al 2007 liu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 fish may lose their ability to discern the right migration direction if the flow velocity in the reservoir is insufficient to provide guidance for fish migration thus providing a basic flow velocity in the river to initiate fish migration and offer directional guidance during migration is critical researchers therefore have carried out a series of studies on how to increase the river flow velocity reduced by dam construction to ensure the normal migration of fish johnson et al 2012 studied the inlet efficiency of lampreys tridentata by controlling the flow velocity at the opening of the fishway wei et al 2019 optimized a fishway combining a vertical slot and nature like section to ensure efficient fish passage after changing the flow velocity to the optimum range babin et al 2020 explored the effect of fish migration on the velocity and direction of water flow through the activity of tagged salmo salar in the mactaquac reservoir and found that migration rates were decreased by 32 57 in the reservoir compared to river reaches due to low flow in reservoir management ecological restrictions were usually coupled into the management model to repair the fish migratory pathways xu et al 2017 however the existing reservoir management research was mainly concentrated on preserving environmental flows in downstream river to protect fish migration routes with little attention paid to whether fish may effectively transit through lentic or semi lentic area during fish migration if the flow velocity in the reservoir is too low fish will stay in the reservoir for a long time subsequently under long term stress caused by supersaturated tdg the risk of fish with bubble disease or death will significantly increase therefore it is necessary to reduce the retention time of supersaturated tdg and increase the flow rate of water body in reservoir area for safe migration of fish over the years researchers have developed many methods for river management such as deep learning algorithms wan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 and multi objective programming methods farahi et al 2021 li et al 2017 deep learning algorithms such as short term memory lstm and artificial neural networks ann are effective in predicting the water quality of rivers and reservoir ozdogan sarikoc et al 2023 wan et al 2022 many optimized deep learning methods by coupling benchmark metaheuristic algorithms were adopted to correct model parameters and improve model accuracy yuan et al 2018 kisi et al 2023 ikram et al 2022 developed a novel hybridized machine learning method extended marine predators algorithm empa based ann ann empa for streamflow estimation in the upper indus basin the result showed the prospects of optimized deep learning in improving predictive performance adnan et al 2022 developed a new machine learning model for streamflow prediction where gradient based optimization gbo algorithm was employed to adjust adaptive neuro fuzzy system s anfis hyperparameters due to the fact that deep learning models including optimized deep learning models are not suitable for water quality prediction with limited data resource therefore the deep learning model was not adopted in this study in balancing the contradiction between multiple objectives the multi objective programming methods plays a more important role cai et al 2009a zhang et al 2021 the operational management of reservoirs usually requires multiple objectives at the same time and a multi objective planning approach can effectively resolve the conflicts between multiple objectives farahi et al 2021 rong et al 2019 cai et al 2009b yu et al 2018 proposed a multi objective reservoir management model that considered hydropower generation socio economic water demand and estuarine eutrophication in reservoirs chen et al 2020 developed a method for optimal regulation of water and sediment in reservoirs considering staged multi objective functions previous research showed that a multi objective programming method could provide support for balancing the conflict between the safety economic and environmental objectives of reservoir operations ahmadianfar et al 2021 this study aims to mitigate the effects of dam construction on fish migration in the reservoir area including the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish and the impact of low flow velocity on fish migration signal although some researchers studied separately how to reduce the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish and how to improve the flow velocity of the reservoir by using operation models to aid fish migration however few researchers considered these two factors together to ensure the safety of fish migration how to incorporate these two factors into the reservoir operation model is also a problem the developed method will be presented as follows 1 the 2 d hydrodynamic model will be used to simulate the flow velocity distribution characteristics in the reservoir area 2 the response surface method will be adopted to predict supersaturated tdg level downstream of the dam and flow velocity in the reservoir 3 a multi objective reservoir management model with the power generation and impact of supersaturated tdg as ecological goals and reservoir flow velocity as one of the ecological constraints will be established and 4 the model results will be validated by a 2 d hydrodynamic model the developed approach has the following innovations a by regulating the outflow and inflow of the reservoir to increase the water flow velocity of the reservoir and provide flow velocity signals for fish migration b the established model could generate interval discharge pattern which effectively reduced the exposure time of fish in supersaturated tdg water and increased the flow velocity of the reservoir c the established method was applied to xld dam to re establish the fish migratory habitats between xld dam and xiangjiaba xjb dam overall the method established in the paper which ensures fish migration and survival may provide important guidance for re establishing fish migration channels with safe habitats in reservoir areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 fish migration requirements one essential feature of a river is that it represents a system of unidirectional water flows which is the primary orientation cue for fluvial fish migration aldven et al 2015 according to the chinese national standard for fishway design the induced velocity of main migratory fish in china is 0 2 m s mwrprc 2013 fish can migrate normally when the flow velocity is greater than 0 2 m s similarly fish will be disoriented if the river velocity is lower than the induced velocity of the fishes xu et al 2017 therefore the flow velocity threshold for meeting fish migration requirements was defined in this study as 0 2 m s which is a condition that would satisfy the flow velocity threshold of most migratory fish in the world as shown in fig 1 simulation results showed that the flow velocity in xjb reservoir was less than 0 2 m s in many sections on july 5 and july 8 2014 as a result fish in xjb reservoir may not be able to migrate upstream hence it is necessary to increase the flow velocity in xjb reservoir by methods of dispatching to reestablish fish migration passage 2 2 tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg the experiment results showed that fish have a certain degree of tolerance to supersaturated tdg yuan et al 2021 the supersaturated tdg tolerance threshold of juvenile rock carp procypris rabaudi tchang was 115 huang et al 2010b and the schizothorax prenanti began to die within 2 h in 120 supersaturated tdg water ji et al 2019a the us environmental protection agency s natural river water quality management standard from 1986 stated that supersaturated tdg in natural water bodies should be less than 110 studies showed that the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg varies with the level and duration of tdg the average survival times of the fish were found to be 2 2 2 7 5 2 6 0 and 6 5 h at supersaturated tdg levels of 145 140 135 130 and 125 respectively xue et al 2019 the lower the level of the supersaturated tdg the longer the survival time of fishes laboratory studies showed that with similar mean values of supersaturated tdg the median lethal time lt 50 of test fish exposed to supersaturated tdg graded from 110 to 130 for 24 h 58 2 lower than that of supersaturated tdg at 120 constant exposure ji et al 2019b therefore this study incorporated the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg into the reservoir management model 2 3 eco friendly reservoir operation method in the study a multi objective reservoir management model was developed to mitigate the effects of supersaturated tdg and low flow velocity on fish migration the framework of the established model was shown in fig 2 including a supersaturated tdg prediction model a reservoir velocity prediction model a multi objective optimization model and 2 d hydraulic model the modeling process was shown as follows 1 firstly appropriate factors were selected through correlation analysis and then response surface methodology rsm was used to construct a prediction model for the generation of supersaturated tdg 2 the 2 d hydraulic model was used to predict the distribution of the velocity field in the reservoir area and the rms was used to construct the minimum velocity prediction model in the reservoir area 3 coupling the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg the flow rate requirements of fish migration and socio economic requirements a multi objective ecological dispatch model was established for reservoirs management 2 3 1 overview of the study area the study area is between the xld hydropower station and the xjb hydropower station as shown in fig 3 located in the lower reaches of jinsha river there are many nature reserves for rare fish in the lower reaches of jinsha river li et al 2020 the total installed capacity of the xld hydropower station is 12 67 million kw the dead water level is 540 m and the normal storage level is 600 m the total installed capacity of the xjb hydropower station is 5 16 million kw the dead water level is 370 m and the normal storage level is 380 m supersaturated tdg generated by the flood discharge of xld hydropower station will be transported and diffused to xjb reservoir causing disease or even death of fish in xjb reservoir the operation of xld and xjb hydropower stations changed the hydrological conditions of the rivers and blocked the migratory pathways of important fish species such as coreius gui chenoti and rhinogobio ventralis which led to a decrease in fish diversity in the lower reaches of jinsha river hu et al 2021 the flow velocity in xjb reservoir is regulated by controlling the outflow from xld dam and xjb reservoir to reconstruct a suitable flow velocity field for fish migration therefore the research focused on the downstream of the xld dam to the xjb dam with a total length of 157 km 2 3 2 2 d hydrodynamic simulation to simulate hydrodynamic conditions a 2 d hydrodynamic model for deep reservoirs based on ce qual w2 platform was built the ce qual w2 is a two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model for rivers estuaries lakes reservoirs and river basin systems wan et al 2021b constructed a 2 d hydrodynamic model between the downstream of xld

3 surrogate model the purpose of establishing the surrogate model was to construct a model that converges to reality by fitting relationships between input variables and response values so the direct effects of supersaturated tdg and flow velocity on fish migration could be quantified by a surrogate model and incorporated into multi objective reservoir management models previously heddam 2016 used the generalized regression neural network to predict tdg uptake with available measured data heddam et al 2019 compared the ability of new modeling tools kriging interpolation method kim response surface method rsm and feedforward neural network ffnn to predict supersaturated tdg level and found little difference in accuracy between the three models the construction process of rsm was relatively simple if the accuracy of the model was sufficient for the subsequent construction of ecological operation models the choice of rsm reduced the difficulty of model construction therefore in this research the rsm was used to design the prediction model of supersaturated tdg generation and the surrogate model of minimum flow velocity in the reservoir area by using correlation analysis the main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg were as the input of the prediction model of supersaturated tdg generation the minimum flow velocity surrogate model in the reservoir area took the inflow and the outflow as model inputs the general fitting equations for the rsm were as follows wang and shi 2021 11 y α 0 i 1 m α i x i or 12 y α 0 i 1 m α i x i i j i j m α i j x i x j i 1 m ε 2 τ

improve fish survival the lt 50 was used to evaluate the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg studies have shown that the lt 50 of fish varies with species under different supersaturated tdg levels as shown in table 1 lt 50 for rock carp was the shortest only 4 32 h under 120 supersaturated tdg water when fish returned to low level supersaturated tdg water the physiological damage caused by supersaturated tdg could be restored hence this research considered the most disadvantageous case took the lt 50 of rock carp as the tolerance threshold of fish and coupled it into the flood discharge pattern the way to realize the interval discharge pattern could be described in table 2 2 4 multi objective reservoir management model the outflow from xld dam directly controlled the incoming flow from xjb reservoir therefore to carry out ecological regulation of the river section between two dams it was necessary to change the flood discharge plan of xld dam in order to reduce the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish and increase power generation a multi objective ecological model was established in this paper the model could be mathematically stated as 13 f 1 min f t 1 n t c t 14 f 2

generation in order to determine the main environmental factors affecting the generation level of supersaturated tdg the correlation analysis among supersaturated tdg water level inflow outflow and flood discharge was carried out as shown in table 3 all four environmental factors were associated with the generation of supersaturated tdg three highly correlated variables water level outflow and flood discharge were selected as the main variables to construct the response surface model the field measured data from july 8 11 2014 were used as the model data input with supersaturated tdg level as response values water level outflow and flood discharge as influencing factors and the design expert software was used for regression fitting the fitted regression equation was as follow 30 y 1 2449 05217 6 84193 a 8 25420 e 003 b 0 015315 c where a is the downstream water level m b is the outflow of hydropower station m3 s c is the flood discharge of hydropower station m3 s the significant results of the regression equation model and various parameters were shown in table 4 the p value was used to judge the significance of the model when p 0 05 the model was significant and the smaller the p value the greater the effect on the model the larger the f value of the model was the more significant the influence of factors was the f value of the model was 127 22 with the p value less than 0 0001 indicating that the model was highly significant and factor a factor b and factor c significantly impact on supersaturated tdg at the same time factor a factor b and factor c had a significant impact on supersaturated tdg as shown in table 5 the r squared r 2 of this model was 0 9051 and the adjusted r square r 2 adj was 0 8980 it showed that the equation had a reasonable degree of fit and could explain 90 51 of the response value change this showed that the model could be used to predict the generation of supersaturated tdg 3 2 the surrogate model of minimum flow velocity in reservoir area the minimum flow velocity data in xjb reservoir under different inflow and outflow of xld and xjb dam were simulated by the 2 d hydrodynamic model as the inflow of the xjb reservoir was the outflow of xld dam the xjb reservoir flow velocity could be regulated by controlling the discharge from xld dam the surrogate model was used to construct the minimum flow velocity control equation and the equation expression was as follow 31 y 2 0 062377 3 04869 e 005 a 2 22347e 004 b 4 03594 e 008 a b 9 76325 e 009 a 2 3 32653e 009 b 2 8 32639 e 012 a b 2 3 56433 e 013 a 3 where a is the discharge of the xld dam m3 s b is the discharge on the right bank of the xjb dam m3 s discharge from the left bank of the xjb dam is equal to right bank as shown in table 6 although the f value of the model was 193 06 and the p value was less than 0 0001 the p value of items a a 2 b and b 3 was greater than 0 1000 which could be removed the adjusted model analysis of variance was shown in table 7 after removing the terms of a 2 b and b 3 the f value of the model as 248 4559 the p value was less than 0 0001 and the terms of b ab a 2 b 2 ab 2 a 3 were significant model terms showing that the significance of the model had improved the r 2 of this model was 0 8329 and r 2 adj was 0 8295 it showed that the equation had a good degree of fit and could explain 83 29 of the response value change 3 3 result of the reservoir operation 3 3 1 comparison of flood discharge patterns three scenarios were designed based on the operation conditions of this study a ecological priority α 1 β 0 b equal weight of ecological and power generation α 0 5 β 0 5 and c priority power generation α 0 β 1 lingo was adopted to solving the multi objective management model for optimal operation within 72 h fig 4 showed the changes of the flood discharge power generation supersaturated tdg level and minimum flow velocity in xjb reservoir for three scenarios the results showed that the maximum power generation capacity of the hydropower station was reached for all three scenarios while ensuring the safety of the dam which was far higher than the prototype observation results the simulation results for all three scenarios also ensured that the minimum flow velocity in xjb reservoir area was greater than or equal to 0 2 m s it could meet the normal upward migration behavior of migratory fish entering the xjb reservoir area both ecological priority and ecological power generation equal weight modes fig 4 a and b could realize the continuous flood discharge time of less than 4 h when the level of the supersaturated tdg downstream of xld was greater than or equal to 140 and then the flood discharge was suspended for a while to reduce the supersaturated tdg in the water body under scenarios a and b there would be a long period of stopping flood discharge from 14 00 on july 9 10 00 on july 12 however the simulation results of scenario a showed that the supersaturated tdg was relatively high from 22 00 on july 8 04 00 on july 9 but the flood discharge stops for a short time and did not give sufficient supersaturated tdg release time the maximum time for supersaturated tdg higher than 140 under the power generation priority scenario fig 4 c was 8 h which was higher than the maximum supersaturated tdg residence time under scenarios a and b in this scenario fish were prone to bubble disease and even death which was not conducive to the ecological health of the river therefore a combined evaluation of the simulation results for three scenarios showed that neither the ecology only nor the power generation only scenarios were optimal simulation results were better for scenario b which considers ecology and power generation 3 3 2 results for the distribution of supersaturated tdg and flow velocity in xjb reservoir since the simulation result of scenario b was the best only the supersaturated tdg distribution of scenario b was analyzed fig 5 showed the simulation results of supersaturated tdg distribution in xjb reservoir of scenario b the contours in fig 5 a showed that high saturated tdg generated by xld entered xjb reservoir at 14 00 on july 8 after 8 h the distribution of supersaturated tdg in xjb reservoir was shown in fig 5 b and the continuous state of high supersaturation tdg in xjb reservoir area was broken the residence time of supersaturated tdg level at 140 was fewer than 2 h of that in the same area because high saturation tdg would spread downstream with water flow and xld dam flood discharge did not continuously generate high supersaturated tdg in an interval discharge pattern according to fig 5 c d e and f the residence time of supersaturated tdg with levels between 115 and 120 was longer but not more than 12 h which was less than the corresponding fish lt 50 since the xld dam stopped flood discharge for a period of time after its flood discharge produces high saturation tdg as shown in fig 5 this could provide fish with a certain time to recover the physiological damage caused by supersaturated tdg after 16 00 on july 10 the xld dam completely stopped flood discharge as shown in fig 5 g and h it meaned that supersaturated tdg in xjb reservoir area would be in a low supersaturation state for a long time and fish could recover well during this time the simulation results of supersaturated tdg distribution showed that the goal of safe fish migration could be achieved by adopting a model with equal weighting for ecology and power generation fig 6 showed the flow velocity distribution simulation results in xjb reservoir area as shown in fig 6 b the flow velocity of the water in the upper layer of xjb reservoir was greater than 0 2 m s at various times and there was no break in the layer this meaned that fish could migrate in this layer of water also according to fig 5 b the level of supersaturated tdg in the xjb reservoir area was within the range that ensured fish safety as a result a fish migration route was re established that entirely fits the needed of migratory fish in xjb reservoir demonstrating the success of our strategy 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy of surrogate model in this paper the rsm was adopted to establish the connection between the supersaturated tdg and various factors which provided conditions for the eco friendly reservoir operation model from the results reported in table 8 the r 2 r 2 adj and f value of two models established by the rsm in this paper were 0 9051 0 8329 0 8980 0 8295 127 22 248 4559 respectively which showed that the fitting effect of the two models was good and could be applied to the later models there was little difference in accuracy between the supersaturated tdg prediction model constructed by heddam et al 2019 using rsm and the model constructed in this paper however such differences were acceptable this was because differences in the amount of data and factors essentially could impact the accuracy of the model fig 7 showed the scatterplots of measured vs calculated values of the supersaturated tdg and the flow velocity prediction models it could be seen that the errors of both models were within acceptable limits this indicated that the accuracy of the models was acceptable therefore numerical simulation using the rsm was feasible the creation of these two models was the key to the realization of the multi objective reservoir management model the development of these two models efficiently quantified the link of supersaturated tdg and flow velocity in the reservoir area with various factors allowing them to be combined with the reservoir s multi objective planning model 4 2 discussion of model operation results protecting fish diversity is an integral part of protecting river biodiversity however the extensive construction of high dams has hindered the safe migration of fish leading to the reduction of river biodiversity most researchers carried out research from the perspective of ensuring the safe passage of fish through the dam ahmadi et al 2021 peirson et al 2021 and restoring the flow velocity of the downstream river chang et al 2021 sedighkia et al 2021 yan et al 2021 which has contributed to the protection of fish migration passages downstream of the dam but some studies have pointed out that despite many efforts has done many fish still failed to complete their migrations successfully noonan et al 2012 xu et al 2020 xu et al 2017 the construction of dams disrupted river connectivity turning formerly torrential rivers into still or semi still reservoirs resulting in the inability of fish to migrate therefore even if the fish successfully reached the upstream of the dam from the downstream through the fishway they could not continue migrating upward because the flow velocity of the water in the reservoir was too low to provide migration guidance therefore an eco friendly reservoir operation method with power generation and the impact of supersaturated tdg ecological goals and the reservoir area flow velocity as one of the ecological constraints was developed the results in table 1 showed that rock carp have the worst tolerance to supersaturated tdg so an interval discharge pattern based on the lt 50 of rock carp was designed and the established 2 d hydrodynamic model wan et al 2021b was adopted to predict the flow velocity and the supersaturated tdg level of water in xjb reservoir the results showed that the flow velocity gained by the original flood discharge management scheme of xld dam could not meet the requirements of migrating fish in xjb reservoir a continuous zone of flow velocity greater than 0 2 m s could not be established along the migration pathway which could not provide directional cues for fish migration in addition according to the prototype observation data of wan et al 2021b the problem of tdg supersaturation existed in xjb reservoir over a long period of time with the actual flood discharge pattern therefore an eco friendly reservoir operation method that protects both fish migration channels and fish survival was established in the paper three scenarios were adopted to verify the usability of the established method results indicated that both scenario a and b could ensure the safe migration of fish as shown in table 9 the maximum residence times of supersaturated tdg in scenario a and b at key sections of the xjb reservoir were less than the corresponding lt 50s for different supersaturated tdg level which indicated that fish could survive normally during the flood discharge process in scenario a and b the results also indicated that the minimum flow velocity of water in reservoirs gained by scenario a and b was greater than 0 2 m s which could provide upward migration signals for migratory fish the maximum residence times of supersaturated tdg with 140 level in scenario c was 8 h which was greater than the corresponding lt 50 about 2 times the evaluation results showed that fish in xjb reservoir in scenario c would die and could not migrate safely since the synergy of ecological and economic benefits was not considered in scenario a therefore scenario b was considered to be the optimal eco friendly reservoir operation method to realize the reconstruction of migratory habitat of fish in reservoir the reliability of scenario b was also verified by the established 2 d hydrodynamics model compared to studies by wan et al 2021b ma et al 2019 and xu et al 2017 this study considers the coupling effects of supersaturated tdg and low flow velocity on fish migration environment achieving the improvement of reconstruction technology for fish migration habitats in reservoirs in this study hydrodynamic and water environmental conditions were linked together which could better reflect the coupling requirements of fish migration to more environmental conditions this study can provide theoretical and technical support for the reconstruction of fish migration pathways under complex environmental conditions 4 3 discuss the ecological risk and economic assessment of the multi objective operation method the effect of supersaturated tdg on fish in this study was reflected in the difference between the maximum residence time and the corresponding lt 50 for each level of supersaturated tdg when the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg was greater than the corresponding lt 50 the fish would die due to overexposure to supersaturated tdg water chen et al 2012 huang et al 2010a when the maximum residence time of the supersaturated tdg was less than the corresponding lt 50 the biological functions of fish damaged by exposure to tdg water could be recovered upon return to freshwater conditions cao et al 2022 cao et al 2016b compared with the original flood discharge method the optimized flood discharge method could reduce the residence time of supersaturated tdg and increased the flow velocity in the reservoir area in table 9 the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg with 140 level in scenario c was 8 h which were greater than the corresponding lt 50 about 2 times in other scenarios scenarios a and c the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg at 120 120 130 140 levels were less than corresponding lt 50 s this showed that the established method considering ecological objectives could increased the survival probability of fish which was consistent with relevant results from other researchers ma et al 2019 wan et al 2021b while minimizing the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg the flow velocity in the reservoir area under three scenarios was also greater than 0 2 m s ensuring the safety of fish migration most fish can obtain migration direction guidance under this flow velocity therefore it can be considered that the established model in this study can improve the migratory habitat of fish and increase the species richness of fish with certain ecological and economic benefits in addition xld hydropower station can generate electricity at its maximum installed capacity in all three scenarios improving economic efficiency 5 conclusions the construction of the dam has caused a great impact on the river ecosystem with the operation of increasing numbers of dams in china side effects of dam constructions such as supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg caused by flood discharge and the reduced flow velocity in the reservoir area have become serious potential threat to aquatic life in order to reduce the impact of dam constructions on river ecosystem an eco friendly multi objective reservoir management model was established in the paper to reduce the residence time of supersaturated tdg and increase reservoir flow velocity in this key ecological zone to restore fish migration pathways simulation results showed that xld hydropower station could generate at full capacity and the minimum flow velocity in xjb reservoir would be above 0 2 m s under all three scenarios the worst simulation results were obtained in the pattern targeting power generation only with a maximum residence time of 8 h for supersaturated tdg level at 140 which exceeds the corresponding lt 50 of fish however compared with the original flood discharge pattern the worst simulation results could significantly reduce the residence time of tdg and improve the flow velocity in key sections of reservoir area the model could effectively reduce the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg and increase the flow velocity greater than 0 2 m s in xjb reservoir area which could improve the quality of fish migration habitats and contribute to the safe migration of fish in the reservoir area the simulation results of two dimensional tdg transport diffusion model indicated that discharge patterns generated by the established eco friendly model could produce several supersaturated tdg clusters in the reservoir and provided a certain recovery time and velocity signal stimulation for fish migration this method could provide new ideas for solving the problem of fish migration caused by dam construction and provide theoretical and technical support for water environment management however the fish migration constraint only requires the flow velocity greater than 0 2 m s in this study which may not meet the flow velocity requirements for all migrating fish in future work we will consider incorporating the uncertainty of fish migration flow velocity constraints into the multi objective ecological scheduling model of the reservoir to improve the optimization accuracy of the model in addition intelligent models such as neural networks and kriging models need to be integrated into the model framework to improve the prediction accuracy of supersaturated tdg generation and flow velocity predication the method can provide new ideas for ecological restoration work on rivers affected by dam construction credit authorship contribution statement yujuan mo conceptualization

7677,study region a deep reservoir between xiluodu xld dam and xiangjiaba xjb dam located in the lower reaches of jinsha river study focus dam construction especially high dam construction normally caused the supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg downstream of the dam and reduced the flow velocity of the reservoir which hindered the safe migration of fish in this research an eco friendly reservoir operation model with a multi objective optimization method was established to reduce supersaturated tdg level and increase reservoir flow velocity in this key ecological zone to restore fish migration pathways the model consisted of three modules supersaturated tdg prediction module reservoir velocity prediction module and multi objective optimization module in order to re establish suitable migratory habitat for fish migration ecological constraints were added to the reservoir multi objective operational method including minimum supersaturated tdg level and maximum reservoir flow velocity and a 2 d tdg transport diffusion model was adopted to verify the effectiveness of eco friendly reservoir operation results the study aims to re establish fish migration channel of large reservoirs by using eco friendly reservoir operation methods new hydrological insights the proposed reservoir operation model was efficient in reducing the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg and increasing the reservoir flow velocity the area between xiluodu xld dam and xiangjiaba xjb dam was used as a studying case to analyze the usability of the developed method the best simulation result was obtained under the scenario with comprehensive consideration of power generation and ecological objectives and the maximum residence time of 140 supersaturated tdg level was 4 h which was consistent with the designed worst mean lethal time lt 50 of 4 h for fish the worst simulation result was obtained in the pattern targeting power generation only with a maximum residence time of 8 h for supersaturated tdg level at 140 which exceeded the corresponding lt 50 of fish under all three scenarios the xld hydropower station was generating at full capacity and the minimum flow velocity in the xjb reservoir would be above 0 2 m s overall this study provides an opportunity to reconstruct the fish migration habitat in the reservoir area graphical abstract ga1 keywords tdg fish migration habitat surrogate model dammed rivers data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dams and reservoirs were widely built to achieve multi objectives such as flood control power generation and water supply saab et al 2022 humankind has obtained much from the construction of dams in terms of economic and social benefits but these infrastructures also caused a series of negative impacts on river ecosystems fernandez et al 2022 wan et al 2022 for example supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg that can result in gas bubble disease gbd and fish mortality in the river reaches downstream of the dam which is recognized as a severe problem downstream of high dam spillways moreover supersaturated tdg may accumulate between the cascade hydropower stations shen et al 2019 damaging fish migration habitats xu et al 2017 hydropower development proposed severe negative impacts on fish migration by breaking the longitudinal connection of rivers and changing their hydrological conditions zarri et al 2022 although fishways that bypass dams facilitate fish passage altering natural flow conditions intensively threatens fish migration xu et al 2017 therefore to ensure the safety of fish migration measures including the physiological effects of supersaturated tdg on fish and ecological scheduling techniques for guiding fish migration by flow velocity need to be researched flood discharge can entrain air and generate tdg supersaturated water under pressure li et al 2009 wan et al 2021a the effects of supersaturated tdg on fish were studied abroad for a long time supersaturated tdg in the columbia river was highlighted as a potential hazard to fish as early as 1965 ebel 1969 based on this background many investigations were established to explain that supersaturated tdg could induce gbd death in fish geist et al 2013 politano et al 2007 stenberg et al 2022 in china supersaturated tdg caused by the flood discharge of the xiluodu xld hydropower station resulted in over 40 tons of fish death in july 2014 wan et al 2021b therefore to ensure the safe migration of fish measures need to be taken to reduce the impact of high supersaturated tdg level generated by the flood discharge on fish in migration habitats according to previous research engineering measures and reservoir operation were commonly used to reduce the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish li et al 2022 yuan et al 2020 spillway deflectors and baffle blocks as representative of engineering measures had significant roles in reducing the level of supersaturated tdg caused by the flood discharge politano et al 2007 the resrarch indicates that the level of supersaturated tdg could be reduced by installing flow deflectors on the spillway face for low head or medium head dams the reason was that the flow deflector could redirect the plunging flow towards the surface of the water body thereby minimizing bubble transport to depth and bubble dissipation wang et al 2019 the level of supersaturated tdg could also be reduced by placing baffle blocks downstream of the spillway of the high dam in the spillway basin to redirect the transport bubbles to an area near the water surface huang et al 2021 however engineering measures to reduce the level of supersaturated tdg generated by low head or medium head dams might be impractical for high dams that require overflow structures e g ski jump spillways to deal with monsoon level discharges shen et al 2019 therefore researchers tried to solve the problem through changing the flood discharge process in numerous studies the interval discharge pattern was considered the most effective and operational method to mitigate the effects of supersaturated tdg on fish based on the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg feng et al 2014 ma et al 2019 wan et al 2021b reducing the physiological impact of supersaturated tdg on fish is a prerequisite for ensuring the safe migration of fish therefore it is urgent and necessary to develop effective and operational ecological scheduling methods to reduce the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish migration however few studies have considered reducing the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish during migration period the construction of dams disrupts river connectivity turning formerly torrential rivers into still or semi still reservoirs resulting in the inability of fish to migrate liermann et al 2012 studies indicated that flow velocity is the primary directional cue for fish migration baigun et al 2007 liu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 fish may lose their ability to discern the right migration direction if the flow velocity in the reservoir is insufficient to provide guidance for fish migration thus providing a basic flow velocity in the river to initiate fish migration and offer directional guidance during migration is critical researchers therefore have carried out a series of studies on how to increase the river flow velocity reduced by dam construction to ensure the normal migration of fish johnson et al 2012 studied the inlet efficiency of lampreys tridentata by controlling the flow velocity at the opening of the fishway wei et al 2019 optimized a fishway combining a vertical slot and nature like section to ensure efficient fish passage after changing the flow velocity to the optimum range babin et al 2020 explored the effect of fish migration on the velocity and direction of water flow through the activity of tagged salmo salar in the mactaquac reservoir and found that migration rates were decreased by 32 57 in the reservoir compared to river reaches due to low flow in reservoir management ecological restrictions were usually coupled into the management model to repair the fish migratory pathways xu et al 2017 however the existing reservoir management research was mainly concentrated on preserving environmental flows in downstream river to protect fish migration routes with little attention paid to whether fish may effectively transit through lentic or semi lentic area during fish migration if the flow velocity in the reservoir is too low fish will stay in the reservoir for a long time subsequently under long term stress caused by supersaturated tdg the risk of fish with bubble disease or death will significantly increase therefore it is necessary to reduce the retention time of supersaturated tdg and increase the flow rate of water body in reservoir area for safe migration of fish over the years researchers have developed many methods for river management such as deep learning algorithms wan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 and multi objective programming methods farahi et al 2021 li et al 2017 deep learning algorithms such as short term memory lstm and artificial neural networks ann are effective in predicting the water quality of rivers and reservoir ozdogan sarikoc et al 2023 wan et al 2022 many optimized deep learning methods by coupling benchmark metaheuristic algorithms were adopted to correct model parameters and improve model accuracy yuan et al 2018 kisi et al 2023 ikram et al 2022 developed a novel hybridized machine learning method extended marine predators algorithm empa based ann ann empa for streamflow estimation in the upper indus basin the result showed the prospects of optimized deep learning in improving predictive performance adnan et al 2022 developed a new machine learning model for streamflow prediction where gradient based optimization gbo algorithm was employed to adjust adaptive neuro fuzzy system s anfis hyperparameters due to the fact that deep learning models including optimized deep learning models are not suitable for water quality prediction with limited data resource therefore the deep learning model was not adopted in this study in balancing the contradiction between multiple objectives the multi objective programming methods plays a more important role cai et al 2009a zhang et al 2021 the operational management of reservoirs usually requires multiple objectives at the same time and a multi objective planning approach can effectively resolve the conflicts between multiple objectives farahi et al 2021 rong et al 2019 cai et al 2009b yu et al 2018 proposed a multi objective reservoir management model that considered hydropower generation socio economic water demand and estuarine eutrophication in reservoirs chen et al 2020 developed a method for optimal regulation of water and sediment in reservoirs considering staged multi objective functions previous research showed that a multi objective programming method could provide support for balancing the conflict between the safety economic and environmental objectives of reservoir operations ahmadianfar et al 2021 this study aims to mitigate the effects of dam construction on fish migration in the reservoir area including the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish and the impact of low flow velocity on fish migration signal although some researchers studied separately how to reduce the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish and how to improve the flow velocity of the reservoir by using operation models to aid fish migration however few researchers considered these two factors together to ensure the safety of fish migration how to incorporate these two factors into the reservoir operation model is also a problem the developed method will be presented as follows 1 the 2 d hydrodynamic model will be used to simulate the flow velocity distribution characteristics in the reservoir area 2 the response surface method will be adopted to predict supersaturated tdg level downstream of the dam and flow velocity in the reservoir 3 a multi objective reservoir management model with the power generation and impact of supersaturated tdg as ecological goals and reservoir flow velocity as one of the ecological constraints will be established and 4 the model results will be validated by a 2 d hydrodynamic model the developed approach has the following innovations a by regulating the outflow and inflow of the reservoir to increase the water flow velocity of the reservoir and provide flow velocity signals for fish migration b the established model could generate interval discharge pattern which effectively reduced the exposure time of fish in supersaturated tdg water and increased the flow velocity of the reservoir c the established method was applied to xld dam to re establish the fish migratory habitats between xld dam and xiangjiaba xjb dam overall the method established in the paper which ensures fish migration and survival may provide important guidance for re establishing fish migration channels with safe habitats in reservoir areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 fish migration requirements one essential feature of a river is that it represents a system of unidirectional water flows which is the primary orientation cue for fluvial fish migration aldven et al 2015 according to the chinese national standard for fishway design the induced velocity of main migratory fish in china is 0 2 m s mwrprc 2013 fish can migrate normally when the flow velocity is greater than 0 2 m s similarly fish will be disoriented if the river velocity is lower than the induced velocity of the fishes xu et al 2017 therefore the flow velocity threshold for meeting fish migration requirements was defined in this study as 0 2 m s which is a condition that would satisfy the flow velocity threshold of most migratory fish in the world as shown in fig 1 simulation results showed that the flow velocity in xjb reservoir was less than 0 2 m s in many sections on july 5 and july 8 2014 as a result fish in xjb reservoir may not be able to migrate upstream hence it is necessary to increase the flow velocity in xjb reservoir by methods of dispatching to reestablish fish migration passage 2 2 tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg the experiment results showed that fish have a certain degree of tolerance to supersaturated tdg yuan et al 2021 the supersaturated tdg tolerance threshold of juvenile rock carp procypris rabaudi tchang was 115 huang et al 2010b and the schizothorax prenanti began to die within 2 h in 120 supersaturated tdg water ji et al 2019a the us environmental protection agency s natural river water quality management standard from 1986 stated that supersaturated tdg in natural water bodies should be less than 110 studies showed that the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg varies with the level and duration of tdg the average survival times of the fish were found to be 2 2 2 7 5 2 6 0 and 6 5 h at supersaturated tdg levels of 145 140 135 130 and 125 respectively xue et al 2019 the lower the level of the supersaturated tdg the longer the survival time of fishes laboratory studies showed that with similar mean values of supersaturated tdg the median lethal time lt 50 of test fish exposed to supersaturated tdg graded from 110 to 130 for 24 h 58 2 lower than that of supersaturated tdg at 120 constant exposure ji et al 2019b therefore this study incorporated the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg into the reservoir management model 2 3 eco friendly reservoir operation method in the study a multi objective reservoir management model was developed to mitigate the effects of supersaturated tdg and low flow velocity on fish migration the framework of the established model was shown in fig 2 including a supersaturated tdg prediction model a reservoir velocity prediction model a multi objective optimization model and 2 d hydraulic model the modeling process was shown as follows 1 firstly appropriate factors were selected through correlation analysis and then response surface methodology rsm was used to construct a prediction model for the generation of supersaturated tdg 2 the 2 d hydraulic model was used to predict the distribution of the velocity field in the reservoir area and the rms was used to construct the minimum velocity prediction model in the reservoir area 3 coupling the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg the flow rate requirements of fish migration and socio economic requirements a multi objective ecological dispatch model was established for reservoirs management 2 3 1 overview of the study area the study area is between the xld hydropower station and the xjb hydropower station as shown in fig 3 located in the lower reaches of jinsha river there are many nature reserves for rare fish in the lower reaches of jinsha river li et al 2020 the total installed capacity of the xld hydropower station is 12 67 million kw the dead water level is 540 m and the normal storage level is 600 m the total installed capacity of the xjb hydropower station is 5 16 million kw the dead water level is 370 m and the normal storage level is 380 m supersaturated tdg generated by the flood discharge of xld hydropower station will be transported and diffused to xjb reservoir causing disease or even death of fish in xjb reservoir the operation of xld and xjb hydropower stations changed the hydrological conditions of the rivers and blocked the migratory pathways of important fish species such as coreius gui chenoti and rhinogobio ventralis which led to a decrease in fish diversity in the lower reaches of jinsha river hu et al 2021 the flow velocity in xjb reservoir is regulated by controlling the outflow from xld dam and xjb reservoir to reconstruct a suitable flow velocity field for fish migration therefore the research focused on the downstream of the xld dam to the xjb dam with a total length of 157 km 2 3 2 2 d hydrodynamic simulation to simulate hydrodynamic conditions a 2 d hydrodynamic model for deep reservoirs based on ce qual w2 platform was built the ce qual w2 is a two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model for rivers estuaries lakes reservoirs and river basin systems wan et al 2021b constructed a 2 d hydrodynamic model between the downstream of xld

3 surrogate model the purpose of establishing the surrogate model was to construct a model that converges to reality by fitting relationships between input variables and response values so the direct effects of supersaturated tdg and flow velocity on fish migration could be quantified by a surrogate model and incorporated into multi objective reservoir management models previously heddam 2016 used the generalized regression neural network to predict tdg uptake with available measured data heddam et al 2019 compared the ability of new modeling tools kriging interpolation method kim response surface method rsm and feedforward neural network ffnn to predict supersaturated tdg level and found little difference in accuracy between the three models the construction process of rsm was relatively simple if the accuracy of the model was sufficient for the subsequent construction of ecological operation models the choice of rsm reduced the difficulty of model construction therefore in this research the rsm was used to design the prediction model of supersaturated tdg generation and the surrogate model of minimum flow velocity in the reservoir area by using correlation analysis the main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg were as the input of the prediction model of supersaturated tdg generation the minimum flow velocity surrogate model in the reservoir area took the inflow and the outflow as model inputs the general fitting equations for the rsm were as follows wang and shi 2021 11 y α 0 i 1 m α i x i or 12 y α 0 i 1 m α i x i i j i j m α i j x i x j i 1 m ε 2 τ

improve fish survival the lt 50 was used to evaluate the tolerance of fish to supersaturated tdg studies have shown that the lt 50 of fish varies with species under different supersaturated tdg levels as shown in table 1 lt 50 for rock carp was the shortest only 4 32 h under 120 supersaturated tdg water when fish returned to low level supersaturated tdg water the physiological damage caused by supersaturated tdg could be restored hence this research considered the most disadvantageous case took the lt 50 of rock carp as the tolerance threshold of fish and coupled it into the flood discharge pattern the way to realize the interval discharge pattern could be described in table 2 2 4 multi objective reservoir management model the outflow from xld dam directly controlled the incoming flow from xjb reservoir therefore to carry out ecological regulation of the river section between two dams it was necessary to change the flood discharge plan of xld dam in order to reduce the impact of supersaturated tdg on fish and increase power generation a multi objective ecological model was established in this paper the model could be mathematically stated as 13 f 1 min f t 1 n t c t 14 f 2

generation in order to determine the main environmental factors affecting the generation level of supersaturated tdg the correlation analysis among supersaturated tdg water level inflow outflow and flood discharge was carried out as shown in table 3 all four environmental factors were associated with the generation of supersaturated tdg three highly correlated variables water level outflow and flood discharge were selected as the main variables to construct the response surface model the field measured data from july 8 11 2014 were used as the model data input with supersaturated tdg level as response values water level outflow and flood discharge as influencing factors and the design expert software was used for regression fitting the fitted regression equation was as follow 30 y 1 2449 05217 6 84193 a 8 25420 e 003 b 0 015315 c where a is the downstream water level m b is the outflow of hydropower station m3 s c is the flood discharge of hydropower station m3 s the significant results of the regression equation model and various parameters were shown in table 4 the p value was used to judge the significance of the model when p 0 05 the model was significant and the smaller the p value the greater the effect on the model the larger the f value of the model was the more significant the influence of factors was the f value of the model was 127 22 with the p value less than 0 0001 indicating that the model was highly significant and factor a factor b and factor c significantly impact on supersaturated tdg at the same time factor a factor b and factor c had a significant impact on supersaturated tdg as shown in table 5 the r squared r 2 of this model was 0 9051 and the adjusted r square r 2 adj was 0 8980 it showed that the equation had a reasonable degree of fit and could explain 90 51 of the response value change this showed that the model could be used to predict the generation of supersaturated tdg 3 2 the surrogate model of minimum flow velocity in reservoir area the minimum flow velocity data in xjb reservoir under different inflow and outflow of xld and xjb dam were simulated by the 2 d hydrodynamic model as the inflow of the xjb reservoir was the outflow of xld dam the xjb reservoir flow velocity could be regulated by controlling the discharge from xld dam the surrogate model was used to construct the minimum flow velocity control equation and the equation expression was as follow 31 y 2 0 062377 3 04869 e 005 a 2 22347e 004 b 4 03594 e 008 a b 9 76325 e 009 a 2 3 32653e 009 b 2 8 32639 e 012 a b 2 3 56433 e 013 a 3 where a is the discharge of the xld dam m3 s b is the discharge on the right bank of the xjb dam m3 s discharge from the left bank of the xjb dam is equal to right bank as shown in table 6 although the f value of the model was 193 06 and the p value was less than 0 0001 the p value of items a a 2 b and b 3 was greater than 0 1000 which could be removed the adjusted model analysis of variance was shown in table 7 after removing the terms of a 2 b and b 3 the f value of the model as 248 4559 the p value was less than 0 0001 and the terms of b ab a 2 b 2 ab 2 a 3 were significant model terms showing that the significance of the model had improved the r 2 of this model was 0 8329 and r 2 adj was 0 8295 it showed that the equation had a good degree of fit and could explain 83 29 of the response value change 3 3 result of the reservoir operation 3 3 1 comparison of flood discharge patterns three scenarios were designed based on the operation conditions of this study a ecological priority α 1 β 0 b equal weight of ecological and power generation α 0 5 β 0 5 and c priority power generation α 0 β 1 lingo was adopted to solving the multi objective management model for optimal operation within 72 h fig 4 showed the changes of the flood discharge power generation supersaturated tdg level and minimum flow velocity in xjb reservoir for three scenarios the results showed that the maximum power generation capacity of the hydropower station was reached for all three scenarios while ensuring the safety of the dam which was far higher than the prototype observation results the simulation results for all three scenarios also ensured that the minimum flow velocity in xjb reservoir area was greater than or equal to 0 2 m s it could meet the normal upward migration behavior of migratory fish entering the xjb reservoir area both ecological priority and ecological power generation equal weight modes fig 4 a and b could realize the continuous flood discharge time of less than 4 h when the level of the supersaturated tdg downstream of xld was greater than or equal to 140 and then the flood discharge was suspended for a while to reduce the supersaturated tdg in the water body under scenarios a and b there would be a long period of stopping flood discharge from 14 00 on july 9 10 00 on july 12 however the simulation results of scenario a showed that the supersaturated tdg was relatively high from 22 00 on july 8 04 00 on july 9 but the flood discharge stops for a short time and did not give sufficient supersaturated tdg release time the maximum time for supersaturated tdg higher than 140 under the power generation priority scenario fig 4 c was 8 h which was higher than the maximum supersaturated tdg residence time under scenarios a and b in this scenario fish were prone to bubble disease and even death which was not conducive to the ecological health of the river therefore a combined evaluation of the simulation results for three scenarios showed that neither the ecology only nor the power generation only scenarios were optimal simulation results were better for scenario b which considers ecology and power generation 3 3 2 results for the distribution of supersaturated tdg and flow velocity in xjb reservoir since the simulation result of scenario b was the best only the supersaturated tdg distribution of scenario b was analyzed fig 5 showed the simulation results of supersaturated tdg distribution in xjb reservoir of scenario b the contours in fig 5 a showed that high saturated tdg generated by xld entered xjb reservoir at 14 00 on july 8 after 8 h the distribution of supersaturated tdg in xjb reservoir was shown in fig 5 b and the continuous state of high supersaturation tdg in xjb reservoir area was broken the residence time of supersaturated tdg level at 140 was fewer than 2 h of that in the same area because high saturation tdg would spread downstream with water flow and xld dam flood discharge did not continuously generate high supersaturated tdg in an interval discharge pattern according to fig 5 c d e and f the residence time of supersaturated tdg with levels between 115 and 120 was longer but not more than 12 h which was less than the corresponding fish lt 50 since the xld dam stopped flood discharge for a period of time after its flood discharge produces high saturation tdg as shown in fig 5 this could provide fish with a certain time to recover the physiological damage caused by supersaturated tdg after 16 00 on july 10 the xld dam completely stopped flood discharge as shown in fig 5 g and h it meaned that supersaturated tdg in xjb reservoir area would be in a low supersaturation state for a long time and fish could recover well during this time the simulation results of supersaturated tdg distribution showed that the goal of safe fish migration could be achieved by adopting a model with equal weighting for ecology and power generation fig 6 showed the flow velocity distribution simulation results in xjb reservoir area as shown in fig 6 b the flow velocity of the water in the upper layer of xjb reservoir was greater than 0 2 m s at various times and there was no break in the layer this meaned that fish could migrate in this layer of water also according to fig 5 b the level of supersaturated tdg in the xjb reservoir area was within the range that ensured fish safety as a result a fish migration route was re established that entirely fits the needed of migratory fish in xjb reservoir demonstrating the success of our strategy 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy of surrogate model in this paper the rsm was adopted to establish the connection between the supersaturated tdg and various factors which provided conditions for the eco friendly reservoir operation model from the results reported in table 8 the r 2 r 2 adj and f value of two models established by the rsm in this paper were 0 9051 0 8329 0 8980 0 8295 127 22 248 4559 respectively which showed that the fitting effect of the two models was good and could be applied to the later models there was little difference in accuracy between the supersaturated tdg prediction model constructed by heddam et al 2019 using rsm and the model constructed in this paper however such differences were acceptable this was because differences in the amount of data and factors essentially could impact the accuracy of the model fig 7 showed the scatterplots of measured vs calculated values of the supersaturated tdg and the flow velocity prediction models it could be seen that the errors of both models were within acceptable limits this indicated that the accuracy of the models was acceptable therefore numerical simulation using the rsm was feasible the creation of these two models was the key to the realization of the multi objective reservoir management model the development of these two models efficiently quantified the link of supersaturated tdg and flow velocity in the reservoir area with various factors allowing them to be combined with the reservoir s multi objective planning model 4 2 discussion of model operation results protecting fish diversity is an integral part of protecting river biodiversity however the extensive construction of high dams has hindered the safe migration of fish leading to the reduction of river biodiversity most researchers carried out research from the perspective of ensuring the safe passage of fish through the dam ahmadi et al 2021 peirson et al 2021 and restoring the flow velocity of the downstream river chang et al 2021 sedighkia et al 2021 yan et al 2021 which has contributed to the protection of fish migration passages downstream of the dam but some studies have pointed out that despite many efforts has done many fish still failed to complete their migrations successfully noonan et al 2012 xu et al 2020 xu et al 2017 the construction of dams disrupted river connectivity turning formerly torrential rivers into still or semi still reservoirs resulting in the inability of fish to migrate therefore even if the fish successfully reached the upstream of the dam from the downstream through the fishway they could not continue migrating upward because the flow velocity of the water in the reservoir was too low to provide migration guidance therefore an eco friendly reservoir operation method with power generation and the impact of supersaturated tdg ecological goals and the reservoir area flow velocity as one of the ecological constraints was developed the results in table 1 showed that rock carp have the worst tolerance to supersaturated tdg so an interval discharge pattern based on the lt 50 of rock carp was designed and the established 2 d hydrodynamic model wan et al 2021b was adopted to predict the flow velocity and the supersaturated tdg level of water in xjb reservoir the results showed that the flow velocity gained by the original flood discharge management scheme of xld dam could not meet the requirements of migrating fish in xjb reservoir a continuous zone of flow velocity greater than 0 2 m s could not be established along the migration pathway which could not provide directional cues for fish migration in addition according to the prototype observation data of wan et al 2021b the problem of tdg supersaturation existed in xjb reservoir over a long period of time with the actual flood discharge pattern therefore an eco friendly reservoir operation method that protects both fish migration channels and fish survival was established in the paper three scenarios were adopted to verify the usability of the established method results indicated that both scenario a and b could ensure the safe migration of fish as shown in table 9 the maximum residence times of supersaturated tdg in scenario a and b at key sections of the xjb reservoir were less than the corresponding lt 50s for different supersaturated tdg level which indicated that fish could survive normally during the flood discharge process in scenario a and b the results also indicated that the minimum flow velocity of water in reservoirs gained by scenario a and b was greater than 0 2 m s which could provide upward migration signals for migratory fish the maximum residence times of supersaturated tdg with 140 level in scenario c was 8 h which was greater than the corresponding lt 50 about 2 times the evaluation results showed that fish in xjb reservoir in scenario c would die and could not migrate safely since the synergy of ecological and economic benefits was not considered in scenario a therefore scenario b was considered to be the optimal eco friendly reservoir operation method to realize the reconstruction of migratory habitat of fish in reservoir the reliability of scenario b was also verified by the established 2 d hydrodynamics model compared to studies by wan et al 2021b ma et al 2019 and xu et al 2017 this study considers the coupling effects of supersaturated tdg and low flow velocity on fish migration environment achieving the improvement of reconstruction technology for fish migration habitats in reservoirs in this study hydrodynamic and water environmental conditions were linked together which could better reflect the coupling requirements of fish migration to more environmental conditions this study can provide theoretical and technical support for the reconstruction of fish migration pathways under complex environmental conditions 4 3 discuss the ecological risk and economic assessment of the multi objective operation method the effect of supersaturated tdg on fish in this study was reflected in the difference between the maximum residence time and the corresponding lt 50 for each level of supersaturated tdg when the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg was greater than the corresponding lt 50 the fish would die due to overexposure to supersaturated tdg water chen et al 2012 huang et al 2010a when the maximum residence time of the supersaturated tdg was less than the corresponding lt 50 the biological functions of fish damaged by exposure to tdg water could be recovered upon return to freshwater conditions cao et al 2022 cao et al 2016b compared with the original flood discharge method the optimized flood discharge method could reduce the residence time of supersaturated tdg and increased the flow velocity in the reservoir area in table 9 the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg with 140 level in scenario c was 8 h which were greater than the corresponding lt 50 about 2 times in other scenarios scenarios a and c the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg at 120 120 130 140 levels were less than corresponding lt 50 s this showed that the established method considering ecological objectives could increased the survival probability of fish which was consistent with relevant results from other researchers ma et al 2019 wan et al 2021b while minimizing the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg the flow velocity in the reservoir area under three scenarios was also greater than 0 2 m s ensuring the safety of fish migration most fish can obtain migration direction guidance under this flow velocity therefore it can be considered that the established model in this study can improve the migratory habitat of fish and increase the species richness of fish with certain ecological and economic benefits in addition xld hydropower station can generate electricity at its maximum installed capacity in all three scenarios improving economic efficiency 5 conclusions the construction of the dam has caused a great impact on the river ecosystem with the operation of increasing numbers of dams in china side effects of dam constructions such as supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg caused by flood discharge and the reduced flow velocity in the reservoir area have become serious potential threat to aquatic life in order to reduce the impact of dam constructions on river ecosystem an eco friendly multi objective reservoir management model was established in the paper to reduce the residence time of supersaturated tdg and increase reservoir flow velocity in this key ecological zone to restore fish migration pathways simulation results showed that xld hydropower station could generate at full capacity and the minimum flow velocity in xjb reservoir would be above 0 2 m s under all three scenarios the worst simulation results were obtained in the pattern targeting power generation only with a maximum residence time of 8 h for supersaturated tdg level at 140 which exceeds the corresponding lt 50 of fish however compared with the original flood discharge pattern the worst simulation results could significantly reduce the residence time of tdg and improve the flow velocity in key sections of reservoir area the model could effectively reduce the maximum residence time of supersaturated tdg and increase the flow velocity greater than 0 2 m s in xjb reservoir area which could improve the quality of fish migration habitats and contribute to the safe migration of fish in the reservoir area the simulation results of two dimensional tdg transport diffusion model indicated that discharge patterns generated by the established eco friendly model could produce several supersaturated tdg clusters in the reservoir and provided a certain recovery time and velocity signal stimulation for fish migration this method could provide new ideas for solving the problem of fish migration caused by dam construction and provide theoretical and technical support for water environment management however the fish migration constraint only requires the flow velocity greater than 0 2 m s in this study which may not meet the flow velocity requirements for all migrating fish in future work we will consider incorporating the uncertainty of fish migration flow velocity constraints into the multi objective ecological scheduling model of the reservoir to improve the optimization accuracy of the model in addition intelligent models such as neural networks and kriging models need to be integrated into the model framework to improve the prediction accuracy of supersaturated tdg generation and flow velocity predication the method can provide new ideas for ecological restoration work on rivers affected by dam construction credit authorship contribution statement yujuan mo conceptualization

zheng et al 2016 according to farinosi et al 2019 climate and lulc change are expected to reduce river flows by up to 20 and lead to a considerable change in the seasonality of flows and an increase in interannual variability in the tapajós basin in the brazilian amazon the 35 and 68 decline in precipitation and runoff during the 1961 1966 and 1973 2001 periods in the chao river basin in china have been attributed to climate change and human activities respectively wang et al 2009 studies in the johor river basin in malaysia found that climate and lulc change increased annual flow by 4 4 and 0 06 tan et al 2015 in the usa a work by giri et al 2019 on the neshanic river catchment showed that climate change scenarios alone or combined with land use change predicted 32 36 higher flow compared to the baseline period in west africa several researchers have investigated the influence of climate and lulc change on water resources in various catchments op de hipt et al 2018 osei et al 2019 yonaba et al 2021a 2021b due to rapid population growth developing countries find it challenging to manage the impacts of lulc and climate change on their catchment aneseyee et al 2020 in the pra river catchment in ghana results of work by awotwi et al 2021 on the impact of climate and lulc change revealed that flows in the near to mid 21st century are projected to increase by 4 12 while a reduction was projected at the end of the 21st century under the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 emission scenario under rcp 8 5 however simulations showed an increase in flow throughout the 21st century forest and topography play a major role in the runoff in a catchment while evapotranspiration and surface runoff are the main factors regulating the flow of water in a catchment rcp projections for all land use categories have shown declining trends in precipitation and streamflow op de hipt et al 2018 osei et al 2019 climate change in west africa could also affect water availability in reservoirs and lead to lower agricultural production increased hunger and lower drinking water supplies for populations antwi agyei et al 2021 kling et al 2016 lawin et al 2019 also gauze et al 2018a b point out that intensification of agricultural activities coupled with climate change could lead to a decrease in potential evapotranspiration and an increase in runoff about 2 7 by 2050 in the davo catchment the latest studies carried out on the lobo reservoir catchment lrc by yao et al 2019a b showed that the rainfall deficit due to climate change will lead to a decrease in flows of the order of 83 at the nibéhibé station and 87 at loboville which may lead to the drying up of some hydraulic infrastructures during the dry periods of the year from the results of the various studies above it can be seen that the impact of climate and lulc change on runoff varies from one catchment to another and according to the region indeed the catchments in these studies differ in size morphology topography soil types and spatio temporal variability of climatic variables rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration also anthropogenic activities on catchments are not the same from one region to another hung et al 2020 onyutha et al 2021 in côte d ivoire very few studies have attempted to understand the combined impact of climate and lulc change on water resources in general and on reservoir inflows in particular in the lobo river catchment no studies have been conducted on the impacts of climate change and lulc in the lrc and its reservoir despite the significant socio economic importance of this reservoir according to lambin et al 2003 the lack of a management policy makes it difficult to manage water resources management policies can evolve appropriately through hydrological modelling dosdogru et al 2020 hydrological models cannot only help to predict current and future flow conditions but also minimise costs and investment time mendez and calvo valverde 2016 in this study the cequeau model is used to assess the impact of climate change and lulc change on inflows to the lobo river reservoir to ensure better management of this water resource by the horizon of 2030 and 2050 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lobo reservoir catchment lrc is located in west central côte d ivoire between longitudes 6 12 and 6 56 west and latitudes 6 40 and 7 55 north fig 1 it covers an area of 6923 km² at nibéhibé station and is characterized by a peneplain with an altitude ranging from 192 m to 612 m avenard 1974 this river is one of the tributaries of the sassandra river yao et al 2019a b rising at an altitude of 400 m south of séguéla yao et al 2019a b koffi et al 2020 the lobo reservoir lr was built in 1976 maiga et al 2001 and is the main source of drinking water for the city of daloa the average amount of water drawn from the reservoir is 16 200 m3 day the average depth of the reservoir is 3 5 m with an average width of 74 m a length of 4 3 km and an area of 30 3 ha the volume at the normal elevation plane level 231 033 m is 380 000 m3 the climate of lrc is transitional equatorial with a rainy season from march to october and a dry season from november to february the average annual rainfall is about 1254 6 mm year 1966 2017 and the average annual temperature is about 26 3 c 1966 2017 the average flow of the river at the hydrometric station nibéhibé located downstream of the reservoir is 13 33 m3 s 1988 2015 the city of daloa represents the economic hub of the region anthropogenic activities in the catchment are very diverse however agriculture remains the main activity of the population 2 2 data 2 2 1 hydro meteorological data the hydrometeorological data required for hydrological modelling using cequeau include rainfall minimum and maximum temperature and discharge from various hydrometric stations in the catchment two sources of rainfall data were used these are observed and satellite rainfall data the observed climate data rainfall and temperature used in this study are obtained from five stations daloa p é lézi séguéla vavoua and zuénoula they were provided by sodexam société d exploitation et de développement aéroportuaire aéronautique et météorologique de côte d ivoire over the period 1983 2016 satellite climate data were obtained from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps the chirps rainfall was used to supplement the missing data of p é lézi and séguéla stations from 1992 to 2016 as well as the the limited spatial distribution of the observed stations in the catchment from 1983 to 2016 chirps data is a gridded precipitation time series with a horizontal resolution of 0 05 ogega et al 2021 the datasets have been widely used for studies in west africa basse et al 2021 boluwade 2020 yangouliba et al 2022a and in côte d ivoire obahoundje et al 2022 chirps rainfall was used to fill in the missing data from the p é lézi and séguéla stations from 1992 to 2016 as well as the limited spatial distribution of observed stations in the catchment from 1983 to 2016 for this purpose a comparison of the chirps data with the observation data from the p é lézi and séguéla stations was carried out over the period 1985 1991 thus the chirps data were compared to the station precipitation on a monthly scale using taylor diagram the hydrometric data from the nibéhibé station are obtained from the database of the directorate of hydrology of côte d ivoire and cover the period from 1985 to 2015 all climatic and hydrometric data used in this study are at daily time step 2 2 2 regional climate model in this study four 4 regional climate models rcms rca4 cclm4 8 17 racmo22t and remo derived from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa program were used giorgi et al 2009 the choice of these rcms is based on their ability to reproduce the general characteristics of the african climate particularly in west africa coulibaly et al 2018 kouadio et al 2020 lawin et al 2019 the models simulations were forced with data from the cnrm cm5 mpi esm lr ichec ec and hadgem2 es global circulation climate models gcms under two representative concentration pathway scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 hazeleger et al 2012 voldoire et al 2013 historical data for these rcms is available for the period 1950 2005 and projections cover the period 2006 2100 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios these are composed of daily rainfall and minimum and maximum temperature at each grid point in the lrc 2 2 3 topographical data and soil map other input data required by the ceqeau model include the digital elevation model dem which was obtained from https lta cr usgs gov at a spatial resolution of 30 m the soil map used in the model is at a scale of 1 5000 000 and was obtained from the us food agricultural organization soil database fao 1995 data for cities rivers and roads were obtained from the database of the côte d ivoire mapping centre cct 2 2 4 remote sensing data the land use maps used in this study were obtained from the processing of landsat tm etm oli 8 images of the years 1986 2002 and 2019 the landsat images were downloaded free of charge from http earthexplorer usgs gov the study area is located between scenes 197 55 and 198 55 which the numbers are wrs path row coordinates all images have a spatial resolution of 30 m all images were downloaded with a cloud cover percentage lower than 10 the authors downloaded level 2 c2 images surface reflectance images the acquired images had already undergone pre processing radiometric geometric topographic atmospheric corrections before being available for download on the usgs earth explorer website 2 3 methods 2 3 1 regional climate model bias correction to improve the resolution of climate models at the desired scales from regional to local and the accuracy reduction of model biases several approaches to correcting the biases of daily precipitation and temperature data have been developed the linear scaling ls method is used in this study because it has been used in several studies around the world chen et al 2015 fiseha et al 2014 giri et al 2019 this method is based on the application of a correction factor to the data series simulated by the climate models in order to make them more representative of the observed climate this correction factor is applied multiplicatively for the correction of rainfall series and additively for temperature the observed rainfall at each station in the lrc was compared with the grid point closest to the rcm considering the grid points as a single station on the map nkiaka et al 2017 a correction was made to the precipitation and temperature data for each climate station the performance of the climate models was assessed by comparing observed and simulated data using the taylor diagram after correcting for the biases in the climate model data an interpolation of the climate stations was used to obtain the variation in mean annual precipitation and temperature for each climate model over the lobo river catchment the correction procedures adopted in this study are explained in eqs 1 and 2 1 p r c m c o r i j p r c m i j p o b s p r c m 2 t r c m c o r i j t r c m i j t o b s t r c m where prcm cor and trcm cor are the corrected value of precipitation and temperature p obs and t obs are the observed historical precipitation and temperature at each station i j is the ith day of the jth month p and oi are the average precipitation and temperature for month j which is calculated as the average of all days in month j under the baseline 1986 2005 2 3 2 lulc mapping before simulating the dynamics of land use change in the lrc a supervised classification of landsat images from 1986 2002 and 2019 based on knowledge of the study area and field data was carried out using envi 4 7 software the maximum likelihood algorithm was chosen for the supervised classification this method is commonly used in the literature gupta and sharma 2020 mciver and friedl 2002 five land use classes namely primary forest degraded forest crop and fallow habitat and bare soil and water were identified based on an expert knowledge of the study area the primary forest refers to a dense forest with a closed canopy degraded forest it does not refer to an intact forest but rather to a forest that has experienced little degradation ebodé et al 2022 2 3 3 land change modelling furthermore the use maps were integrated into the land change modeler lcm of the terrset software for the 2030 and 2050 land use modelling lcm has been used for land cover modelling worldwide leta et al 2021 mishra et al 2014 nedjai et al 2016 yonaba et al 2021a 2021b the multilayer perceptron neural network mlp method was used in the lobo river catchment the mpl method was preferred because it can model complex relationships between variables as neural networks can express simultaneous change potentials to various types of field changes thapa and murayama 2012 the methodology adopted by lcm considers that land use changes are the result of endogenous trends of change factors which are assessed in the calibration phase as well as exogenous changes such as long term policies constraints or incentives yangouliba et al 2022b zarandian et al 2023 the potential transitions were carried out using the mlp method each potential transition is modelled individually using the explanatory variables that may have explained it between the five land use classes the accuracy rate evaluates the explanatory potential of the combination of illustrative variables potential transition the lcm tutorial suggests an accuracy rate of 80 or more eastman 2016 however an accuracy rate of 50 is accepted rodríguez eraso et al 2013 the conversion of water to another class was not taken into account because a significant variation has not been observed since 1986 conversion of crops and fallow land to the primary forest was not considered the last time considerable vegetation recovery was observed was in 1986 according to historical satellite images discussions with local people and studies by kouassi et al 2020 on the lobo river catchment land use maps for 1986 and 2002 were used as input for the calibration six explanatory variables were considered as factors that influence the land use change digital elevation model dem slope pedology road network hydrographic network and towns fig 2 the pre processing of the distance from the road and hydrographic network to the variables was done in arcgis once the data was acquired in the desired format it was entered into lcm the cramer s v statistic was used to assess the explanatory power of environmental factors this statistic ranges from 0 weak association to 1 strong association and eastman 2016 suggests thresholds for interpreting cramer s v a value greater than 0 4 indicates high potential while a minimum value of 0 15 indicates the variable is useful in describing changes however a cramer s v value below 0 15 does not necessarily exclude the variable from being included in the model as this may depend on expert judgment or consideration of the study context beygi heidarlou et al 2019 mishra et al 2014 r yonaba et al 2021a 2021b in this study the selected variables all had an overall cramer s v value greater than 0 15 and transition potential maps were generated from the calibrated model additionally the model s accuracy rate and skill measure were evaluated with the latter being given by an equation ranging from 1 low estimator accuracy to 1 high estimator accuracy richards 2013 mas et al 2014b eastman 2015 the land use map of 2019 was simulated based on trends observed over the period 1986 2019 the mlp neural network was then used to produce the 2019 prediction map validation of the 2019 prediction map was carried out through two methods first by comparing simulated 2019 and reference 2019 maps second by using kappa statistics criteria the kappa for location klocation expresses the ability of the model to predict the location of changes the standard kappa index of agreement kstandard quantifies the level of agreement between the simulated and reference maps finally the kappa for no information kno defines the overall accuracy of the simulation when all three kappa are equal to 1 it indicates a perfect simulation pontius 2000 subedi et al 2013 after calibration and validation of the model the prediction of the lulc maps for 2030 and 2050 was carried out with an mlp neural network under a business as usual scenario 2 3 4 cequeau hydrological model setup calibration and validation cequeau is semi distributed hydrological reservoir type model the model uses a production function vertical water flow and a transfer function upstream downstream to simulate the flow over the entire catchment this model was developed at the national institute of scientific research inrs water in quebec morin et al 1995 dibike and coulibaly 2005 the structure of the model is based on the calculation of the water and heat balance for each node of the grid at daily time step the grid consists of physiographic cells of equal size each with its own land use physiographic and meteorological data in this study the catchment area was discretised into 112 grid cells within which these different processes occur the whole mesh is further subdivided into 201 submeshes fig 3 the rainfall runoff conceptual module first simulates the hydrological state of the catchment as a function of total precipitation ptot minimum and maximum air temperature tmin and tmax and topographical data via a production function the hydrological components are simulated on each grid cell and then fed to the thermal module with additional meteorological inputs solar radiation wind speed air vapour pressure and cloud cover the hydrological and thermal components of the model are described in detail in charron et al 2021 the following state variables are used in cequeau water level in the upper reservoir water level in the lower reservoir water level in lakes and marshes snow accumulation in non forested areas and actual evapotranspiration in the lrc the parameters of snow stock formation and melting are not considered because the study area is located in a tropical region west africa the model allows the user to indicate the presence of a dam at any point in the catchment and the relationship between flow and storage goodrich 1931 method was used to estimate the inflow and outflow of the reservoir potential evapotranspiration pet is calculated by cequeau model using the thorntwaite method the calibration method of the cequeau model is done by testing and optimization the period of 1988 2006 was used as a calibration period whereas the period 2007 2015 was used for the validation the calibration period contains wet dry and normal years the adjustment of the model parameters was carried out by analyzing the numerical and graphical criteria the numerical criterion is done by comparing the observed and simulated flows using the nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe

cequeau model was used to estimate the inflow into the reservoir for this purpose three simulation scenarios were carried out the first scenario examines the impact of land use change on water inflows into the lr during this simulation the climatic parameters precipitation and temperature over the reference period 1986 2005 are static but the land use maps of 1986 2002 2019 2030 and 2050 are used the second scenario only considers the effects of climate change on the lr inflow over 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in this simulation the climate conditions of the period 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 are used and the 2002 land use is kept fixed over the reference period 1986 2005 the third scenario analyses the combined impacts of climate change and land use on the lr inflow over 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 all climate parameters temperature and precipitation horizon 2030 2021 2040 horizon 2050 2041 2060 and lulc 1986 2002 2019 2030 and 2050 are not static the implementation of several simulation hypotheses makes it possible to verify which scenario has a real influence on the hydrological functioning of the lobo river catchment 3 results 3 1 satellite data validation the results obtained by comparing the observed data from the stations of séguéla and p é lézi with the satellite data chirps are presented by the taylor diagram fig 4 it can be seen that the correlation values obtained from the comparison are higher than 0 9 with a standard deviation lower than 2 0 and an rmse value lower than 1 the chirps model at the séguéla station has the lowest correlation 0 78 the lowest centred rmse 0 8 and the highest standard deviation 0 64 fig 4a although the chirps data at the pelezi station was found to be the strongest it recorded a correlation of 0 85 a centred rmse of less than 0 98 and a standard deviation of 0 56 fig 4b it can be generally observed that the chirps satellite data can reproduce the daily rainfall data observed at the séguéla and p é lézi stations therefore it can be said that the chirps data are considered reliable for the analysis 3 2 effect of bias correction on rcms performance fig 5 and the taylor diagram fig 6 show the bias correction results for the four rcms and the average of all models before bias correction of the rcms precipitation data the rmses ranged from 0 58 to 1 2 the standard deviations from 0 57 to 0 78 and the correlation coefficients from 0 75 to 0 85 figs 5a and 6a after correcting for the bias in the precipitation data the performance criteria of all models improved significantly rmses between 0 99 and 1 1 standard deviations between 0 19 and 0 25 and correlation coefficients between 0 96 and 0 98 were obtained fig 5b 6b before the bias correction of the temperature data we had rmses between 0 58 and 1 3 standard deviations between 0 2 and 0 7 and correlation coefficients between 0 71 and 0 98 fig 5c 6c after bias correction rmses between 0 99 and 1 25 standard deviations between 0 2 and 0 6 and correlation coefficients between 0 88 and 0 98 were obtained fig 5d 6d after bias correction the performance criteria between the observed data and the rcms are improved therefore the corrected rcms were considered reliable for the analysis 3 3 evolution of future precipitation under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the models show that the catchment will experience both increase and decrease in monthly and annual rainfall fig 7 under rcp 4 5 the rca4 model shows that october and november will experience a 6 9 and 23 8 decrease in precipitation in the catchment by 2021 2040 by 2041 2060 there will be a decrease in precipitation from march to april and december of 19 22 14 5 and 2 74 respectively compared to the reference period the racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 models show a monthly and annual decrease in precipitation over the catchment for both future horizons for the 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time horizons the months of january to june and october to december will experience the largest decreases in rainfall this trend in rainfall observed under rcp 4 5 could continue in the 2021 2040 and 2040 2060 timeframes under rcp 8 5 according to the rca4 model there will be an increase in precipitation for all months of the year except april where there will be a decrease of 12 86 by 2021 2040 under the rcp 8 5 scenario by 2041 2060 october will experience a decrease of 1 3 in contrast to the rca4 model the racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 models will experience a decrease over several months of the year according to the racmo22t model it is the months of january to april august october and december that will be impacted in the 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time frame the cclm4 8 17 model predicts a decline in rainfall for all months except december by 2021 2040 by 2041 2060 the periods from march to july and october to december will be impacted by a decrease in precipitation the remo model projects an increase of 18 and 37 8 by 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively under the rcp 4 5 under the rcp 8 5 rainfall is expected to increase by 31 and 45 by 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively the results show an annual increase in rainfall regardless of the rca4 and remo model scenario this is not the case for the racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 models the relative deviations of all models show that under the rcp 4 5 scenario there is a relative decrease in precipitation of 3 26 and an absolute decrease of 0 032 mm compared to the baseline period under the rcp 8 5 scenario we have a relative decrease of 1 21 and an absolute decrease of 0 012 mm 3 4 evolution of future temperature the monthly mean temperature variations simulated by the rcms rca4 racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 for the 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time horizons with respect to the 1986 2005 reference period are presented by fig 8 the results show that temperatures in the lrc will increase in the future according to majority of climate models based on the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios under the rcp 4 5 scenario for the 2021 2040 time horizon the rca4 and racmo22t climate models predict an increase in mean temperature by 0 16 c and 2 97 c for all months except february which will experience a decrease of 0 17 c and 0 71 c by 2041 2060 both models project an increase of 0 48 3 38 c the monthly temperature forecasts projected by the cclm4 8 17 model are different from those of the rca4 and racmo22t models indeed during the period 2021 2040 the cclm4 8 17 model predicts a temperature decrease of 1 75 c and 0 04 c in dry season and wet season respectively the months of march may and july to september will experience a temperature increase of 1 02 c by 2021 2040 by 2041 2060 monthly temperatures are expected to rise throughout the year under rcp 8 5 scenario not all models are unanimous about an increase or decrease in mean temperature the mean temperature could increase in all months of the year by 0 34 3 69 c by 2041 2060 according to the racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 models a decrease in mean temperature during the beginning of the rainy season by 0 23 2 26 c and at the end of the dry season by 2 24 c is expected the remo model predicts a rise in temperature in all months of the year for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the results show that the temperature amplitude is higher for the rcp 8 5 scenario than for the rcp 4 5 scenario the relative deviations of all models show that under the rcp 4 5 scenario there is a relative temperature increase of 5 2 and an absolute decrease of 0 063 c compared to the baseline period under the rcp 8 5 scenario we have a relative increase of 6 4 and an absolute decrease of 0 060 c 3 5 simulation of land use changes 3 5 1 land use changes analysis between 1986 and 2019 to better appreciate land use dynamics maps depicting changes in land use pattern were created for all land use categories for the periods 1986 2002 2002 2019 1986 2019 fig 9 five main land cover classes emerge from the tm etm and oli image classifications the primary forest class the degraded forest class the crops and fallow class the habitat and bare soil class and the water class visual observation of these maps indicates an overall regression in the area of the primary forest class while the crops and fallow land habitat and bare soil and degraded forest classes have increased in size between 1986 and 2019 the crop and fallow class increased from 8 553 85 km2 to 43 2976 89 km2 the increase of crop and fallow land differs between the periods as follows 19 between 1986 and 2002 and 16 between 2002 and 2019 table 1 the increase is also observed in the habitat and bare soil class indeed between 1986 and 2002 the habitat and bare soil class increased from 11 761 54 km² to 15 1038 45 km² between 2002 and 2019 there was an increase from 15 1038 45 km2 to 17 1142 29 km² table 1 this significant increase in cultivation and bare soil and habitats has led to a significant decrease in forest area in the lrc the primary forest area was 64 4430 7 km2 in 1986 32 2215 4 km2 in 2002 and 10 692 3 km2 in 2019 thus primary forest areas decreased by 32 between 1986 and 2002 22 between 2002 and 2019 and 54 between 1986 and 2019 moreover due to the increase in crop and fallow land the degraded forest class increased from 14 969 22 km2 in 1986 24 1661 52 km2 and 29 2007 67 km2 in 2002 and 2019 respectively 3 5 2 change analysis a change analysis was performed between 1986 and 2002 2002 2019 and 1986 2019 losses gains and net changes for all land use and cover classes lulc are presented in fig 10 during 1986 2002 primary forest lost 2634 km² and gained 875 km² a net loss of 1759 km² the degraded forest class lost 1080 km² and gained 1670 km² a gain of 590 km² the crop and fallow class lost 203 km² and gained 1097 km² i e an increase of 894 km² the habitat and bare soil class lost 187 km² and gained 500 km² a gain of 313 km² the water class lost 105 km² and gained 66 km² a loss of 39 km² fig 10a during 2002 and 2019 the primary forest class lost 2757 km² and gained 306 km² a net loss of 2451 km² fig 10 b the degraded forest class lost 1541 km² and gained 870 km² a loss of 671 km² the crop and fallow class lost 486 km² and gained 3038 km² and 2552 km² built up areas lost 437 km² and gained 1068 km² with a gain of 631 km² the water class lost 67 km² and gained 8 km² a loss of 59 km² fig 10b during the last period 1986 2019 primary forest lost 4580 km² and gained 368 km² a loss of 4212 km² the degraded forest class lost 1006 km² and gained 926 km² i e a loss of 80 km² fig 10 c the crop and fallow land class failed 123 km² and gained 3569 km² 3446 km² the habitat and bare soil class lost 120 km² and gained 1064 km² a gain of 944 km² finally the water class has been very little impacted with minimal variation it lost 105 km² and gained 7 km² a loss of 98 km² fig 10c 3 5 3 analysis of the relationship between the explanatory variables the different explanatory variables and their levels of association with the observed transitions are measured through cramer s v coefficient table 2 almost all variables have a cramer s v value 0 14 with all classes except distance to roads the overall cramer s v statistics for lulc classes such as degraded forest crops and fallow and habitat and soil had the highest values overall v 0 1838 0 4315 similarly distance to locations and dem influence lulc changes with cramer s global v ranging from 0 2307 to 0 3104 distance to roads soil type and slope moderately influence explaining changes in lulc but are still very useful overall v 0 1367 0 1781 all explanatory variables were accepted for modelling the different transitions the accuracy rates of the different potential transitions obtained from the mlp method are below 80 table 3 the lowest accuracy rate is observed for the degraded forest to crop and fallow transition 54 6 the highest accuracy rate is observed in the primary forest to degraded forest transition 70 36 all accuracy rates are above 50 and therefore acceptable 3 5 4 lcm model validation the areas of the different land use classes are presented in table 4 visual interpretation and modelling results show that the simulated map for the year 2019 is reasonably similar to the actual map for that year as shown in fig 11 a large part of the forest has been converted to crop and fallow land the model tends to overestimate the primary forest habitat and bare soil and crop and fallow classes however the model underestimated the degraded forest class it should be noted that water resources remain relatively stable over time the kappa statistics k between the observed and simulated map show strong similarity between the actual and projected land use in the lrc indeed the results show that all statistics kstandard 84 33 knon 86 02 and klocation 86 89 are above 80 table 4 3 5 5 predicted maps based on the assumption of an intensification of anthropogenic activities in the study site over time future land use maps of 2030 and 2050 were produced fig 12 the period 2019 2050 is marked by a downward trend in forest and degraded forest landscapes this decline will be in favour of crops and fallow land and the habitat and bare soil classes the calculated rate of change between 2019 and the simulated maps for 2030 and 2050 shows that crop and fallow remain the most important land use class in 2030 and 2050 table 5 the habitat and bare soil class 17 in 2019 20 in 2030 and 22 in 2050 and crops and fallow land 43 in 2019 67 7 in 2030 and 68 74 in 2050 are the classes that will experience the greatest rate of change however forest areas will experience the highest rate of decline respectively 10 in 2019 6 32 by 2030 and 4 01 by 2050 3 6 calibration and validation of the hydrological model the calibration and validation of the cequeau hydrological model are presented by fig 13 the model shows satisfactory performance during calibration and validation periods with rmse values of 0 83 m3 s nse of 0 7 pbias of 14 1 and a coefficient of determination r² of 0 83 an improvement in the nash criterion is then observed during the validation phase compared to the calibration period we have an nse of 0 75 an rmse of 2 15 m3 s a percentage bias of 12 and a coefficient of determination r² of 0 65 these numerical results are confirmed by a fairly good similarity between the observed and model simulated hydrographs fig 10 nevertheless during the calibration and validation of the model underestimation and an overestimation of the flows for certain years are observed despite the slight discrepancy between the observed and simulated hydrographs the seasonal variations were well reproduced by the model 3 7 impact of lulc on inflow the variation in simulated monthly and annual flows for lulc from 2002 2019 2030 and 2050 under the assumption of static climate parameters over the reference period 1986 2005 are presented fig 14 under this scenario the observed changes in water inflow to the reservoir are attributable to lulc dynamics which are mainly due to the conversion of primary forest degraded forest to cropland and fallow and habitat and bare soil indeed the loss of primary forest replaced by crops and fallow leads to an increase in surface runoff of about 15 2 between 1986 and 2019 24 2 between 2021 and 2040 horizon 2030 and 29 8 between 2041 and 2060 horizon 2050 when converting primary and degraded forests to habitat and bare soil the increase in reservoir flows is even more pronounced than the transition from primary forest to crop and fallow there is an increase of 21 8 between 1986 and 2019 32 4 between 2021 and 2040 horizon 2030 and 39 8 between 2041 and 2060 horizon 2050 this increase in runoff is more noticeable during high water periods however this dynamic is not respected during low water periods there is a deficit before and especially after high water annually the degradation of lulc could lead to an increase in runoff in the lobo reservoir of about 10 8 and 18 87 in 2030 and 2050 respectively 3 8 impact of climate change on inflow the results show a fairly good correspondence between the simulated hydrological regimes over the 2021 2040 2030 and 2041 2060 2050 horizons and those of the baseline fig 15 in terms of dynamics there is no change in the hydrological regime the periods of low flows and peak flows remain identical to those observed over the baseline however the changes are mainly in the volumes of water all climate models rca4 racmo22t cclm4 8 17 and remo are not unanimous on the change in annual inflows to the lr the rca4 and remo models evolve in the same order of magnitude an increase in annual runoff of 17 2 29 5 and 23 6 35 8 is predicted for the 2021 2040 horizon according under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 by 2041 2060 this increase in runoff could continue and reach 23 1 51 3 under rcp 4 5 and 12 3 44 under rcp 8 5 the racmo22t model predict a decrease in annual flows of about 13 3 under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 14 7 for the rcp 8 5 scenario by 2021 2040 however the 2041 2060 horizon is marked by an increase in inflow of about 3 74 according to the rcp 4 5 scenario this increase could be higher under the rcp 8 5 scenario with flows increasing by 7 8 as for the cclm4 8 17 model it predicts a decrease in inflows regardless of the climate scenario used rcp 4 5 and 8 5 an annual decrease of 24 7 and 21 2 in flows by 2021 2040 under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios is expected this decline observed by 2021 2040 could amplify to 29 7 by 2041 2060 under the rcp 4 5 and 13 6 under the rcp 8 3 9 impact of climate and lulc change on water inflow to highlight future changes in inflows to the lr monthly flows were simulated using the cequeau model fig 16 shows the hydrographs of inflows at the 2030 and 2050 horizons compared to the baseline when the combined scenarios of climate change and lulc are considered the results evolve in the same dynamic as the results of scenario 1 the results show a general increase in inflow in the lobo river catchment regardless of the climate model used this increase varies from one climate model to another rca4 racmo22t cclm4 8 17 and remo thus the combined effect of lulc 2030 and 2050 and the climate parameters of the rca4 and remo models could lead to an annual increase in inflow to the reservoir of about 21 3 23 6 and 25 6 29 3 by 2030 according under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively by 2050 this increase could reach 24 31 4 and 31 5 36 2 under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively the racmo22t model also projects a significant increase in inflows during all months of the year with annual increasing flows of 4 8 and 11 94 by 2030 and 7 3 and 14 2 by 2050 however by 2050 a monthly decrease from may to august compared to the baseline period is observed the regional model cclm4 8 17 predicts an increase in the reservoir over the different time horizons under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios inflow will increase by 6 32 and 12 8 respectively by 2030 compared to the baseline by 2050 the increase in annual runoff observed by 2030 under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios will continue this increase could reach between 9 5 and 11 2 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the projection of inflow to the lr shows that the combined scenario of climate change and lulc leads to an increase of reservoir inflow to assess which parameter has a real influence on the water inflow to the lobo river reservoir the isolated effects of climate change and land use on the surface runoff in 2030 and 2050 were evaluated in relation to the reference period 1986 2005 under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios with the annual average of all climate models table 6 the results show that despite a decrease in precipitation by 2030 14 6 by 2050 15 2 under scenario 2 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 and by 6 1 under rcp 4 5 scenario 3 we observe an increase in runoff of 10 8 18 87 scenario 1 1 2 4 46 rcp4 5 3 35 and 2 7 rcp8 5 under scenario 2 and 6 58 11 83 rcp 4 5 14 83 17 72 rcp 8 5 under scenario 3 the influence of climate on surface runoff is less dominant a decrease in precipitation does not necessarily lead to a decrease in inflows to the lobo reservoir changes in lulc conditions and anthropogenic activities were identified as the main causes rather than climate variability 4 discussion 4 1 climate projection in the regional context climate projections from the regional climate models rca4 racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 and remo project higher temperatures for the rcp 8 5 scenarios compared to the rcp 4 5 scenarios over the lrc this result is consistent with the work of ayele et al 2016 and soro et al 2017 other studies have also reported an increase in temperature followed by a decrease in rainfall over west africa diallo et al 2016 sarr and camara 2017 in côte d ivoire several studies are unanimous on the increase in temperature followed by a significant decrease in rainfall over different catchments in the country kouakou et al 2014 soro et al 2017 coulibaly et al 2018 yao et al 2019a b the decrease in mean rainfall in the region could probably be induced in part by a decrease in water vapour in the atmosphere diallo et al 2016 these results confirm the analysis by sylla et al 2018 and the ipcc 2019 on rainfall in west africa indeed west africa is expected to be strongly affected by rising temperatures this increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall observed in the lrc could make the catchment more vulnerable to climate change yao et al 2019a b changes in soil conditions can reduce or exacerbate warming at the regional scale they can affect the intensity frequency and duration of extreme weather events including heat waves droughts and precipitation 4 2 calibration validation of the cequeau model some studies have been carried out in côte d ivoire using the cequeau model the results of our study during the calibration and validation of the cequeau model are in the same order of magnitude as the results found by kouadio et al 2015 on the agnéby and boubo catchment and gauze et al 2018a b on the davo catchment the cequeau model produces satisfactory results during the calibration and validation phases the performance of the nse was better during the validation phase compared to the calibration period similar results have been obtained in other studies joorabian shooshtari et al 2017 osei et al 2021 some studies have been carried out in côte d ivoire using the cequeau model the results of our study during the calibration and validation of the cequeau model are in the same order of magnitude as the results found by kouadio 2015 on the boubo catchment and kouamé 2017 on the davo catchment in addition to the cequeau model several hydrological models including gr2m gr4j swat have been tested on the watersheds of lobo buyo and bandama in côte d ivoire by anoh et al 2021 coulibaly et al 2016 marie rosine et al 2020 and west africa guug et al 2020 schuol and abbaspour 2006 the quality of the simulations is in line with the work of bourgin 2019 who showed that the nse in calibration and validation depends on the intrinsic method of the hydrological model used overall the impact of climate change on flows varies according to the variability of rainfall predicted by each climate model all climate models are not unanimous on in the direction of reservoir inflow at all time horizons 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 this discrepancy between models can be attributed to data scarcity and limited knowledge of the regional climatology kwawuvi et al 2022 op de hipt et al 2018 this was supported by the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 which showed different changes in precipitation up to 2050 field and barros 2014 this difficulty of models to reproduce rainfall especially in forest areas could also be due to the effect of the west african monsoon ibrahim et al 2012 4 3 impact of climate change and lulc change on the flow variation the hydrological response of the lobo river catchment to climate change and lulc was simulated by the cequeau model after calibration and validation according to the results the static lulc scenario 1 observed an increasing trend in surface runoff by 2030 and 2050 despite increased or decreased precipitation under scenario 2 despite a decrease in precipitation an increase in runoff is still observed a non linear trend between precipitation and land use dynamics is observed this non linear trend of increasing runoff could be due to the lulc and the conversion of primary forest degraded forest to crop fallow habitats and bare soil these results correlate closely with kouadio 2015 and gauze et al 2018a b work in côte d ivoire similarly yonaba et al 2021a 2021b work in burkina faso and séguis et al 2004 in niger showed that the loss of primary forest replaced by cultivated areas and bare soil and habitats could be one of the leading causes of the increase in surface runoff in this study the steady increase in temperature also has impact on the annual inflow to the lrc the simulated flow variations follow the rainfall dynamics for the future thus the increase and deficit in rainfall projected by the climate models used in this study according to the different climate scenarios result to both increase and decrease in reservoir inflows by 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 depending on the model when the two scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 of climate change are combined with the change in lulc scenario 3 the results show that despite a decrease or increase in rainfall by 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 there is a consistent increase in inflows to the lr this result correlates closely with the work of mahe et al 2010 sanjay et al 2017 and stanzel et al 2018 this increase in runoff could be related to the decrease in forest areas replaced by crops and bare soil leading to an increase in runoff generation in the catchment in fact the forest cover normally acts like a sponge retaining rainfall which it releases slowly thereby attenuated flood events and providing support for flood management by reducing peak flows thus the decrease in forest areas leads to an acceleration of high flows and increases general erosivity in the catchment ashraf et al 2022 chen et al 2015 descroix et al 2018a b yonaba et al 2021a 2021b the increase in erosivity in the catchment may be accompanied by increased sediment transport which increases the rate of siltation of the lr thereby reducing its water storage capacity and lifecycle 5 conclusion this study proved the separate and combined impacts of climate and lulc on the inflows of the lobo reservoir the catchment is under pressure due to anthropogenic activities the hydrological model cequeau has been calibrated 1988 2006 and validated 2007 2015 at a daily scale climate data from the cordex africa project after correction for the 2030 and 2050 horizons with four models rca4 cclm4 8 17 racmo22t and remo and simulation of lulc for the 2030 and 2050 horizons with lcm model were used as inputs in the cequeau model to quantify the individual and combined impact of lulc and climate change on inflows to the reservoir three scenarios were used first varying lulc and keeping climate parameters constant over the baseline period scenario 1 varying climate models and keeping land cover constant over the baseline period scenario 2 and simultaneous variation of land use land cover and climate model outputs scenario 3 under the first scenario when converting primary and degraded forests to habitat and bare soil the increase in reservoir flows is even more pronounced compared to the transition from primary forest to crop and fallow there is an increase of 21 8 between 1986 and 2019 32 4 between 2021 and 2040 horizon 2030 and 39 8 between 2041 and 2060 horizon 2050 during the flood periods august september and october it can be seen that the exposure of the land leads to an increase in runoff of 29 6 32 52 and 38 03 in 2019 2030 and 2050 respectively compared to the reference period however this dynamic is not respected during the low water period there is a deficit before and especially after the high water under the second scenario the increase or decrease in precipitation predicted by the climate models rca4 racmo22t cclm4 8 17 and remo according to the different climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 leads to an increase and a decrease of inflows into the lr at the horizons 2030 and 2050 however the median average of all climate models shows that water inflow to the reservoir is observed despite a decrease or increase in precipitation lulc is therefore the main dominating factor the prediction of inflows to the lrr shows that the combined climate change and land use scenario scenario three increase inflows to the reservoir regardless of the climate model used rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the simulated flows under the combined climate and lulc change scenario follow the same dynamics as scenario 1 the non linear complexity of climate and lulc change encourages consideration of the combined effects of climate and lulc change on the hydrological response of catchments rather than simply summarising individual outcomes unlike climate change which is now a global issue with more uncertainties local authorities should focus on mitigating the effects of lulc on regional water resources it is important to note that water management in the lrc needs to be taken into account in this study and could be one of the perspectives of the study also it could combine analysis of the impact of future sediment inputs and lulc under climate change scenarios with hydrological models to understand the rate of siltation of the lr funding the authors would like to thank the facilitators

population growth changing lifestyles and climate change and variability li et al 2021 stanzel et al 2018 in addition increasing demand from different water user sectors increased economic activities and land use land cover lulc are equally exerting pressure on freshwater resources daneshi et al 2021 lang et al 2017 urbanization and agricultural expansion also has significant impact on the hydrological cycle notably by increasing evapotranspiration saadi et al 2020 surface runoff reducing the infiltration capacity of the soil and groundwater recharge andréassian 2004 descroix et al 2018a b many studies have shown that climate and lulc change have a significant impact on river flows gbohoui et al 2021 joorabian shooshtari et al 2017 li et al 2007 onyutha et al 2021 xu et al 2020 zheng et al 2016 according to farinosi et al 2019 climate and lulc change are expected to reduce river flows by up to 20 and lead to a considerable change in the seasonality of flows and an increase in interannual variability in the tapajós basin in the brazilian amazon the 35 and 68 decline in precipitation and runoff during the 1961 1966 and 1973 2001 periods in the chao river basin in china have been attributed to climate change and human activities respectively wang et al 2009 studies in the johor river basin in malaysia found that climate and lulc change increased annual flow by 4 4 and 0 06 tan et al 2015 in the usa a work by giri et al 2019 on the neshanic river catchment showed that climate change scenarios alone or combined with land use change predicted 32 36 higher flow compared to the baseline period in west africa several researchers have investigated the influence of climate and lulc change on water resources in various catchments op de hipt et al 2018 osei et al 2019 yonaba et al 2021a 2021b due to rapid population growth developing countries find it challenging to manage the impacts of lulc and climate change on their catchment aneseyee et al 2020 in the pra river catchment in ghana results of work by awotwi et al 2021 on the impact of climate and lulc change revealed that flows in the near to mid 21st century are projected to increase by 4 12 while a reduction was projected at the end of the 21st century under the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 emission scenario under rcp 8 5 however simulations showed an increase in flow throughout the 21st century forest and topography play a major role in the runoff in a catchment while evapotranspiration and surface runoff are the main factors regulating the flow of water in a catchment rcp projections for all land use categories have shown declining trends in precipitation and streamflow op de hipt et al 2018 osei et al 2019 climate change in west africa could also affect water availability in reservoirs and lead to lower agricultural production increased hunger and lower drinking water supplies for populations antwi agyei et al 2021 kling et al 2016 lawin et al 2019 also gauze et al 2018a b point out that intensification of agricultural activities coupled with climate change could lead to a decrease in potential evapotranspiration and an increase in runoff about 2 7 by 2050 in the davo catchment the latest studies carried out on the lobo reservoir catchment lrc by yao et al 2019a b showed that the rainfall deficit due to climate change will lead to a decrease in flows of the order of 83 at the nibéhibé station and 87 at loboville which may lead to the drying up of some hydraulic infrastructures during the dry periods of the year from the results of the various studies above it can be seen that the impact of climate and lulc change on runoff varies from one catchment to another and according to the region indeed the catchments in these studies differ in size morphology topography soil types and spatio temporal variability of climatic variables rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration also anthropogenic activities on catchments are not the same from one region to another hung et al 2020 onyutha et al 2021 in côte d ivoire very few studies have attempted to understand the combined impact of climate and lulc change on water resources in general and on reservoir inflows in particular in the lobo river catchment no studies have been conducted on the impacts of climate change and lulc in the lrc and its reservoir despite the significant socio economic importance of this reservoir according to lambin et al 2003 the lack of a management policy makes it difficult to manage water resources management policies can evolve appropriately through hydrological modelling dosdogru et al 2020 hydrological models cannot only help to predict current and future flow conditions but also minimise costs and investment time mendez and calvo valverde 2016 in this study the cequeau model is used to assess the impact of climate change and lulc change on inflows to the lobo river reservoir to ensure better management of this water resource by the horizon of 2030 and 2050 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lobo reservoir catchment lrc is located in west central côte d ivoire between longitudes 6 12 and 6 56 west and latitudes 6 40 and 7 55 north fig 1 it covers an area of 6923 km² at nibéhibé station and is characterized by a peneplain with an altitude ranging from 192 m to 612 m avenard 1974 this river is one of the tributaries of the sassandra river yao et al 2019a b rising at an altitude of 400 m south of séguéla yao et al 2019a b koffi et al 2020 the lobo reservoir lr was built in 1976 maiga et al 2001 and is the main source of drinking water for the city of daloa the average amount of water drawn from the reservoir is 16 200 m3 day the average depth of the reservoir is 3 5 m with an average width of 74 m a length of 4 3 km and an area of 30 3 ha the volume at the normal elevation plane level 231 033 m is 380 000 m3 the climate of lrc is transitional equatorial with a rainy season from march to october and a dry season from november to february the average annual rainfall is about 1254 6 mm year 1966 2017 and the average annual temperature is about 26 3 c 1966 2017 the average flow of the river at the hydrometric station nibéhibé located downstream of the reservoir is 13 33 m3 s 1988 2015 the city of daloa represents the economic hub of the region anthropogenic activities in the catchment are very diverse however agriculture remains the main activity of the population 2 2 data 2 2 1 hydro meteorological data the hydrometeorological data required for hydrological modelling using cequeau include rainfall minimum and maximum temperature and discharge from various hydrometric stations in the catchment two sources of rainfall data were used these are observed and satellite rainfall data the observed climate data rainfall and temperature used in this study are obtained from five stations daloa p é lézi séguéla vavoua and zuénoula they were provided by sodexam société d exploitation et de développement aéroportuaire aéronautique et météorologique de côte d ivoire over the period 1983 2016 satellite climate data were obtained from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps the chirps rainfall was used to supplement the missing data of p é lézi and séguéla stations from 1992 to 2016 as well as the the limited spatial distribution of the observed stations in the catchment from 1983 to 2016 chirps data is a gridded precipitation time series with a horizontal resolution of 0 05 ogega et al 2021 the datasets have been widely used for studies in west africa basse et al 2021 boluwade 2020 yangouliba et al 2022a and in côte d ivoire obahoundje et al 2022 chirps rainfall was used to fill in the missing data from the p é lézi and séguéla stations from 1992 to 2016 as well as the limited spatial distribution of observed stations in the catchment from 1983 to 2016 for this purpose a comparison of the chirps data with the observation data from the p é lézi and séguéla stations was carried out over the period 1985 1991 thus the chirps data were compared to the station precipitation on a monthly scale using taylor diagram the hydrometric data from the nibéhibé station are obtained from the database of the directorate of hydrology of côte d ivoire and cover the period from 1985 to 2015 all climatic and hydrometric data used in this study are at daily time step 2 2 2 regional climate model in this study four 4 regional climate models rcms rca4 cclm4 8 17 racmo22t and remo derived from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa program were used giorgi et al 2009 the choice of these rcms is based on their ability to reproduce the general characteristics of the african climate particularly in west africa coulibaly et al 2018 kouadio et al 2020 lawin et al 2019 the models simulations were forced with data from the cnrm cm5 mpi esm lr ichec ec and hadgem2 es global circulation climate models gcms under two representative concentration pathway scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 hazeleger et al 2012 voldoire et al 2013 historical data for these rcms is available for the period 1950 2005 and projections cover the period 2006 2100 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios these are composed of daily rainfall and minimum and maximum temperature at each grid point in the lrc 2 2 3 topographical data and soil map other input data required by the ceqeau model include the digital elevation model dem which was obtained from https lta cr usgs gov at a spatial resolution of 30 m the soil map used in the model is at a scale of 1 5000 000 and was obtained from the us food agricultural organization soil database fao 1995 data for cities rivers and roads were obtained from the database of the côte d ivoire mapping centre cct 2 2 4 remote sensing data the land use maps used in this study were obtained from the processing of landsat tm etm oli 8 images of the years 1986 2002 and 2019 the landsat images were downloaded free of charge from http earthexplorer usgs gov the study area is located between scenes 197 55 and 198 55 which the numbers are wrs path row coordinates all images have a spatial resolution of 30 m all images were downloaded with a cloud cover percentage lower than 10 the authors downloaded level 2 c2 images surface reflectance images the acquired images had already undergone pre processing radiometric geometric topographic atmospheric corrections before being available for download on the usgs earth explorer website 2 3 methods 2 3 1 regional climate model bias correction to improve the resolution of climate models at the desired scales from regional to local and the accuracy reduction of model biases several approaches to correcting the biases of daily precipitation and temperature data have been developed the linear scaling ls method is used in this study because it has been used in several studies around the world chen et al 2015 fiseha et al 2014 giri et al 2019 this method is based on the application of a correction factor to the data series simulated by the climate models in order to make them more representative of the observed climate this correction factor is applied multiplicatively for the correction of rainfall series and additively for temperature the observed rainfall at each station in the lrc was compared with the grid point closest to the rcm considering the grid points as a single station on the map nkiaka et al 2017 a correction was made to the precipitation and temperature data for each climate station the performance of the climate models was assessed by comparing observed and simulated data using the taylor diagram after correcting for the biases in the climate model data an interpolation of the climate stations was used to obtain the variation in mean annual precipitation and temperature for each climate model over the lobo river catchment the correction procedures adopted in this study are explained in eqs 1 and 2 1 p r c m c o r i j p r c m i j p o b s p r c m 2 t r c m c o r i j t r c m i j t o b s t r c m where prcm cor and trcm cor are the corrected value of precipitation and temperature p obs and t obs are the observed historical precipitation and temperature at each station i j is the ith day of the jth month p and oi are the average precipitation and temperature for month j which is calculated as the average of all days in month j under the baseline 1986 2005 2 3 2 lulc mapping before simulating the dynamics of land use change in the lrc a supervised classification of landsat images from 1986 2002 and 2019 based on knowledge of the study area and field data was carried out using envi 4 7 software the maximum likelihood algorithm was chosen for the supervised classification this method is commonly used in the literature gupta and sharma 2020 mciver and friedl 2002 five land use classes namely primary forest degraded forest crop and fallow habitat and bare soil and water were identified based on an expert knowledge of the study area the primary forest refers to a dense forest with a closed canopy degraded forest it does not refer to an intact forest but rather to a forest that has experienced little degradation ebodé et al 2022 2 3 3 land change modelling furthermore the use maps were integrated into the land change modeler lcm of the terrset software for the 2030 and 2050 land use modelling lcm has been used for land cover modelling worldwide leta et al 2021 mishra et al 2014 nedjai et al 2016 yonaba et al 2021a 2021b the multilayer perceptron neural network mlp method was used in the lobo river catchment the mpl method was preferred because it can model complex relationships between variables as neural networks can express simultaneous change potentials to various types of field changes thapa and murayama 2012 the methodology adopted by lcm considers that land use changes are the result of endogenous trends of change factors which are assessed in the calibration phase as well as exogenous changes such as long term policies constraints or incentives yangouliba et al 2022b zarandian et al 2023 the potential transitions were carried out using the mlp method each potential transition is modelled individually using the explanatory variables that may have explained it between the five land use classes the accuracy rate evaluates the explanatory potential of the combination of illustrative variables potential transition the lcm tutorial suggests an accuracy rate of 80 or more eastman 2016 however an accuracy rate of 50 is accepted rodríguez eraso et al 2013 the conversion of water to another class was not taken into account because a significant variation has not been observed since 1986 conversion of crops and fallow land to the primary forest was not considered the last time considerable vegetation recovery was observed was in 1986 according to historical satellite images discussions with local people and studies by kouassi et al 2020 on the lobo river catchment land use maps for 1986 and 2002 were used as input for the calibration six explanatory variables were considered as factors that influence the land use change digital elevation model dem slope pedology road network hydrographic network and towns fig 2 the pre processing of the distance from the road and hydrographic network to the variables was done in arcgis once the data was acquired in the desired format it was entered into lcm the cramer s v statistic was used to assess the explanatory power of environmental factors this statistic ranges from 0 weak association to 1 strong association and eastman 2016 suggests thresholds for interpreting cramer s v a value greater than 0 4 indicates high potential while a minimum value of 0 15 indicates the variable is useful in describing changes however a cramer s v value below 0 15 does not necessarily exclude the variable from being included in the model as this may depend on expert judgment or consideration of the study context beygi heidarlou et al 2019 mishra et al 2014 r yonaba et al 2021a 2021b in this study the selected variables all had an overall cramer s v value greater than 0 15 and transition potential maps were generated from the calibrated model additionally the model s accuracy rate and skill measure were evaluated with the latter being given by an equation ranging from 1 low estimator accuracy to 1 high estimator accuracy richards 2013 mas et al 2014b eastman 2015 the land use map of 2019 was simulated based on trends observed over the period 1986 2019 the mlp neural network was then used to produce the 2019 prediction map validation of the 2019 prediction map was carried out through two methods first by comparing simulated 2019 and reference 2019 maps second by using kappa statistics criteria the kappa for location klocation expresses the ability of the model to predict the location of changes the standard kappa index of agreement kstandard quantifies the level of agreement between the simulated and reference maps finally the kappa for no information kno defines the overall accuracy of the simulation when all three kappa are equal to 1 it indicates a perfect simulation pontius 2000 subedi et al 2013 after calibration and validation of the model the prediction of the lulc maps for 2030 and 2050 was carried out with an mlp neural network under a business as usual scenario 2 3 4 cequeau hydrological model setup calibration and validation cequeau is semi distributed hydrological reservoir type model the model uses a production function vertical water flow and a transfer function upstream downstream to simulate the flow over the entire catchment this model was developed at the national institute of scientific research inrs water in quebec morin et al 1995 dibike and coulibaly 2005 the structure of the model is based on the calculation of the water and heat balance for each node of the grid at daily time step the grid consists of physiographic cells of equal size each with its own land use physiographic and meteorological data in this study the catchment area was discretised into 112 grid cells within which these different processes occur the whole mesh is further subdivided into 201 submeshes fig 3 the rainfall runoff conceptual module first simulates the hydrological state of the catchment as a function of total precipitation ptot minimum and maximum air temperature tmin and tmax and topographical data via a production function the hydrological components are simulated on each grid cell and then fed to the thermal module with additional meteorological inputs solar radiation wind speed air vapour pressure and cloud cover the hydrological and thermal components of the model are described in detail in charron et al 2021 the following state variables are used in cequeau water level in the upper reservoir water level in the lower reservoir water level in lakes and marshes snow accumulation in non forested areas and actual evapotranspiration in the lrc the parameters of snow stock formation and melting are not considered because the study area is located in a tropical region west africa the model allows the user to indicate the presence of a dam at any point in the catchment and the relationship between flow and storage goodrich 1931 method was used to estimate the inflow and outflow of the reservoir potential evapotranspiration pet is calculated by cequeau model using the thorntwaite method the calibration method of the cequeau model is done by testing and optimization the period of 1988 2006 was used as a calibration period whereas the period 2007 2015 was used for the validation the calibration period contains wet dry and normal years the adjustment of the model parameters was carried out by analyzing the numerical and graphical criteria the numerical criterion is done by comparing the observed and simulated flows using the nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r² percentage bias pbias and root mean square error rmse gupta et al 1999 tuo et al 2018 in the literature it is said that a coefficient of determination and a nash

cequeau model was used to estimate the inflow into the reservoir for this purpose three simulation scenarios were carried out the first scenario examines the impact of land use change on water inflows into the lr during this simulation the climatic parameters precipitation and temperature over the reference period 1986 2005 are static but the land use maps of 1986 2002 2019 2030 and 2050 are used the second scenario only considers the effects of climate change on the lr inflow over 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in this simulation the climate conditions of the period 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 are used and the 2002 land use is kept fixed over the reference period 1986 2005 the third scenario analyses the combined impacts of climate change and land use on the lr inflow over 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 all climate parameters temperature and precipitation horizon 2030 2021 2040 horizon 2050 2041 2060 and lulc 1986 2002 2019 2030 and 2050 are not static the implementation of several simulation hypotheses makes it possible to verify which scenario has a real influence on the hydrological functioning of the lobo river catchment 3 results 3 1 satellite data validation the results obtained by comparing the observed data from the stations of séguéla and p é lézi with the satellite data chirps are presented by the taylor diagram fig 4 it can be seen that the correlation values obtained from the comparison are higher than 0 9 with a standard deviation lower than 2 0 and an rmse value lower than 1 the chirps model at the séguéla station has the lowest correlation 0 78 the lowest centred rmse 0 8 and the highest standard deviation 0 64 fig 4a although the chirps data at the pelezi station was found to be the strongest it recorded a correlation of 0 85 a centred rmse of less than 0 98 and a standard deviation of 0 56 fig 4b it can be generally observed that the chirps satellite data can reproduce the daily rainfall data observed at the séguéla and p é lézi stations therefore it can be said that the chirps data are considered reliable for the analysis 3 2 effect of bias correction on rcms performance fig 5 and the taylor diagram fig 6 show the bias correction results for the four rcms and the average of all models before bias correction of the rcms precipitation data the rmses ranged from 0 58 to 1 2 the standard deviations from 0 57 to 0 78 and the correlation coefficients from 0 75 to 0 85 figs 5a and 6a after correcting for the bias in the precipitation data the performance criteria of all models improved significantly rmses between 0 99 and 1 1 standard deviations between 0 19 and 0 25 and correlation coefficients between 0 96 and 0 98 were obtained fig 5b 6b before the bias correction of the temperature data we had rmses between 0 58 and 1 3 standard deviations between 0 2 and 0 7 and correlation coefficients between 0 71 and 0 98 fig 5c 6c after bias correction rmses between 0 99 and 1 25 standard deviations between 0 2 and 0 6 and correlation coefficients between 0 88 and 0 98 were obtained fig 5d 6d after bias correction the performance criteria between the observed data and the rcms are improved therefore the corrected rcms were considered reliable for the analysis 3 3 evolution of future precipitation under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the models show that the catchment will experience both increase and decrease in monthly and annual rainfall fig 7 under rcp 4 5 the rca4 model shows that october and november will experience a 6 9 and 23 8 decrease in precipitation in the catchment by 2021 2040 by 2041 2060 there will be a decrease in precipitation from march to april and december of 19 22 14 5 and 2 74 respectively compared to the reference period the racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 models show a monthly and annual decrease in precipitation over the catchment for both future horizons for the 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time horizons the months of january to june and october to december will experience the largest decreases in rainfall this trend in rainfall observed under rcp 4 5 could continue in the 2021 2040 and 2040 2060 timeframes under rcp 8 5 according to the rca4 model there will be an increase in precipitation for all months of the year except april where there will be a decrease of 12 86 by 2021 2040 under the rcp 8 5 scenario by 2041 2060 october will experience a decrease of 1 3 in contrast to the rca4 model the racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 models will experience a decrease over several months of the year according to the racmo22t model it is the months of january to april august october and december that will be impacted in the 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time frame the cclm4 8 17 model predicts a decline in rainfall for all months except december by 2021 2040 by 2041 2060 the periods from march to july and october to december will be impacted by a decrease in precipitation the remo model projects an increase of 18 and 37 8 by 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively under the rcp 4 5 under the rcp 8 5 rainfall is expected to increase by 31 and 45 by 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively the results show an annual increase in rainfall regardless of the rca4 and remo model scenario this is not the case for the racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 models the relative deviations of all models show that under the rcp 4 5 scenario there is a relative decrease in precipitation of 3 26 and an absolute decrease of 0 032 mm compared to the baseline period under the rcp 8 5 scenario we have a relative decrease of 1 21 and an absolute decrease of 0 012 mm 3 4 evolution of future temperature the monthly mean temperature variations simulated by the rcms rca4 racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 for the 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time horizons with respect to the 1986 2005 reference period are presented by fig 8 the results show that temperatures in the lrc will increase in the future according to majority of climate models based on the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios under the rcp 4 5 scenario for the 2021 2040 time horizon the rca4 and racmo22t climate models predict an increase in mean temperature by 0 16 c and 2 97 c for all months except february which will experience a decrease of 0 17 c and 0 71 c by 2041 2060 both models project an increase of 0 48 3 38 c the monthly temperature forecasts projected by the cclm4 8 17 model are different from those of the rca4 and racmo22t models indeed during the period 2021 2040 the cclm4 8 17 model predicts a temperature decrease of 1 75 c and 0 04 c in dry season and wet season respectively the months of march may and july to september will experience a temperature increase of 1 02 c by 2021 2040 by 2041 2060 monthly temperatures are expected to rise throughout the year under rcp 8 5 scenario not all models are unanimous about an increase or decrease in mean temperature the mean temperature could increase in all months of the year by 0 34 3 69 c by 2041 2060 according to the racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 models a decrease in mean temperature during the beginning of the rainy season by 0 23 2 26 c and at the end of the dry season by 2 24 c is expected the remo model predicts a rise in temperature in all months of the year for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the results show that the temperature amplitude is higher for the rcp 8 5 scenario than for the rcp 4 5 scenario the relative deviations of all models show that under the rcp 4 5 scenario there is a relative temperature increase of 5 2 and an absolute decrease of 0 063 c compared to the baseline period under the rcp 8 5 scenario we have a relative increase of 6 4 and an absolute decrease of 0 060 c 3 5 simulation of land use changes 3 5 1 land use changes analysis between 1986 and 2019 to better appreciate land use dynamics maps depicting changes in land use pattern were created for all land use categories for the periods 1986 2002 2002 2019 1986 2019 fig 9 five main land cover classes emerge from the tm etm and oli image classifications the primary forest class the degraded forest class the crops and fallow class the habitat and bare soil class and the water class visual observation of these maps indicates an overall regression in the area of the primary forest class while the crops and fallow land habitat and bare soil and degraded forest classes have increased in size between 1986 and 2019 the crop and fallow class increased from 8 553 85 km2 to 43 2976 89 km2 the increase of crop and fallow land differs between the periods as follows 19 between 1986 and 2002 and 16 between 2002 and 2019 table 1 the increase is also observed in the habitat and bare soil class indeed between 1986 and 2002 the habitat and bare soil class increased from 11 761 54 km² to 15 1038 45 km² between 2002 and 2019 there was an increase from 15 1038 45 km2 to 17 1142 29 km² table 1 this significant increase in cultivation and bare soil and habitats has led to a significant decrease in forest area in the lrc the primary forest area was 64 4430 7 km2 in 1986 32 2215 4 km2 in 2002 and 10 692 3 km2 in 2019 thus primary forest areas decreased by 32 between 1986 and 2002 22 between 2002 and 2019 and 54 between 1986 and 2019 moreover due to the increase in crop and fallow land the degraded forest class increased from 14 969 22 km2 in 1986 24 1661 52 km2 and 29 2007 67 km2 in 2002 and 2019 respectively 3 5 2 change analysis a change analysis was performed between 1986 and 2002 2002 2019 and 1986 2019 losses gains and net changes for all land use and cover classes lulc are presented in fig 10 during 1986 2002 primary forest lost 2634 km² and gained 875 km² a net loss of 1759 km² the degraded forest class lost 1080 km² and gained 1670 km² a gain of 590 km² the crop and fallow class lost 203 km² and gained 1097 km² i e an increase of 894 km² the habitat and bare soil class lost 187 km² and gained 500 km² a gain of 313 km² the water class lost 105 km² and gained 66 km² a loss of 39 km² fig 10a during 2002 and 2019 the primary forest class lost 2757 km² and gained 306 km² a net loss of 2451 km² fig 10 b the degraded forest class lost 1541 km² and gained 870 km² a loss of 671 km² the crop and fallow class lost 486 km² and gained 3038 km² and 2552 km² built up areas lost 437 km² and gained 1068 km² with a gain of 631 km² the water class lost 67 km² and gained 8 km² a loss of 59 km² fig 10b during the last period 1986 2019 primary forest lost 4580 km² and gained 368 km² a loss of 4212 km² the degraded forest class lost 1006 km² and gained 926 km² i e a loss of 80 km² fig 10 c the crop and fallow land class failed 123 km² and gained 3569 km² 3446 km² the habitat and bare soil class lost 120 km² and gained 1064 km² a gain of 944 km² finally the water class has been very little impacted with minimal variation it lost 105 km² and gained 7 km² a loss of 98 km² fig 10c 3 5 3 analysis of the relationship between the explanatory variables the different explanatory variables and their levels of association with the observed transitions are measured through cramer s v coefficient table 2 almost all variables have a cramer s v value 0 14 with all classes except distance to roads the overall cramer s v statistics for lulc classes such as degraded forest crops and fallow and habitat and soil had the highest values overall v 0 1838 0 4315 similarly distance to locations and dem influence lulc changes with cramer s global v ranging from 0 2307 to 0 3104 distance to roads soil type and slope moderately influence explaining changes in lulc but are still very useful overall v 0 1367 0 1781 all explanatory variables were accepted for modelling the different transitions the accuracy rates of the different potential transitions obtained from the mlp method are below 80 table 3 the lowest accuracy rate is observed for the degraded forest to crop and fallow transition 54 6 the highest accuracy rate is observed in the primary forest to degraded forest transition 70 36 all accuracy rates are above 50 and therefore acceptable 3 5 4 lcm model validation the areas of the different land use classes are presented in table 4 visual interpretation and modelling results show that the simulated map for the year 2019 is reasonably similar to the actual map for that year as shown in fig 11 a large part of the forest has been converted to crop and fallow land the model tends to overestimate the primary forest habitat and bare soil and crop and fallow classes however the model underestimated the degraded forest class it should be noted that water resources remain relatively stable over time the kappa statistics k between the observed and simulated map show strong similarity between the actual and projected land use in the lrc indeed the results show that all statistics kstandard 84 33 knon 86 02 and klocation 86 89 are above 80 table 4 3 5 5 predicted maps based on the assumption of an intensification of anthropogenic activities in the study site over time future land use maps of 2030 and 2050 were produced fig 12 the period 2019 2050 is marked by a downward trend in forest and degraded forest landscapes this decline will be in favour of crops and fallow land and the habitat and bare soil classes the calculated rate of change between 2019 and the simulated maps for 2030 and 2050 shows that crop and fallow remain the most important land use class in 2030 and 2050 table 5 the habitat and bare soil class 17 in 2019 20 in 2030 and 22 in 2050 and crops and fallow land 43 in 2019 67 7 in 2030 and 68 74 in 2050 are the classes that will experience the greatest rate of change however forest areas will experience the highest rate of decline respectively 10 in 2019 6 32 by 2030 and 4 01 by 2050 3 6 calibration and validation of the hydrological model the calibration and validation of the cequeau hydrological model are presented by fig 13 the model shows satisfactory performance during calibration and validation periods with rmse values of 0 83 m3 s nse of 0 7 pbias of 14 1 and a coefficient of determination r² of 0 83 an improvement in the nash criterion is then observed during the validation phase compared to the calibration period we have an nse of 0 75 an rmse of 2 15 m3 s a percentage bias of 12 and a coefficient of determination r² of 0 65 these numerical results are confirmed by a fairly good similarity between the observed and model simulated hydrographs fig 10 nevertheless during the calibration and validation of the model underestimation and an overestimation of the flows for certain years are observed despite the slight discrepancy between the observed and simulated hydrographs the seasonal variations were well reproduced by the model 3 7 impact of lulc on inflow the variation in simulated monthly and annual flows for lulc from 2002 2019 2030 and 2050 under the assumption of static climate parameters over the reference period 1986 2005 are presented fig 14 under this scenario the observed changes in water inflow to the reservoir are attributable to lulc dynamics which are mainly due to the conversion of primary forest degraded forest to cropland and fallow and habitat and bare soil indeed the loss of primary forest replaced by crops and fallow leads to an increase in surface runoff of about 15 2 between 1986 and 2019 24 2 between 2021 and 2040 horizon 2030 and 29 8 between 2041 and 2060 horizon 2050 when converting primary and degraded forests to habitat and bare soil the increase in reservoir flows is even more pronounced than the transition from primary forest to crop and fallow there is an increase of 21 8 between 1986 and 2019 32 4 between 2021 and 2040 horizon 2030 and 39 8 between 2041 and 2060 horizon 2050 this increase in runoff is more noticeable during high water periods however this dynamic is not respected during low water periods there is a deficit before and especially after high water annually the degradation of lulc could lead to an increase in runoff in the lobo reservoir of about 10 8 and 18 87 in 2030 and 2050 respectively 3 8 impact of climate change on inflow the results show a fairly good correspondence between the simulated hydrological regimes over the 2021 2040 2030 and 2041 2060 2050 horizons and those of the baseline fig 15 in terms of dynamics there is no change in the hydrological regime the periods of low flows and peak flows remain identical to those observed over the baseline however the changes are mainly in the volumes of water all climate models rca4 racmo22t cclm4 8 17 and remo are not unanimous on the change in annual inflows to the lr the rca4 and remo models evolve in the same order of magnitude an increase in annual runoff of 17 2 29 5 and 23 6 35 8 is predicted for the 2021 2040 horizon according under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 by 2041 2060 this increase in runoff could continue and reach 23 1 51 3 under rcp 4 5 and 12 3 44 under rcp 8 5 the racmo22t model predict a decrease in annual flows of about 13 3 under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 14 7 for the rcp 8 5 scenario by 2021 2040 however the 2041 2060 horizon is marked by an increase in inflow of about 3 74 according to the rcp 4 5 scenario this increase could be higher under the rcp 8 5 scenario with flows increasing by 7 8 as for the cclm4 8 17 model it predicts a decrease in inflows regardless of the climate scenario used rcp 4 5 and 8 5 an annual decrease of 24 7 and 21 2 in flows by 2021 2040 under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios is expected this decline observed by 2021 2040 could amplify to 29 7 by 2041 2060 under the rcp 4 5 and 13 6 under the rcp 8 3 9 impact of climate and lulc change on water inflow to highlight future changes in inflows to the lr monthly flows were simulated using the cequeau model fig 16 shows the hydrographs of inflows at the 2030 and 2050 horizons compared to the baseline when the combined scenarios of climate change and lulc are considered the results evolve in the same dynamic as the results of scenario 1 the results show a general increase in inflow in the lobo river catchment regardless of the climate model used this increase varies from one climate model to another rca4 racmo22t cclm4 8 17 and remo thus the combined effect of lulc 2030 and 2050 and the climate parameters of the rca4 and remo models could lead to an annual increase in inflow to the reservoir of about 21 3 23 6 and 25 6 29 3 by 2030 according under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively by 2050 this increase could reach 24 31 4 and 31 5 36 2 under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively the racmo22t model also projects a significant increase in inflows during all months of the year with annual increasing flows of 4 8 and 11 94 by 2030 and 7 3 and 14 2 by 2050 however by 2050 a monthly decrease from may to august compared to the baseline period is observed the regional model cclm4 8 17 predicts an increase in the reservoir over the different time horizons under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios inflow will increase by 6 32 and 12 8 respectively by 2030 compared to the baseline by 2050 the increase in annual runoff observed by 2030 under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios will continue this increase could reach between 9 5 and 11 2 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the projection of inflow to the lr shows that the combined scenario of climate change and lulc leads to an increase of reservoir inflow to assess which parameter has a real influence on the water inflow to the lobo river reservoir the isolated effects of climate change and land use on the surface runoff in 2030 and 2050 were evaluated in relation to the reference period 1986 2005 under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios with the annual average of all climate models table 6 the results show that despite a decrease in precipitation by 2030 14 6 by 2050 15 2 under scenario 2 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 and by 6 1 under rcp 4 5 scenario 3 we observe an increase in runoff of 10 8 18 87 scenario 1 1 2 4 46 rcp4 5 3 35 and 2 7 rcp8 5 under scenario 2 and 6 58 11 83 rcp 4 5 14 83 17 72 rcp 8 5 under scenario 3 the influence of climate on surface runoff is less dominant a decrease in precipitation does not necessarily lead to a decrease in inflows to the lobo reservoir changes in lulc conditions and anthropogenic activities were identified as the main causes rather than climate variability 4 discussion 4 1 climate projection in the regional context climate projections from the regional climate models rca4 racmo22t and cclm4 8 17 and remo project higher temperatures for the rcp 8 5 scenarios compared to the rcp 4 5 scenarios over the lrc this result is consistent with the work of ayele et al 2016 and soro et al 2017 other studies have also reported an increase in temperature followed by a decrease in rainfall over west africa diallo et al 2016 sarr and camara 2017 in côte d ivoire several studies are unanimous on the increase in temperature followed by a significant decrease in rainfall over different catchments in the country kouakou et al 2014 soro et al 2017 coulibaly et al 2018 yao et al 2019a b the decrease in mean rainfall in the region could probably be induced in part by a decrease in water vapour in the atmosphere diallo et al 2016 these results confirm the analysis by sylla et al 2018 and the ipcc 2019 on rainfall in west africa indeed west africa is expected to be strongly affected by rising temperatures this increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall observed in the lrc could make the catchment more vulnerable to climate change yao et al 2019a b changes in soil conditions can reduce or exacerbate warming at the regional scale they can affect the intensity frequency and duration of extreme weather events including heat waves droughts and precipitation 4 2 calibration validation of the cequeau model some studies have been carried out in côte d ivoire using the cequeau model the results of our study during the calibration and validation of the cequeau model are in the same order of magnitude as the results found by kouadio et al 2015 on the agnéby and boubo catchment and gauze et al 2018a b on the davo catchment the cequeau model produces satisfactory results during the calibration and validation phases the performance of the nse was better during the validation phase compared to the calibration period similar results have been obtained in other studies joorabian shooshtari et al 2017 osei et al 2021 some studies have been carried out in côte d ivoire using the cequeau model the results of our study during the calibration and validation of the cequeau model are in the same order of magnitude as the results found by kouadio 2015 on the boubo catchment and kouamé 2017 on the davo catchment in addition to the cequeau model several hydrological models including gr2m gr4j swat have been tested on the watersheds of lobo buyo and bandama in côte d ivoire by anoh et al 2021 coulibaly et al 2016 marie rosine et al 2020 and west africa guug et al 2020 schuol and abbaspour 2006 the quality of the simulations is in line with the work of bourgin 2019 who showed that the nse in calibration and validation depends on the intrinsic method of the hydrological model used overall the impact of climate change on flows varies according to the variability of rainfall predicted by each climate model all climate models are not unanimous on in the direction of reservoir inflow at all time horizons 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 this discrepancy between models can be attributed to data scarcity and limited knowledge of the regional climatology kwawuvi et al 2022 op de hipt et al 2018 this was supported by the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 which showed different changes in precipitation up to 2050 field and barros 2014 this difficulty of models to reproduce rainfall especially in forest areas could also be due to the effect of the west african monsoon ibrahim et al 2012 4 3 impact of climate change and lulc change on the flow variation the hydrological response of the lobo river catchment to climate change and lulc was simulated by the cequeau model after calibration and validation according to the results the static lulc scenario 1 observed an increasing trend in surface runoff by 2030 and 2050 despite increased or decreased precipitation under scenario 2 despite a decrease in precipitation an increase in runoff is still observed a non linear trend between precipitation and land use dynamics is observed this non linear trend of increasing runoff could be due to the lulc and the conversion of primary forest degraded forest to crop fallow habitats and bare soil these results correlate closely with kouadio 2015 and gauze et al 2018a b work in côte d ivoire similarly yonaba et al 2021a 2021b work in burkina faso and séguis et al 2004 in niger showed that the loss of primary forest replaced by cultivated areas and bare soil and habitats could be one of the leading causes of the increase in surface runoff in this study the steady increase in temperature also has impact on the annual inflow to the lrc the simulated flow variations follow the rainfall dynamics for the future thus the increase and deficit in rainfall projected by the climate models used in this study according to the different climate scenarios result to both increase and decrease in reservoir inflows by 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 depending on the model when the two scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 of climate change are combined with the change in lulc scenario 3 the results show that despite a decrease or increase in rainfall by 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 there is a consistent increase in inflows to the lr this result correlates closely with the work of mahe et al 2010 sanjay et al 2017 and stanzel et al 2018 this increase in runoff could be related to the decrease in forest areas replaced by crops and bare soil leading to an increase in runoff generation in the catchment in fact the forest cover normally acts like a sponge retaining rainfall which it releases slowly thereby attenuated flood events and providing support for flood management by reducing peak flows thus the decrease in forest areas leads to an acceleration of high flows and increases general erosivity in the catchment ashraf et al 2022 chen et al 2015 descroix et al 2018a b yonaba et al 2021a 2021b the increase in erosivity in the catchment may be accompanied by increased sediment transport which increases the rate of siltation of the lr thereby reducing its water storage capacity and lifecycle 5 conclusion this study proved the separate and combined impacts of climate and lulc on the inflows of the lobo reservoir the catchment is under pressure due to anthropogenic activities the hydrological model cequeau has been calibrated 1988 2006 and validated 2007 2015 at a daily scale climate data from the cordex africa project after correction for the 2030 and 2050 horizons with four models rca4 cclm4 8 17 racmo22t and remo and simulation of lulc for the 2030 and 2050 horizons with lcm model were used as inputs in the cequeau model to quantify the individual and combined impact of lulc and climate change on inflows to the reservoir three scenarios were used first varying lulc and keeping climate parameters constant over the baseline period scenario 1 varying climate models and keeping land cover constant over the baseline period scenario 2 and simultaneous variation of land use land cover and climate model outputs scenario 3 under the first scenario when converting primary and degraded forests to habitat and bare soil the increase in reservoir flows is even more pronounced compared to the transition from primary forest to crop and fallow there is an increase of 21 8 between 1986 and 2019 32 4 between 2021 and 2040 horizon 2030 and 39 8 between 2041 and 2060 horizon 2050 during the flood periods august september and october it can be seen that the exposure of the land leads to an increase in runoff of 29 6 32 52 and 38 03 in 2019 2030 and 2050 respectively compared to the reference period however this dynamic is not respected during the low water period there is a deficit before and especially after the high water under the second scenario the increase or decrease in precipitation predicted by the climate models rca4 racmo22t cclm4 8 17 and remo according to the different climate scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 leads to an increase and a decrease of inflows into the lr at the horizons 2030 and 2050 however the median average of all climate models shows that water inflow to the reservoir is observed despite a decrease or increase in precipitation lulc is therefore the main dominating factor the prediction of inflows to the lrr shows that the combined climate change and land use scenario scenario three increase inflows to the reservoir regardless of the climate model used rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the simulated flows under the combined climate and lulc change scenario follow the same dynamics as scenario 1 the non linear complexity of climate and lulc change encourages consideration of the combined effects of climate and lulc change on the hydrological response of catchments rather than simply summarising individual outcomes unlike climate change which is now a global issue with more uncertainties local authorities should focus on mitigating the effects of lulc on regional water resources it is important to note that water management in the lrc needs to be taken into account in this study and could be one of the perspectives of the study also it could combine analysis of the impact of future sediment inputs and lulc under climate change scenarios with hydrological models to understand the rate of siltation of the lr funding the authors would like to thank the facilitators

socio hydrological systems e g yager et al 2021 or cultural landscapes e g white nockleby et al 2021 indeed bofedales have long provided grazing grounds for andean camelids e g palacios rios 1977

et al 2019 uribe álvarez et al 2022 bofedales have also been linked to the presence and expansion of human settlements e g vining et al 2019 two properties of bofedales contribute to their inferred role as a natural water storage infrastructure first bofedales contain layers of high porosity peat up to 10 m thick hribljan et al 2015 engel et al 2014 cooper et al 2019 with the capacity to store large quantities of water e g cooper 2019 valois et al 2020 valois et al 2021 secondly as post glacial features bofedales are often found in low gradient areas fed by large contributions of upslope groundwater e g gordon et al 2015 cooper et al 2019 although they are peat forming bofedales are minerotrophic fens meaning water and nutrients primarily come from groundwater fens differ from ombrotrophic bogs which receive water and nutrients from precipitation only squeo 2006 cooper et al 2010 2019 maldonado fónken 2014 salvador et al 2014 hribljan et al 2015 oyague et al 2022 the hydrologic role of peat forming wetlands has been studied to the north and south of perú in the humid páramo of ecuador annual water yield and catchment wide water storage increase with the extent of peat forming wetlands mosquera et al 2015 lazo et al 2019 in the arid andes of north central chile geophysical and hydrochemical methods revealed bofedales to have large total water storage due to their large average porosity valois et al 2020 valois et al 2021 whereas these studies identify links between wetlands water storage and flow regulation no study has yet quantified the annual amount of water bofedales seasonally store and release to streams our study focused on the upper ramuschaka watershed urw a headwater catchment within the 11 048 km2 vilcanota urubamba basin vub drenkhan et al 2018 the humid puna covers 78 2 of the vub oshun et al 2021 josse et al 2009 and the hydrograph is driven by groundwater draining the humid puna drenkhan et al 2015 buytaert et al 2017 egemsa oshun et al 2021 fernandez palomino et al 2021 cusco the largest city in the vub with a population of approximately 420 000 inei 2015 derives approximately 90 of its water from the humid puna sedacusco 2019 the urw which is a non glacierized watershed characteristic of the humid puna is the primary local water source for the agrarian district of zurite population of 3640 municipalidad distrital de zurite 2017 zurite is vulnerable to water shortages due to a dependence on limited local water resources a pronounced dry season and a lack of long term water storage the dry season may october water demand for the 852 irrigated hectares in zurite is 1150 mm municipalidad distrital de zurite 2017 the urw represents an example watershed in the humid puna that may provide insights into to hydrologic processes across the region specifically we addressed the following questions 1 what are the annual and seasonal water yields from the urw a humid puna catchment in the central andes 2 what are the temporal patterns linking subsurface hydrology and streamflow in the urw 3 is there a relationship between bofedal area and unit runoff hereafter referred to as runoff in the urw 4 what is the quantity of seasonally dynamic water storage in bofedales and what proportion of total dry season runoff is released from bofedales here we define seasonally dynamic storage relative as the volume of water stored in bofedales relative to the end of the dry season e g sayama et al 2011 we collected hydrogeologic data over three water years through the collaborative effort of students scientists and community members oshun et al 2021 our results provide hydrologic data from a societally important yet understudied region and show water released in bofedales is partly responsible for sustained dry season streamflow 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description of the upper ramuschaka watershed urw the 2 12 km2 urw spans elevations of 4011 4543 m a s l and sustains three perennial streams draining three primary subbasins the western 0 373 km2 central 0 873 km2 and eastern 0 797 km2 fig 1 these subbasins form a confluence 150 m upstream of the terminus of the urw at a concrete diversion weir used by the community of zurite to divert surface water for irrigation mean annual precipitation 1981 2017 in zurite 3405 m a s l is 848 mm 95 of which falls between october and april aybar et al 2020 the underlying bedrock of the urw is primarily the eocene age san jeronimo formation fig s1 the central and eastern subbasins are underlain by cliff forming reddish gray sandstone that is finely bedded to massive locally known as capa roja e g carlotto et al 2010 garcía fernández baca 2017 the sandstone is interbedded with broad sections of tan to reddish gray to greenish gray finely bedded and extensively fractured weak mudstone known as lutita e g garcía fernández baca 2017 a sugary white crystalline quartzite forms a steep bedrock exposed ridge that divides two upper tributaries of the central subbasin the western subbasin is underlain by the san jeronimo formation however there is also extensively weathered limestone karst in the northwest and an oligocene quartz monzodiorite intrusive underlying the southwest portions of the subbasin respectively the topography and vegetation are characteristic of the humid puna the urw headwaters are defined by cliff forming headwalls of quartzite or sandstone and more gently sloping lutita below are low gradient valleys with seasonally saturated bofedales poorly distinguished moraines at the margins and hummocky landforms fig 2 the topography of the landscape combined with its southern aspect suggest recent glaciation perhaps during the holocene steep uplands are predominantly covered in the perennial tussock grass jarava ichu which we observed to be rooted to a depth of approximately 1 2 m hydrophytic plants such as distichia muscoides oxychloe andina and plantago tabulosa are found in the seasonally saturated bofedales there is no sphagnum moss which is consistent with the distichia peatlands presented in maldanado fónken 2014 to stabilize hillslopes following landslides the community of zurite planted polylepis sp in a grid pattern over an area of 0 568 km2 in the lower urw fig 1 despite the afforestation campaign most polylepis shrubs remained small 1 m in height with sparse branching because of low growth rates through seasonal drought and a grassland fire in late july 2019 soils beneath j ichu are dark and organic rich 20 25 silt loams to approximately 0 25 m underlain by dark silty clay loam to sandy loam with organic content decreasing to 7 or less sand and rock chips increase in concentration with depth with transition to a fractured and weathered saprolite at depths of 0 4 0 75 m in comparison to the andosols of the humid páramo e g buytaert et al 2005 mosquera et al 2020a b upland soils in the urw are derived from primarily sedimentary parent material exhibit a thinner organic rich layer generally less clay sized particles 40 in the soil and 5 29 in the saprolite a well developed b horizon and the absence of a low conductivity layer and seasonally perched water table 2 2 geospatial characterization 2 2 1 land cover classification we used the support vector machine algorithm l3harris geospatial 2019 on a 1 meter resolution image of the urw esri world imagery to classify four land cover classes in the urw bofedal upland outcrop and shrubland we quality controlled the resulting land cover classification vectors via ground truthing during field campaigns and with orthoimagery 8 3 cm pixel produced from unmanned aerial vehicle uav surveys 2 2 2 topographic data collection and processing in june 2019 we flew a dji phantom 4 pro uav to create a digital elevation model dem of the urw we programmed flights to take photos with 80 coverage overlap at 200 feet above the ground surface and used a real time kinematic rtk gps eos arrowgold to survey 26 ground control points mean horizontal error of 0 097 m and mean vertical error of 0 113 m supplementary material s2 we post processed imagery in agisoft metashape professional to create a 1 m cell resolution dem following protocols from the united states geological survey 2017 and dietrich 2015 the mean slope of the urw for 1 m pixels is 24 0 table 1 however the mean slope of bofedales which cover 0 244 km2 11 6 of the urw is 14 1 2 3 hydrologic monitoring 2 3 1 annual water balance we constructed annual water balances by measuring precipitation p and runoff q calculating actual evapotranspiration eta and estimating interannual water storage s water balances are referenced to the site 3 gauging station in the central subbasin 0 806 km2 fig 1 due to the incomplete data set for water year wy 2019 which lacked a complete record of upland soil and saprolite and groundwater measurements used to estimate eta we focused our water balance analyses on wy2020 and wy2021 2 3 2 precipitation precipitation was measured at a resolution of 0 2 mm using a tipping bucket rain gauge hobo onset rg3 installed in june 2018 near site 3 at a height of approximately 1 5 m above the ground the start of the annual water year september 1 corresponds with the end of the regionally dry austral winter and marks a gradual transition into the wet season we define the dry season as the period over which 15 day cumulative precipitation remained less than 10 mm and the wet season as the period over which 15 day cumulative precipitation exceeded 10 mm although spatial variability in precipitation can be high in andean catchments e g buytaert et al 2006a célleri et al 2007 the rugged topography and limited access prevented us from installing a spatially distributed rainfall network the rain gauge was installed near the geographic center of the urw at 4171 m a s l the resolution of the national gridded precipitation dataset aybar et al 2020 is insufficient to show variability within the urw for our water balance estimates we corrected for orographic effects via an elevation precipitation model using rain gauges in the urw and zurite 3411 m a s l we calculated the difference in 15 day cumulative precipitation between the two gauges and extrapolated via a second degree polynomial to predict annual precipitation at the mean elevation of the site 3 subbasin 4369 m a s l s3 1 2 3 3 bofedal groundwater in june 2019 we drilled to 11 m in bofedal i fig 1 using a 2 75 diameter gas powered rotary drill and installed monitoring well 102 the upper 0 6 m were peat which was underlain by clay to a depth of 2 5 m we encountered a layer of weathered bedrock clasts silt and clay material interpreted to be glacio fluvial deposits at 2 5 m which extended down through the base of the well we cased well 102 with 65 mm diameter pvc pipe with 1 mm slits over the entire length capped at the base and installed a pressure transducer hobo u20 001 at a depth of 6 93 m to measure water table dynamics fully slotted wells have been effective in similar landscapes to monitor bofedal groundwater dynamics hribljan et al 2015 cooper et al 2019 oyague et al 2022 monge salazar et al 2022 and lahuatte et al 2022 2 3 4 streamflow in june 2018 we installed stream gauges in the central subbasin site 3 drainage area 0 806 km2 and above the diversion canal site 1 drainage area 2 11 km2 at each location we connected a slotted pvc staff gauge with demarcations to 1 50th of a foot to rebar stakes driven into the channel bed and installed a pressure transducer hobo u20l 001 inside the pvc an identical transducer was installed adjacent to the stream to measure atmospheric pressure data were post processed to account for sensor drift or slight changes in the position of the sensor after downloading data and reinstalling the gauge s3 2 due to high flow variability narrow 1 m shallow 0 5 m and steep 5 channels with complex streambed morphology we measured stream discharge using the dry injection salt dilution technique hudson and fraser 2005 which is more accurate than the area velocity method in andean streams parra et al 2016 for each discharge measurement we placed a conductivity probe onset u24 001 in the stream and injected a known mass of salt at least 20 channel widths upstream typically 15 m upstream measurements took 15 20 min we applied the conductivity assistant non linear correction in hoboware pro onset to convert breakthrough curves to specific conductance and then scaled by the recommended correction factor of 0 486 hudson and fraser 2005 additional details can be found in s3 2 at site 3 we developed two rating curves one before and one after a high flow event in march 2019 at site 1 we present one rating curve from april 2019 onward due to substantial changes in the channel geometry in march 2019 all three rating curves are well constrained r2 0 95 figs s5 s6 we scaled discharge by watershed area using the uav derived 1 m resolution dem and present hydrographs of runoff mm day for wys 2019 2021 runoff at site 3 was used in water balances for wys 2020 and 2021 as it has the longest continuous record and the most well constrained rating curve error in runoff was quantified as the mean residual error from all discharge measurements used to develop each rating curve 2 3 5 subsurface moisture monitoring and estimates of grassland evapotranspiration in january 2019 we installed four teros 12 volumetric water content vwc sensors and two teros 21 water potential sensors meter group inc 2018 at an elevation of 4195 m a s l beneath a 36 slope covered in j ichu fig 1 an organic rich loam extended to a depth of 0 4 m below was a dark brown clayey soil with clasts of sandstone that increased with depth a transition to sandstone saprolite occurred at 0 75 m and clay content decreased with increasing depth roots were found throughout the profile but in decreasing abundance with depth bulk density increased from 0 60 g cm3 at 0 11 m to 0 93 g cm3 at 0 52 m the profile was representative of upland soils table s4 probes were inserted horizontally in the upslope face undisturbed soil and saprolite we installed vwc sensors at depths of 0 2 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m and collocated water potential sensors at depths of 0 2 and 0 9 m we converted 15 minute vwc measurements to daily averages and multiplied over thicknesses determined by material properties to quantify dynamics in moisture storage mm in the soil 0 0 75 m and in the saprolite 0 75 1 35 cm table s5 to estimate eta from j ichu we applied a conditional model depending on whether subsurface conditions were above or below field capacity we used in situ measurements of water potential and vwc at 0 2 m soil and 0 9 m saprolite to construct wetting and drying water release curves wrc fig s8 we estimated field capacity using a water potential of 33 kpa the vwc of field capacity at 0 6 and 1 2 m where no water potential sensors were installed was estimated using water potential data at 0 2 m soil and at 0 9 m saprolite respectively the vwc s at field capacity in the soil 0 432 0 357 cm3 cm3 table s6 are smaller than those reported in the organic rich andosols of the humid páramo e g buytaert et al 2005 mosquera et al 2020 which may be due to the lower organic matter content at our study site when subsurface moisture at 0 2 m depth exceeded field capacity 0 432 we calculated a daily reference evapotranspiration eto via a temperature based model visualizing ecosystem land management assessment 2 0 abdelnour et al 2011 hamon 1963 we then converted eto to actual evapotranspiration eta by scaling by a crop coefficient of 0 74 which was recently derived for the less humid period in humid páramo grasslands carrillo rojas et al 2019 when water potential in the soil fell below field capacity we integrated moisture losses in mm over the rooting zone using the vwc sensors there were 202 and 159 days in which field capacity was exceeded in wy 2020 and 2021 respectively we extrapolated the eta estimates to land classified as upland which covers 83 of subbasin 3 error estimates of the teros 12 sensors is reported to be 3 00 for an uncalibrated mineral soil system such as the urw upland meter group inc 2019 however to account for error in our field capacity estimates the temperature based method for deriving eto and our crop coefficient we applied the maximum error 30 reported from estimates in the humid páramo córdova et al 2015 2 3 6 estimates of bofedal evapotranspiration to estimate daily eta fluxes from bofedales covering 16 of the site 3 subbasin we calculated daily eto using velma as above and converted eto to eta by applying a crop coefficient of 0 85 derived from a study of peat bogs gerling et al 2019 we applied the same maximum error from above 30 to our estimates of bofedal eta 2 4 spatiotemporal measurements of discharge we measured discharge via salt dilution hudson and fraser 2005 at 19 nested locations on 14 dates between june 2019 and september 2021 within the central n 10 eastern n 8 and western n 1 subbasins fig 1 the monitoring strategy was designed to measure the spatial and temporal variability of runoff and to compare runoff to the extent of bofedales across the urw s subbasins we hypothesized that subbasins with greater percent bofedal cover would yield higher runoff especially in the dry season our measurements focused on the central and eastern subbasins because the underlying lithologies are consistent fig s1 the drainage areas of the subbasins range from 0 096 to 2 112 km2 with bofedales covering 7 71 29 42 table s1 channel morphology ranged from relatively gentle sloped reaches flowing through bofedal and wet grassland settings to steep bedrock confined channels predominantly found in the lower portion of the watershed in most locations the channel was incised into either bedrock proglacial features or bofedales 2 5 seasonal moisture dynamics in bofedales 2 5 1 material and hydraulic properties of bofedales to characterize material and hydraulic properties in bofedales we augered 34 boreholes in transects spanning ichu uplands immediately above and through bofedales i 2 transects 9 boreholes ii 2 transects 15 boreholes iii 1 transect 5 boreholes and iv 1 transect 5 boreholes fig s7 ten boreholes were used for nuclear magnetic resonance nmr surveys and were augered with a 2 25 bucket all other boreholes were augered with a 4 bucket boreholes were augered in june 2019 dry season and january 2020 wet season peat was field identified by a very dark brown to black color partially to completely decomposed organic matter a greasy and fibrous texture and high water content when saturated yielded water when squeezed we corroborated field estimates with laboratory data showing gravimetric water contents from 0 6 to 1 45 g g 1 weight percent carbon 25 45 and total porosities exceeding 0 8 clay was identified by an increase in density dark gray to reddish gray color the disappearance of organic matter and the ability to roll soil into worms silt sand and rock chips increased with depth due to glacio lacustrine and fluvial deposits or weathered bedrock henceforth referred to as the mineral layer in june 2019 we surveyed 10 boreholes in bofedales i and ii with a portable downhole nmr logging system dart vista clara inc mukilteo washington usa nmr is a geophysical method that directly detects the presence of hydrogen and is used to determine porosity or water content and to estimate hydraulic conductivity e g behroozmand et al 2015 unlike other in situ methods for determining water content such as neutron probe and time domain reflectometry nmr estimates of water content do not require site specific calibration e g schmidt and rempe 2020 measurements were made with 0 25 m spacing from the ground surface downward each measurement s investigation volume was a cylindrical shell of 0 23 m height 1 2 mm in thickness at a radius of 6 5 7 6 cm from the central axis of the tool walsh et al 2013 additional details on instrument parameters and data processing can be found in s4 1 2 5 2 estimates of bofedal dynamic water storage we quantified seasonally dynamic water storage in bofedales storage relative to the end of the dry season through downhole nmr measurements direct observations of material properties and saturation state and water table monitoring in bofedal i for each layer peat clay mineral we calculated drainable water storage as the difference between nmr measurements of total porosity vwc at saturation and an estimation of vwc at field capacity we did not measure water potential in the peat so we could not construct wrcs as we did for the upland soils instead we estimated field capacity by measuring the vwc of freely drained peat clay or the mineral layer a distance of approximately 0 25 m above the water table in peat or at the margins clay mineral layer of bofedal ii our estimates for field capacity in peat is 0 42 cm3 cm3 which matches reported values of field capacity in hemic peat dimitrov and lafleur 2021 our estimate of field capacity in the clay 0 3 cm3 cm3 and mineral layer 0 2 cm3 cm3 are supported by previous studies of lacustrine clays bruand and tessier 2000 ito and azam 2009 we determined the minimum depth of the water table via direct measurements maximum water depth was estimated by continuous monitoring in well 102 and corroborated with field measurements in the wet season january 2020 the average depth to the water table in the four bofedales was 0 12 m table s7 with standing water across large portions of all four bofedales in the dry season july 2019 the depth to water table was similar across bofedales i and ii the maximum observed water table depth at w102 1 94 m was applied to bofedales ii iv we interpolated layers peat clay mineral and the maximum and minimum depth of water table across the cross sections using inverse distance weighting figs s11 14 we then multiplied the areas of each layer by its drainable vwc to calculate dynamic storage and determine the total for each cross section finally we divided total storage in each cross section by the length of the cross section to estimate average dynamic storage capacity in mm for bofedales i iv 3 results 3 1 annual water balances and dry season runoff precipitation subsurface moisture groundwater and runoff dynamics in the urw followed seasonal cycles of wet up from october to december a sustained period of precipitation and high runoff from december to april and a dry period from may to october fig 3 3 1 1 precipitation the precipitation measured in the urw rain gauge was 749 825 and 738 mm in wys 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the dry season started in may to early june with an average length of 139 days and average precipitation of only 19 mm fig 3a table 2 the onset of the wet season occurred in early to mid october and wet season precipitation peaked in frequency and intensity between december and april fig 3a 3 1 2 subsurface moisture dynamics in the uplands in wys 2020 2022 an average of 138 mm of cumulative precipitation fell before field capacity was reached across the upland rooting depth table 3 successive storms caused ephemeral increases in soil and saprolite moisture storage and drainage to deeper layers in the dry season subsurface moisture storage across the soil fell below field capacity fig 3b with faster rates of drying and greater overall moisture loss in the soil by the end of the dry season soil and saprolite water storage reached average minimum values of 231 and 174 mm respectively table 2 3 1 3 bofedal groundwater dynamics groundwater dynamics in bofedal i showed remarkably consistent annual cycles of recharge sustained saturation through the wet season and into the dry season and steady decline until the following wet up fig 3c the water table in bofedal i responded immediately to the start of the wet season with a modest rise however there was a dramatic rise in the water table to saturation that closely coincided with the timing of field capacity on the hillslopes bofedal i saturated between late november and mid december following an average of 197 mm of cumulative precipitation table 3 bofedal i desaturated an average of 41 days into the following dry season and declined linearly at an average rate of 14 0 mm day to an average maximum depth of 1 71 m table 2 3 1 4 runoff in the urw at the onset of the wet season runoff rose above values of 1 mm d after an average of 173 mm of cumulative precipitation similar to the amount of cumulative precipitation when bofedal i saturated and exceeding the amount that resulted in field capacity across the ichu rooting zone in the hillslope fig 3d table 3 throughout the wet season runoff at site 3 responded quickly to precipitation inputs with peak flows rising to an average of 7 7 mm d 72 l s table 3 in wy 2021 low stream stage resulted in peak flows that never exceeded 5 0 mm d 47 l s the site 3 rating curve combined wys 20 and 21 due to infrequent field visits through the covid 19 lockdowns despite these limitations medium and low flows were consistent with our rating curve figs s5 runoff declined steadily as the system entered the dry season across the three dry seasons the rate and shape of runoff recessions were similar with average minimum flow of 0 21 mm d 2 0 l s 3 1 5 annual water balances annual precipitation adjusted for orographic effects by using the mean elevation of the site 3 subbasin ranged from 754 to 867 mm over wy 2019 2021 table 4 annual precipitation values are within one standard deviation of the long term 1981 2017 average annual gridded precipitation 848 156 mm aybar et al 2020 annual runoff varied from 439 to 643 mm corresponding to 57 74 of annual precipitation with eta accounting for 34 35 dry season runoff amounted to 12 of annual runoff on average the difference between annual inputs and outputs δs in table 4 combines interannual watershed storage potential drainage below the stream gauge at site 3 which we did not directly measure and measurement error in wy2020 δs was 69 mm and in wy2021 δs was 51 mm

watershed s response runoff eta storage in bofedales are used to separate the water year into three phases fill up steady state and release values are in table s8 the fill up phase began with the start of the wy here we use fill up rather than the more general wet up used above to specify the period from september 1 until bofedal i saturated during the fill up phase cumulative runoff and eta were modest cumulative precipitation which exceeded the combined fluxes of runoff and eta by greater than a factor of four primarily recharged the unsaturated zone the steady state phase began with saturation of bofedal i which closely followed the rise in moisture to field capacity in the hillslope in this phase successive precipitation events caused rapid stormflow responses and cumulative eta increased steadily due to increasing temperatures during the austral summer precipitation inputs roughly equaled the combined outputs of runoff and eta the release phase began with the onset of the dry season may 19 in wy2020 and june 8 in wy2021 although there is a near absence of precipitation during this phase cumulative runoff continues to increase as streams continue to flow bofedal i did not desaturate until an average of 41 days into the dry season table 2 baseflow throughout the release phase remained above 0 25 mm d eta accounted for the greatest total moisture loss over the release phase as upland grasses and hydrophytic vegetation sustained steady rates of transpiration leading to moisture depletion across the root zone 3 1 7 spatiotemporal patterns of runoff in the urw we measured greater runoff across all seasons coming from subbasins with higher bofedal coverage fig 5 data points are colored corresponding to the flow exceedance probability across the monitoring period at site 3 to indicate the general flow conditions in the urw the start of the dry season corresponded with the 41 5 39 3 and 44 5 exceedance flow in wys 2019 2021 respectively we performed a simple regression analysis on the percent of the subbasin covered in bofedales and the logarithm of runoff at high flows percent exceedance 30 there is a weak but significant fit r2 0 19 p 0 05 at low flows percent exceedance 70 the fit improves slightly r2 0 21 p 0 05 three sites showed consistently higher runoff falling along a trendline offset from other subbasins west 1 and 2 fig 1 if we exclude these three sites from the regression analysis we find a weak but significant fit at high flows r2 0 07 p 0 05 and a strong and significant fit at low flows r2 0 61 p 0 05 table s9 3 2 seasonally dynamic water storage in bofedales and their contributions to runoff 3 2 1 bofedal material properties water storage borehole transects in bofedales i iv showed similar stratigraphy figs

glaciofluvial clays and silts up to 1 2 m thick and 4 weathered clayey silty saprolite or glacio fluvial deposits that are several meters thick photograph in fig 6a shows only the upper three layers we did not observe confining layers a perched water table or groundwater under artesian pressure hydrophytic plant roots extended beyond the depth of peat into underlying clays or mineral layers to depths exceeding 1 5 m downhole nmr data from 10 borehole transects in bofedales i and ii showed similar trends in the stratigraphy of different layers with peat thickening towards the center of the bofedal and a decrease in vwc through the profile fig 6b c the signal to noise ratio was large indicating the data were of high quality fig s10 the porosity of each layer determined from measurements below the june 2019 water table showed small standard deviations across all measurements table 5 drainable porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased by approximately one order of magnitude from peat to clay and from clay to the mineral layer 3 2 2 seasonally dynamic water storage and runoff in the urw average dynamic storage in bofedales i iv varied from 360 to 540 mm table 6 the range is primarily due to differences in the thickness of the high porosity peat which thickened towards the center fig 6b c and was thickest in bofedal ii 1 75 m table s7 smaller bofedales such as i iii and iv exhibited thinner peat layers 0 50 1 0 m bofedales cover an area of 0 244 km2 across the urw by combining our surveys of four bofedales with borehole nmr measurements and groundwater monitoring we estimate bofedales store 105 000 10 000 m3 of water seasonally at the scale of the urw 2 12 km2 this volume corresponds to 49 5 mm of water which contributes to dry season runoff once the bofedales begin to drain conservatively we can compare bofedal dynamic storage to total dry season runoff which averaged 73 2 18 2 mm at site 3 and 114 9 21 4 mm at site 1 bofedal water storage accounts for 67 31 of dry season streamflow at site 3 and 43 22 of dry season streamflow at site 1 4 discussion andean communities depend on water resources emanating from the humid puna however data relating the physical structure of the humid puna including bofedales to hydrologic processes are limited here we discuss our key findings in the context of our motivating questions by first comparing seasonal patterns in water yield from the urw with the few existing studies of water resources in high elevation and seasonally dry andean landscapes we next highlight our discovery of higher runoff from subbasins with greater bofedal coverage and compare seasonally dynamic storage in bofedales with dry season runoff and downstream water needs we discuss the limitations of our analyses and present a conceptual model of the hydrologic function of bofedales in regulating water resources and sustaining perennial streamflow in the humid puna 4 1 water resources in the humid puna a comparison of catchments in high elevation and seasonally dry andean landscapes is useful to place the urw in the context of the region and to highlight similarities and differences between humid puna and more extensively studied humid páramo catchments we compare published hydrologic and topographic data from five similar high elevation grassland catchments table s10 two of the catchments are in the seasonally dry puna of perú and bolivia hua1 and tiq2 from ochoa tocachi et al 2016 and three are in the perennially humid páramo of southern ecuador pau1 from ochoa tocachi et al 2016 and zeo m4 and m5 from mosquera et al 2015 the urw elevation range 4011 4543 m a s l lies within the elevation range of the comparison catchments 3665 4840 m a s l nearly 16 of subbasin 3 is covered in bofedales which is within the reported range of the 5 catchments 5 18 no bofedal coverage estimates were given for pau1 in ochoa tocachi et al 2016 so an estimate of 8 was derived using google earth pro while ochoa tocachi et al 2016 report the bofedal coverage of hua1 to be 15 we estimated the bofedal coverage at hua1 to be closer to 5 using google earth pro the underlying geology of zeo and pau1 is predominantly composed of lava flows and ash deposits with very low permeability mosquera et al 2015 buytaert et al 2007 the parent material weathers to form andosols with high water retention

limited geological information was available for tiq2 beyond soil classification lepitsols and inceptisol as with the urw and the larger vub runoff in the five catchments is driven by precipitation inputs the urw has a slightly lower annual precipitation 803 mm compared to the other catchments which range from 871 mm tiq2 to 1358 mm pau1 the runoff ratio in the urw 0 57 0 74 was similar to runoff ratios in all catchments except for tiq2 0 29 a comparison of the flow duration curves fdc to the two puna catchments shows the urw to have a more gentle overall slope fig 7 runoff in tiq2 exceeds runoff in the urw during high flows and is much smaller at low flows tiq2 s low runoff ratio and lower baseflow may be attributable to less bofedal coverage lower average slope large interannual storage in cirque lakes and or higher rates of evapotranspiration peak flows in hua1 are higher than the urw however the slope of the fdc is large and runoff is less than in the urw at medium to low flows 40 exceedance the large slope indicates little baseflow and the flashiness of hua1 may be a result of limited upland storage due to steep headwalls of exposed bedrock runoff in the three humid páramo catchments is consistently higher than in the urw peak runoff is 22 78 mm d in the humid páramo while peak runoff in the urw reaches only 11 mm d in the humid páramo large annual

flow exceedance probability between 33 and 66 is 1 49 similar to the fdc slopes of the humid páramo catchments table s10 in a seasonally dry environment a gentle sloped fdc suggests the presence of

studies in the humid páramo of ecuador report similar relationships between peak runoff and wetland coverage mosquera et al 2015 or between catchment wide storage and the extent of histosols lazo et

acreman 2003 dominated by event water e g laudon et al 2007 the spatiotemporal patterns of runoff in the urw differ from these studies in two primary ways first we found no relationships between bofedal coverage or mean runoff and the size of the subbasin second we found a stronger relationship between bofedal coverage and runoff at low flows similar to studies relating greater baseflow to thicker sedimentary deposits and more extensive wetlands in boreal catchments e g karlsen et al 2016 floriancic et al 2019 wet and dry season runoff were anomalously high at three sites in the lower part of the urw site 1 site 2 and the western subbasin mean slope throughout these three subbasins was between 23 and 25 slightly steeper than in other subbasins table s1 bofedales covered 11 5 and 14 5 of sites 1 and 3 respectively but only 7 7 of the western subbasin between site 3 and site 2 the valley morphology changes from broad and u shaped to narrow and v shaped with a steep bedrock confined channel changes in morphology from glaciated valleys with thick deposits to deeply incised stream morphology would decrease subsurface storage capacity as glacial deposits are removed to expose bedrock and might force flow to the surface resulting in greater stream runoff prancevic and kirchner 2019 gillespie and clark 2011 whiting and godsey 2016 large runoff in the western subbasin may be associated with extensive limestone karst in the headwaters which are often productive water sources e g villacorta et al 2016 somers and mckenzie 2020 although there is a statistically significant fit for all data the dry season fit improved markedly by excluding data from the three outlier catchments the outlier catchments serve as a reminder of the additional factors lithology and topography controlling the hydrologic response of small 10 km2 upland catchments e g ochoa tocachi et al 2016 lahuatte et al 2022 such as the urw 2 12 km2 4 3 dynamic storage in bofedales quantifying contributions to streamflow bofedal i saturated after an average of 197 mm of cumulative precipitation far less than the precipitation required to directly recharge one meter of peat with a porosity of 0 88 880 mm the topographic setting temporal correspondence between hillslope field capacity and saturation in bofedal i and a dynamic storage capacity exceeding cumulative precipitation at the time of saturation support previous studies identifying groundwater flow as the primary recharge mechanism e g cooper et al 2019 valois et al 2020 valois et al 2021 integrating measurements of drainable porosity in all layers over the dynamic range of the water table yields an average dynamic storage capacity of 430 mm table 6 we are aware of only two studies quantifying water storage capacity in bofedales both conducted in streamside bofedales in a narrow canyon of the estero derecho watershed in chile valois et al 2020 valois et al 2021 the chilean bofedales are 0 02 km2 smaller than bofedal iv and composed of a 0 3 m thick layer of peat and underlying fluvial deposits the authors calculated total porosity 0 34 over a depth of 10 m to estimate a total water storage of up to 3400 mm we suggest however that a more useful calculation would yield the amount of water a bofedal yields to streams if we assume the chilean bofedal has the same maximum water table depth as in the urw s bofedales 1 94 m and the drainable porosities for the 0 3 m of peat and 1 64 m of underlying deposits reported in the chilean bofedal are the same as in the urw 0 42 and 0 21 respectively the bofedal would yield a total of 438 mm of water to streams this brief analysis yields a comparable dynamic storage to the urw and suggests bofedales across the andes may be contributing large volumes of water to dry season streamflow from the time bofedales begin to drain in the middle of the dry season early july to the start of the wet season early to mid october irrigation demand in zurite is approximately 730 mm wunderlich 2021 oshun et al 2021 chacras or family owned agricultural plots are typically 0 25 1 ha 0 0025 0 01 km2 oshun et al 2021 the total dynamic storage of the urw s bofedales 105 000 m3 meets the dry season irrigation demand of 13 0 15 7 ha 0 13 0 157 km2 equivalent to the needs of 13 63 chacras bofedales which are fragile and vulnerable ecosystems e g bridgham et al 2008 and anderson et al 2021 provide important contributions to local water supply and overall water security 4 4 limitations and potential error in water balance and bofedal dynamic storage estimates 4 4 1 limitations and potential error in water balance our estimates of eta relied on the conversion of eto to eta via a crop coefficient 0 85 throughout the year in bofedales for the uplands covered in j ichu we used a conditional model which applies a crop coefficient 0 74 to convert eto to eta when conditions exceeded field capacity at 0 2 m depth and via direct measurements of moisture loss at conditions below field capacity each crop coefficient is an imperfect fit as there are no published crop coefficients for the humid puna uplands nor for bofedales with each method we report eta estimates and an error of 30 annual eta accounts for 34 35 of annual precipitation table 4 which corresponds well with estimates of pastureland eta across the vub fernandez palomino et al 2021 and to values reported in natural and wetter catchments in the páramo buytaert et al 2007 however more recent studies in the páramo report eta accounting for a much greater proportion of annual precipitation e g carrillo rojas et al 2019 ochoa sánchez et al 2019 in wy20 greater subsurface drying likely from vigorous vegetation growth following a grassland fire in late july 2019 resulted in a storage deficit of 69 mm table 4 in wy21 cumulative precipitation was larger at the time of field capacity bofedal i saturation and a rise in stream runoff above 1 mm d as greater amounts of precipitation replaced the moisture deficit across the rooting zone table 3 interannual storage was 51 mm in wy21 likely due to replenishing the deficit across the rooting zone table 4 whereas eta estimates are provided with a large range of uncertainty the well constrained rating curves and low runoff error 12 13 provide a robust estimate of water yield and corroborate the eta estimates 4 4 2 limitations and potential error in bofedal dynamic storage estimates there are two possible sources of error in the bofedal dynamic storage estimates spatial heterogeneity in bofedal soil properties and continuous water table dynamics across the entire urw we have attempted to limit the extent of this error by collecting data across transects that span four bofedales covering a combined area of 0 12 km2 50 of the urw s total bofedal area the transects show consistent patterns such as peat thickening towards the center of the bofedal fig 6 fig s11 14 furthermore the porosity values are well constrained across the borehole transects suggesting similar material properties across all bofedales and the drainable porosity of peat 0 42 47 of total porosity is within the range of peat water yield 10 80 depending on the degree of organic decomposition radforth and brawner 1977 letts et al 2000 we note that this is the first study to use nmr to quantify peatland water storage and highlights the value of this portable system in examining the porosity and water content within the humid puna fig 6 despite extreme topography and a lack of road access that required us to carry a drill rig to bofedal i we were able to drill well 102 however this terrain prevented us from drilling a well in bofedal ii limiting our water table measurements to one bofedal well 102 allowed us to measure seasonal water table fluctuations and a maximum water table depth of 1 94 m while 1 94 m is greater than reported maximum water table depths in other bofedales hribljan et al 2015 cooper et al 2019 oyague et al 2022 monge salazar et al 2022 it is similar to studies of bofedales experiencing moderate drainage planas clarke et al 2020 in the urw dry season drainage is likely driven by natural stream incision which may affect the health of cushion plants despite their long taproots observed to extend to depths approaching 2 m e g chimner et al 2019 suarez et al 2021 fritz et al 2011 although we do not have measurements of the maximum water table depth across all bofedales in the late dry season our assumption of spatial consistency in groundwater dynamics is supported with the following observations 1 the saturation of well 102 closely followed the timing of field capacity in the hillslope and roughly coincided with a transition to sustained high runoff values throughout the urw and 2 similar average depths to the water table in the wet and dry seasons were found across the bofedales table s7 these observations would be strengthened through an expanded groundwater monitoring network including wells in upland areas and through the application of a conservative tracer to identify flow paths finally while our site may provide insight into other similar puna grasslands catchments in the region additional analysis at the urw and comparable analysis at other sites including detailed information on watershed size elevation aspect and geologic and hydrogeologic parameters of subsurface substrates are needed to quantify relationships between bofedal size and dynamic water storage at the regional scale 4 5 conceptual model of bofedal hydrology bofedales contribute to catchment wide water storage and sustain baseflow through three mechanisms fig 8 first bofedales form in low gradient glacially carved landscapes upland bofedales form in cirques in which lakes or ponds become peat forming through a process of terrestrialization bofedales are thus located in interior basins that in the urw are 4 12 times greater than the bofedal itself thus bofedales intercept large volumes of groundwater which leads to seasonal saturation second layers of high porosity peat with high drainable porosity form a natural sponge to seasonally store tremendous volumes of water third the combined effects of a low water table gradient and low hydraulic conductivities in underlying clay and mineral layers result in the slow release of water from bofedales to streams although our study is the first to quantify the hydrology of bofedales in the context of water resources in the humid puna previous studies have shown water flowing through wetlands to have longer mean transit times e g lyon et al 2010 roa garcía and weiler 2010 buytaert et al 2011 lane et al 2020 lazo et al 2019 and argued the presence of wetlands increases or dominates the existing catchment wide water storage e g lane et al 2020 the impact of bofedal groundwater dynamics on streamflow is best illustrated through the three phases fill up steady state and release in the fill up phase precipitation recharges the unsaturated zone to field capacity as the water table in bofedales continues to fall to nearly 2 m below the ground surface after an average of 138 mm of precipitation field capacity is reached in the upland rooting zone causing drainage and groundwater inflow to the bofedales bofedales saturate at the beginning of the steady state phase at this point seasonally dynamic water storage in the urw has approached the storage capacity and runoff rapidly increases as the catchment sheds additional precipitation we note the likelihood of saturation overland flow across bofedales during the steady state phase the end of the rainy season in may june marks the start of the release phase groundwater from hillslopes continues to move through bofedales to streams at rates sufficient to maintain saturation in the bofedales until an average of 41 days into the dry season at which point the water table begins to fall at an average rate of 14 mm day additional moisture depletion in the peat and clay below field capacity occurs due to transpiration of deeply rooted hydrophytic plants 5 conclusion the urw a 2 12 km2 humid puna catchment draining to the agrarian village of zurite yields 57 74 of annual rainfall to runoff despite a dry season lasting up to 5 months the fdc of the urw shows a gentle slope and 12 of annual runoff comes in the dry season the gentle slope of the fdc and sustained dry season streamflow are the result of large seasonally dynamic water storage at the catchment scale spatiotemporal discharge measurements throughout the urw identified greater runoff emanating from subbasins with greater bofedal coverage across all seasons three key characteristics provide large seasonally dynamic water storage and make bofedales vital sources of baseflow first bofedales are found in topographic depressions that collect water from upslope areas 4 12 times their size second high porosity peat up to 1 75 m thick seasonally stores tremendous volumes of water third a gentle water table gradient in gently sloping bofedales and the low conductivity of underlying clay and mineral layers result in the slow drainage of stored water to streams we estimate bofedal dynamic storage capacity and water yield to streams to be 49 5 mm at the scale of the urw bofedales which drain in the dry season account for 20 98 of dry season flow in the urw sufficient to meet the irrigation demands of 13 15 ha we conclude that bofedales regulate flow to sustain perennial streams in the humid puna and are thus vital to local and

and extensively fractured weak mudstone known as lutita e g garcía fernández baca 2017 a sugary white crystalline quartzite forms a steep bedrock exposed ridge that divides two upper tributaries of the central subbasin the western subbasin is underlain by the san jeronimo formation however there is also extensively weathered limestone karst in the northwest and an oligocene quartz monzodiorite intrusive underlying the southwest portions of the subbasin respectively the topography and vegetation are characteristic of the humid puna the urw headwaters are defined by cliff forming headwalls of

characterization 2 2 1 land cover classification we used the support vector machine algorithm l3harris geospatial 2019 on a 1 meter resolution image of the urw esri world imagery to classify four land cover classes in the urw bofedal upland outcrop and shrubland we quality controlled the resulting land cover classification vectors via ground truthing during field campaigns and with orthoimagery 8 3 cm pixel produced from unmanned aerial vehicle uav surveys 2 2 2 topographic data collection and processing in june 2019 we flew a dji phantom 4 pro uav to create a digital elevation model dem of the urw we programmed flights to take photos with 80 coverage overlap at 200 feet above the ground surface and used a real time kinematic rtk gps eos arrowgold to survey 26 ground control points mean horizontal error of 0 097 m and mean vertical error of 0 113 m supplementary material s2 we post processed imagery in agisoft metashape professional to create a 1 m cell resolution dem following protocols from the united states geological survey 2017 and dietrich 2015 the mean slope of the urw for 1 m pixels is 24 0 table 1 however the mean slope of bofedales which cover 0 244 km2 11 6 of the urw is 14 1 2 3 hydrologic monitoring 2 3 1 annual water balance we constructed annual water balances by measuring precipitation p and runoff q calculating actual evapotranspiration eta and estimating interannual water storage s water balances are referenced to the site 3 gauging station in the central subbasin 0 806 km2 fig 1 due to the incomplete data set for water year wy 2019 which lacked a complete record of upland soil and saprolite and groundwater measurements used to estimate eta we focused our water balance analyses on wy2020 and wy2021 2 3 2 precipitation precipitation was measured at a resolution of 0 2 mm using a tipping bucket rain gauge hobo onset rg3 installed in june 2018 near site 3 at a height of approximately 1 5 m above the ground the start of the annual water year september 1 corresponds with the end of the regionally dry austral winter and marks a gradual transition into the wet season we define the dry season as the period over which 15 day cumulative precipitation remained less than 10 mm and the wet season as the period over which 15 day cumulative precipitation exceeded 10 mm although spatial variability in precipitation can be high in andean catchments e g buytaert et al 2006a célleri et al 2007 the rugged topography and limited access prevented us from installing a spatially distributed rainfall network the rain gauge was installed near the geographic center of the urw at 4171 m a s l the resolution of the national gridded precipitation dataset aybar et al 2020 is insufficient to show variability within the urw for our water balance estimates we corrected for orographic effects via an elevation precipitation model using rain gauges in the urw and zurite 3411 m a s l we calculated the difference in 15 day cumulative precipitation between the two gauges and extrapolated via a second degree polynomial to predict annual precipitation at the mean elevation of the site 3 subbasin 4369 m a s l s3 1 2 3 3 bofedal groundwater in june 2019 we drilled to 11 m in bofedal i fig 1 using a 2 75 diameter gas powered rotary drill and installed monitoring well 102 the upper 0 6 m were peat which was underlain by clay to a depth of 2 5 m we encountered a layer of weathered bedrock clasts silt and clay material interpreted to be glacio fluvial deposits at 2 5 m which extended down through the base of the well we cased well 102 with 65 mm diameter pvc pipe with 1 mm slits over the entire length capped at the base and installed a pressure transducer hobo u20 001 at a depth of 6 93 m to measure water table dynamics fully slotted wells have been effective in similar landscapes to monitor bofedal groundwater dynamics hribljan et al 2015 cooper et al 2019 oyague et al 2022 monge salazar et al 2022 and lahuatte et al 2022 2 3 4 streamflow in june 2018 we installed stream gauges in the central subbasin site 3 drainage area 0 806 km2 and above the diversion canal site 1 drainage area 2 11 km2 at each location we connected a slotted pvc staff gauge with demarcations to 1 50th of a foot to rebar stakes driven into the channel bed and installed a pressure transducer hobo u20l 001 inside the pvc an identical transducer was installed adjacent to the stream to measure atmospheric pressure data were post processed to account for sensor drift or slight changes in the position of the sensor after downloading data and reinstalling the gauge s3 2 due to high flow variability narrow 1 m shallow 0 5 m and steep 5 channels with complex streambed morphology we measured stream discharge using the dry injection salt dilution technique hudson and fraser 2005 which is more accurate than the area velocity method in andean streams parra et al 2016 for each discharge measurement we placed a conductivity probe onset u24 001 in the stream and injected a known mass of salt at least 20 channel widths upstream typically 15 m upstream measurements took 15 20 min we applied the conductivity assistant non linear correction in hoboware pro onset to convert breakthrough curves to specific conductance and then scaled by the recommended correction factor of 0 486 hudson and fraser 2005 additional details can be found in s3 2 at site 3 we developed two rating curves one before and one after a high flow event in march 2019 at site 1 we present one rating curve from april 2019 onward due to substantial changes in the channel geometry in march 2019 all three rating curves are well constrained r2 0 95 figs s5 s6 we scaled discharge by watershed area using the uav derived 1 m resolution dem and present hydrographs of runoff mm day for wys 2019 2021 runoff at site 3 was used in water balances for wys 2020 and 2021 as it has the longest continuous record and the most well constrained rating curve error in runoff was quantified as the mean residual error from all discharge measurements used to develop each rating curve 2 3 5 subsurface moisture monitoring and estimates of grassland evapotranspiration in january 2019 we installed four teros 12 volumetric water content vwc sensors and two teros 21 water potential sensors meter group inc 2018 at an elevation of 4195 m a s l beneath a 36 slope covered in j ichu fig 1 an organic rich loam extended to a depth of 0 4 m below was a dark brown clayey soil with clasts of sandstone that increased with depth a transition to sandstone saprolite occurred at 0 75 m and clay content decreased with increasing depth roots were found throughout the profile but in decreasing abundance with depth bulk density increased from 0 60 g cm3 at 0 11 m to 0 93 g cm3 at 0 52 m the profile was representative of upland soils table s4 probes were inserted horizontally in the upslope face undisturbed soil and saprolite we installed vwc sensors at depths of 0 2 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m and collocated water potential sensors at depths of 0 2 and 0 9 m we converted 15 minute vwc measurements to daily averages and multiplied over thicknesses determined by material properties to quantify dynamics in moisture storage mm in the soil 0 0 75 m and in the saprolite 0 75 1 35 cm table s5 to estimate eta from j ichu we applied a conditional model depending on whether subsurface conditions were above or below field capacity we used in situ measurements of water potential and vwc at 0 2 m soil and 0 9 m saprolite to construct wetting and drying water release curves wrc fig s8 we estimated field capacity using a water potential of 33 kpa the vwc of field capacity at 0 6 and 1 2 m where no water potential sensors were installed was estimated using water potential data at 0 2 m soil and at 0 9 m saprolite respectively the vwc s at field capacity in the soil 0 432 0 357 cm3 cm3 table s6 are smaller than those reported in the organic rich andosols of the humid páramo e g buytaert et al 2005 mosquera et al 2020 which may be due to the lower organic matter content at our study site when subsurface moisture at 0 2 m depth exceeded field capacity 0 432 we calculated a daily reference evapotranspiration eto via a temperature based model visualizing ecosystem land management assessment 2 0 abdelnour et al 2011 hamon 1963 we then converted eto to actual evapotranspiration eta by scaling by a crop coefficient of 0 74 which was recently derived for the less humid period in humid páramo grasslands carrillo rojas et al 2019 when water potential in the soil fell below field capacity we integrated moisture losses in mm over the rooting zone using the vwc sensors there were 202 and 159 days in which field capacity was exceeded in wy 2020 and 2021 respectively we extrapolated the eta estimates to land classified as upland which covers 83 of subbasin 3 error estimates of the teros 12 sensors is reported to be 3 00 for an uncalibrated mineral soil system such as the urw upland meter group inc 2019 however to account for error in our field capacity estimates the temperature based method for deriving eto and our crop coefficient we applied the maximum error 30 reported from estimates in the humid páramo córdova et al 2015 2 3 6 estimates of bofedal evapotranspiration to estimate daily eta fluxes from bofedales covering 16 of the site 3 subbasin we calculated daily eto using velma as above and converted eto to eta by applying a crop coefficient of 0 85 derived from a study of peat bogs gerling et al 2019 we applied the same maximum error from above 30 to our estimates of bofedal eta 2 4 spatiotemporal measurements of discharge we measured discharge via salt dilution hudson and fraser 2005 at 19 nested locations on 14 dates between june 2019 and september 2021 within the central n 10 eastern n 8 and western n 1 subbasins fig 1 the monitoring strategy was designed to measure the spatial and temporal variability of runoff and to compare runoff to the extent of bofedales across the urw s subbasins we hypothesized that subbasins with greater percent bofedal cover would yield higher runoff especially in the dry season our measurements focused on the central and eastern subbasins because the underlying lithologies are consistent fig s1 the drainage areas of the subbasins range from 0 096 to 2 112 km2 with bofedales covering 7 71 29 42 table s1 channel morphology ranged from relatively gentle sloped reaches flowing through bofedal and wet grassland settings to steep bedrock confined channels predominantly found in the lower portion of the watershed in most locations the channel was incised into either bedrock proglacial features or bofedales 2 5 seasonal moisture dynamics in bofedales 2 5 1 material and hydraulic properties of bofedales to characterize material and hydraulic properties in bofedales we augered 34 boreholes in transects spanning ichu uplands immediately above and through bofedales i 2 transects 9 boreholes ii 2 transects 15 boreholes iii 1 transect 5 boreholes and iv 1 transect 5 boreholes fig s7 ten boreholes were used for nuclear magnetic resonance nmr surveys and were augered with a 2 25 bucket all other boreholes were augered with a 4 bucket boreholes were augered in june 2019 dry season and january 2020 wet season peat was field identified by a very dark brown to black color partially to completely decomposed organic matter a greasy and fibrous texture and high water content when saturated yielded water when squeezed we corroborated field estimates with laboratory data showing gravimetric water contents from 0 6 to 1 45 g g 1 weight percent carbon 25 45 and total porosities exceeding 0 8 clay was identified by an increase in density dark gray to reddish gray color the disappearance of organic matter and the ability to roll soil into worms silt sand and rock chips increased with depth due to glacio lacustrine and fluvial deposits or weathered bedrock henceforth referred to as the mineral layer in june 2019 we surveyed 10 boreholes in bofedales i and ii with a portable downhole nmr logging system dart vista clara inc mukilteo washington usa nmr is a geophysical method that directly detects the presence of hydrogen and is used to determine porosity or water content and to estimate hydraulic conductivity e g behroozmand et al 2015 unlike other in situ methods for determining water content such as neutron probe and time domain reflectometry nmr estimates of water content do not require site specific calibration e g schmidt and rempe 2020 measurements were made with 0 25 m spacing from the ground surface downward each measurement s investigation volume was a cylindrical shell of 0 23 m height 1 2 mm in thickness at a radius of 6 5 7 6 cm from the central axis of the tool walsh et al 2013 additional details on instrument parameters and data processing can be found in s4 1 2 5 2 estimates of bofedal dynamic water storage we quantified seasonally dynamic water storage in bofedales storage relative to the end of the dry season through downhole nmr measurements direct observations of material properties and saturation state and water table monitoring in bofedal i for each layer peat clay mineral we calculated drainable water storage as the difference between nmr measurements of total porosity vwc at saturation and an estimation of vwc at field capacity we did not measure water potential in the peat so we could not construct wrcs as we did for the upland soils instead we estimated field capacity by measuring the vwc of freely drained peat clay or the mineral layer a distance of approximately 0 25 m above the water table in peat or at the margins clay mineral layer of bofedal ii our estimates for field capacity in peat is 0 42 cm3 cm3 which matches reported values of field capacity in hemic peat dimitrov and lafleur 2021 our estimate of field capacity in the clay 0 3 cm3 cm3 and mineral layer 0 2 cm3 cm3 are supported by previous studies of lacustrine clays bruand and tessier 2000 ito and azam 2009 we determined the minimum depth of the water table via direct measurements maximum water depth was estimated by continuous monitoring in well 102 and corroborated with field measurements in the wet season january 2020 the average depth to the water table in the four bofedales was 0 12 m table s7 with standing water across large portions of all four bofedales in the dry season july 2019 the depth to water table was similar across bofedales i and ii the maximum observed water table depth at w102 1 94 m was applied to bofedales ii iv we interpolated layers peat clay mineral and the maximum and minimum depth of water table across the cross sections using inverse distance weighting figs s11 14 we then multiplied the areas of each layer by its drainable vwc to calculate dynamic storage and determine the total for each cross section finally we divided total storage in each cross section by the length of the cross section to estimate average dynamic storage capacity in mm for bofedales i iv 3 results 3 1 annual water balances and dry season runoff precipitation subsurface moisture groundwater and runoff dynamics in the urw followed seasonal cycles of wet up from october to december a sustained period of precipitation and high runoff from december to april and a dry period from may to october fig 3 3 1 1 precipitation the precipitation measured in the urw rain gauge was 749 825 and 738 mm in wys 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the dry season started in may to early june with an average length of 139 days and average precipitation of only 19 mm fig 3a table 2 the onset of the wet season occurred in early to mid october and wet season precipitation peaked in frequency and intensity between december and april fig 3a 3 1 2 subsurface moisture dynamics in the uplands in wys 2020 2022 an average of 138 mm of cumulative precipitation fell before field capacity was reached across the upland rooting depth table 3 successive storms caused ephemeral increases in soil and saprolite moisture storage and drainage to deeper layers in the dry season subsurface moisture storage across the soil fell below field capacity fig 3b with faster rates of drying and greater overall moisture loss in the soil by the end of the dry season soil and saprolite water storage reached average minimum values of 231 and 174 mm respectively table 2 3 1 3 bofedal groundwater dynamics groundwater dynamics in bofedal i showed remarkably consistent annual cycles of recharge sustained saturation through the wet season and into the dry season and steady decline until the following wet up fig 3c the water table in bofedal i responded immediately to the start of the wet season with a modest rise however there was a dramatic rise in the water table to saturation that closely coincided with the timing of field capacity on the hillslopes bofedal i saturated between late november and mid december following an average of 197 mm of cumulative precipitation table 3 bofedal i desaturated an average of 41 days into the following dry season and declined linearly at an average rate of 14 0 mm day to an average maximum depth of 1 71 m table 2 3 1 4 runoff in the urw at the onset of the wet season runoff rose above values of 1 mm d after an average of 173 mm of cumulative precipitation similar to the amount of cumulative precipitation when bofedal i saturated and exceeding the amount that resulted in field capacity across the ichu rooting zone in the hillslope fig 3d table 3 throughout the wet season runoff at site 3 responded quickly to precipitation inputs with peak flows rising to an average of 7 7 mm d 72 l s table 3 in wy 2021 low stream stage resulted in peak flows that never exceeded 5 0 mm d 47 l s the site 3 rating curve combined wys 20 and 21 due to infrequent field visits through the covid 19 lockdowns despite these limitations medium and low flows were consistent with our rating curve figs s5 runoff declined steadily as the system entered the dry season across the three dry seasons the rate and shape of runoff recessions were similar with average minimum flow of 0 21 mm d 2 0 l s 3 1 5 annual water balances annual precipitation adjusted for orographic effects by using the mean elevation of the site 3 subbasin ranged from 754 to 867 mm over wy 2019 2021 table 4 annual precipitation values are within one standard deviation of the long term 1981 2017 average annual gridded precipitation 848 156 mm aybar et al 2020 annual runoff varied from 439 to 643 mm corresponding to 57 74 of annual precipitation with eta accounting for 34 35 dry season runoff amounted to 12 of annual runoff on average the difference between annual inputs and outputs δs in table 4 combines interannual watershed storage potential drainage below the stream gauge at site 3 which we did not directly measure and measurement error in wy2020 δs was 69 mm and in wy2021 δs was 51 mm

watershed s response runoff eta storage in bofedales are used to separate the water year into three phases fill up steady state and release values are in table s8 the fill up phase began with the start of the wy here we use fill up rather than the more general wet up used above to specify the period from september 1 until bofedal i saturated during the fill up phase cumulative runoff and eta were modest cumulative precipitation which exceeded the combined fluxes of runoff and eta by greater than a factor of four primarily recharged the unsaturated zone the steady state phase began with saturation of bofedal i which closely followed the rise in moisture to field capacity in the hillslope in this phase successive precipitation events caused rapid stormflow responses and cumulative eta increased steadily due to increasing temperatures during the austral summer precipitation inputs roughly equaled the combined outputs of runoff and eta the release phase began with the onset of the dry season may 19 in wy2020 and june 8 in wy2021 although there is a near absence of precipitation during this phase cumulative runoff continues to increase as streams continue to flow bofedal i did not desaturate until an average of 41 days into the dry season table 2 baseflow throughout the release phase remained above 0 25 mm d eta accounted for the greatest total moisture loss over the release phase as upland grasses and hydrophytic vegetation sustained steady rates of transpiration leading to moisture depletion across the root zone 3 1 7 spatiotemporal patterns of runoff in the urw we measured greater runoff across all seasons coming from subbasins with higher bofedal coverage fig 5 data points are colored corresponding to the flow exceedance probability across the monitoring period at site 3 to indicate the general flow conditions in the urw the start of the dry season corresponded with the 41 5 39 3 and 44 5 exceedance flow in wys 2019 2021 respectively we performed a simple regression analysis on the percent of the subbasin covered in bofedales and the logarithm of runoff at high flows percent exceedance 30 there is a weak but significant fit r2 0 19 p 0 05 at low flows percent exceedance 70 the fit improves slightly r2 0 21 p 0 05 three sites showed consistently higher runoff falling along a trendline offset from other subbasins west 1 and 2 fig 1 if we exclude these three sites from the regression analysis we find a weak but significant fit at high flows r2 0 07 p 0 05 and a strong and significant fit at low flows r2 0 61 p 0 05 table s9 3 2

we did not observe confining layers a perched water table or groundwater under artesian pressure hydrophytic plant roots extended beyond the depth of peat into underlying clays or mineral layers to depths exceeding 1 5 m downhole nmr data from 10 borehole transects in bofedales i and ii showed similar trends in the stratigraphy of different layers with peat thickening towards the center of the bofedal and a decrease in vwc through the profile fig 6b c the signal to noise ratio was large indicating the data were of high quality fig s10 the porosity of each layer determined from measurements below the june 2019 water table showed small standard deviations across all measurements table 5 drainable porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased by approximately one order of magnitude from peat to clay and from clay to the mineral layer 3 2 2 seasonally dynamic water storage and runoff in the urw average dynamic storage in bofedales i iv varied from 360 to 540 mm table 6 the range is primarily due to differences in the thickness of the high porosity peat which thickened towards the center fig 6b c and was thickest in bofedal ii 1 75 m table s7 smaller bofedales such as i iii and iv exhibited thinner peat layers 0 50 1 0 m bofedales cover an area of 0 244 km2 across the urw by combining our surveys of four bofedales with borehole nmr measurements and groundwater monitoring we estimate bofedales store 105 000 10 000 m3 of water seasonally at the scale of the urw 2 12 km2 this volume corresponds to 49 5 mm of water which contributes to dry season runoff once the bofedales begin to drain conservatively we can compare bofedal dynamic storage to total dry season runoff which averaged 73 2 18 2 mm at site 3 and 114 9 21 4 mm at site 1 bofedal water storage accounts for 67 31 of dry season streamflow at site 3 and 43 22 of dry season streamflow at site 1 4 discussion andean communities depend on water resources emanating from the humid puna however data relating the physical structure of the humid puna including bofedales to hydrologic processes are limited here we discuss our key findings in the context of our motivating questions by first comparing seasonal patterns in water yield from the urw with the few existing studies of water resources in high elevation and seasonally dry andean landscapes we next highlight our discovery of higher runoff from subbasins with greater bofedal coverage and compare seasonally dynamic storage in bofedales with dry season runoff and downstream water needs we discuss the limitations of our analyses and present a conceptual model of the hydrologic function of bofedales in regulating water resources and sustaining perennial streamflow in the humid puna 4 1 water resources in the humid puna a comparison of catchments in high elevation and seasonally dry andean landscapes is useful to place the urw in the context of the region and to highlight similarities and differences between humid puna and more extensively studied humid páramo catchments we compare published hydrologic and topographic data from five similar high elevation grassland catchments table s10 two of the catchments are in the seasonally dry puna of perú and bolivia hua1 and tiq2 from ochoa tocachi et al 2016 and three are in the perennially humid páramo of southern ecuador pau1 from ochoa tocachi et al 2016 and zeo m4 and m5 from mosquera et al 2015 the urw elevation range 4011 4543 m a s l lies within the elevation range of the comparison catchments 3665 4840 m a s l nearly 16 of subbasin 3 is covered in bofedales which is within the reported range of the 5 catchments 5 18 no bofedal coverage estimates were given for pau1 in ochoa tocachi et al 2016 so an estimate of 8 was derived using google earth pro while ochoa tocachi et al 2016 report the bofedal coverage of hua1 to be 15 we estimated the bofedal coverage at hua1 to be closer to 5 using google earth pro the underlying geology of zeo and pau1 is

limited geological information was available for tiq2 beyond soil classification lepitsols and inceptisol as with the urw and the larger vub runoff in the five catchments is driven by precipitation inputs the urw has a slightly lower annual precipitation 803 mm compared to the other catchments which range from 871 mm tiq2 to 1358 mm pau1 the runoff ratio in the urw 0 57 0 74 was similar to runoff ratios in all catchments except for tiq2 0 29 a comparison of the flow duration curves fdc to the two puna catchments shows the urw to have a more gentle overall slope fig 7 runoff in tiq2 exceeds runoff in the urw during high flows and is much smaller at low flows tiq2 s low runoff ratio and lower baseflow may be attributable to less bofedal coverage lower average slope large interannual storage in cirque lakes and or higher rates of evapotranspiration peak flows in hua1 are higher than the urw however the slope of the fdc is large and runoff is less than in the urw at medium to low flows 40 exceedance the large slope indicates little baseflow and the flashiness of hua1 may be a result of limited upland storage due to steep headwalls of exposed bedrock runoff in the

bofedal coverage or mean runoff and the size of the subbasin second we found a stronger relationship between bofedal coverage and runoff at low flows similar to studies relating greater baseflow to thicker sedimentary deposits and more extensive wetlands in boreal catchments e g karlsen et al 2016 floriancic et al 2019 wet and dry season runoff were anomalously high at three sites in the lower part of the urw site 1 site 2 and the western subbasin mean slope throughout these three subbasins was between 23 and 25 slightly steeper than in other subbasins table s1 bofedales covered 11 5 and 14 5 of sites 1 and 3 respectively but only 7 7 of the western subbasin between site 3 and site 2 the valley morphology changes from broad and u shaped to narrow and v shaped with a steep bedrock confined channel changes in morphology from glaciated valleys with thick deposits to deeply incised stream morphology would decrease subsurface storage capacity as glacial deposits are removed to expose bedrock and might force flow to the surface resulting in greater stream runoff prancevic and kirchner 2019 gillespie and clark 2011 whiting and godsey 2016 large runoff in the western subbasin

capacity in bofedales both conducted in streamside bofedales in a narrow canyon of the estero derecho watershed in chile valois et al 2020 valois et al 2021 the chilean bofedales are 0 02 km2 smaller than bofedal iv and composed of a 0 3 m thick layer of peat and underlying fluvial deposits the authors calculated total porosity 0 34 over a depth of 10 m to estimate a total water storage of up to 3400 mm we suggest however that a more useful calculation would yield the amount of water a bofedal yields to streams if we assume the chilean bofedal has the same maximum water table depth as in the urw s bofedales 1 94 m and the drainable porosities for the 0 3 m of peat and 1 64 m of underlying deposits reported in the chilean bofedal are the same as in the urw 0 42 and 0 21 respectively the bofedal would yield a total of 438 mm of water to streams this brief analysis yields a comparable dynamic storage to the urw and suggests bofedales across the andes may be contributing large volumes of water to dry season streamflow from the time bofedales begin to drain in the middle of the dry season early july to the start of the wet season early to mid october irrigation demand in zurite is approximately 730 mm wunderlich 2021 oshun et al 2021 chacras or family owned agricultural plots are typically 0 25 1 ha 0 0025 0 01 km2 oshun et al 2021 the total dynamic storage of the urw s bofedales 105 000 m3 meets the dry season irrigation demand of 13 0 15 7 ha 0 13 0 157 km2 equivalent to the needs of 13 63 chacras bofedales which are fragile and vulnerable ecosystems e g bridgham et al 2008 and anderson et al 2021 provide important contributions to local water supply and overall water security 4 4 limitations and potential error in water balance and bofedal dynamic storage estimates 4 4 1 limitations and potential error in water balance our estimates of eta relied on the conversion of eto to eta via a crop coefficient 0 85 throughout the year in bofedales for the uplands covered in j ichu we used a conditional model which applies a crop coefficient 0 74 to convert eto to eta when conditions exceeded field capacity at 0 2 m depth and via direct measurements of moisture loss at conditions below field capacity each crop coefficient is an imperfect fit as there are no published crop coefficients for the humid puna uplands nor for bofedales with each method we report eta estimates and an error of 30 annual eta accounts for 34 35 of annual precipitation table 4 which corresponds well with estimates of pastureland eta across the vub fernandez palomino et al 2021 and to values reported in natural and wetter catchments in the páramo buytaert et al 2007 however more recent studies in the páramo report eta accounting for a much greater proportion of annual precipitation e g carrillo rojas et al 2019 ochoa sánchez et al 2019 in wy20 greater subsurface drying likely from vigorous vegetation growth following a grassland fire in late july 2019 resulted in a storage deficit of 69 mm table 4 in wy21 cumulative precipitation was larger at the time of field capacity bofedal i saturation and a rise in stream runoff above 1 mm d as greater amounts of precipitation replaced the moisture deficit across the rooting zone table 3 interannual storage was 51 mm in wy21 likely due to replenishing the deficit across the rooting zone table 4 whereas eta estimates are provided with a large range of uncertainty the well constrained rating curves and low runoff error 12 13 provide a robust estimate of water yield and corroborate the eta estimates 4 4 2 limitations and potential error in bofedal dynamic storage estimates there are two possible sources of error in the bofedal dynamic storage estimates spatial heterogeneity in bofedal soil properties and continuous water table dynamics across the entire urw we have attempted to limit the extent of this error by collecting data across transects that span four bofedales covering a combined area of 0 12 km2 50 of the urw s total bofedal area the transects show consistent patterns such as peat thickening towards the center of the bofedal fig 6 fig s11 14 furthermore the porosity values are well constrained across the borehole transects suggesting similar material properties across all bofedales and the drainable porosity of peat 0 42 47 of total porosity is within the range of peat water yield 10 80 depending on the degree of organic decomposition radforth and brawner 1977 letts et al 2000 we note that this is the first study to use nmr to quantify peatland water storage and highlights the value of this portable system in examining the porosity and water content within the humid puna fig 6 despite extreme topography and a lack of road access that required us to carry a drill rig to bofedal i we were able to drill well 102 however this terrain prevented us from drilling a well in bofedal ii limiting our water table measurements to one bofedal well 102 allowed us to measure seasonal water table fluctuations and a maximum water table depth of 1 94 m while 1 94 m is greater than reported maximum water table depths in other bofedales hribljan et al 2015 cooper et al 2019 oyague et al 2022 monge salazar et al 2022 it is similar to studies of bofedales experiencing moderate drainage planas clarke et al 2020 in the urw dry season drainage is likely driven by natural stream incision which may affect the health of cushion plants despite their long taproots observed to extend to depths approaching 2 m e g chimner et al 2019 suarez et al 2021 fritz et al 2011 although we do not have measurements of the maximum water table depth across all bofedales in the late dry season our assumption of spatial consistency in groundwater dynamics is supported with the following observations 1 the saturation of well 102 closely followed the timing of field capacity in the hillslope and roughly coincided with a transition to sustained high runoff values throughout the urw and 2 similar average depths to the water table in the wet and dry seasons were found across the bofedales table s7 these observations would be strengthened through an expanded groundwater monitoring network including wells in upland areas and through the application of a conservative tracer to identify flow paths finally while our site may provide insight into other similar puna grasslands catchments in the region additional analysis at the urw and comparable analysis at other sites including detailed information on watershed size elevation aspect and geologic and hydrogeologic parameters of subsurface substrates are needed to quantify relationships between bofedal size and dynamic water storage at the regional scale 4 5 conceptual model of bofedal hydrology bofedales contribute to catchment wide water storage and sustain baseflow through three mechanisms fig 8 first bofedales form in low gradient glacially carved landscapes upland bofedales form in cirques in which lakes or ponds become peat forming through a process of terrestrialization bofedales are thus located in interior basins that in the urw are 4 12 times greater than the bofedal itself thus bofedales intercept large volumes of groundwater which leads to seasonal saturation second layers of high porosity peat with high drainable porosity form a natural sponge to seasonally store tremendous volumes of water third the combined effects of a low water table gradient and low hydraulic conductivities in underlying clay and mineral layers result in the slow release of water from bofedales to streams although our study is the first to quantify the hydrology of bofedales in the context of water resources in the humid puna previous studies have shown water flowing through wetlands to have longer mean transit times e g lyon et al 2010 roa garcía and weiler 2010 buytaert et al 2011 lane et al 2020 lazo et al 2019 and argued the presence of wetlands increases or dominates the existing catchment wide water storage e g lane et al 2020 the impact of bofedal groundwater dynamics on streamflow is best illustrated through the three phases fill up steady state and release in the fill up phase precipitation recharges the unsaturated zone to field capacity as the water table in bofedales continues to fall to nearly 2 m below the ground surface after an average of 138 mm of precipitation field capacity is reached in the upland rooting zone causing drainage and groundwater inflow to the bofedales bofedales saturate at the beginning of the steady state phase at this point seasonally dynamic water storage in the urw has approached the storage capacity and runoff rapidly increases as the catchment sheds additional precipitation we note the likelihood of saturation overland flow across bofedales during the steady state phase the end of the rainy season in may june marks the start of the release phase groundwater from hillslopes continues to move through bofedales to streams at rates sufficient to maintain saturation in the bofedales until an average of 41 days into the dry season at which point the water table begins to fall at an average rate of 14 mm day additional moisture depletion in the peat and clay below field capacity occurs due to transpiration of deeply rooted hydrophytic plants 5 conclusion the urw a 2 12 km2 humid puna catchment draining to the agrarian village of zurite yields 57 74 of annual rainfall to runoff despite a dry season lasting up to 5 months the fdc of the urw shows a gentle slope and 12 of annual runoff comes in the dry season the gentle slope of the fdc and sustained dry season streamflow are the result of large seasonally dynamic water storage at the catchment scale spatiotemporal discharge measurements throughout the urw identified greater runoff emanating from subbasins with greater bofedal coverage across all seasons three key characteristics provide large seasonally dynamic water storage and make bofedales vital sources of baseflow first bofedales are found in topographic depressions that collect water from upslope areas 4 12 times their size second high porosity peat up to 1 75 m thick seasonally stores tremendous volumes of water third a gentle water table gradient in gently sloping bofedales and the low conductivity of underlying clay and mineral layers result in the slow drainage of stored water to streams we estimate bofedal dynamic storage capacity and water yield to streams to be 49 5 mm at the scale of the urw bofedales which drain in the dry season account for 20 98 of dry season flow in the urw sufficient to meet the irrigation demands of 13 15 ha we conclude that bofedales regulate flow to sustain perennial streams in the humid puna and are thus vital to local and
