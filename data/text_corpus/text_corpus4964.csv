24820,apis mellifera plays a crucial role as pollinator of the majority of crops linked to food production and thus its presence is currently fundamental to our health and survival the composition and configuration of the landscape in which apis mellifera lives will likely determine the well being of the hives and the pollination service that their members can provide to the crops here we present a spatially explicit model that predicts the spatial distribution of visits by apis mellifera to crops by simulating daily trips of honey bees the demographical dynamic of each hive and their honey production this model goes beyond existing approaches by including 1 a flower resource affected by the feedback interaction between nectar extraction pollination blossoming and repeated visits 2 a pollinators dynamic that allows competition through short term resource depletion 3 a probabilistic approach of the foraging behavior modeling the fact that the pollinators have only partial knowledge of the resource on their surroundings and 4 the specific and systematic foraging behavior and strategies of apis mellifera at the moment of choosing foraging sites as opposed to those adopted by solitary and wild pollinators with a balance between simplicity and realism we show the importance of keeping a minimal fraction of natural habitat in an agricultural landscape we also evaluate the effects of the landscape s structure on pollination and demonstrate that there exists an optimal size of natural habitat patches that maximizes the pollination service for a fixed fraction of natural habitat keywords pollination apis mellifera competition landscape structure ecological intensification 1 introduction the intensive agricultural production systems developed during the twentieth century are facing multiple crises mostly due to the degradation of the natural ecosystems they promote grab et al 2019 newbold 2015 wilting et al 2017 one of these crises is the fast decline of the populations of pollinators and the consequent decrease in the quality of the pollination service potts 2010 vanbergen and initiative 2013 the reduction of floral diversity requested by intensive monoculture particularly endangers wild pollinators but also weakens managed species klein 2007 potts 2010 2016 vanbergen and initiative 2013 pollinators are not only essential for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems but they are also fundamental to our survival garibaldi et al 2019 potts 2016 even if recent studies demonstrate the importance of wild bees the managed bee apis mellifera holds a particularly important place in the pollination service garibaldi et al 2013 k lj et al 2018 in this context countermeasures are constantly being developed to reach a better agriculture productive sustainable and healthy for the consumer cbd foley 2011 garibaldi et al 2019 these include the structuring of landscapes to improve the ecological services provided by the biological actors of the crops growth and reproduction such as pollinators garibaldi et al 2019 the experimental approach to study the effect of landscape structure on pollination quickly reaches limits in terms of the quantity of available experimental farms and of reproducibility of experiments an approach in terms of mathematical modeling is particularly fit in such cases since it allows the fast exploration of a variety of scenarios landscape configurations found in agricultural exploitations around the world have arisen mostly from the experience of the growers and are usually designed to increase the size of the cultivated area macdonald et al 2013 the treatments and management tested on the field or in silico to improve the pollination service usually consist in the addition of semi natural habitat such as flower strips or grassy bands mostly on the margins of the crops hussler et al 2017 jnsson et al 2015 scheper et al 2015 but little is known about the global effects of the topology of the spatial arrangements of habitat in agricultural systems martin 2019 many models have been developed in order to understand the needs and implications of sustainable pollination some of them consider a homogeneous environment and two interacting populations plant and pollinator cropp and norbury 2018 khoury et al 2013 montoya et al 2019 they generally do not include the spatial dimension ignoring the effect of plants distribution in space or the distance between plants and pollinators nests nevertheless such models have provided an understanding of many characteristics of the plant pollinator interactions in terms of the impact of the presence of semi natural habitat montoya et al 2019 or the coevolutive dynamics between plant and pollinator cropp and norbury 2018 besides croft et al 2018 motivated by the growing concern on the abrupt and unexplained collapse of honeybee colonies presented a model to evaluate the impact of pesticides and the regulation of their use on the sustainability of a colony the authors concluded that the decrease of the colony size is a much better indicator of reduced ecoservice than an increased mortality of brood or foragers while the work is focused on a very detailed description of the population dynamics of the individuals within the colony with special attention on the effect of pesticides in three development stages it does not incorporate details about the interaction between the bees and the resource as a general feature these models are not suitable to study the effect of landscape configurations as the lack of a spatial dimension conceals the importance of a patterned distribution of resources where boundaries and heterogeneous distributions can play extremely relevant roles as will be discussed in the present work it is fair to mention regarding the inclusion of a spatial dimension several spatially explicit models that also incorporate seasonal aspects of plants and pollinators dynamics they are able to predict the probable distribution of the pollinators on a large scale according to the resource distribution lonsdorf et al 2009 olsson et al 2015 they can also infer the impact of some forms of management or treatments of a particular landscape on pollination hussler et al 2017 in particular the beehave family of models has addressed some questions on pollination using a spatially explicit approach becher et al 2016 2014 2018 these models addressed the impact of a great number of stressors on pollinators at different scales individuals colony population while the model we present here focuses on the effect of landscape structure on flower visit rates bumble beehave is the first model to include competition within and between hives and has shown its capacity to estimate at large scale the flower visit rates becher et al 2018 the study of this last aspect is the nucleus of another very interesting model which is the one underneath the software tool beescout becher et al 2016 the model implemented in that tool points to examine the exploratory patterns of bees considering the particular structure of the landscape it includes details about the detection capabilities of bees and propose several search strategies the aim of this work is to contribute to the simulation of realistic scenarios of colony growth and death in response to environmental and resource changes in particular the implementation of the foraging site election in these models leads to a systematic overchoosing of the most resourceful sites inside of a chosen metapatch of the grid the sites with few resources are also excluded from the options of the bumblebees even if these approximations are useful to save computation time and are reasonable at some level to compare quite different landscapes suboptimal choices due to partial knowledge of the surroundings and to communication failure between scouts and foragers have been shown to increase the dispersion of the visit and improve the pollination service okada et al 2015 our model uses parallel computation on gpus graphics processing units to avoid these approximations and propose an adjustable site election modality allowing for mistakes the scale at which our model operates is also finer 10 m against 25 m for bumble beehave allowing to explore the question of the size of patches on the pollination efficiency a comparison of our model to previous foraging models is shown in table 1 all the models cited above only consider a resource dynamic that is not affected by pollination becher et al 2016 2014 2018 hussler et al 2017 lonsdorf et al 2009 olsson et al 2015 this is the second feature present exclusively in our model a feedback of the resource in response to pollination even if in general nectar recuperation happens within a day krlevska et al 1995 a visited patch is likely to offer less resource on days following a visit because successfully pollinated flowers will stop producing pollen and nectar and also because some of the flowers can be damaged by over visitation sáez et al 2014 this has the effect of increasing the competition between hives due to a local short term resource depletion regarding the colony dynamics our model uses the previously established growth model for apis mellifera of khoury et al 2013 khoury et al 2013 combined with a novel foraging model which benefits from recent advances in parallel computation in order to infer the spatial distribution of visits to flowers from a fine resolution map of land cover compatible with a geographic information system gis we consider only managed hives of a mellifera whose well being only depends on the available resource of their surroundings we chose to model only managed hives because bee keeping is a worldwide spread practice and the results we can produce will be applicable to more landscapes in order to isolate the effects of the landscape structure we also compare the results obtained with the spatially explicit model to a similar mean field model that assumes a uniform distribution of the different types of land covers to summarize in this work we propose a step towards a theoretical foundation for agricultural landscape design studying the effects of general compositional and structural features such as the fraction of natural habitat size of patches and meshing of the patches of different crops on artificial maps in order to be able to design new fields that optimize the pollination by a mellifera we intend to assess a number of relevant questions such as what is the influence of different configurations of natural habitats and crops considering contrasting edge densities on the dynamics of the honey bee population honey production and crop flower visitation how does the number of hives as a management tool interact with the effects of the configuration of natural habitats and crops through local competition and also what is the influence of different crop blooming periods in the next section we describe the conceptual and mathematical details of our model followed by results a specific mean field model to contrast them and a final discussion 2 spatially explicit model in this section we present the spatially explicit model it is followed in the next section by a description of the mean field model to be able to discuss the agreements and differences between them later on 2 1 landscape maps and resource dynamics the maps used by the model are grids readable by gis software composed of a discrete number of habitat categories each habitat has a resource carrying capacity a daily resource renewal rate and a blooming period in this study we will consider that the carrying capacity is constant during the blooming period and equal to zero the rest of the year but a temporal distribution of the value of the carrying capacity can also be provided the resource consists of both nectar and pollen considered together in the present model time evolves in discrete steps with a time unit of one day when the resource is depleted a fraction of it disappears proportionally to the number of visits and it is renewed during the following days let k be the carrying capacity and rt the value of the resource before a number vt of visits on day t then the resource of a patch evolves as 1 r t 1 r t p v t r k r t p v t where p is the fraction of flowers which will cease to produce nectar or pollen after the visits of bees i e the success of pollination plus the damaged flowers and r is a constant renewal rate this equation reflects the decrease of the resource due to the daily visits and the recovery dynamics limited by saturation for the present study we created random maps of 3 km by 3 km with each cell measuring 10 m by 10 m this scale is fine enough to draw realistic maps relevant to the size of a mellifera foraging sites around 30 m by 30 m i e 9 cells and it is large enough to be interesting regarding their flight range such that not all hives can forage on the entire map these maps are composed of two habitats a natural one whose blooming period is all spring and summer due to the great diversity of flowers it contains and a monoculture with a 35 days blooming period we used maps with different fractions of natural habitat and of edge density number of cells of a given habitat which are at the border divided by the total number of cells of the habitat to build them we used an algorithm of nucleation in 2d kashchiev 2000 varying the number of patches of natural habitat and the number of nuclei from which they grow more nuclei mean smaller and more dispersed patches and thus a higher edge density the value of the resource is the same in the natural habitat and in the cultivated crop so that the bees do not have any preference when the flowering periods overlap this is a particular choice used as a first step in this analysis but can be easily relaxed when studying specific examples of crops and natural habitats 2 2 the hives each hive is characterized by its position on the map its population of bees and its quantity of honey when the population of a hive falls below a threshold one thousand bees the hive is considered dead and removed from the list of hives given that our main interest is the estimation of the number of visits to the crops the only seasons considered in this study are spring and summer when the crops bloom managed hives are usually well cared for during autumn and winter furgala 1975 and we did not model their dynamic during this season we only considered that at the beginning of a new foraging season approximately one third of the bees of each hive has survived the dynamic of the hive is based on the one described by khoury et al 2013 khoury et al 2013 the only difference is that while in that model the food increases proportionally to the number of foragers in our model it increases with the daily gain of the foragers gt the new equation for the food dynamic is the following 2 f t 1 f t γ a n f n w γ b n b g t with ft the quantity of food on day t γa the consumption rate of workers and foragers γb the consumption rate of broods as in khoury et al 2013 and n f w b are the number of foragers workers and broods respectively apis mellifera is faithful to their harvesting sites when they choose a site they forage on it all day sending a great number of bees sometimes until the resource of nectar is completely drained rollin and garibaldi 2019 in the model each day a hive chooses a number of foraging sites with a size of 30 m by 30 m 9 cells where it will send a fraction of foragers to harvest the daily gain of the hive is the sum of the gains that each squad of foragers could obtain from the foraged site 3 g t i 1 m b t g i t x y where m is the number of squads which can forage from a hive of size bt i e an integral fraction of the number of bees bt and g i t x y is the local gain of squad i at the foraging site centered at x y apis mellifera choose their harvesting sites at the beginning of each day relying on relevant information provided by scouts von frisch 1967 the resource at the sites and their distance from the nest in the model we implement this by choosing harvesting sites at random at the beginning of each day according to a specific distribution probability as follows the probability to choose site x y is defined as depending on rt x y which is the total resource in the 9 cells moore neighborhood centered at x y and the flight cost to reach them f d 4 p x y r t x y f d γ u v r f r t u v f d γ if d r f 0 otherwise where d is the euclidean distance from the hive to x y and rf is the range of flight of the bees the cost f d normalized to the interval 0 1 is an affine decreasing function of d with f 0 1 and f r f 0 the exponent γ represents the knowledge that the hive has of the resource on its surroundings if γ 0 the hive chooses its foraging sites uniformly at random and when γ the hive systematically chooses the site with the highest harvestable resource the precise value of this parameter is less important than the general shape of the function so there is some freedom to choose it within the boundaries of biological significance in our studies we used γ 3 which gives a realistic behavior for the scouts based on the shape of the preference function once the harvesting sites are chosen the hive sends a fraction νi of foragers to each site i also depending on resource and distance this parameter νi is a weight factor so that the more harvestable resource there is on a site more bees are sent to it 5 ν i r t x y f d chosen x y r t x y f d as a result of this election process several hives can choose the same sites and thus compete for the resource note that the probability for hives to choose the same site is higher when the resource is globally low on their surroundings and thus the competition is stronger we implement this possibility of hive competition by sorting each day a random harvesting order τ for each hive sorting this order every time step averages the effect of the chosen order let r t τ x y correspond to the value of the resource after the turn of the hive which feeds at round τ the actual harvestable resource for the next hive at the site is the product of r t τ x y and f d let c correspond to the maximum that a forager can carry back if the distance to the nest is null if the resource is in excess the bees sent to the site harvest the maximum value they can carry during the day cf d νk nf but if the resource is lower than this value they take it all the daily local gain of hive i at site x y can then be described as follows 6 g i t x y max c f d ν i n f r t τ x y in the results we will also discuss the total number of visits which is a proxy for the pollination efficiency the number of visits to a site on one day is the sum of the visits made by all the visiting hives in turn the visits made by each of these hives is the product of the number of bees that flew to the site ntrips the average number of flowers visited in one trip n flower trip and the average number of trips made by one bee 7 v t c h o s e n s i t e s n t r i p s n f l o w e r t r i p ν i n f appropriate values are used for these parameters to compute the pollination service as will be discussed below 2 3 setting the parameters since our main interest is the impact of landscape structure on pollination all the parameters which concern the hives dynamic have been kept constant in the simulations both in the spatially explicit model and in the mean field presented below all the parameters used for the colony model have been kept from the study by khoury et al 2013 the parameters of the foraging model have been estimated from real data such as the number of chosen sites and the number of trips per bee per day and have been set within the range of observed values a summary of the parameters and their values is provided in table 2 the average number of trips per day and the number of flowers visited have been chosen as the overall daily number of trips of a hive without distinguishing pollen trip from nectar trip the maximum distance of foraging has been set to 3 km so that bees can forage on almost all the map it is known that bees can make trips farther than 3 km abou shaara 2014 but these trips cannot be seen on the map as currently implemented the average foraging distance of the bees is not a parameter of the model but a result of the foraging process and varies with the exponent γ of the preference function and with the distribution of the resource the number of visits necessary to pollinate a flower is a parameter difficult to come by as it is highly dependent on the type of flower and also depends on the scale considered in a nontrivial way it is not available in the literature for the scale considered here so we had to adjust it to observe a reasonable behavior of the resource depletion a second parameter which is not available in the literature is the size of a foraging squad nevertheless as shown in the sensitivity analysis in the supplementary material its value does not influence much the outputs of the model all the codes are written in python using the cuda module for gpu computation 3 mean field model let us now describe a mean field model of the system which assumes a uniform distribution of the different types of land covers the dynamic of the hives during autumn and winter is the same as in the spatially explicit model bees stop their foraging activities to enter in dormancy for spring and summer the mean field equations for the number of bees in each hive and for the quantity of honey stored in the hive are also the same as in the spatially explicit model from khoury et al 2013 however the equation for the daily gain gt differs from eq 3 as now it is proportional to the number of foragers and to the available resource within the flight range of the hive but has no dependence on the spatial distribution of the resource in the following we discuss its dynamic in more detail as in the spatially explicit model we consider that the hives are surrounded by two types of habitats one is a monoculture relying on pollination while the other is a natural habitat with greater flower diversity such as a forest or even a semi natural habitat the monoculture has a determined blooming period whereas the natural habitat is flowering during all spring and summer we assume that during the blooming period the resource is in excess and call r max the maximum that a hive can harvest in a day out of the blooming period r b a s r max represents the basal resource available in the natural habitat during all spring and summer when the fraction of natural habitat is small a small increment of its value induces a proportional increase of the harvest but when this fraction is large the gain does not increase as much with the addition of natural habitat because it is limited by the foraging capacity of the bees let us say that x represents the fraction of natural habitat within the flight range of the hive and ks is the saturation constant of the harvest the gain is 8 g t n f r m a x during the crop blooming period n f r b a s otherwise where 9 r b a s r m a x x 1 k s x k s the number of visits from the hive to the crop each day is proportional to the number of foragers and to the fraction of monoculture 10 v t n f 1 x where 1 x represents the fraction of crop within the flight range of the hive 4 results let us first explore the effect of competition on the pollination service in previous models the absence of competition produces a linear dependence of visits on the number of hives for a given map hussler et al 2017 lonsdorf et al 2009 olsson et al 2015 in our model the competition induces a saturation of the number of visits and even a decrease of the visits due to competition induced hive mortality we explore how the carrying capacity of the resource and its renewal rate affects this dependence and thus the pollination efficiency regarding the number of hives placed in a crop on two maps see fig 1 we can see that when the resource is in excess and the renewal rate is high the number of visits is indeed proportional to the number of hives when the resource is low we can observe a saturation of the number of visits due to smaller hives or even because some of the hives did not get through winter with this analysis we are able to estimate for each map an optimal number of hives for a given carrying capacity and renewal rate of the resources we can see that the optimal number of hives increases with the amount of natural habitat the carrying capacity and the renewal rate of the resource but these effects are nonlinear and thus harder to predict in fig 2 we can see that the renewal rate of the resource does affect the number of visits only if it is really low which can happen at the end of the blooming period for instance we can conclude that most of the competition occurs within a day the corresponding plots for honey production and number of bees can be found in the supplementary material and they show a similar response we also explored the effect of the exponent γ of the site election function eq 4 on the mean foraging distance of bees and the mean gain of nectar and pollen per site the results are shown in fig 3 we can see that the exponent performs as expected increasing the foraging efficiency of the hives and reducing the foraging distance to quantify the effect of the amount of natural habitat we performed extensive simulations monitoring the foraging activity of the bees on one thousand random maps during 4 years for each map we placed 100 nests at random on the borders of the natural habitat which is the usual practice for managed hives due to runtime constraints each map was simulated once the number of maps was chosen so that the effect of the stochasticity in the heterogeneity of the landscape does not affect significantly the average results the mean anual number of visits to the crop is shown in fig 4 for three possible blooming periods during the season the corresponding contour plots for honey production and number of bees can be found in the supplementary material the number of visits to the crop reaches a maximum darkest green in the plots that remains stable for all the blooming periods only its value increases when we go later in the season we can also see that there is an additional dependence on the edge density of the natural habitat with a maximum between 0 2 and 0 4 a low edge density means that the natural habitat and the crop are well segregated making some sites at the center of the crop unreachable for the bees on the other hand a large edge density means that the natural habitat and the crop are well mixed diluting the resource of the natural habitat out of the blooming period for the number of visits to be maximal the patches of natural habitat can not be too dispersed but cannot be extremely segregated either results of the mean field model as mentioned before a mean field model is suitable to estimate the influence of the fraction of natural habitat on the pollination service by a mellifera without considering the effect of the distribution and shape adopted by this fraction here we present the corresponding results we made simulations for different values of the fraction of natural habitat and measured the number of visits of a hive during a 4 years period the results are shown in fig 5 we can see that the production of honey increases with the fraction of natural habitat saturating for large values of it we can also see that the honey production barely depends on the blooming period of the monoculture the number of visits instead strongly depends on the blooming period it has a maximum for a fraction of natural habitat which ranges from 11 6 for an early blooming to 28 1 for a late one the numbers of visits on late blooming crops are larger because the honey bee population is also larger during this time of the year 5 discussion the spatially explicit model presented in this work provides a valuable insight about the impact of the landscape structure on the pollination service we have seen that a mean field approach accurately predicts the impact of the fraction of natural habitat on the number of visits nevertheless it fails to explain much of the richness of the possible outcomes since the disposition of the natural habitat patches and the competition between hives showed to have an influence on the pollination service even if the existence of an optimal fraction of natural habitat to maximize the number of visits is quite predictable with simpler mean field models or good sense the value it takes in function of the configuration of the landscape or the growth of hives remains quite non trivial it is remarkable that some published experimental results suggest a maximum of pollination around the same values of edge density and fraction of natural habitat as the ones found by means of our model with default parameters 20 of semi natural habitat for an edge density between 0 3 and 0 4 martin 2019 moreover this is as far as we know the only model which can effectively address the effect of the size of patches on the number of visits considering a cell size smaller than the size of foraging sites allowing to find the explicit dependence on patch density we could infer from extensive computations how this optimum varies with forager mortality or flight range of the bees for instance the model also showed that the moment of the flowering period does not influence much the optimal composition or configuration of the agricultural landscape for pollination our model does not allow to predict an absolutely trustworthy number of visits indeed several parameters such as the number of trips per day and the number of flowers visited per travel which have been considered constant are in fact highly variable depending on parameters we chose not to investigate in this first study weather subspecies of bees or type of crop for instance but taking into account that these parameters vary evenly in every map we can consider that the model is suitable to compare the number of visits between maps specific implementations for real world applications are under way and will be the subject of further work the partial knowledge and the visibility of bees is hard to model in simple mathematical terms that is why the site election modality of this foraging model even if it appears less biased than in bumble beehave remains an approximation it clearly does not replace approaches based on individual decision making like the beescout to understand the foraging behavior of bees but for the moment the computation time required to apply the decision making and field exploration to as much individuals as we have in a 3 km by 3 km map remains too high and our function remains a good approximation as it is shown in fig 3 the exponent γ can easily be deduced from the mean daily gain of foragers and the mean flight distance of the bees and allows the user to avoid a quite unrealistic systematic choice of the most resourceful patch leading to an overestimated competition between foragers for a single patch our results apply to hives which are managed at low cost without intervention during spring and summer in some places with a particular lack of natural habitat offering flower diversity agreements are made between farmers and beekeepers in order to keep alive enough hives for pollination purposes goodwin 2012 they can be moved across the fields through the seasons and regularly supplied with syrup if needed a good beekeeper can effectively erase the effect of landscape structure but at a great cost in time and money in our analysis we have presented the total number of visits over the map as one of the important outputs which is different from the economically more relevant fruit production it is known that generally around ten visits per flower are enough for the fecundation to occur and that more visits not only do not improve production but can even damage the pistil and reduce fecundation probability rollin and garibaldi 2019 sáez et al 2014 we have also calculated production from the local number of visits each day but because hives have identical foraging behavior fruit production and number of visits are similar consequently we did not find it useful to show these results here however we can say that the slight differences observed between visits and production only occur when the competition is strong and the flowers are overvisited these differences are likely to increase for a larger number of hives a detailed analysis will also be presented elsewhere it is important to rise a word of caution about our results concerning the impact of the fraction of natural habitat on production what we demonstrated is that there is an optimal fraction of natural habitat needed in order to maintain a sufficient population of a mellifera to pollinate the field but it does not mean that increasing the fraction of natural habitat in an agricultural landscape will necessarily diminish the production indeed a natural habitat such as a forest not only serves as a nectar supply for a mellifera all over spring and summer but also provides several other ecological services e g as a wind breaker air cooler furnishing water retention and shelter for wild pollinators de marco and coelho 2004 etc the minimal fraction of natural habitat which begins to damage the pollination service by a mellifera is likely to be lower than the one that will damage the actual yield of crop it is generally acknowledged that while a mellifera is the most used pollinator of crops they are not the most efficient ones garibaldi et al 2013 rollin and garibaldi 2019 a model of pollination by wild bees using the same resource maps has already been developed by us and will be used to characterize the effects of the landscape structure on the pollination by native pollinators on artificial and real landscapes as well as the impact of mixing native and managed bees on pollination the goal reached by this work is a characterization of the effect of some structural features of landscapes on the pollination service the model has been developed to analyze the pollination service in real gis maps with a larger number of land covers and it is also able to predict the impact of slight changes in real landscape composition and configuration on the pollination service it will be used in a subsequent study to predict the pollination service on different real agricultural landscapes we hope that it can become a useful tool for farmers beekeepers and policy makers in order to understand the impact of the composition and configuration of the agricultural landscape on the pollination service by the honey bee help them to design their farms and contribute to a sustainable use of the environment credit authorship contribution statement julien joseph methodology software

24820,apis mellifera plays a crucial role as pollinator of the majority of crops linked to food production and thus its presence is currently fundamental to our health and survival the composition and configuration of the landscape in which apis mellifera lives will likely determine the well being of the hives and the pollination service that their members can provide to the crops here we present a spatially explicit model that predicts the spatial distribution of visits by apis mellifera to crops by simulating daily trips of honey bees the demographical dynamic of each hive and their honey production this model goes beyond existing approaches by including 1 a flower resource affected by the feedback interaction between nectar extraction pollination blossoming and repeated visits 2 a pollinators dynamic that allows competition through short term resource depletion 3 a probabilistic approach of the foraging behavior modeling the fact that the pollinators have only partial knowledge of the resource on their surroundings and 4 the specific and systematic foraging behavior and strategies of apis mellifera at the moment of choosing foraging sites as opposed to those adopted by solitary and wild pollinators with a balance between simplicity and realism we show the importance of keeping a minimal fraction of natural habitat in an agricultural landscape we also evaluate the effects of the landscape s structure on pollination and demonstrate that there exists an optimal size of natural habitat patches that maximizes the pollination service for a fixed fraction of natural habitat keywords pollination apis mellifera competition landscape structure ecological intensification 1 introduction the intensive agricultural production systems developed during the twentieth century are facing multiple crises mostly due to the degradation of the natural ecosystems they promote grab et al 2019 newbold 2015 wilting et al 2017 one of these crises is the fast decline of the populations of pollinators and the consequent decrease in the quality of the pollination service potts 2010 vanbergen and initiative 2013 the reduction of floral diversity requested by intensive monoculture particularly endangers wild pollinators but also weakens managed species klein 2007 potts 2010 2016 vanbergen and initiative 2013 pollinators are not only essential for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems but they are also fundamental to our survival garibaldi et al 2019 potts 2016 even if recent studies demonstrate the importance of wild bees the managed bee apis mellifera holds a particularly important place in the pollination service garibaldi et al 2013 k lj et al 2018 in this context countermeasures are constantly being developed to reach a better agriculture productive sustainable and healthy for the consumer cbd foley 2011 garibaldi et al 2019 these include the structuring of landscapes to improve the ecological services provided by the biological actors of the crops growth and reproduction such as pollinators garibaldi et al 2019 the experimental approach to study the effect of landscape structure on pollination quickly reaches limits in terms of the quantity of available experimental farms and of reproducibility of experiments an approach in terms of mathematical modeling is particularly fit in such cases since it allows the fast exploration of a variety of scenarios landscape configurations found in agricultural exploitations around the world have arisen mostly from the experience of the growers and are usually designed to increase the size of the cultivated area macdonald et al 2013 the treatments and management tested on the field or in silico to improve the pollination service usually consist in the addition of semi natural habitat such as flower strips or grassy bands mostly on the margins of the crops hussler et al 2017 jnsson et al 2015 scheper et al 2015 but little is known about the global effects of the topology of the spatial arrangements of habitat in agricultural systems martin 2019 many models have been developed in order to understand the needs and implications of sustainable pollination some of them consider a homogeneous environment and two interacting populations plant and pollinator cropp and norbury 2018 khoury et al 2013 montoya et al 2019 they generally do not include the spatial dimension ignoring the effect of plants distribution in space or the distance between plants and pollinators nests nevertheless such models have provided an understanding of many characteristics of the plant pollinator interactions in terms of the impact of the presence of semi natural habitat montoya et al 2019 or the coevolutive dynamics between plant and pollinator cropp and norbury 2018 besides croft et al 2018 motivated by the growing concern on the abrupt and unexplained collapse of honeybee colonies presented a model to evaluate the impact of pesticides and the regulation of their use on the sustainability of a colony the authors concluded that the decrease of the colony size is a much better indicator of reduced ecoservice than an increased mortality of brood or foragers while the work is focused on a very detailed description of the population dynamics of the individuals within the colony with special attention on the effect of pesticides in three development stages it does not incorporate details about the interaction between the bees and the resource as a general feature these models are not suitable to study the effect of landscape configurations as the lack of a spatial dimension conceals the importance of a patterned distribution of resources where boundaries and heterogeneous distributions can play extremely relevant roles as will be discussed in the present work it is fair to mention regarding the inclusion of a spatial dimension several spatially explicit models that also incorporate seasonal aspects of plants and pollinators dynamics they are able to predict the probable distribution of the pollinators on a large scale according to the resource distribution lonsdorf et al 2009 olsson et al 2015 they can also infer the impact of some forms of management or treatments of a particular landscape on pollination hussler et al 2017 in particular the beehave family of models has addressed some questions on pollination using a spatially explicit approach becher et al 2016 2014 2018 these models addressed the impact of a great number of stressors on pollinators at different scales individuals colony population while the model we present here focuses on the effect of landscape structure on flower visit rates bumble beehave is the first model to include competition within and between hives and has shown its capacity to estimate at large scale the flower visit rates becher et al 2018 the study of this last aspect is the nucleus of another very interesting model which is the one underneath the software tool beescout becher et al 2016 the model implemented in that tool points to examine the exploratory patterns of bees considering the particular structure of the landscape it includes details about the detection capabilities of bees and propose several search strategies the aim of this work is to contribute to the simulation of realistic scenarios of colony growth and death in response to environmental and resource changes in particular the implementation of the foraging site election in these models leads to a systematic overchoosing of the most resourceful sites inside of a chosen metapatch of the grid the sites with few resources are also excluded from the options of the bumblebees even if these approximations are useful to save computation time and are reasonable at some level to compare quite different landscapes suboptimal choices due to partial knowledge of the surroundings and to communication failure between scouts and foragers have been shown to increase the dispersion of the visit and improve the pollination service okada et al 2015 our model uses parallel computation on gpus graphics processing units to avoid these approximations and propose an adjustable site election modality allowing for mistakes the scale at which our model operates is also finer 10 m against 25 m for bumble beehave allowing to explore the question of the size of patches on the pollination efficiency a comparison of our model to previous foraging models is shown in table 1 all the models cited above only consider a resource dynamic that is not affected by pollination becher et al 2016 2014 2018 hussler et al 2017 lonsdorf et al 2009 olsson et al 2015 this is the second feature present exclusively in our model a feedback of the resource in response to pollination even if in general nectar recuperation happens within a day krlevska et al 1995 a visited patch is likely to offer less resource on days following a visit because successfully pollinated flowers will stop producing pollen and nectar and also because some of the flowers can be damaged by over visitation sáez et al 2014 this has the effect of increasing the competition between hives due to a local short term resource depletion regarding the colony dynamics our model uses the previously established growth model for apis mellifera of khoury et al 2013 khoury et al 2013 combined with a novel foraging model which benefits from recent advances in parallel computation in order to infer the spatial distribution of visits to flowers from a fine resolution map of land cover compatible with a geographic information system gis we consider only managed hives of a mellifera whose well being only depends on the available resource of their surroundings we chose to model only managed hives because bee keeping is a worldwide spread practice and the results we can produce will be applicable to more landscapes in order to isolate the effects of the landscape structure we also compare the results obtained with the spatially explicit model to a similar mean field model that assumes a uniform distribution of the different types of land covers to summarize in this work we propose a step towards a theoretical foundation for agricultural landscape design studying the effects of general compositional and structural features such as the fraction of natural habitat size of patches and meshing of the patches of different crops on artificial maps in order to be able to design new fields that optimize the pollination by a mellifera we intend to assess a number of relevant questions such as what is the influence of different configurations of natural habitats and crops considering contrasting edge densities on the dynamics of the honey bee population honey production and crop flower visitation how does the number of hives as a management tool interact with the effects of the configuration of natural habitats and crops through local competition and also what is the influence of different crop blooming periods in the next section we describe the conceptual and mathematical details of our model followed by results a specific mean field model to contrast them and a final discussion 2 spatially explicit model in this section we present the spatially explicit model it is followed in the next section by a description of the mean field model to be able to discuss the agreements and differences between them later on 2 1 landscape maps and resource dynamics the maps used by the model are grids readable by gis software composed of a discrete number of habitat categories each habitat has a resource carrying capacity a daily resource renewal rate and a blooming period in this study we will consider that the carrying capacity is constant during the blooming period and equal to zero the rest of the year but a temporal distribution of the value of the carrying capacity can also be provided the resource consists of both nectar and pollen considered together in the present model time evolves in discrete steps with a time unit of one day when the resource is depleted a fraction of it disappears proportionally to the number of visits and it is renewed during the following days let k be the carrying capacity and rt the value of the resource before a number vt of visits on day t then the resource of a patch evolves as 1 r t 1 r t p v t r k r t p v t where p is the fraction of flowers which will cease to produce nectar or pollen after the visits of bees i e the success of pollination plus the damaged flowers and r is a constant renewal rate this equation reflects the decrease of the resource due to the daily visits and the recovery dynamics limited by saturation for the present study we created random maps of 3 km by 3 km with each cell measuring 10 m by 10 m this scale is fine enough to draw realistic maps relevant to the size of a mellifera foraging sites around 30 m by 30 m i e 9 cells and it is large enough to be interesting regarding their flight range such that not all hives can forage on the entire map these maps are composed of two habitats a natural one whose blooming period is all spring and summer due to the great diversity of flowers it contains and a monoculture with a 35 days blooming period we used maps with different fractions of natural habitat and of edge density number of cells of a given habitat which are at the border divided by the total number of cells of the habitat to build them we used an algorithm of nucleation in 2d kashchiev 2000 varying the number of patches of natural habitat and the number of nuclei from which they grow more nuclei mean smaller and more dispersed patches and thus a higher edge density the value of the resource is the same in the natural habitat and in the cultivated crop so that the bees do not have any preference when the flowering periods overlap this is a particular choice used as a first step in this analysis but can be easily relaxed when studying specific examples of crops and natural habitats 2 2 the hives each hive is characterized by its position on the map its population of bees and its quantity of honey when the population of a hive falls below a threshold one thousand bees the hive is considered dead and removed from the list of hives given that our main interest is the estimation of the number of visits to the crops the only seasons considered in this study are spring and summer when the crops bloom managed hives are usually well cared for during autumn and winter furgala 1975 and we did not model their dynamic during this season we only considered that at the beginning of a new foraging season approximately one third of the bees of each hive has survived the dynamic of the hive is based on the one described by khoury et al 2013 khoury et al 2013 the only difference is that while in that model the food increases proportionally to the number of foragers in our model it increases with the daily gain of the foragers gt the new equation for the food dynamic is the following 2 f t 1 f t γ a n f n w γ b n b g t with ft the quantity of food on day t γa the consumption rate of workers and foragers γb the consumption rate of broods as in khoury et al 2013 and n f w b are the number of foragers workers and broods respectively apis mellifera is faithful to their harvesting sites when they choose a site they forage on it all day sending a great number of bees sometimes until the resource of nectar is completely drained rollin and garibaldi 2019 in the model each day a hive chooses a number of foraging sites with a size of 30 m by 30 m 9 cells where it will send a fraction of foragers to harvest the daily gain of the hive is the sum of the gains that each squad of foragers could obtain from the foraged site 3 g t i 1 m b t g i t x y where m is the number of squads which can forage from a hive of size bt i e an integral fraction of the number of bees bt and g i t x y is the local gain of squad i at the foraging site centered at x y apis mellifera choose their harvesting sites at the beginning of each day relying on relevant information provided by scouts von frisch 1967 the resource at the sites and their distance from the nest in the model we implement this by choosing harvesting sites at random at the beginning of each day according to a specific distribution probability as follows the probability to choose site x y is defined as depending on rt x y which is the total resource in the 9 cells moore neighborhood centered at x y and the flight cost to reach them f d 4 p x y r t x y f d γ u v r f r t u v f d γ if d r f 0 otherwise where d is the euclidean distance from the hive to x y and rf is the range of flight of the bees the cost f d normalized to the interval 0 1 is an affine decreasing function of d with f 0 1 and f r f 0 the exponent γ represents the knowledge that the hive has of the resource on its surroundings if γ 0 the hive chooses its foraging sites uniformly at random and when γ the hive systematically chooses the site with the highest harvestable resource the precise value of this parameter is less important than the general shape of the function so there is some freedom to choose it within the boundaries of biological significance in our studies we used γ 3 which gives a realistic behavior for the scouts based on the shape of the preference function once the harvesting sites are chosen the hive sends a fraction νi of foragers to each site i also depending on resource and distance this parameter νi is a weight factor so that the more harvestable resource there is on a site more bees are sent to it 5 ν i r t x y f d chosen x y r t x y f d as a result of this election process several hives can choose the same sites and thus compete for the resource note that the probability for hives to choose the same site is higher when the resource is globally low on their surroundings and thus the competition is stronger we implement this possibility of hive competition by sorting each day a random harvesting order τ for each hive sorting this order every time step averages the effect of the chosen order let r t τ x y correspond to the value of the resource after the turn of the hive which feeds at round τ the actual harvestable resource for the next hive at the site is the product of r t τ x y and f d let c correspond to the maximum that a forager can carry back if the distance to the nest is null if the resource is in excess the bees sent to the site harvest the maximum value they can carry during the day cf d νk nf but if the resource is lower than this value they take it all the daily local gain of hive i at site x y can then be described as follows 6 g i t x y max c f d ν i n f r t τ x y in the results we will also discuss the total number of visits which is a proxy for the pollination efficiency the number of visits to a site on one day is the sum of the visits made by all the visiting hives in turn the visits made by each of these hives is the product of the number of bees that flew to the site ntrips the average number of flowers visited in one trip n flower trip and the average number of trips made by one bee 7 v t c h o s e n s i t e s n t r i p s n f l o w e r t r i p ν i n f appropriate values are used for these parameters to compute the pollination service as will be discussed below 2 3 setting the parameters since our main interest is the impact of landscape structure on pollination all the parameters which concern the hives dynamic have been kept constant in the simulations both in the spatially explicit model and in the mean field presented below all the parameters used for the colony model have been kept from the study by khoury et al 2013 the parameters of the foraging model have been estimated from real data such as the number of chosen sites and the number of trips per bee per day and have been set within the range of observed values a summary of the parameters and their values is provided in table 2 the average number of trips per day and the number of flowers visited have been chosen as the overall daily number of trips of a hive without distinguishing pollen trip from nectar trip the maximum distance of foraging has been set to 3 km so that bees can forage on almost all the map it is known that bees can make trips farther than 3 km abou shaara 2014 but these trips cannot be seen on the map as currently implemented the average foraging distance of the bees is not a parameter of the model but a result of the foraging process and varies with the exponent γ of the preference function and with the distribution of the resource the number of visits necessary to pollinate a flower is a parameter difficult to come by as it is highly dependent on the type of flower and also depends on the scale considered in a nontrivial way it is not available in the literature for the scale considered here so we had to adjust it to observe a reasonable behavior of the resource depletion a second parameter which is not available in the literature is the size of a foraging squad nevertheless as shown in the sensitivity analysis in the supplementary material its value does not influence much the outputs of the model all the codes are written in python using the cuda module for gpu computation 3 mean field model let us now describe a mean field model of the system which assumes a uniform distribution of the different types of land covers the dynamic of the hives during autumn and winter is the same as in the spatially explicit model bees stop their foraging activities to enter in dormancy for spring and summer the mean field equations for the number of bees in each hive and for the quantity of honey stored in the hive are also the same as in the spatially explicit model from khoury et al 2013 however the equation for the daily gain gt differs from eq 3 as now it is proportional to the number of foragers and to the available resource within the flight range of the hive but has no dependence on the spatial distribution of the resource in the following we discuss its dynamic in more detail as in the spatially explicit model we consider that the hives are surrounded by two types of habitats one is a monoculture relying on pollination while the other is a natural habitat with greater flower diversity such as a forest or even a semi natural habitat the monoculture has a determined blooming period whereas the natural habitat is flowering during all spring and summer we assume that during the blooming period the resource is in excess and call r max the maximum that a hive can harvest in a day out of the blooming period r b a s r max represents the basal resource available in the natural habitat during all spring and summer when the fraction of natural habitat is small a small increment of its value induces a proportional increase of the harvest but when this fraction is large the gain does not increase as much with the addition of natural habitat because it is limited by the foraging capacity of the bees let us say that x represents the fraction of natural habitat within the flight range of the hive and ks is the saturation constant of the harvest the gain is 8 g t n f r m a x during the crop blooming period n f r b a s otherwise where 9 r b a s r m a x x 1 k s x k s the number of visits from the hive to the crop each day is proportional to the number of foragers and to the fraction of monoculture 10 v t n f 1 x where 1 x represents the fraction of crop within the flight range of the hive 4 results let us first explore the effect of competition on the pollination service in previous models the absence of competition produces a linear dependence of visits on the number of hives for a given map hussler et al 2017 lonsdorf et al 2009 olsson et al 2015 in our model the competition induces a saturation of the number of visits and even a decrease of the visits due to competition induced hive mortality we explore how the carrying capacity of the resource and its renewal rate affects this dependence and thus the pollination efficiency regarding the number of hives placed in a crop on two maps see fig 1 we can see that when the resource is in excess and the renewal rate is high the number of visits is indeed proportional to the number of hives when the resource is low we can observe a saturation of the number of visits due to smaller hives or even because some of the hives did not get through winter with this analysis we are able to estimate for each map an optimal number of hives for a given carrying capacity and renewal rate of the resources we can see that the optimal number of hives increases with the amount of natural habitat the carrying capacity and the renewal rate of the resource but these effects are nonlinear and thus harder to predict in fig 2 we can see that the renewal rate of the resource does affect the number of visits only if it is really low which can happen at the end of the blooming period for instance we can conclude that most of the competition occurs within a day the corresponding plots for honey production and number of bees can be found in the supplementary material and they show a similar response we also explored the effect of the exponent γ of the site election function eq 4 on the mean foraging distance of bees and the mean gain of nectar and pollen per site the results are shown in fig 3 we can see that the exponent performs as expected increasing the foraging efficiency of the hives and reducing the foraging distance to quantify the effect of the amount of natural habitat we performed extensive simulations monitoring the foraging activity of the bees on one thousand random maps during 4 years for each map we placed 100 nests at random on the borders of the natural habitat which is the usual practice for managed hives due to runtime constraints each map was simulated once the number of maps was chosen so that the effect of the stochasticity in the heterogeneity of the landscape does not affect significantly the average results the mean anual number of visits to the crop is shown in fig 4 for three possible blooming periods during the season the corresponding contour plots for honey production and number of bees can be found in the supplementary material the number of visits to the crop reaches a maximum darkest green in the plots that remains stable for all the blooming periods only its value increases when we go later in the season we can also see that there is an additional dependence on the edge density of the natural habitat with a maximum between 0 2 and 0 4 a low edge density means that the natural habitat and the crop are well segregated making some sites at the center of the crop unreachable for the bees on the other hand a large edge density means that the natural habitat and the crop are well mixed diluting the resource of the natural habitat out of the blooming period for the number of visits to be maximal the patches of natural habitat can not be too dispersed but cannot be extremely segregated either results of the mean field model as mentioned before a mean field model is suitable to estimate the influence of the fraction of natural habitat on the pollination service by a mellifera without considering the effect of the distribution and shape adopted by this fraction here we present the corresponding results we made simulations for different values of the fraction of natural habitat and measured the number of visits of a hive during a 4 years period the results are shown in fig 5 we can see that the production of honey increases with the fraction of natural habitat saturating for large values of it we can also see that the honey production barely depends on the blooming period of the monoculture the number of visits instead strongly depends on the blooming period it has a maximum for a fraction of natural habitat which ranges from 11 6 for an early blooming to 28 1 for a late one the numbers of visits on late blooming crops are larger because the honey bee population is also larger during this time of the year 5 discussion the spatially explicit model presented in this work provides a valuable insight about the impact of the landscape structure on the pollination service we have seen that a mean field approach accurately predicts the impact of the fraction of natural habitat on the number of visits nevertheless it fails to explain much of the richness of the possible outcomes since the disposition of the natural habitat patches and the competition between hives showed to have an influence on the pollination service even if the existence of an optimal fraction of natural habitat to maximize the number of visits is quite predictable with simpler mean field models or good sense the value it takes in function of the configuration of the landscape or the growth of hives remains quite non trivial it is remarkable that some published experimental results suggest a maximum of pollination around the same values of edge density and fraction of natural habitat as the ones found by means of our model with default parameters 20 of semi natural habitat for an edge density between 0 3 and 0 4 martin 2019 moreover this is as far as we know the only model which can effectively address the effect of the size of patches on the number of visits considering a cell size smaller than the size of foraging sites allowing to find the explicit dependence on patch density we could infer from extensive computations how this optimum varies with forager mortality or flight range of the bees for instance the model also showed that the moment of the flowering period does not influence much the optimal composition or configuration of the agricultural landscape for pollination our model does not allow to predict an absolutely trustworthy number of visits indeed several parameters such as the number of trips per day and the number of flowers visited per travel which have been considered constant are in fact highly variable depending on parameters we chose not to investigate in this first study weather subspecies of bees or type of crop for instance but taking into account that these parameters vary evenly in every map we can consider that the model is suitable to compare the number of visits between maps specific implementations for real world applications are under way and will be the subject of further work the partial knowledge and the visibility of bees is hard to model in simple mathematical terms that is why the site election modality of this foraging model even if it appears less biased than in bumble beehave remains an approximation it clearly does not replace approaches based on individual decision making like the beescout to understand the foraging behavior of bees but for the moment the computation time required to apply the decision making and field exploration to as much individuals as we have in a 3 km by 3 km map remains too high and our function remains a good approximation as it is shown in fig 3 the exponent γ can easily be deduced from the mean daily gain of foragers and the mean flight distance of the bees and allows the user to avoid a quite unrealistic systematic choice of the most resourceful patch leading to an overestimated competition between foragers for a single patch our results apply to hives which are managed at low cost without intervention during spring and summer in some places with a particular lack of natural habitat offering flower diversity agreements are made between farmers and beekeepers in order to keep alive enough hives for pollination purposes goodwin 2012 they can be moved across the fields through the seasons and regularly supplied with syrup if needed a good beekeeper can effectively erase the effect of landscape structure but at a great cost in time and money in our analysis we have presented the total number of visits over the map as one of the important outputs which is different from the economically more relevant fruit production it is known that generally around ten visits per flower are enough for the fecundation to occur and that more visits not only do not improve production but can even damage the pistil and reduce fecundation probability rollin and garibaldi 2019 sáez et al 2014 we have also calculated production from the local number of visits each day but because hives have identical foraging behavior fruit production and number of visits are similar consequently we did not find it useful to show these results here however we can say that the slight differences observed between visits and production only occur when the competition is strong and the flowers are overvisited these differences are likely to increase for a larger number of hives a detailed analysis will also be presented elsewhere it is important to rise a word of caution about our results concerning the impact of the fraction of natural habitat on production what we demonstrated is that there is an optimal fraction of natural habitat needed in order to maintain a sufficient population of a mellifera to pollinate the field but it does not mean that increasing the fraction of natural habitat in an agricultural landscape will necessarily diminish the production indeed a natural habitat such as a forest not only serves as a nectar supply for a mellifera all over spring and summer but also provides several other ecological services e g as a wind breaker air cooler furnishing water retention and shelter for wild pollinators de marco and coelho 2004 etc the minimal fraction of natural habitat which begins to damage the pollination service by a mellifera is likely to be lower than the one that will damage the actual yield of crop it is generally acknowledged that while a mellifera is the most used pollinator of crops they are not the most efficient ones garibaldi et al 2013 rollin and garibaldi 2019 a model of pollination by wild bees using the same resource maps has already been developed by us and will be used to characterize the effects of the landscape structure on the pollination by native pollinators on artificial and real landscapes as well as the impact of mixing native and managed bees on pollination the goal reached by this work is a characterization of the effect of some structural features of landscapes on the pollination service the model has been developed to analyze the pollination service in real gis maps with a larger number of land covers and it is also able to predict the impact of slight changes in real landscape composition and configuration on the pollination service it will be used in a subsequent study to predict the pollination service on different real agricultural landscapes we hope that it can become a useful tool for farmers beekeepers and policy makers in order to understand the impact of the composition and configuration of the agricultural landscape on the pollination service by the honey bee help them to design their farms and contribute to a sustainable use of the environment credit authorship contribution statement julien joseph methodology software

24821,significant inter country transfers of ecological footprint are embodied in foreign trade previous research on these transfers mainly focused on historical characteristics of the flows based on historical data however the transfers of ecological footprints in foreign trade are dynamic and are influenced by environmental tax policies whose future impacts have seldom been considered in the present study we explored the effects of an energy tax a common form of environmental tax on these transfers we combined a multi sector dynamic computable general equilibrium model with ecological footprint assessment and analyzed the changes in the actual and virtual land uses that comprise the ecological footprint under different tax intensities we used china as a case study to analyze the energy tax s effects for the actual land use component of the ecological footprint the energy tax increased the export of ecological footprint but decreased its import and china s average net exports exports minus imports decreased by 4 56 106 gha global hectares and 10 81 106 gha from 2015 to 2020 under the low and high tax intensities respectively for the virtual land use component of the ecological footprint the energy tax simultaneously decreased export and import of this footprint component the average net import would increase by 3 84 106 gha and 8 91 106 gha for the total ecological footprint the energy tax also simultaneously reduced export and import with the net import decreasing by 1 76 106 gha and 4 45 106 gha under the low and high taxes respectively keywords ecological footprint foreign trade energy tax cge model 1 introduction human consumption has exceeded nature s biological production ability in many regions feng et al 2017 danish hassan et al 2019 leading to serious degradation of ecosystems ecological footprints which represent the area of productive land or water required to provide a given level of ecological services and absorb pollutants for a specific population and consumption situation provide an effective tool to measure the impacts of human consumption on nature wackernagel et al 1999 ahmed et al 2019 the approach has been widely used to calculate national ecological assets evaluate the appropriation of land and measure the demands humans place on the ecological environment s regenerative capacity in a region or a country white et al 2015 gao and tian 2016 moudrý et al 2018 patterson et al 2017 liao et al 2019 economic globalization has significantly strengthened the economic links among countries and has changed the ecological footprint of each country by exporting the pressure on the environment from the consumer country to an exporter country that supplies the consumer country with goods or services rudolph and figge 2017 used data from 146 countries from 1981 to 2009 to explore the ecological consequences of globalization and suggested that economic globalization drove the consumption production import and export of ecological footprint whereas social globalization interactions among social communities around the world could also increase these imports and exports but reduce their consumption and production figge et al 2017 further analyzed the impacts of globalization on ecological footprint for 171 countries and also found that economic globalization stimulated the consumption of ecological footprint ahmed et al 2019 argued that malaysia was a highly globalized country and found that from 1971 to 2014 its ecological footprint increased by more than 140 and its resources availability decreased by more than 50 resulting in an ecological deficit of 85 between supply and demand foreign trade is an essential component of economic globalization it can stimulate economic activities and promote economic development with the increase of foreign trade caused by globalization the transfers of ecological footprints in this trade also increased turner et al 2007 used input output methods to analyze the flows of ecological footprint embodied in internationally traded goods and services moran et al 2009 argued that the largest flows of ecological footprint in the world were from latin america to north america and from north america to the asia pacific region wiedmann 2009 compared a multi region input output model and product land use matrix methods to analyze the ecological footprints embodied in trade by the united kingdom in 2002 and found that the multi region approach analyzed the flows of ecological footprint more comprehensively and was therefore more suitable to estimate the ecological footprints embodied in national imports and exports liu et al 2013 analyzed the virtual ecological footprint transfers related to land use that were embodied in china s crop imports and exports and found that from 1986 to 2009 china s crop imports grew rapidly particularly after 1999 and that the net virtual trade related to land use had increased from 4 42 106 ha a net import in 1986 to 28 90 106 ha in 2009 kissinger and rees 2009 also used ecological footprints to analyze the impacts of international trade and concluded that the growing dependence of nations on international trade implies previously ignored risks to both importers and exporters kissinger and gottlieb 2012 used israel s wheat supply as a case study to compare the effectiveness of four ecological footprint calculation approaches for analyses of foreign trade i e the global hectare approach domestic versus international approach place oriented approach and place oriented global hectares approach and suggested that the four approaches should be integrated to generate a comprehensive sustainability indicator for managing the resource supply the previous research effectively explored the flows of ecological footprint embodied in foreign trade however it mainly focused on an analysis of the historical characteristics of these flows based on historical data and did not account for the dynamic changes in foreign trade and the effects of environmental tax policies that were designed to minimize these flows prediction of the future ecological footprints embodied in trade provides important support for governments that must develop more effective environmental policies energy taxes are one important environmental tax policy that deserves more attention sancho

major driving force for china s economic growth and development chen et al 2019 however during foreign trade the ecological resources that are used to produce commodities outside china are consumed in china thereby transferring pressure on the environment between countries tian et al 2018 the expansion of china s foreign trade has also changed the consumption of ecological resources zhou and bu 2018 leading to significant impacts on china s potential to achieve sustainable development li et al 2018 zhao and lin 2020 to reveal the impacts of an energy tax on the ecological footprints embodied in foreign trade we performed a case study of china that combined a multi sector dynamic computable general equilibrium cge model with ecological footprint calculations we simulated the changes in the ecological footprint embodied in foreign trade and analyzed the effects of different energy tax intensities the results of our analysis will help decision makers to understand the effect of an energy tax at both a local scale i e the effects on energy conservation and pollutant emission within a country and an international scale i e the effects on the inter country flows of ecological footprint and the potential ecological impacts outside the consumer country 2 methods in this research we divided the biologically productive land into actual and virtual land the actual land includes the cultivated land grassland forest building land and bodies of water that provide ecological services wackernagel and yount 1998 these categories of land represent the actual land area occupied by human production activities the consumption of fossil fuel will cause carbon dioxide emission and the emission can be absorbed by land the land that performs this function is called virtual land but has also been called fossil energy land wackernagel et al 1999 since foreign trade does not involve built up land we did not account for built up land in this study because our focus in this study is on energy taxes we did not consider other types of virtual land e g land that absorbs wastewater in our analysis details of the sources of our data are provided in section 2 3 2 1 the cge model to simulate chinese socioeconomic conditions under an energy tax we established a cge model we used the model of löfgren et al 2002 but expanded the environmental module by adding an energy tax the model allows substitution between fuel types and between capital and energy the model has 11 economic sectors 7 non energy sectors agriculture heavy industry light industry transportation construction services water 3 fossil fuel sectors coal oil natural gas and one non fossil fuel energy sector electricity the production tree of the cge model is shown in fig 1 in the cge model s environmental module we adopted the method of zhou et al 2011 the government is the collector of the environmental tax lin and jia 2018 bovenberg and goulder 1996 the economic sectors households and enterprises are the consumers and are also the payers of the energy tax we set the energy tax as an ad valorem tax which is based on the assessed value of a good or service li and rose 1995 the energy tax is collected when the consumers use the energy in the cge model s trade module both imports and exports utilized the small country assumption athukorala and riedel 1991 that is in foreign trade the international price of commodities is not affected by china s import and export demand accordingly the free on board price of commodities in foreign currency units i e us dollars is fixed and the price of imported commodities before customs duties are collected in foreign currency units is also fixed to achieve macroeconomic closure in our analysis we treated the foreign exchange rates as an endogenous variable and fixed the balance of payment in addition the investment labor supply capital supply and labor price are exogenously assumed su et al 2019 in the recursive dynamic structure of this model we used 2015 as the baseline year and used 2015 to 2025 as the simulation period the gdp growth rate and population growth rate were based on data from the development research group of the state council of china 2005 on china s future economic development forecast considering the stages of economic development in their analysis we divided the simulation scenario into two stages 2015 2020 the annual gdp growth rate and the annual population growth rate are 7 20 and 0 73 respectively and 2021 2025 the annual gdp growth rate and the annual population growth rate are 6 50 and 0 60 respectively we hypothesized that the energy tax intensity would affect the ecological footprint we considered three tax intensity scenarios no tax a low tax and a high tax according to previous research lu et al 2010 the ad valorem tax rates were set at 50 and 125 rmb tce i e per ton coal equivalent for the low and high tax intensities respectively 2 2 ecological footprint accounting we calculated the ecological footprint embodied in foreign trade using three steps 1 we determined the commodity volume in foreign trade under the energy tax 2 we converted the commodities into the land area required to produce that volume and 3 we converted that land area into the total ecological footprint step 1 based on the cge model the import and export volumes of a product can be determined for each industry or sector here we worked at a sectoral level based on the availability of data for china the product volume must be further converted into the volume of each commodity this is because the product of an industry may involve several commodities for example the product of agriculture involves cereals beans potatoes cotton and other crops we assumed that the relative proportion of each commodity in an industry s total imports and exports remain the same as in the baseline scenario with no tax the volume of one commodity under a given tax scenario can be determined using eq 1 1 v c t i v c b i v p t v p b where vcti is the volume of commodity i under a given tax scenario vcbi is the volume of commodity i under the baseline scenario which can be found in china s national statistical yearbook vpt is the overall import or export volume of a product for one industry under a given tax scenario which is determined by the cge model and vpb is the overall import or export volume of the product for one industry under the baseline scenario with no tax which can be determined from china s national input output tables and national statistical yearbook step 2 the land included in the ecological footprint comprises both actual land and virtual land the actual land corresponds to the commodities such as the crops described in step 1 jin et al 2015 that are produced by actual land the actual land for a given commodity is determined using eq 2 2 a l i q i p i where ali is the actual land for commodity i qi is the volume of commodity i and pi is the global average production coefficient corresponding to commodity i the virtual land corresponds to the land required to absorb the carbon dioxide emitted by direct or indirect fossil fuel use wackernagel et al 1999 it is determined according to the energy carried by the commodities and the global average energy footprint for each unit of energy using eq 3 3 v l i e c i k where vli is the virtual land for commodity i eci is the energy carried by commodity i and k is the energy conversion coefficient which represents the land area required to absorb the emission from one unit of energy for energy commodities fossil fuels eci is the energy obtained from burning the fossil fuel for the non energy commodities eci is the energy consumed during the product s life cycle manufacturing transportation use and disposal step 3 the biological productivity differs among land types wackernagel and monfreda 2004 to sum these land types into an ecological footprint we accounted for the biological productivity of each land type using eq 4 4 e f i j a l i j f j i v l i r where ef is the ecological footprint ali j is the area for actual land type j j 1 2 3 4 represent the cultivated land grassland forest and water area respectively corresponding to commodity i fj is the equivalence factor for actual land j and r is the equivalence factor for virtual land 2 3 data sources we obtained the import and export data from the national statistical yearbook of china 2016 we obtained the equivalence factors global average energy footprints and classification standards from the living planet report published by the world wide fund for nature wwf 2016 for the global average production coefficients we used the annual human development report of the united nations development program undp 2015 the annual report of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2015 and previous research chen et al 2019 for the energy conversion coefficients we mainly referred to fao 2015 a social accounting matrix table can be used to describe the economic system s operation and contains the basic data used by the cge model in this study we compiled a table with 11 economic sectors based on data from 2015 the data of the social accounting matrix sam table are mainly from the input output table of 2015 the statistical yearbook of china 2016 national bureau of statistics of china 2016 the finance yearbook of china 2016 china financial yearbook editorial board 2016 and the taxation yearbook of china 2016 china taxation yearbook editorial board 2016 etc we obtained data for the demand elasticity parameters used by the cge model and substitution elasticity from bao et al 2010 and li et al 2010 3 results and discussion if a country s exports of ecological footprint are greater than the imports this represents an ecological deficit this means that the country lost more of its biologically productive land than it gained through foreign trade thereby accelerating the consumption of its ecological resources if the imports of ecological footprint are greater than the exports this represents an ecological surplus this means that the country obtains more biologically productive land through foreign trade than it loses thereby reducing the consumption of its ecological resources the balance between exports and imports i e an ecological deficit or surplus is a key point for studying the impacts of transfers of ecological footprint during foreign trade 3 1 the actual land use in the ecological footprint based on the cge model we determined the actual land use involved in the ecological footprint using three tax intensities table 1 the export of actual land use increased with increasing tax intensity for all land uses the average increases of total land use from 2015 to 2020 were 1 14 106 global hectares gha and 2 73 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities 50 and 125 rmb tce for the low and high tax intensities respectively respectively compared with the baseline scenario no tax the cultivated land contributed the largest proportion of the increase of ecological footprint exports 85 9 the average increases for cultivated land use exports were 0 98 106 gha and 2 35 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively the actual land use was mainly determined by the commodities or sectors that were not energy intensive because they and their commodities were land intensive sectors mainly agriculture the proportion of the energy use in the total inputs of land intensive sectors was only 2 in 2015 the export increase was caused mainly by the increased production volume of non energy intensive commodities the energy tax increased the energy cost leading to an adjustment of the industrial structure during this adjustment the industrial structure will gradually shift to increase the proportion of industries or sectors that consume relatively little energy this means that the production volume of these commodities will increase for example the production volume of non energy intensive commodities will increase to 6 6 109 rmb in 2015 under the low tax consequently to maintain balanced supply and demand in the domestic market the export of non energy intensive commodities will increase in contrast the energy tax exerted the opposite impact on the imports of actual land use in the ecological footprint table 2 the imports of actual land use decreased with an increasing energy tax for all land uses except grassland and water which had no associated imports the average reduction of total land use from 2015 to 2020 were 4 54 106 gha and 10 76 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively the cultivated land contributed the largest proportion to the decrease of the ecological footprint imports the average decreases of the cultivated land use imports were 3 58 106 gha and 8 47 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively the import decrease was also caused mainly by the increased domestic production volume of non energy intensive commodities to maintain a balance between supply and demand in the domestic market the import of non energy intensive commodities will decrease for the net exports exports minus imports of actual land use in the ecological footprint the energy tax s effects were similar to the effects for exports that is the net export of actual land use increased with increasing tax intensity the average increases of total land use from 2015 to 2020 were 4 56 106 gha and 10 81 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively the cultivated land use also contributed the largest proportion to the increase of the net export of ecological footprint the average increases of cultivated land use exports were 5 69 106 gha and 13 49 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities in addition table 3 shows that china is a net importer of total actual land use i e the net export is negative in all years under all tax intensities the net import of the total actual land decreased with increasing tax intensity indicating that the energy tax could help to reduce the pressure on actual land in china s trade partners table 4 shows that the magnitudes absolute values of the rates of change of actual land use were higher for the net exports than for the imports and exports but that all three rates were relatively low with no changes greater than 5 the magnitude of the change increased over time for the exports but decreased over time for the imports and net exports and was always higher under the high tax intensity indicating that economic development could increase the impacts of the energy tax 3 2 the virtual land use in the ecological footprint we determined the virtual land use in the ecological footprint using the cge model under the three tax intensities table 5 increasing the tax intensity decreased the exports and imports of virtual land use in the ecological footprint for the exports the average reduction of the virtual land use from 2015 to 2020 was 5 57 106 gha and 12 61 106 gha compared with the baseline scenario no tax under the low and high tax intensities respectively the corresponding decreases for imports were 1 73 106 gha and 3 69 106 gha in contrast to the actual land use in the ecological footprint which is mainly determined by the non energy intensive i e land intensive commodities and sectors the virtual land use in the ecological footprint was mainly determined by the energy intensive commodities and sectors such as coal heavy industry and light industry the reductions of the exports and imports mainly resulted from the increased energy cost under the tax and the decreased production of energy intensive commodities in the domestic market the energy cost and price will increase under the energy taxes but the energy price in international markets does not change due to the price changes exports will therefore decrease in addition energy is an essential input for commodity production especially for the energy intensive commodities the increased energy cost will increase the price of the energy intensive commodities and reduce the demand for these commodities in the domestic market consequently the imports also decrease in addition table 5 shows that china is a net importer of virtual land use and that the net import of virtual land use increases with increasing tax intensity in all years the average increase in the net imports compared with the baseline scenario no tax from 2015 to 2020 was 3 84 106 gha and 8 91 106 gha under the low and high taxes respectively thus the energy tax will increase the virtual land requirement for carbon dioxide absorption in china s trade partners and increase the pressure to provide land to absorb carbon dioxide emission in countries with a net export of virtual land as was the case for the actual land use in the ecological footprint the magnitudes absolute values of the change rates for the imports and net exports of virtual land use were all smaller than 5 table 6 however the change rates for the exports of virtual land were high with rates ranging from 9 to 35 under the low and high tax intensities the average export change rates from 2015 to 2020 were 11 9 and 26 9 respectively this indicates that the energy cost increase due to the taxes will significantly decrease the competitive ability of china s energy intensive commodities in the international market 3 3 the total ecological footprint we analyzed the impact of the energy taxes on the total ecological footprint which represents the sum of the actual and virtual land use table 7 and calculated the magnitude of the reductions table 8 the energy taxes reduced the exports and imports of ecological footprint the average export of ecological footprint from 2015 to 2020 decreased by 4 42 106 gha and 9 88 106 gha respectively under the low and high tax intensities the corresponding average import reductions were 6 27 106 gha and 14 45 106 gha the export reduction was much less than the import reduction however the reduction rate for exports was greater than that for imports for example the export reduction rate under the high tax intensity in 2025 was 10 4 which is much greater than the import reduction rate of 1 8 the high export reduction rate resulted from the significant reduction rate of virtual land use exports in the ecological footprint caused by the energy cost increase tables 7 and 8 also show that ra is negative for net exports thus china is a net importer of ecological footprint the net import of ecological footprint decreased with increasing energy tax intensity in all three years the average net imports of ecological footprint from 2015 to 2025 was 746 38 106 gha 744 53 106 gha and 741 80 106 gha under the baseline low tax and high tax scenarios respectively the energy tax could therefore reduce the net imports of ecological footprint with reductions compared with the baseline scenario of 1 76 106 gha and 4 45 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively our results demonstrate that the energy tax had beneficial effects by encouraging china to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emission table 7 indicates that the energy tax could reduce the ecological footprint pressure on china s trade partners by reducing china s imports of ecological footprint however the energy tax would decrease china s gdp by 0 01 and 0 05 under the low and high tax intensities respectively compared with the baseline scenario this would be offset by the increased economic development permitted by international trade however implementing an energy tax in china would reduce the net imports of commodities from china s trade partners which is a negative consequence from the perspective of global economic development table 8 also shows that the reduction of the net imports of ecological footprint increases with economic development from 2015 to 2025 the average net import reduction under the low and high tax intensities was 3 11 106 gha in 2015 3 21 106 gha in 2020 and 3 31 106 gha in 2025 respectively however the reduction rates decreased with economic development with decreases of 0 5 in 2015 0 4 in 2020 and 0 4 in 2025 compared with the baseline scenario this indicates that china s domestic economy could gradually adapt to the energy tax by adjusting the industrial structure to favor sectors that consume less energy 4 conclusions international transfers of ecological footprint are an important consequence of global trade energy taxes are a common form of environmental policy to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emission thereby decreasing the ecological footprint of economic development in the present study we established a multi sector dynamic cge model that accounted for china s industrial structure using expanded environmental and ecological footprint modules our analysis showed that implementing an energy tax can greatly affect the price and production of commodities using this cge model we analyzed the transfers of ecological footprint based on both the actual and virtual land use in china s foreign trade from 2015 to 2026 under two energy tax intensities we obtained three main conclusions l the net export change in china varies between 1 31 and 12 77 under the two tax intensities in 2017 china s exports account for 6 4 of the global exports and its imports accounts for 8 6 of the global imports wto 2019 the maximum possible influence of energy tax in china on the international trade is 1 10 which will not obviously influence the international price thus the small country assumption is reasonable in this research l for the actual land use the sum of cultivated land grassland forest and water areas the energy tax increased exports but decreased imports of ecological footprint the average net exports exports minus imports decreased by 4 56 106 gha and 10 81 106 gha from 2015 to 2020 under the low and high tax intensities respectively l for the virtual land use the land required to absorb carbon dioxide generated by the combustion of fossil fuels the energy tax decreased both exports and imports of ecological footprint the average net imports from 2015 to 2020 increased by 3 84 106 gha and 8 91 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively l for the total ecological footprint the sum of actual and virtual land use the energy tax reduced both exports and imports of ecological footprint the net import decreased by 1 76 106 gha and 4 45 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively l in this research we mainly considered the product output changes for each sector and the related import and export changes but the energy tax could also force the industry to adopt new technologies to produce the same commodity with less energy consumption the impacts of new technologies are subject to future research

24821,significant inter country transfers of ecological footprint are embodied in foreign trade previous research on these transfers mainly focused on historical characteristics of the flows based on historical data however the transfers of ecological footprints in foreign trade are dynamic and are influenced by environmental tax policies whose future impacts have seldom been considered in the present study we explored the effects of an energy tax a common form of environmental tax on these transfers we combined a multi sector dynamic computable general equilibrium model with ecological footprint assessment and analyzed the changes in the actual and virtual land uses that comprise the ecological footprint under different tax intensities we used china as a case study to analyze the energy tax s effects for the actual land use component of the ecological footprint the energy tax increased the export of ecological footprint but decreased its import and china s average net exports exports minus imports decreased by 4 56 106 gha global hectares and 10 81 106 gha from 2015 to 2020 under the low and high tax intensities respectively for the virtual land use component of the ecological footprint the energy tax simultaneously decreased export and import of this footprint component the average net import would increase by 3 84 106 gha and 8 91 106 gha for the total ecological footprint the energy tax also simultaneously reduced export and import with the net import decreasing by 1 76 106 gha and 4 45 106 gha under the low and high taxes respectively keywords ecological footprint foreign trade energy tax cge model 1 introduction human consumption has exceeded nature s biological production ability in many regions feng et al 2017 danish hassan et al 2019 leading to serious degradation of ecosystems ecological footprints which represent the area of productive land or water required to provide a given level of ecological services and absorb pollutants for a specific population and consumption situation provide an effective tool to measure the impacts of human consumption on nature wackernagel et al 1999 ahmed et al 2019 the approach has been widely used to calculate national ecological assets evaluate the appropriation of land and measure the demands humans place on the ecological environment s regenerative capacity in a region or a country white et al 2015 gao and tian 2016 moudrý et al 2018 patterson et al 2017 liao et al 2019 economic globalization has significantly strengthened the economic links among countries and has changed the ecological footprint of each country by exporting the pressure on the environment from the consumer country to an exporter country that supplies the consumer country with goods or services rudolph and figge 2017 used data from 146 countries from 1981 to 2009 to explore the ecological consequences of globalization and suggested that economic globalization drove the consumption production import and export of ecological footprint whereas social globalization interactions among social communities around the world could also increase these imports and exports but reduce their consumption and production figge et al 2017 further analyzed the impacts of globalization on ecological footprint for 171 countries and also found that economic globalization stimulated the consumption of ecological footprint ahmed et al 2019 argued that malaysia was a highly globalized country and found that from 1971 to 2014 its ecological footprint increased by more than 140 and its resources availability decreased by more than 50 resulting in an ecological deficit of 85 between supply and demand foreign trade is an essential component of economic globalization it can stimulate economic activities and promote economic development with the increase of foreign trade caused by globalization the transfers of ecological footprints in this trade also increased turner et al 2007 used input output methods to analyze the flows of ecological footprint embodied in internationally traded goods and services moran et al 2009 argued that the largest flows of ecological footprint in the world were from latin america to north america and from north america to the asia pacific region wiedmann 2009 compared a multi region input output model and product land use matrix methods to analyze the ecological footprints embodied in trade by the united kingdom in 2002 and found that the multi region approach analyzed the flows of ecological footprint more comprehensively and was therefore more suitable to estimate the ecological footprints embodied in national imports and exports liu et al 2013 analyzed the virtual ecological footprint transfers related to land use that were embodied in china s crop imports and exports and found that from 1986 to 2009 china s crop imports grew rapidly particularly after 1999 and that the net virtual trade related to land use had increased from 4 42 106 ha a net import in 1986 to 28 90 106 ha in 2009 kissinger and rees 2009 also used ecological footprints to analyze the impacts of international trade and concluded that the growing dependence of nations on international trade implies previously ignored risks to both importers and exporters kissinger and gottlieb 2012 used israel s wheat supply as a case study to compare the effectiveness of four ecological footprint calculation approaches for analyses of foreign trade i e the global hectare approach domestic versus international approach place oriented approach and place oriented global hectares approach and suggested that the four approaches should be integrated to generate a comprehensive sustainability indicator for managing the resource supply the previous research effectively explored the flows of ecological footprint embodied in foreign trade however it mainly focused on an analysis of the historical characteristics of these flows based on historical data and did not account for the dynamic changes in foreign trade and the effects of environmental tax policies that were designed to minimize these flows prediction of the future ecological footprints embodied in trade provides important support for governments that must develop more effective environmental policies energy taxes are one important environmental tax policy that deserves more attention sancho 2010 vandyck and regemorter 2014 xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 he et al 2019 they are frequently proposed to improve energy conservation and reduce carbon dioxide emission especially under international agreements such as the kyoto protocol lin and jia 2019 shmelev and speck 2018 energy taxes could affect domestic energy use domestic economic activity and foreign trade zhao et al 2018 peng et al 2019 under an energy tax the flows of ecological footprint embodied in foreign trade will also change since china joined the world trade organization in 2001 foreign trade has become a major driving force for china s economic growth and development chen et al 2019 however during foreign trade the ecological resources that are used to produce commodities outside china are consumed in china thereby transferring pressure on the environment between countries tian et al 2018 the expansion of china s foreign trade has also changed the consumption of ecological resources zhou and bu 2018 leading to significant impacts on china s potential to achieve sustainable development li et al 2018 zhao and lin 2020 to reveal the impacts of an energy tax on the ecological footprints embodied in foreign trade we performed a case study of china that combined a multi sector dynamic computable general equilibrium cge model with ecological footprint calculations we simulated the changes in the ecological footprint embodied in foreign trade and analyzed the effects of different energy tax intensities the results of our analysis will help decision makers to understand the effect of an energy tax at both a local scale i e the effects on energy conservation and pollutant emission within a country and an international scale i e the effects on the inter country flows of ecological footprint and the potential ecological impacts outside the consumer country 2 methods in this research we divided the biologically productive land into actual and virtual land the actual land includes the cultivated land grassland forest building land and bodies of water that provide ecological services wackernagel and yount 1998 these categories of land represent the actual land area occupied by human production activities the consumption of fossil fuel will cause carbon dioxide emission and the emission can be absorbed by land the land that performs this function is called virtual land but has also been called fossil energy land wackernagel et al 1999 since foreign trade does not involve built up land we did not account for built up land in this study because our focus in this study is on energy taxes we did not consider other types of virtual land e g land that absorbs wastewater in our analysis details of the sources of our data are provided in section 2 3 2 1 the cge model to simulate chinese socioeconomic conditions under an energy tax we established a cge model we used the model of löfgren et al 2002 but expanded the environmental module by adding an energy tax the model allows substitution between fuel types and between capital and energy the model has 11 economic sectors 7 non energy sectors agriculture heavy industry light industry transportation construction services water 3 fossil fuel sectors coal oil natural gas and one non fossil fuel energy sector electricity the production tree of the cge model is shown in fig 1 in the cge model s environmental module we adopted the method of zhou et al 2011 the government is the collector of the environmental tax lin and jia 2018 bovenberg and goulder 1996 the economic sectors households and enterprises are the consumers and are also the payers of the energy tax we set the energy tax as an ad valorem tax which is based on the assessed value of a good or service li and rose 1995 the energy tax is collected when the consumers use the energy in the cge model s trade module both imports and exports utilized the small country assumption athukorala and riedel 1991 that is in foreign trade the international price of commodities is not affected by china s import and export demand accordingly the free on board price of commodities in foreign currency units i e us dollars is fixed and the price of imported commodities before customs duties are collected in foreign currency units is also fixed to achieve macroeconomic closure in our analysis we treated the foreign exchange rates as an endogenous variable and fixed the balance of payment in addition the investment labor supply capital supply and labor price are exogenously assumed su et al 2019 in the recursive dynamic structure of this model we used 2015 as the baseline year and used 2015 to 2025 as the simulation period the gdp growth rate and population growth rate were based on data from the development research group of the state council of china 2005 on china s future economic development forecast considering the stages of economic development in their analysis we divided the simulation scenario into two stages 2015 2020 the annual gdp growth rate and the annual population growth rate are 7 20 and 0 73 respectively and 2021 2025 the annual gdp growth rate and the annual population growth rate are 6 50 and 0 60 respectively we hypothesized that the energy tax intensity would affect the ecological footprint we considered three tax intensity scenarios no tax a low tax and a high tax according to previous research lu et al 2010 the ad valorem tax rates were set at 50 and 125 rmb tce i e per ton coal equivalent for the low and high tax intensities respectively 2 2 ecological footprint accounting we calculated the ecological footprint embodied in foreign trade using three steps 1 we determined the commodity volume in foreign trade under the energy tax 2 we converted the commodities into the land area required to produce that volume and 3 we converted that land area into the total ecological footprint step 1 based on the cge model the import and export volumes of a product can be determined for each industry or sector here we worked at a sectoral level based on the availability of data for china the product volume must be further converted into the volume of each commodity this is because the product of an industry may involve several commodities for example the product of agriculture involves cereals beans potatoes cotton and other crops we assumed that the relative proportion of each commodity in an industry s total imports and exports remain the same as in the baseline scenario with no tax the volume of one commodity under a given tax scenario can be determined using eq 1 1 v c t i v c b i v p t v p b where vcti is the volume of commodity i under a given tax scenario vcbi is the volume of commodity i under the baseline scenario which can be found in china s national statistical yearbook vpt is the overall import or export volume of a product for one industry under a given tax scenario which is determined by the cge model and vpb is the overall import or export volume of the product for one industry under the baseline scenario with no tax which can be determined from china s national input output tables and national statistical yearbook step 2 the land included in the ecological footprint comprises both actual land and virtual land the actual land corresponds to the commodities such as the crops described in step 1 jin et al 2015 that are produced by actual land the actual land for a given commodity is determined using eq 2 2 a l i q i p i where ali is the actual land for commodity i qi is the volume of commodity i and pi is the global average production coefficient corresponding to commodity i the virtual land corresponds to the land required to absorb the carbon dioxide emitted by direct or indirect fossil fuel use wackernagel et al 1999 it is determined according to the energy carried by the commodities and the global average energy footprint for each unit of energy using eq 3 3 v l i e c i k where vli is the virtual land for commodity i eci is the energy carried by commodity i and k is the energy conversion coefficient which represents the land area required to absorb the emission from one unit of energy for energy commodities fossil fuels eci is the energy obtained from burning the fossil fuel for the non energy commodities eci is the energy consumed during the product s life cycle manufacturing transportation use and disposal step 3 the biological productivity differs among land types wackernagel and monfreda 2004 to sum these land types into an ecological footprint we accounted for the biological productivity of each land type using eq 4 4 e f i j a l i j f j i v l i r where ef is the ecological footprint ali j is the area for actual land type j j 1 2 3 4 represent the cultivated land grassland forest and water area respectively corresponding to commodity i fj is the equivalence factor for actual land j and r is the equivalence factor for virtual land 2 3 data sources we obtained the import and export data from the national statistical yearbook of china 2016 we obtained the equivalence factors global average energy footprints and classification standards from the living planet report published by the world wide fund for nature wwf 2016 for the global average production coefficients we used the annual human development report of the united nations development program undp 2015 the annual report of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2015 and previous research chen et al 2019 for the energy conversion coefficients we mainly referred to fao 2015 a social accounting matrix table can be used to describe the economic system s operation and contains the basic data used by the cge model in this study we compiled a table with 11 economic sectors based on data from 2015 the data of the social accounting matrix sam table are mainly from the input output table of 2015 the statistical yearbook of china 2016 national bureau of statistics of china 2016 the finance yearbook of china 2016 china financial yearbook editorial board 2016 and the taxation yearbook of china 2016 china taxation yearbook editorial board 2016 etc we obtained data for the demand elasticity parameters used by the cge model and substitution elasticity from bao et al 2010 and li et al 2010 3 results and discussion if a country s exports of ecological footprint are greater than the imports this represents an ecological deficit this means that the country lost more of its biologically productive land than it gained through foreign trade thereby accelerating the consumption of its ecological resources if the imports of ecological footprint are greater than the exports this represents an ecological surplus this means that the country obtains more biologically productive land through foreign trade than it loses thereby reducing the consumption of its ecological resources the balance between exports and imports i e an ecological deficit or surplus is a key point for studying the impacts of transfers of ecological footprint during foreign trade 3 1 the actual land use in the ecological footprint based on the cge model we determined the actual land use involved in the ecological footprint using three tax intensities table 1 the export of actual land use increased with increasing tax intensity for all land uses the average increases of total land use from 2015 to 2020 were 1 14 106 global hectares gha and 2 73 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities 50 and 125 rmb tce for the low and high tax intensities respectively respectively compared with the baseline scenario no tax the cultivated land contributed the largest proportion of the increase of ecological footprint exports 85 9 the average increases for cultivated land use exports were 0 98 106 gha and 2 35 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively the actual land use was mainly determined by the commodities or sectors that were not energy intensive because they and their commodities were land intensive sectors mainly agriculture the proportion of the energy use in the total inputs of land intensive sectors was only 2 in 2015 the export increase was caused mainly by the increased production volume of non energy intensive commodities the energy tax increased the energy cost leading to an adjustment of the industrial structure during this adjustment the industrial structure will gradually shift to increase the proportion of industries or sectors that consume relatively little energy this means that the production volume of these commodities will increase for example the production volume of non energy intensive commodities will increase to 6 6 109 rmb in 2015 under the low tax consequently to maintain balanced supply and demand in the domestic market the export of non energy intensive commodities will increase in contrast the energy tax exerted the opposite impact on the imports of actual land use in the ecological footprint table 2 the imports of actual land use decreased with an increasing energy tax for all land uses except grassland and water which had no associated imports the average reduction of total land use from 2015 to 2020 were 4 54 106 gha and 10 76 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively the cultivated land contributed the largest proportion to the decrease of the ecological footprint imports the average decreases of the cultivated land use imports were 3 58 106 gha and 8 47 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively the import decrease was also caused mainly by the increased domestic production volume of non energy intensive commodities to maintain a balance between supply and demand in the domestic market the import of non energy intensive commodities will decrease for the net exports exports minus imports of actual land use in the ecological footprint the energy tax s effects were similar to the effects for exports that is the net export of actual land use increased with increasing tax intensity the average increases of total land use from 2015 to 2020 were 4 56 106 gha and 10 81 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively the cultivated land use also contributed the largest proportion to the increase of the net export of ecological footprint the average increases of cultivated land use exports were 5 69 106 gha and 13 49 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities in addition table 3 shows that china is a net importer of total actual land use i e the net export is negative in all years under all tax intensities the net import of the total actual land decreased with increasing tax intensity indicating that the energy tax could help to reduce the pressure on actual land in china s trade partners table 4 shows that the magnitudes absolute values of the rates of change of actual land use were higher for the net exports than for the imports and exports but that all three rates were relatively low with no changes greater than 5 the magnitude of the change increased over time for the exports but decreased over time for the imports and net exports and was always higher under the high tax intensity indicating that economic development could increase the impacts of the energy tax 3 2 the virtual land use in the ecological footprint we determined the virtual land use in the ecological footprint using the cge model under the three tax intensities table 5 increasing the tax intensity decreased the exports and imports of virtual land use in the ecological footprint for the exports the average reduction of the virtual land use from 2015 to 2020 was 5 57 106 gha and 12 61 106 gha compared with the baseline scenario no tax under the low and high tax intensities respectively the corresponding decreases for imports were 1 73 106 gha and 3 69 106 gha in contrast to the actual land use in the ecological footprint which is mainly determined by the non energy intensive i e land intensive commodities and sectors the virtual land use in the ecological footprint was mainly determined by the energy intensive commodities and sectors such as coal heavy industry and light industry the reductions of the exports and imports mainly resulted from the increased energy cost under the tax and the decreased production of energy intensive commodities in the domestic market the energy cost and price will increase under the energy taxes but the energy price in international markets does not change due to the price changes exports will therefore decrease in addition energy is an essential input for commodity production especially for the energy intensive commodities the increased energy cost will increase the price of the energy intensive commodities and reduce the demand for these commodities in the domestic market consequently the imports also decrease in addition table 5 shows that china is a net importer of virtual land use and that the net import of virtual land use increases with increasing tax intensity in all years the average increase in the net imports compared with the baseline scenario no tax from 2015 to 2020 was 3 84 106 gha and 8 91 106 gha under the low and high taxes respectively thus the energy tax will increase the virtual land requirement for carbon dioxide absorption in china s trade partners and increase the pressure to provide land to absorb carbon dioxide emission in countries with a net export of virtual land as was the case for the actual land use in the ecological footprint the magnitudes absolute values of the change rates for the imports and net exports of virtual land use were all smaller than 5 table 6 however the change rates for the exports of virtual land were high with rates ranging from 9 to 35 under the low and high tax intensities the average export change rates from 2015 to 2020 were 11 9 and 26 9 respectively this indicates that the energy cost increase due to the taxes will significantly decrease the competitive ability of china s energy intensive commodities in the international market 3 3 the total ecological footprint we analyzed the impact of the energy taxes on the total ecological footprint which represents the sum of the actual and virtual land use table 7 and calculated the magnitude of the reductions table 8 the energy taxes reduced the exports and imports of ecological footprint the average export of ecological footprint from 2015 to 2020 decreased by 4 42 106 gha and 9 88 106 gha respectively under the low and high tax intensities the corresponding average import reductions were 6 27 106 gha and 14 45 106 gha the export reduction was much less than the import reduction however the reduction rate for exports was greater than that for imports for example the export reduction rate under the high tax intensity in 2025 was 10 4 which is much greater than the import reduction rate of 1 8 the high export reduction rate resulted from the significant reduction rate of virtual land use exports in the ecological footprint caused by the energy cost increase tables 7 and 8 also show that ra is negative for net exports thus china is a net importer of ecological footprint the net import of ecological footprint decreased with increasing energy tax intensity in all three years the average net imports of ecological footprint from 2015 to 2025 was 746 38 106 gha 744 53 106 gha and 741 80 106 gha under the baseline low tax and high tax scenarios respectively the energy tax could therefore reduce the net imports of ecological footprint with reductions compared with the baseline scenario of 1 76 106 gha and 4 45 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively our results demonstrate that the energy tax had beneficial effects by encouraging china to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emission table 7 indicates that the energy tax could reduce the ecological footprint pressure on china s trade partners by reducing china s imports of ecological footprint however the energy tax would decrease china s gdp by 0 01 and 0 05 under the low and high tax intensities respectively compared with the baseline scenario this would be offset by the increased economic development permitted by international trade however implementing an energy tax in china would reduce the net imports of commodities from china s trade partners which is a negative consequence from the perspective of global economic development table 8 also shows that the reduction of the net imports of ecological footprint increases with economic development from 2015 to 2025 the average net import reduction under the low and high tax intensities was 3 11 106 gha in 2015 3 21 106 gha in 2020 and 3 31 106 gha in 2025 respectively however the reduction rates decreased with economic development with decreases of 0 5 in 2015 0 4 in 2020 and 0 4 in 2025 compared with the baseline scenario this indicates that china s domestic economy could gradually adapt to the energy tax by adjusting the industrial structure to favor sectors that consume less energy 4 conclusions international transfers of ecological footprint are an important consequence of global trade energy taxes are a common form of environmental policy to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emission thereby decreasing the ecological footprint of economic development in the present study we established a multi sector dynamic cge model that accounted for china s industrial structure using expanded environmental and ecological footprint modules our analysis showed that implementing an energy tax can greatly affect the price and production of commodities using this cge model we analyzed the transfers of ecological footprint based on both the actual and virtual land use in china s foreign trade from 2015 to 2026 under two energy tax intensities we obtained three main conclusions l the net export change in china varies between 1 31 and 12 77 under the two tax intensities in 2017 china s exports account for 6 4 of the global exports and its imports accounts for 8 6 of the global imports wto 2019 the maximum possible influence of energy tax in china on the international trade is 1 10 which will not obviously influence the international price thus the small country assumption is reasonable in this research l for the actual land use the sum of cultivated land grassland forest and water areas the energy tax increased exports but decreased imports of ecological footprint the average net exports exports minus imports decreased by 4 56 106 gha and 10 81 106 gha from 2015 to 2020 under the low and high tax intensities respectively l for the virtual land use the land required to absorb carbon dioxide generated by the combustion of fossil fuels the energy tax decreased both exports and imports of ecological footprint the average net imports from 2015 to 2020 increased by 3 84 106 gha and 8 91 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively l for the total ecological footprint the sum of actual and virtual land use the energy tax reduced both exports and imports of ecological footprint the net import decreased by 1 76 106 gha and 4 45 106 gha under the low and high tax intensities respectively l in this research we mainly considered the product output changes for each sector and the related import and export changes but the energy tax could also force the industry to adopt new technologies to produce the same commodity with less energy consumption the impacts of new technologies are subject to future research

24822,the amount of potentially toxic chemicals in a fish depends on various environmental factors such as temperature and feeding ecology which can be affected by global changes gc the main objective of the present work was to study the relative influence of temperature food quality and food availability on the growth and contamination of juveniles of common sole solea solea a marine flatfish species known to be a relevant indicator of the nursery quality it focuses on two persistent organic pollutants cb153 and l pfos of legacy and emerging concern respectively to achieve this we used a toxicokinetic tk model in which toxicant flows are mechanistically predicted using a bioenergetic model based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory this modelling framework was applied to juvenile sole from the gironde estuary sw france and allows accounting for the influence of environmental conditions on fish biological processes involved in toxicant fluxes to compare their respective influence on model predictions of age length and contamination at puberty we included in a global sensitivity analysis 1 environmental variability gathered from literature for this particular estuary and 2 tk parameters i e assimilation efficiency ae and elimination rate k e variability and uncertainty gathered from literature about each contaminant but for different fish species and experimental conditions then model predictions were confronted to fish contamination measurements from the gironde estuary with different combinations of tk parameter values from literature results highlighted a key role of diet composition on fish contamination and growth while water temperature only affected growth it stressed the need to focus on gc impact on benthic communities and their consequences on juvenile fish diet for future work on gc scenarios furthermore for both chemical the range of variability of tk parameters from experiments led to underestimated fish contaminations the best model fits were obtained using tk parameter values from model applications from mounier et al n d for cb153 solea solea experiment ae 0 8 and k e 0 d 1 and from de vos et al 2008 for pfos food chain of the western scheldt estuary the netherlands ae 0 8 and k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 keywords gironde estuary solea solea deb model tk model cb153 pfos sensitivity analysis 1 introduction bioaccumulation is a fundamental process in environmental toxicology because it controls the amount of potential toxicants in individual organisms arnot and gobas 2004 thus predicting chemical body burdens is important to assess ecological adverse effects van der oost et al 2003 the observed contamination levels of organisms are the result of different contaminants inflows and outflows related to 4 main processes uptake internal distribution biotransformation and elimination ashauer and escher 2010 these fluxes themselves depend on several factors ashauer and escher 2010 grech et al 2017 1 the contaminants physicochemical properties and structure 2 the metabolic capacities of the species in question feeding rate respiration and biotransformation capacity and 3 the individuals physiological state depending on their life stage and environmental conditions they have experienced e g environmental contamination temperature or diet disentangling and quantifying the relative importance of chemical environmental and physiological factors underlying this observed variability of individual contamination levels remains a major challenge that is difficult to address by conventional statistical approaches in this context the use of a mechanistic framework for modelling toxicokinetic tk processes is required to predict the evolution of toxicants bioaccumulation dynamics within the frame of global changes more specifically there is a need to develop mechanistic models disentangling the relative effect of ecological physiological and biochemical characteristics and environmental conditions on internal individual concentrations grech et al 2017 mechanistic toxicokinetic tk models aims at predicting organisms contamination by modelling uptake and clearance contaminants flows according to biological flows in most cases these biological flows are considered to be constant and predicted organisms contamination is given at steady state this approach is the simplest one and is useful to compare bioaccumulation between chemicals or species but it is not adapted to fluctuating environmental conditions ashauer et al 2006 to address this issue some tk models have been developed within the conceptual framework of the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 to predict consequences of environmental changes e g temperature food quality or food availability on biological processes that control chemical fluxes see tk models using sub model based on deb theory bodiguel et al 2009 eichinger et al 2010 for one compartment tk models and grech et al 2019 for a physiologically based toxicokinetic model the implementation of a deb tk model was of interest to study the influence of the environment on the internal concentrations to implement in perspective a debtox approach linking contamination levels and potential adverse effects at the individual level debtox models see jager and zimmer 2012 kooijman and bedaux 1996 one of the main strengths of the deb theory is that it allows the modelling of toxic effects on growth reproduction and survival in a consistent and well documented framework see for instance baas et al 2018 for a review on the use of deb models in ecological risk assessment persistent organic pollutants pops are of particular interest when studying bioaccumulation as they are characterised by their persistence in the environment their toxicity and their high bioaccumulative and long range transport potentials polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are compounds from a historical family of pops banned decades ago they are still found in all environmental compartments and their bioaccumulation has long been studied contrary to pcbs perfluoroalkylated substances pfass are of emerging interest and their ecodynamics is still relatively poorly known especially in aquatic environments houde et al 2006 munoz et al 2017a xiao 2017 a better understanding of contaminant transfer processes in aquatic food webs and their controlling factors is required to better assess the environmental and health risks associated with the presence of these xenobiotics amongst hydrosystems coastal and estuarine ecosystems contribute greatly to the economic importance of coastal marine environments costanza et al 1997 for instance numerous marine fish species spend their juvenile phase in estuarine nursery grounds beck et al 2001 able 2005 this phase of their life cycle during which the individuals reach puberty i e defined as the start of energy allocation to reproduction is highly critical for the fitness of the population beck et al 2001 able 2005 rochette et al 2010 however physicochemical factors of estuarine essential habitats are naturally highly variable e g elliott and hemingway 2002 lobry et al 2003 and also particularly affected by anthropogenic pollutions especially pops e g budzinski et al 1997 matthiessen and law 2002 munoz et al 2019 both stress sources can affect juvenile survival growth and health gilliers et al 2004 and consequently population dynamics organic contamination has already been related to nursery dysfunction e g courrat et al 2009 gilliers et al 2006 gilliers et al 2006 in particular growth rates and abundance of juvenile common sole solea solea l from several nursery areas along the french coast were found to be highly correlated with their level of chemical pressure amara et al 2007 gilliers et al 2006 the common sole is thus considered as a relevant model species to study the quality of coastal and estuarine nursery areas in western europe the gironde estuary sw french atlantic coast appears to be a relevant case study to analyse the sensitivity of pops bioaccumulation in juvenile common sole to several gc factors in nursery grounds indeed the question of interactions between environmental changes and contaminations is highly topical in this particular area for at least three reasons first it is one of the largest european estuaries lobry et al 2003 and thus one of the main nursery ground for the atlantic sole stock which is one of the most economically important fish stock for the bay of biscay le pape et al 2003 second abiotic and biotic contamination has been studied for several years for pcbs bodin et al 2014 lauzent 2018 tapie et al 2011 and more recently for pfass munoz et al 2017b 2017a third significant changes in the abundance of flatfish populations hermant et al 2010 pasquaud et al 2012 and in the structure and functioning of the whole food web chevillot et al 2016 chevillot et al 2019 in relation with strong modifications of physicochemical conditions warming and salinization were recently highlighted chaalali et al 2013 in essence the analysis in the present paper aims at determining which factors affected by gc have the highest influence on fish contamination so as to better identify which ones are of particular interest to study future environmental changes for this we used a common sole deb model mounier et al n d coupled with a one compartment tk model to account for the influence of environmental conditions on biological flows and thus on contaminant flows amongst these environmental conditions water temperature chaalali et al 2013 and prey availability chevillot et al 2019 are already affected by local and global modifications and the composition of the sole diet is known to fluctuate with size season and prey availability ballutaud et al 2019 pasquaud 2006 also contamination of the environment and thus of prey is expected to change with the management of pollutant sources the first objective was therefore to describe the sensitivity of juvenile sole growth and pop contamination to the highly variable environmental conditions of estuaries by means of a sensitivity analysis on deb tk in our study we focused on cb153 2 2 4 4 5 5 hexachlorobiphenyl and l pfos linear isomer of perfluorooctane sulfonate as these compounds are the major ones in the natural environment for pcbs and pfass respectively in addition to environmental variability we included tk parameters variability and uncertainty in the sensitivity analysis on fish contamination indeed tk parameters estimated values are also known to be highly variable between studies e g for pcbs kobayashi et al 2011 which also complicates the prediction of fish contamination moreover the uncertainty in these parameters for pfass is high due to the scarce number of related studies finally we compared deb tk predictions of fish contamination by cb153 and l pfos to measurements in juvenile sole from the gironde estuary this allowed assessing the realism of environmental and tk parameters used in modelling scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 general framework of the study the general framework of this study relies on the coupling between a dynamic energy budget deb model and a toxicokinetic tk model on which a global sensitivity analysis sa was conducted to highlight to which tk parameters and environmental inputs of the deb tk affected by gc model outputs of fish growth and contamination are the most sensitive the general articulation between data model inputs model coupling and model outputs used in the present paper is presented in fig 1 we studied the sensitivity of 4 model outputs age at puberty length at puberty and internal contamination of fish when reaching puberty for each of the two contaminants i e cb153 and l pfos as some deb parameters differed between sexes in the model used i e maximum food assimilation rate and maturation threshold at puberty see mounier et al n d especially concerning food ingestion and thus growth and contaminant ingestion we differentiated these 4 predictions by sex which led to 8 model outputs we focused on the puberty stage considering that the growth phase in nursery grounds lasts until puberty which may be the trigger event for fish to leave nursery grounds we used the most recent version of deb model on solea solea developed by mounier et al n d to study bioaccumulation under experimental and in situ conditions the deb parameters were calibrated for each sex of s solea using the latest method for deb parameters estimation and a broad compilation of data from literature for details on structure parameters and calibration of the deb model we encourage the interested reader to refer to mounier et al n d in this materials and methods section we only present the tk model developed considering both uptake and elimination fluxes and how it relates with this deb model tk parameters and the environmental forcings of the deb tk model are listed to perform the sensitivity analysis of the deb tk model predictions we have to know the range of variability associated to each model input i e environmental inputs and tk parameters to determine these ranges environmental data from the gironde estuary was gathered when available from previous field based studies see section 2 3 our strategy to go from raw observations to simulation characteristics for model inputs is presented in section 2 4 next the principles of the global sensitivity analysis sa are presented as the variability of the food contamination input relies on both diet composition and preys contamination variabilities a complementary variance analysis was conducted on food contamination to disentangle the relative influence of these factors for that purpose a nominal value and a range of variability were defined for diet and prey contaminations on a final step model predictions were compared with measurements of cb153 and l pfos contaminations in sole individuals from the gironde estuary 2 2 toxicokinetic model 2 2 1 general principles the mechanistic tk model presented below is a one compartment kinetic model similar to the one presented by arnot and gobas 2004 who related bioaccumulation in an aquatic organism to 6 major routes of chemical uptake and elimination dietary uptake gill uptake gill elimination metabolic transformation faecal egestion and growth dilution the fundamental interest of this deb tk model is to consider non constancy of these different chemical fluxes we used the deb theory kooijman 2010 to predict the variation of chemical fluxes due to environmentally induced variations of metabolic activity ingestion and growth dynamics in the present model no retroaction of contamination level on deb parameters is implemented i e no sub lethal effects of the level of contamination are applied on fish metabolism furthermore as we focus on the juvenile phase the reproduction and thus the transfer to the gametes are not accounted for 2 2 2 model characteristics and equations a more detailed version of tk equation is provided in the supplementary material appendix a this deb tk model only considers dietary uptake where food is a mix of different prey dietary uptake qin in ng of contaminant was related to food contamination cx in ng gfood 1 dw dynamic

from food ae in ng of chemical assimilated per ng of chemical ingested ae is the tk parameter that describes the proportion of the chemicals ingested with food that is assimilated by the fish this approach was used in bodiguel et al 2009 and eichinger et al 2010 in this approach contaminants in the faeces represent the non assimilated part of ingested contaminants contaminant elimination was considered using a second tk parameter the elimination rate k e in d 1 that quantifies gill elimination metabolic transformation and faecal elimination i e due to the chemical partition between the organism and the digested food in guts we assumed first order elimination kinetics i e no saturation also as well as other metabolic rates elimination rate is supposed to be affected by temperature see kooijman et al 2009 for general theory and borgå et al 2010 for an application of this principle to the study of climate change impacts on bioaccumulation in a food web thus k e was defined as the daily diminution of the contaminant concentration in fish c in ng cm 3 at the reference temperature t r e f 293 k it was then corrected by the actual temperature t following the same arrhenius

temperature correction factor ct even though deb parameters are individual specific the sets of estimates are quite homogeneous at the population level as the individuals are genetically close kooijman 2010 thus deb parameters were considered to be constant between individuals in our work on soles from a single study site on the contrary tk parameters depend on many chemical biological and environmental factors however the way in which these factors influence tk parameters is not always well known especially for compounds of emerging interest such as pfass borgå et al 2004 they first depend on the affinity of the chemical to different biomolecules which relies on its physicochemical properties and its structure see for instance ng and hungerbuhler 2014 for pfass and arnot and gobas 2003 for hydrophobic chemicals such as pcbs in relation to this chemical properties tk parameters also depend on fish characteristics such as fish lipid content or fish biotransformation capacity borgå et al 2004 the assimilation efficiency ae also depends on diet assimilation efficiency gobas et al 1999 and especially on the assimilation of the lipid part of the food for pcbs kobayashi et al 2011 and probably for pfass too de vos et al 2008 consequently several sets of empirical values for different fish species are available in the literature see 2 4 5 for details in the

poor ecological status courrat et al 2009 delpech et al 2010 in relation in particular with global contamination courrat et al 2009 gilliers et al 2006 consequently the bioaccumulation the trophic

sole samples from 46 juveniles were collected several years after in the mesohaline zone of the gironde estuary see map in figure b1 all fish samples were weighed and measured their average total length was 15 7 cm min max 8 4 26 5 cm and their average weight was 42 5 g min max 4 9 165 5 g the sample preparation and detailed analytical procedure for pcbs and pfass were published previously lauzent 2018 munoz et al 2017a thompson and budzinski 2000 only 3 samples were measured for each prey thus the distributions of prey contamination are unknown the nominal value for contamination of a given prey was therefore set as the mid range i e the average of the largest and smallest values of observed contamination level the range thresholds were set as the minimum and maximum observed values data summary is provided in section 2 4 6 table 1 and detailed data is represented in figure b4 2 4 model inputs computation and associated uncertainty as environmental conditions are highly variable in space and time in a macrotidal estuary such as the gironde we chose to simplify analyses by setting model simulations with constant environmental forcing variables except for temperature which was modelled as a sinusoid function we assumed that virtual fish were born uncontaminated in this section we presented for each model input 1 how it was computed from environmental data and 2 its associated uncertainty the uncertainty was defined by estimating a range of values i e a minimum and a maximum for each model input due to the low number of samples in the datasets used presented section 2 3 uniform distributions between these ranges were associated with their respective model inputs the model inputs and their associated uncertainty are summarised in table 2 section 2 4 6 2 4 1 average annual temperature temp and birth date birth for modelling purpose the daily temperature dynamics t d was represented by a sinusoid to account for seasonal variations 1 t d t a s i n 2 π 365 d φ with t the average annual temperature a the amplitude and φ the phase expressed in days t was computed for each year selected from the temperature dataset listed in the section 2 3 2 the amplitude a was fixed to 9 c i e the approximated mean amplitude value observed in the gironde estuary temperature time series in section 2 3 2 φ value was used to model the influence of temperature life history related to the settlement date on deb tk predictions to reproduce the phase shift necessary to make d 0 corresponding to the 1st of january φ had to be equal to 240 days thus for a given fish φ was calculated as 240 plus the day of the year at birth within the spawning season the temperature conditions experienced by an individual during its nursery phase depend on both the year of birth and the settlement date they thus can be variable at the annual year of birth and seasonal settlement date levels indeed average annual temperature can vary by several degrees in the gironde estuary see 2 3 2 and table 2 in 2 4 6 inter annual variability is obtained by considering t variations between years using in situ data presented above minimum and maximum values of t were respectively 14 7 c and 16 3 c also the common sole is a batch spawner with a large spawning season in the bay of biscay deniel 1990 thus the environmental conditions encountered in the estuary by the individuals from the earlier and the later batches may also differ in our case the spawning season is known to last for several months i e from early december to late march with a peak in late january and early february amara et al 1994 consequently birth date range was december 1 i e 335th day of the year march 31 i e 90th day of the year as a simplification we assumed that larval drift duration was the same during all the spawning season see supplementary material appendix c figure c1 for a graphical representation of birth date influence on temperature sinusoid experienced in the estuary after settlement 2 4 2 food availability avail the deb parameter used to describe food availability is the scaled functional response hereafter symbolized f f is considered constant over life and its value can be approximated by dividing the asymptotic length observed in the studied environment linf by the theoretical maximal length that an animal can attain if food is not limited lmax kooijman 2010 in the absence of age length relationship for the studied population from the gironde estuary it was not possible however to estimate f in our case study we thus assumed that f was similar to the one for the douarnenez bay s population brittany nw french coast for which a large set of age length data were available the food availability encountered all over the juvenile period in the estuary may differ from one individual to another depending for instance on their different locations in the estuary during this period thus to obtain the range of f values we divided the minimum 41 cm and maximum 47 cm total lengths of fully grown males over 15 years old n 8 from douarnenez bay deniel 1981 by the total length of the largest one ever observed 75 cm male http www fishbase org thus f was supposed to be between 0 547 and 0 627 2 4 3 food quality quality the deb parameter used to describe food quality is the food energy density ϱ x j gfood 1 dw it is a combination of diet composition and prey energy density ϱ x was computed for each diet composition solution from the corresponding dry mass proportion of preys fp in the diet see section 2 3 3 and from dry energy density of each prey species ϱ p j gprey 1 dw as follows 2 ϱ x p 1 5 ϱ p f p as ϱ p values were not reported in literature for the gironde estuary case study we used values of corresponding species from a databank of conversion factors updated in 2012 brey 2001 brey et al 2010 15 770 j g 1 dw for gammarids 17 396 j g 1 dw for brown shrimp 17 359 j g 1 dw for nereis 19 319 for white shrimp and 11 887 j g 1 dw for crab ϱ p was considered constant but diet composition was variable indeed diet composition can modulate food quality as the different preys do not provide the same energy ϱ x range was fixed to the minimum and maximum values computed from the results of ϱ x for all diet composition solutions provided by escroc n 150 000 ϱ x estimates ranged from 14 047 to 18 034 j gfood 1 dw 2 4 4 food contamination contam food contamination level cx ng gfood 1 dw is a combination of diet composition and prey contamination it was computed using the formula 3 c x p 1 5 c p f p where cp is the concentration in the prey p ng gprey 1 dw and fp is the dry mass proportion of prey p in the diet diet composition can also modulate food contamination as the different preys do not contain the same amount of contaminant see 2 3 4 thus we computed cx for each diet composition solution n 150 000 see section 2 3 3 with either the minima or the maxima contamination observed for each prey see section 2 3 4 for preys contamination the lower and upper boundaries for food contamination were fixed to the minimum and maximum cx values computed respectively i e 3 3 24 5 ng g 1 dw for cb153 and 6 2 79 3 ng g 1 dw for l pfos 2 4 5 tk parameters ae and k e tk parameters input values and associated variability were gathered from literature kobayashi et al 2011 fisk et al 1998 and buckman et al 2004 for cb153 and hassell et al 2019 goeritz et al 2013 and martin et al 2003 for the pfos for several fish species because no specific data s on sole were found for assimilation efficiency ae estimates for pcbs were compiled by kobayashi et al 2011 and were ranging from 0 26 to 1 for cb153 most previous estimates of fish tk parameters for pfos were estimated at the carcass level and reported high but non realistic estimates for ae i e ae 100 from martin et al 2003a thus by default we retained 1 as the higher value of the range the lower bound was provided by hassell et al 2019 for l pfos at the whole body level it was computed as the estimate minus 1 96 times the associated standard error this led to a range of ae values from 0 53 to 1 for the l pfos the elimination rate k e values were compiled from buckman et al 2004 and fisk et al 1998 for cb153 and goeritz et al 2013 hassell et al 2019 and martin et al 2003 for pfos a range for k e was calculated using the estimate provided by the authors 1 96 times the associated standard error when the latter was provided these different k e values were obtained under different temperature conditions varying from 8 to 17 5 c depending on the studies hence to be compared with each other the estimates from the different sources were corrected to be given at 20 c i e the reference temperature for the arrhenius correction see temperature correction parameter estimates from mounier et al n d we considered the minimum and maximum values estimated at 20 c as the range of variation of k e i e 0 45 2 24 for cb153 and 5 22 11 28 for pfos all in 10 2 d 1 2 4 6 summary of model input data model input nominal values and ranges are summarized in table 1 for preys characteristics the ranges of variation of other environmental variables and tk parameters are given in table 2 2 5 sensitivity analyses 2 5 1 global sensitivity analysis 2 5 1 1 general principle a global sensitivity analysis was implemented to assess which were the inputs whose variability mainly explains the outputs variability it also allows detecting interactions between model inputs and provides sensitivity results considering the entire input space this global sensitivity analysis was performed using the variance based sobol method saltelli et al 2010 it is a model independent method that allows estimating within a probabilistic framework the contribution of each model input variance and of their interactions to the unconditional variance of a model output sobol first order indice si quantifies the sensitivity of a model output variance to the main effect of a model input it thus measures the effect of varying this particular input alone considering variations in other input parameters by construction si indices sum to 1 for a given model output the more a si value is close to 1 for a particular input parameter the more sensitive is the model output variance to this input variance the sobol total index sti considers the contribution to the output variance of all variance caused by a given input and its interactions thus the difference between si and sti values for a given input output couple provide information about the sensitivity of the output variance to interactions of the given input with all the other inputs combined 2 5 1 2 computation to estimate both si and sti indices at the same time we used jansen estimators jansen 1999 with improved formulas from saltelli et al 2010 computed using the soboljansen function from r package sensitivity iooss et al 2019 this function computes the monte carlo estimation of the sobol indices using two independent input matrices with n rows the random sample size n 10 000 and p columns the number of inputs p 4 for growth outputs i e birth temp avail quality p 7 for contamination outputs i e idem contam ae ke in both matrices every row represents a possible set of input values for the deb tk model to build these matrices we optimised model inputs combinations using scrambled sobol sequences i e quasi random low discrepancy sequences with both owen and faure tezuka type of scrambling computed using the sobol function from the r package randtoolbox dutang and savicky 2009 each model inputs values were transposed from 0 to 1 sampling to their respective ranges defined in the section 2 4 these lower and upper limits table 2 were defined either to cover the variability of environmental conditions observed in the gironde estuary or to cover the uncertainty in tk parameter values in order to compute sobol indices outputs are predicted for each row of the matrices and returned by the function each row corresponds to one fish simulated with a constant value for each model input given in the matrix to assess confidence intervals on the estimation of sobol indices bootstrapping with resampling was used within the soboljansen function the n samples used for the model evaluations were 250 times sampled with replacement whereby for each resampling the function computes sobol indices to obtain the 95 confidence intervals for si and sti values 2 5 2 complementary variance analysis on food contamination food contamination variability used as a model input to calculate the sobol indices is actually a compound variable see 2 4 4 its variability mixes variabilities of the diet composition and the individual contaminations of each of the 5 preys see 2 3 3 and 2 3 4 respectively to disentangle the relative influence of the contamination of each prey on the contamination of sole a complementary analysis was thus required for this particular complementary analysis we introduced 6 dummy variables the first dummy variable is set to 1 to indicate that the diet composition is variable while a 1 indicates that the diet composition is fixed to its nominal value the 5 other dummy variables correspond to each of the 5 preys a 1 indicates that the corresponding prey contamination is set to its nominal value while a 1 indicates that it is variable to explore the effects main and interactions of each of these 6 sources of variability we generated an orthogonal fractional factorial 2 level design of resolution v using the frf2 function from the eponym r package grömping 2014 with the 6 dummy variables as factor of the design it permits to obtain the smallest necessary experimental design i e smallest number of factors combination to be computed which was here composed of 32 runs instead of 64 for the full factorial design each experiment is composed of a particular combination of the different 2 level factors i e 1 or 1 values for the 6 factors for each experiment the model was run with 50 000 different sets of parameters values according to the following rule the value of a parameter was set to its nominal value for the 50 000 runs if the corresponding dummy variable equals 1 if the corresponding dummy variable equal 1 then 50 000 values were uniformly drawn between min and max values for contamination of species while 50 000 diet compositions were randomly sampled from the posterior distribution see section 2 3 3 for diet composition finally from these model predictions a variance analysis was carried out to assess the contribution of the different considered environmental variables and their interactions to food contamination variance 2 6 model predictions vs in situ measurements finally model predictions were compared to in situ measurements following two steps as a first step we graphically compared contamination levels measured in fish from the gironde estuary see 2 3 4 with distribution of deb tk predictions of contamination at puberty computed for the purpose of the sobol indices estimations by doing this we were able to compare variability of field concentrations with the variability of predicted concentrations due to variability and uncertainty of model inputs i e environmental variables and tk parameters for comparison purpose with measurements model predictions of contamination at puberty were associated with the predicted range of length at puberty from the same analysis on a second step we addressed model predictions with different scenarios of fixed values of tk parameters a worst case scenario of chemical bioaccumulation with tk parameters classically used in ecological risk assessment models ae 1 and k e 0 two scenarios from experimental estimates from goeritz et al 2013 for the pfos estimated for the rainbow trout ae 0 721 and k e 5 8 10 2 d 1 at 20 c from mounier et al n d for the cb153 applied to the common sole ae 0 8 and k e 0 d 1 a scenario from de vos et al 2008 who explored the behaviour of pfos uptake and elimination using the bioaccumulation model omega ae 0 8 i e uptake comparable to moderately hydrophobic compounds and k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 i e elimination best described by elimination kinetics of metals non specified temperature value applied directly for these scenarios as tk parameters were fixed the variability considered only relied on environmental forcings variability practically we built matrices in the same way as for the sobol method each line or sample corresponded to a possible combination of input variables we computed contamination predictions at puberty for these samples and confronted them with data in the same way as presented in the first paragraph for each step model fit was assessed comparing 1 the minimums and maximums values of predictions and measurements and 2 the median of predictions i e the distribution reflecting notably the diet composition distribution and its consequences on food contamination with the average value of all measurements i e regardless of fish size 2 7 implementation sensitivity analyses and deb tk simulations were implemented using r language r core team 2017 version 3 6 1 and the integrated development environment ide r studio version 1 2 5019 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis no major influence of sex was found in the global analysis results are thus only presented here for females detailed results for each sex can be found in supplementary material appendix d table d1 si and sti estimates for biological outputs fig 2 were very close si sti 0 9 which indicates little interactions between model inputs the main contributor to age and length variance was the variability in food quality si 0 68 and to a much lesser extent in food availability si 0 2 by contrast age at puberty was slightly sensitive to average annual temperature si 0 09 and nearly not affected by birth date si 0 02 global sensitivity of contamination predictions to environmental inputs variability were similar for cb153 and l pfos and close to zero apart from food contamination si and sti 0 01 see fig 2 food contamination was the major contributor to fish contamination variance si 0 38 and 0 7 for cb153 and l pfos respectively for cb153 food contamination was closely followed by the two tk parameters si 0 26 and 0 23 for k e and ae respectively in contrast the influence of food contamination is much higher than tk parameters for l pfos si 0 14 and 0 09 for k e and ae respectively nevertheless for both chemical the influence of k e variability was higher than the influence of ae variability for both these influent inputs and both chemicals sti values were different from si values si sti around 0 75 indicating interactions between inputs the distributions predicted for each output are presented in fig 3 considering the range of environmental variability accounted in this study age at puberty predicted for the purpose of the computation of sobol indices varied by one year i e between 1 6 to 2 7 years old with a median value of 2 2 years old estimates for length at puberty varied from 20 9 to 22 3 cm with a median value of 21 7 cm when considering both environmental and tk parameters variability contamination levels in fish varied by a factor 54 to 124 for l pfos and cb153 respectively between 0 1 and 5 4 ng g 1 ww and between 0 1 and 12 4 ng g 1 ww respectively contrary to biological outputs the median of estimated values for contaminations outputs 1 9 and 1 4 ng g 1 ww for cb153 and l pfos respectively were close to the minimal values 3 2 variance analysis on food contamination since food contamination is one of the main factor influencing the model outputs it was crucial to disentangle the relative effect of diet composition and respective prey contaminations fig 4 almost all the variance 90 in food contamination was induced by only two factors unsurprisingly the variability in diet composition explained 39 and 50 of food contamination variance for cb153 and l pfos respectively for cb153 the variability of contamination levels in gammarids the main prey of sole juveniles explained almost all the remaining variance 57 whereas for l pfos it was nereis i e nereis diversicolor the most contaminated prey species for this contaminant 45 the influence of the other factors was therefore considered as negligible the residual variance that could be associated to interactions was also negligible 5 3 3 data comparison to model predictions when considering environmental and tk parameters variability fish contamination levels were underestimated for both chemicals compared to in situ measurements fig 5 and table 3 levels were underestimated by a factor 3 5 for l pfos and 3 9 for cb153 the maximum values were less underestimated for cb153 factor 1 5 than for l pfos factor 2 4 the minimums were much more underestimated than the maximums i e by a factor 9 and 18 for l pfos and cb153 respectively with the worst case scenario fig 6 a the distributions of the model predictions for cb153 and the observations were similar table 3 even though the upper part of the contamination distribution was higher than the highest measurement on the contrary l pfos contamination was overestimated by a factor 10 table 3 for the experiments scenarios fig 6 b predicted contamination level and range of variability with tk parameters used by mounier et al n d were consistent with observations for cb153 for l pfos predictions with the estimates from goeritz et al 2013 underestimated both level and range of contamination finally de vos et al 2008 scenario fig 6 c produced the best model fit for l pfos with an overestimation of contamination by a factor 2 for both mean level and range of variability 4 discussion 4 1 main goals and outcomes the first aim of this study was to prioritize the influence of the environmental factors involved in global change on the variance of biological traits and contamination level at puberty of juvenile common sole from the gironde estuary for this purpose we developed a mechanistic tk model by combining last updated deb model on s solea with a basic one compartment tk model this allowed to mechanistically model the relative influence of these environmental factors i e water temperature food quality food availability on biological traits that themselves combined with food contamination influence bioaccumulation the analyses conducted in this paper highlighted that diet composition through food energy density and food contamination was the key environmental factor influencing both juvenile sole growth and contamination variabilities as it is a rather opportunistic feeder species cabral 2000 future global change studies should focus on constructing credible scenarios for the future evolution of benthos populations in order to deduce possible changes in the diet of the common sole the second aim was to compare the influence of these environmental factors with that of tk parameters uncertainty on the variability of fish contamination levels finally several scenarios of tk parameters were tested with the model to determine which one would give the best fit to the cb153 and l pfos contamination data of the gironde estuary our results also underlined the strong influence of the tk parameters ae and k e on sole contamination estimations and the importance of using correct values for each chemical species and environment a major direct influence of temperature was shown on age at puberty but not on fish contamination 4 2 sex difference in juvenile ingestion does not influence sole contamination first of all results were obtained for each sex as the deb model used considers sex specific parameters mounier et al n d including one related to food ingestion throughout the entire lifecycle which directly influences dietary contamination in the present work focusing on the juvenile phase spent in nursery grounds the influence of these sex differences on fish contamination was found negligible this result support the assumption that sex differences in fish contamination observed in adults are rather due to sex differences in contaminant elimination through gametes emission than to a differential accumulation during their juvenile phase in contaminated areas bodiguel et al 2009 loizeau and abarnou 1994 peng et al 2010 shi et al 2018 it emphasizes the necessity to use of a deb model considering sex differences especially those regarding gametes emission see mounier et al n d to study fish contamination at the lifecycle scale and sex specific impact of reproduction 4 3 the major role of diet composition food quality based on prey energy density and diet composition was found to be the main factor influencing life history traits of age and length at puberty in our approach the variability of food quality is only due to the diet composition variability the diet variability also appeared to be a major factor influencing food contamination variance for both chemicals and food contamination was the only environmental factor significantly influencing fish contamination variance for both chemicals fish diet was already put forward for biomagnified compounds as a factor that may be responsible for the variability in bioaccumulation between individuals sites and seasons for pcbs masset et al 2019 stapleton et al 2002 van der oost et al 2003 and between fish species for pfass babut et al 2017 diet modifications influence on juvenile sole growth and contamination is all the more topical that in the gironde estuary as in several other ones shifts in ecological communities e g chaalali 2013 chaalali et al 2013a chevillot et al 2016 for the gironde and food web structure and functioning e g chevillot et al 2018 for the gironde tecchio et al 2016 for the seine have been highlighted in relation with global changes and we can assume that if prey abundances are affected by global change common sole diet is expected to change and adapt as sole is rather an opportunistic feeder species pasquaud et al 2010 this feeding behaviour adaptation of the juvenile sole as a function of prey abundance has been demonstrated in the tagus estuary cabral and costa 1999 results from the variance analysis on food contamination indicated the strong influence of gammarids and nereis contamination in cb153 and l pfos respectively nereis is the most consumed prey all year round whereas gammarids are mainly found in the stomachs of sole in spring pasquaud 2006 as a consequence seasonal fluctuations in the gironde estuarine soles diet could have different effects on the two studied chemicals these seasonal variations of food contamination due to variations of diet composition may also enhance the influence of birth date on fish contamination as birth date affects the time of the season when the individual settles in the estuary 4 4 substantial direct impact of temperature on the age puberty our results highlighted that the direct influence of temperature on growth rates induce substantial changes of the age at puberty that could lead to substantial consequences at the population level indeed the implemented variability of the average annual temperature i e a range of 1 6 c was responsible for nearly 11 of the variance of age at puberty as puberty was predicted to vary between 18 and 32 months for females considering all the environmental variability an increase of 1 6 c of the average temperature alone could lead to a decrease of several months in the age puberty e g 17 days for 0 16 c see local sensitivity in supplementary material appendix e such increase of mean annual temperature is a realistic scenario in the context of climate change as during the last 3 decades the water temperature of the gironde estuary already increased by about 2 c chaalali 2013 le treut 2013 as deb models can describe the full life cycle of an individual by combining it with different population models charles et al 2009 jager and klok 2010 this modelling framework allows studying the consequences at the population level of such modifications of female age at puberty our results showed that direct impact of temperature on fish metabolism does not affect fish contamination at puberty indeed considering deb model properties although temperature significantly influences growth rate it does not affect the state variable values at a given point of development e g the length at puberty because it affects each energy flux in the same way however temperature can have indirect impacts on fish by modifying for instance prey distribution and consequently diet composition which could induce changes in age length and contamination at puberty thus the global influence of temperature on fish contamination is difficult to predict simply due to direct and indirect effects on metabolism and ecological traits 4 5 tk parameters estimates 4 5 1 variability of tk parameters tk parameters variability was shown to be more influent on fish contamination variability than environmental factors with the exception of food contamination moreover for cb153 they were almost as influent as food contamination it highlights the importance of the tk parameter values used to study global change influence on fish contamination indeed the amplitude of tk parameters values from the literature reflects both the uncertainty of the estimates from experimental data and the variability due to the different species studied and the experimental conditions used thus the variability considered on tk parameters estimates may reflect the influence of both environmental e g temperature and food composition and biological variabilities e g length and specific metabolic capacities on the chemical fluxes most of these factors are already included in the mechanistic models equations and parameters thus in the present analysis the variability on chemical flux predicted considered both environmental variability from the model and the environmental biological variability implicitly included in tk estimates from literature consequently the apparent strong influence of tk parameters variability mostly indicates that tk estimates must be chosen and wisely chosen from the literature for this particular type of model application in our results unlike cb153 l pfos food contamination was by far the major factor influencing fish contamination compared to tk parameters this difference may be due to the much larger range of food contamination levels for l pfos than for cb153 factor 3 5 reducing the influence of tk parameters comparatively to the one of food contamination thus variability in food contamination can have a greater or lesser impact on fish contamination depending on the chemical the variance analysis showed that for l pfos the variance of nereis contamination supported half of the variance of food contamination however only 3 measurements of nereis contamination were performed and the large range of contamination was mostly dependant on only one sample with particularly high contamination level figure b4 consequently further studies on prey contamination may be necessary to exclude that tk parameters uncertainty is not as important as food contamination variability for l pfos too 4 5 2 uncertainty of tk parameters estimates for s solea in estuarine environment our results highlighted the high variability of tk parameters in the literature and the difficulty to use them in natural environment studies indeed considering the whole range of tk parameters estimates from literature led to an underestimation of fish contamination level and variability in our case study results from the sensitivity analyses i e the global one presented in the main document and the one step at a time local analysis from the supplementary material appendix e highlighted that an underestimation of fish contamination level could be due to several factors there were interactions between food contamination ae and k e values as food contamination was estimated from prey measurements from the gironde estuary we assume that they are reliable on the contrary tk parameters were taken from a large review of the literature since the values of ae and k e interact on fish contamination it was not possible to dissociate the effects of each parameter and to estimate them from in situ contamination data to do so we would have needed contamination decontamination data from controlled experimental conditions i e k e is the only parameter involved in fish contamination kinetics during the decontamination period however we can assume from our results that the underestimation of fish contamination may be rather due to too high values of elimination rate or to the omission of other uptake routes as the maximum value of assimilation efficiency parameter i e full assimilation was included in the range used for simulations moreover results of data comparison to model predictions with the worst case scenario full assimilation and no elimination showed that the hypothesis of too high values of elimination rate is the most likely one for both compounds this conclusion of a smaller error of the model on the assimilation flow i e efficiency from diet assimilation and or other routes of exposure compared to elimination flow is also consistent with the knowledge that exchanges with water through gills can be neglected for highly lipophilic compounds i e with an octanol water partition coefficient logkow larger than 6 6 mackay and fraser 2000 like cb153 logkow 6 92 hawker and connell 1988 moreover this pcb congener does not have any precursor that could be biotransformed into cb153 by the fish metabolism finally the assumption of an overestimation of the elimination flux is also supported by the satisfactory model fits to experimental contamination of s solea in mounier et al n d and to in situ measurements in the present paper both using tk values with no elimination from mounier et al n d pfos is known to be mainly associated with the particulate phase in estuarine environment which reduces exposure via respiration munoz et al 2017b another likely source of uptake might be considered for pfos the biotransformation of precursors themselves accumulated from the environment babut et al 2017 martin et al 2010 yet considering pfos estimates from de vos et al 2008 led to higher fish contamination levels without considering these other sources of pfos consequently an overestimation of k e for pfos may more likely be responsible for fish contamination underestimation indeed de vos et al 2008 in a modelling exercise showed that pfos elimination was best described by mimicking elimination kinetics of metals and used an empirical value of k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 thus a 7 fold lower value compared to the minimum threshold of the range used in the present analysis using de vos et al 2008 values i e ae 0 8 and k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 pfos contamination would only be overestimated by a factor 2 moreover the overestimation with these parameters was likely as the authors also reported that these values led to an overestimation of bioaccumulation factors this indicates that the elimination rate of pfos in our case study is likely to lie between the one used for metals by de vos et al 2008 k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 and the lower bound of the range defined from literature estimates k e 5 2 10 2 d 1 which is close to the one from goeritz et al 2013 overall the results reflect that k e values from literature were too high for our species of interest in our case study context yet there was no information about sole in the literature cited according to arnot et al 2008 the inherent variability amongst species and conditions life stage and sex is not well understood while estimates for most chemicals are derived from only one or two tests it could lead to significantly high estimation uncertainty thus available data in literature probably do not allow for general conclusions about differences in k e values between species routes of exposure and environments to conclude the use of non informative tk parameter values like the common worst case scenario showed that depending on the chemical studied predictions may greatly overestimate fish contamination and thus probably toxic effects in future works to select the best informative tk estimates from the literature and use it properly in such mechanistic models it should be necessary to consider the closest species possible as even amongst fish between common sole and rainbow trout from goeritz et al 2013 results showed that tk parameters seems to differ for l pfos however the underestimation of sole contamination using goeritz et al 2013 estimates for l pfos could come from environmental differences rather than from species specific capacities indeed results showed that elimination rate in sole from the gironde estuary is lower than the one from rainbow trouts from goeritz et al experiment however food contamination was greatly higher in the experiment 500 ng g 1 dw compared to in situ contamination 6 2 79 3 ng g 1 dw and elimination rate is concentration dependant thus the use of tk parameters estimated from contamination decontamination experiment should be preceded by an adaptation of the estimates to this mechanistic model to do so it should be necessary to have as much information as possible on the experimental design and results used to acquire the estimates e g water temperature food composition and assimilation by the studied species

24822,the amount of potentially toxic chemicals in a fish depends on various environmental factors such as temperature and feeding ecology which can be affected by global changes gc the main objective of the present work was to study the relative influence of temperature food quality and food availability on the growth and contamination of juveniles of common sole solea solea a marine flatfish species known to be a relevant indicator of the nursery quality it focuses on two persistent organic pollutants cb153 and l pfos of legacy and emerging concern respectively to achieve this we used a toxicokinetic tk model in which toxicant flows are mechanistically predicted using a bioenergetic model based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory this modelling framework was applied to juvenile sole from the gironde estuary sw france and allows accounting for the influence of environmental conditions on fish biological processes involved in toxicant fluxes to compare their respective influence on model predictions of age length and contamination at puberty we included in a global sensitivity analysis 1 environmental variability gathered from literature for this particular estuary and 2 tk parameters i e assimilation efficiency ae and elimination rate k e variability and uncertainty gathered from literature about each contaminant but for different fish species and experimental conditions then model predictions were confronted to fish contamination measurements from the gironde estuary with different combinations of tk parameter values from literature results highlighted a key role of diet composition on fish contamination and growth while water temperature only affected growth it stressed the need to focus on gc impact on benthic communities and their consequences on juvenile fish diet for future work on gc scenarios furthermore for both chemical the range of variability of tk parameters from experiments led to underestimated fish contaminations the best model fits were obtained using tk parameter values from model applications from mounier et al n d for cb153 solea solea experiment ae 0 8 and k e 0 d 1 and from de vos et al 2008 for pfos food chain of the western scheldt estuary the netherlands ae 0 8 and k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 keywords gironde estuary solea solea deb model tk model cb153 pfos sensitivity analysis 1 introduction bioaccumulation is a fundamental process in environmental toxicology because it controls the amount of potential toxicants in individual organisms arnot and gobas 2004 thus predicting chemical body burdens is important to assess ecological adverse effects van der oost et al 2003 the observed contamination levels of organisms are the result of different contaminants inflows and outflows related to 4 main processes uptake internal distribution biotransformation and elimination ashauer and escher 2010 these fluxes themselves depend on several factors ashauer and escher 2010 grech et al 2017 1 the contaminants physicochemical properties and structure 2 the metabolic capacities of the species in question feeding rate respiration and biotransformation capacity and 3 the individuals physiological state depending on their life stage and environmental conditions they have experienced e g environmental contamination temperature or diet disentangling and quantifying the relative importance of chemical environmental and physiological factors underlying this observed variability of individual contamination levels remains a major challenge that is difficult to address by conventional statistical approaches in this context the use of a mechanistic framework for modelling toxicokinetic tk processes is required to predict the evolution of toxicants bioaccumulation dynamics within the frame of global changes more specifically there is a need to develop mechanistic models disentangling the relative effect of ecological physiological and biochemical characteristics and environmental conditions on internal individual concentrations grech et al 2017 mechanistic toxicokinetic tk models aims at predicting organisms contamination by modelling uptake and clearance contaminants flows according to biological flows in most cases these biological flows are considered to be constant and predicted organisms contamination is given at steady state this approach is the simplest one and is useful to compare bioaccumulation between chemicals or species but it is not adapted to fluctuating environmental conditions ashauer et al 2006 to address this issue some tk models have been developed within the conceptual framework of the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 to predict consequences of environmental changes e g temperature food quality or food availability on biological processes that control chemical fluxes see tk models using sub model based on deb theory bodiguel et al 2009 eichinger et al 2010 for one compartment tk models and grech et al 2019 for a physiologically based toxicokinetic model the implementation of a deb tk model was of interest to study the influence of the environment on the internal concentrations to implement in perspective a debtox approach linking contamination levels and potential adverse effects at the individual level debtox models see jager and zimmer 2012 kooijman and bedaux 1996 one of the main strengths of the deb theory is that it allows the modelling of toxic effects on growth reproduction and survival in a consistent and well documented framework see for instance baas et al 2018 for a review on the use of deb models in ecological risk assessment persistent organic pollutants pops are of particular interest when studying bioaccumulation as they are characterised by their persistence in the environment their toxicity and their high bioaccumulative and long range transport potentials polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are compounds from a historical family of pops banned decades ago they are still found in all environmental compartments and their bioaccumulation has long been studied contrary to pcbs perfluoroalkylated substances pfass are of emerging interest and their ecodynamics is still relatively poorly known especially in aquatic environments houde et al 2006 munoz et al 2017a xiao 2017 a better understanding of contaminant transfer processes in aquatic food webs and their controlling factors is required to better assess the environmental and health risks associated with the presence of these xenobiotics amongst hydrosystems coastal and estuarine ecosystems contribute greatly to the economic importance of coastal marine environments costanza et al 1997 for instance numerous marine fish species spend their juvenile phase in estuarine nursery grounds beck et al 2001 able 2005 this phase of their life cycle during which the individuals reach puberty i e defined as the start of energy allocation to reproduction is highly critical for the fitness of the population beck et al 2001 able 2005 rochette et al 2010 however physicochemical factors of estuarine essential habitats are naturally highly variable e g elliott and hemingway 2002 lobry et al 2003 and also particularly affected by anthropogenic pollutions especially pops e g budzinski et al 1997 matthiessen and law 2002 munoz et al 2019 both stress sources can affect juvenile survival growth and health gilliers et al 2004 and consequently population dynamics organic contamination has already been related to nursery dysfunction e g courrat et al 2009 gilliers et al 2006 gilliers et al 2006 in particular growth rates and abundance of juvenile common sole solea solea l from several nursery areas along the french coast were found to be highly correlated with their level of chemical pressure amara et al 2007 gilliers et al 2006 the common sole is thus considered as a relevant model species to study the quality of coastal and estuarine nursery areas in western europe the gironde estuary sw french atlantic coast appears to be a relevant case study to analyse the sensitivity of pops bioaccumulation in juvenile common sole to several gc factors in nursery grounds indeed the question of interactions between environmental changes and contaminations is highly topical in this particular area for at least three reasons first it is one of the largest european estuaries lobry et al 2003 and thus one of the main nursery ground for the atlantic sole stock which is one of the most economically important fish stock for the bay of biscay le pape et al 2003 second abiotic and biotic contamination has been studied for several years for pcbs bodin et al 2014 lauzent 2018 tapie et al 2011 and more recently for pfass munoz et al 2017b 2017a third significant changes in the abundance of flatfish populations hermant et al 2010 pasquaud et al 2012 and in the structure and functioning of the whole food web chevillot et al 2016 chevillot et al 2019 in relation with strong modifications of physicochemical conditions warming and salinization were recently highlighted chaalali et al 2013 in essence the analysis in the present paper aims at determining which factors affected by gc have the highest influence on fish contamination so as to better identify which ones are of particular interest to study future environmental changes for this we used a common sole deb model mounier et al n d coupled with a one compartment tk model to account for the influence of environmental conditions on biological flows and thus on contaminant flows amongst these environmental conditions water temperature chaalali et al 2013 and prey availability chevillot et al 2019 are already affected by local and global modifications and the composition of the sole diet is known to fluctuate with size season and prey availability ballutaud et al 2019 pasquaud 2006 also contamination of the environment and thus of prey is expected to change with the management of pollutant sources the first objective was therefore to describe the sensitivity of juvenile sole growth and pop contamination to the highly variable environmental conditions of estuaries by means of a sensitivity analysis on deb tk in our study we focused on cb153 2 2 4 4 5 5 hexachlorobiphenyl and l pfos linear isomer of perfluorooctane sulfonate as these compounds are the major ones in the natural environment for pcbs and pfass respectively in addition to environmental variability we included tk parameters variability and uncertainty in the sensitivity analysis on fish contamination indeed tk parameters estimated values are also known to be highly variable between studies e g for pcbs kobayashi et al 2011 which also complicates the prediction of fish contamination moreover the uncertainty in these parameters for pfass is high due to the scarce number of related studies finally we compared deb tk predictions of fish contamination by cb153 and l pfos to measurements in juvenile sole from the gironde estuary this allowed assessing the realism of environmental and tk parameters used in modelling scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 general framework of the study the general framework of this study relies on the coupling between a dynamic energy budget deb model and a toxicokinetic tk model on which a global sensitivity analysis sa was conducted to highlight to which tk parameters and environmental inputs of the deb tk affected by gc model outputs of fish growth and contamination are the most sensitive the general articulation between data model inputs model coupling and model outputs used in the present paper is presented in fig 1 we studied the sensitivity of 4 model outputs age at puberty length at puberty and internal contamination of fish when reaching puberty for each of the two contaminants i e cb153 and l pfos as some deb parameters differed between sexes in the model used i e maximum food assimilation rate and maturation threshold at puberty see mounier et al n d especially concerning food ingestion and thus growth and contaminant ingestion we differentiated these 4 predictions by sex which led to 8 model outputs we focused on the puberty stage considering that the growth phase in nursery grounds lasts until puberty which may be the trigger event for fish to leave nursery grounds we used the most recent version of deb model on solea solea developed by mounier et al n d to study bioaccumulation under experimental and in situ conditions the deb parameters were calibrated for each sex of s solea using the latest method for deb parameters estimation and a broad compilation of data from literature for details on structure parameters and calibration of the deb model we encourage the interested reader to refer to mounier et al n d in this materials and methods section we only present the tk model developed considering both uptake and elimination fluxes and how it relates with this deb model tk parameters and the environmental forcings of the deb tk model are listed to perform the sensitivity analysis of the deb tk model predictions we have to know the range of variability associated to each model input i e environmental inputs and tk parameters to determine these ranges environmental data from the gironde estuary was gathered when available from previous field based studies see section 2 3 our strategy to go from raw observations to simulation characteristics for model inputs is presented in section 2 4 next the principles of the global sensitivity analysis sa are presented as the variability of the food contamination input relies on both diet composition and preys contamination variabilities a complementary variance analysis was conducted on food contamination to disentangle the relative influence of these factors for that purpose a nominal value and a range of variability were defined for diet and prey contaminations on a final step model predictions were compared with measurements of cb153 and l pfos contaminations in sole individuals from the gironde estuary 2 2 toxicokinetic model 2 2 1 general principles the mechanistic tk model presented below is a one compartment kinetic model similar to the one presented by arnot and gobas 2004 who related bioaccumulation in an aquatic organism to 6 major routes of chemical uptake and elimination dietary uptake gill uptake gill elimination metabolic transformation faecal egestion and growth dilution the fundamental interest of this deb tk model is to consider non constancy of these different chemical fluxes we used the deb theory kooijman 2010 to predict the variation of chemical fluxes due to environmentally induced variations of metabolic activity ingestion and growth dynamics in the present model no retroaction of contamination level on deb parameters is implemented i e no sub lethal effects of the level of contamination are applied on fish metabolism furthermore as we focus on the juvenile phase the reproduction and thus the transfer to the gametes are not accounted for 2 2 2 model characteristics and equations a more detailed version of tk equation is provided in the supplementary material appendix a this deb tk model only considers dietary uptake where food is a mix of different prey dietary uptake qin in ng of contaminant was related to food contamination cx in ng gfood 1 dw dynamic ingestion rate predicted by the deb model p x ϱ x in gfood dw per day with p x the food ingestion flux in j d 1 and ϱ x the food energy density in j gfood 1 and assimilation efficiency of chemical from food ae in ng of chemical assimilated per ng of chemical ingested ae is the tk parameter that describes the proportion of the chemicals ingested with food that is assimilated by the fish this approach was used in bodiguel et al 2009 and eichinger et al 2010 in this approach contaminants in the faeces represent the non assimilated part of ingested contaminants contaminant elimination was considered using a second tk parameter the elimination rate k e in d 1 that quantifies gill elimination metabolic transformation and faecal elimination i e due to the chemical partition between the organism and the digested food in guts we assumed first order elimination kinetics i e no saturation also as well as other metabolic rates elimination rate is supposed to be affected by temperature see kooijman et al 2009 for general theory and borgå et al 2010 for an application of this principle to the study of climate change impacts on bioaccumulation in a food web thus k e was defined as the daily diminution of the contaminant concentration in fish c in ng cm 3 at the reference temperature t r e f 293 k it was then corrected by the actual temperature t following the same arrhenius

per unit of somatic volume vw in cm3 vw is the sum of the structural volume v and the reserve volume ve computed from the deb model with v e e ϱ e d v which assumes that densities of reserve and

corresponding total weight predicted by the deb model ww 2 2 3 model parameters and forcings the deb model from mounier et al n d is used to predict fish growth in volume vw and weight ww and temperature correction factor ct even though deb parameters are individual specific the sets of estimates are quite homogeneous at the population level as the individuals are genetically close kooijman 2010 thus deb parameters were considered to be constant between individuals in our work on soles from a single study site on the contrary tk parameters depend on many chemical biological and environmental factors however the way in which these factors influence tk parameters is not always well known especially for compounds of emerging interest such as pfass borgå et al 2004 they first depend on the affinity of the chemical to different biomolecules which relies on its physicochemical properties and its structure see for instance ng and hungerbuhler 2014 for pfass and arnot and gobas 2003 for hydrophobic chemicals such as pcbs in relation to this chemical properties tk parameters also depend on fish characteristics such as fish lipid content or fish biotransformation capacity borgå et al 2004 the assimilation efficiency ae also depends on diet assimilation efficiency gobas et al 1999 and especially on the assimilation of the lipid part of the food for pcbs kobayashi et al 2011 and probably for pfass too de vos et al 2008 consequently several sets of empirical values for different fish species are available in the literature see 2 4 5 for details in the present work the variability and uncertainty in the values of the two tk parameters presented above i e ae and k e will be considered only for the studied compounds i e cb153 and l pfos deb tk

coast in sw france the gironde estuary see figure b1 in supplementary material is the largest estuary in western europe lobry et al 2003 recent ecological assessments led to conclude that it is in a poor ecological status courrat et al 2009 delpech et al 2010 in relation in particular with global contamination courrat et al 2009 gilliers et al 2006 consequently the bioaccumulation the trophic magnification and the toxicity potential of several pops are studied there munoz et al 2017a tapie et al 2011 2 3 2 water temperature seasonal and inter annual water temperature data were provided by the high frequency monitoring program of the gironde fluvial estuarine system marel gironde estuary magest http www magest u bordeaux1 fr we used mean daily temperature measured in the central zone of the estuary see map in figure b1 we selected 5 years with a limited number of missing data to be able to compute representative mean annual temperature see figure b2 2 3 3 diet composition the juvenile common sole diet composition and associated variability were obtained from escroc mixing model estimations for the gironde estuarine food web ballutaud et al 2019 five preys were identified in sole diet as a nominal value we used the median values of proportions amongst the different sets of solutions i e 150 000 solutions of possible diet composition standardized to sum to 1 52 8 of gammarids 14 6 of brown shrimp 13 5 of nereis 11 2 of white shrimp and 7 9 of crab see figure b3 2 3 4 juvenile sole and preys contamination preys contamination data cp ng gprey 1 dw from the gironde estuary used in this study came from lauzent 2018 for cb153 and munoz et al 2017a for l pfos see munoz 2015 and munoz et al 2017a for details on sample collections 3 samples per prey species common sole samples from 46 juveniles were collected several years after in the mesohaline zone of the gironde estuary see map in figure b1 all fish samples were weighed and measured their average total length was 15 7 cm min max 8 4 26 5 cm and their average weight was 42 5 g min max 4 9 165 5 g the sample preparation and detailed analytical procedure for pcbs and pfass were published previously lauzent 2018 munoz et al 2017a thompson and budzinski 2000 only 3 samples were measured for each prey thus the distributions of prey contamination are unknown the nominal value for contamination of a given prey was therefore set as the mid range i e the average of the largest and smallest values of observed contamination level the range thresholds were set as the minimum and maximum observed values data summary is provided in section 2 4 6 table 1 and detailed data is represented in figure b4 2 4 model inputs computation and associated uncertainty as environmental conditions are highly variable in space and time in a macrotidal estuary such as the gironde we chose to simplify analyses by setting model simulations with constant environmental forcing variables except for temperature which was modelled as a sinusoid function we assumed that virtual fish were born uncontaminated in this section we presented for each model input 1 how it was computed from environmental data and 2 its associated uncertainty the uncertainty was defined by estimating a range of values i e a minimum and a maximum for each model input due to the low number of samples in the datasets used presented section 2 3 uniform distributions between these ranges were associated with their respective model inputs the model inputs and their associated uncertainty are summarised in table 2 section 2 4 6 2 4 1 average annual temperature temp and birth date birth for modelling purpose the daily temperature dynamics t d was represented by a sinusoid to account for seasonal variations 1 t d t a s i n 2 π 365 d φ with t the average annual temperature a the amplitude and φ the phase expressed in days t was computed for each year selected from the temperature dataset listed in the section 2 3 2 the amplitude a was fixed to 9 c i e the approximated mean amplitude value observed in the gironde estuary temperature time series in section 2 3 2 φ value was used to model the influence of temperature life history related to the settlement date on deb tk predictions to reproduce the phase shift necessary to make d 0 corresponding to the 1st of january φ had to be equal to 240 days thus for a given fish φ was calculated as 240 plus the day of the year at birth within the spawning season the temperature conditions experienced by an individual during its nursery phase depend on both the year of birth and the settlement date they thus can be variable at the annual year of birth and seasonal settlement date levels indeed average annual temperature can vary by several degrees in the gironde estuary see 2 3 2 and table 2 in 2 4 6 inter annual variability is obtained by considering t variations between years using in situ data presented above minimum and maximum values of t were respectively 14 7 c and 16 3 c also the common sole is a batch spawner with a large spawning season in the bay of biscay deniel 1990 thus the environmental conditions encountered in the estuary by the individuals from the earlier and the later batches may also differ in our case the spawning season is known to last for several months i e from early december to late march with a peak in late january and early february amara et al 1994 consequently birth date range was december 1 i e 335th day of the year march 31 i e 90th day of the year as a simplification we assumed that larval drift duration was the same during all the spawning season see supplementary material appendix c figure c1 for a graphical representation of birth date influence on temperature sinusoid experienced in the estuary after settlement 2 4 2 food availability avail the deb parameter used to describe food availability is the scaled functional response hereafter symbolized f f is considered constant over life and its value can be approximated by dividing the asymptotic length observed in the studied environment linf by the theoretical maximal length that an animal can attain if food is not limited lmax kooijman 2010 in the absence of age length relationship for the studied population from the gironde estuary it was not possible however to estimate f in our case study we thus assumed that f was similar to the one for the douarnenez bay s population brittany nw french coast for which a large set of age length data were available the food availability encountered all over the juvenile period in the estuary may differ from one individual to another depending for instance on their different locations in the estuary during this period thus to obtain the range of f values we divided the minimum 41 cm and maximum 47 cm total lengths of fully grown males over 15 years old n 8 from douarnenez bay deniel 1981 by the total length of the largest one ever observed 75 cm male http www fishbase org thus f was supposed to be between 0 547 and 0 627 2 4 3 food quality quality the deb parameter used to describe food quality is the food energy density ϱ x j gfood 1 dw it is a combination of diet composition and prey energy density ϱ x was computed for each diet composition solution from the corresponding dry mass proportion of preys fp in the diet see section 2 3 3 and from dry energy density of each prey species ϱ p j gprey 1 dw as follows 2 ϱ x p 1 5 ϱ p f p as ϱ p values were not reported in literature for the gironde estuary case study we used values of corresponding species from a databank of conversion factors updated in 2012 brey 2001 brey et al 2010 15 770 j g 1 dw for gammarids 17 396 j g 1 dw for brown shrimp 17 359 j g 1 dw for nereis 19 319 for white shrimp and 11 887 j g 1 dw for crab ϱ p was considered constant but diet composition was variable indeed diet composition can modulate food quality as the different preys do not provide the same energy ϱ x range was fixed to the minimum and maximum values computed from the results of ϱ x for all diet composition solutions provided by escroc n 150 000 ϱ x estimates ranged from 14 047 to 18 034 j gfood 1 dw 2 4 4 food contamination contam food contamination level cx ng gfood 1 dw is a combination of diet composition and prey contamination it was computed using the formula 3 c x p 1 5 c p f p where cp is the concentration in the prey p ng gprey 1 dw and fp is the dry mass proportion of prey p in the diet diet composition can also modulate food contamination as the different preys do not contain the same amount of contaminant see 2 3 4 thus we computed cx for each diet composition solution n 150 000 see section 2 3 3 with either the minima or the maxima contamination observed for each prey see section 2 3 4 for preys contamination the lower and upper boundaries for food contamination were fixed to the minimum and maximum cx values computed respectively i e 3 3 24 5 ng g 1 dw for cb153 and 6 2 79 3 ng g 1 dw for l pfos 2 4 5 tk parameters ae and k e tk parameters input values and associated variability were gathered from literature kobayashi et al 2011 fisk et al 1998 and buckman et al 2004 for cb153 and hassell et al 2019 goeritz et al 2013 and martin et al 2003 for the pfos for several fish species because no specific data s on sole were found for assimilation efficiency ae estimates for pcbs were compiled by kobayashi et al 2011 and were ranging from 0 26 to 1 for cb153 most previous estimates of fish tk parameters for pfos were estimated at the carcass level and reported high but non realistic estimates for ae i e ae 100 from martin et al 2003a thus by default we retained 1 as the higher value of the range the lower bound was provided by hassell et al 2019 for l pfos at the whole body level it was computed as the estimate minus 1 96 times the associated standard error this led to a range of ae values from 0 53 to 1 for the l pfos the elimination rate k e values were compiled from buckman et al 2004 and fisk et al 1998 for cb153 and goeritz et al 2013 hassell et al 2019 and martin et al 2003 for pfos a range for k e was calculated using the estimate provided by the authors 1 96 times the associated standard error when the latter was provided these different k e values were obtained under different temperature conditions varying from 8 to 17 5 c depending on the studies hence to be compared with each other the estimates from the different sources were corrected to be given at 20 c i e the reference temperature for the arrhenius correction see temperature correction parameter estimates from mounier et al n d we considered the minimum and maximum values estimated at 20 c as the range of variation of k e i e 0 45 2 24 for cb153 and 5 22 11 28 for pfos all in 10 2 d 1 2 4 6 summary of model input data model input nominal values and ranges are summarized in table 1 for preys characteristics the ranges of variation of other environmental variables and tk parameters are given in table 2 2 5 sensitivity analyses 2 5 1 global sensitivity analysis 2 5 1 1 general principle a global sensitivity analysis was implemented to assess which were the inputs whose variability mainly explains the outputs variability it also allows detecting interactions between model inputs and provides sensitivity results considering the entire input space this global sensitivity analysis was performed using the variance based sobol method saltelli et al 2010 it is a model independent method that allows estimating within a probabilistic framework the contribution of each model input variance and of their interactions to the unconditional variance of a model output sobol first order indice si quantifies the sensitivity of a model output variance to the main effect of a model input it thus measures the effect of varying this particular input alone considering variations in other input parameters by construction si indices sum to 1 for a given model output the more a si value is close to 1 for a particular input parameter the more sensitive is the model output variance to this input variance the sobol total index sti considers the contribution to the output variance of all variance caused by a given input and its interactions thus the difference between si and sti values for a given input output couple provide information about the sensitivity of the output variance to interactions of the given input with all the other inputs combined 2 5 1 2 computation to estimate both si and sti indices at the same time we used jansen estimators jansen 1999 with improved formulas from saltelli et al 2010 computed using the soboljansen function from r package sensitivity iooss et al 2019 this function computes the monte carlo estimation of the sobol indices using two independent input matrices with n rows the random sample size n 10 000 and p columns the number of inputs p 4 for growth outputs i e birth temp avail quality p 7 for contamination outputs i e idem contam ae ke in both matrices every row represents a possible set of input values for the deb tk model to build these matrices we optimised model inputs combinations using scrambled sobol sequences i e quasi random low discrepancy sequences with both owen and faure tezuka type of scrambling computed using the sobol function from the r package randtoolbox dutang and savicky 2009 each model inputs values were transposed from 0 to 1 sampling to their respective ranges defined in the section 2 4 these lower and upper limits table 2 were defined either to cover the variability of environmental conditions observed in the gironde estuary or to cover the uncertainty in tk parameter values in order to compute sobol indices outputs are predicted for each row of the matrices and returned by the function each row corresponds to one fish simulated with a constant value for each model input given in the matrix to assess confidence intervals on the estimation of sobol indices bootstrapping with resampling was used within the soboljansen function the n samples used for the model evaluations were 250 times sampled with replacement whereby for each resampling the function computes sobol indices to obtain the 95 confidence intervals for si and sti values 2 5 2 complementary variance analysis on food contamination food contamination variability used as a model input to calculate the sobol indices is actually a compound variable see 2 4 4 its variability mixes variabilities of the diet composition and the individual contaminations of each of the 5 preys see 2 3 3 and 2 3 4 respectively to disentangle the relative influence of the contamination of each prey on the contamination of sole a complementary analysis was thus required for this particular complementary analysis we introduced 6 dummy variables the first dummy variable is set to 1 to indicate that the diet composition is variable while a 1 indicates that the diet composition is fixed to its nominal value the 5 other dummy variables correspond to each of the 5 preys a 1 indicates that the corresponding prey contamination is set to its nominal value while a 1 indicates that it is variable to explore the effects main and interactions of each of these 6 sources of variability we generated an orthogonal fractional factorial 2 level design of resolution v using the frf2 function from the eponym r package grömping 2014 with the 6 dummy variables as factor of the design it permits to obtain the smallest necessary experimental design i e smallest number of factors combination to be computed which was here composed of 32 runs instead of 64 for the full factorial design each experiment is composed of a particular combination of the different 2 level factors i e 1 or 1 values for the 6 factors for each experiment the model was run with 50 000 different sets of parameters values according to the following rule the value of a parameter was set to its nominal value for the 50 000 runs if the corresponding dummy variable equals 1 if the corresponding dummy variable equal 1 then 50 000 values were uniformly drawn between min and max values for contamination of species while 50 000 diet compositions were randomly sampled from the posterior distribution see section 2 3 3 for diet composition finally from these model predictions a variance analysis was carried out to assess the contribution of the different considered environmental variables and their interactions to food contamination variance 2 6 model predictions vs in situ measurements finally model predictions were compared to in situ measurements following two steps as a first step we graphically compared contamination levels measured in fish from the gironde estuary see 2 3 4 with distribution of deb tk predictions of contamination at puberty computed for the purpose of the sobol indices estimations by doing this we were able to compare variability of field concentrations with the variability of predicted concentrations due to variability and uncertainty of model inputs i e environmental variables and tk parameters for comparison purpose with measurements model predictions of contamination at puberty were associated with the predicted range of length at puberty from the same analysis on a second step we addressed model predictions with different scenarios of fixed values of tk parameters a worst case scenario of chemical bioaccumulation with tk parameters classically used in ecological risk assessment models ae 1 and k e 0 two scenarios from experimental estimates from goeritz et al 2013 for the pfos estimated for the rainbow trout ae 0 721 and k e 5 8 10 2 d 1 at 20 c from mounier et al n d for the cb153 applied to the common sole ae 0 8 and k e 0 d 1 a scenario from de vos et al 2008 who explored the behaviour of pfos uptake and elimination using the bioaccumulation model omega ae 0 8 i e uptake comparable to moderately hydrophobic compounds and k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 i e elimination best described by elimination kinetics of metals non specified temperature value applied directly for these scenarios as tk parameters were fixed the variability considered only relied on environmental forcings variability practically we built matrices in the same way as for the sobol method each line or sample corresponded to a possible combination of input variables we computed contamination predictions at puberty for these samples and confronted them with data in the same way as presented in the first paragraph for each step model fit was assessed comparing 1 the minimums and maximums values of predictions and measurements and 2 the median of predictions i e the distribution reflecting notably the diet composition distribution and its consequences on food contamination with the average value of all measurements i e regardless of fish size 2 7 implementation sensitivity analyses and deb tk simulations were implemented using r language r core team 2017 version 3 6 1 and the integrated development environment ide r studio version 1 2 5019 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis no major influence of sex was found in the global analysis results are thus only presented here for females detailed results for each sex can be found in supplementary material appendix d table d1 si and sti estimates for biological outputs fig 2 were very close si sti 0 9 which indicates little interactions between model inputs the main contributor to age and length variance was the variability in food quality si 0 68 and to a much lesser extent in food availability si 0 2 by contrast age at puberty was slightly sensitive to average annual temperature si 0 09 and nearly not affected by birth date si 0 02 global sensitivity of contamination predictions to environmental inputs variability were similar for cb153 and l pfos and close to zero apart from food contamination si and sti 0 01 see fig 2 food contamination was the major contributor to fish contamination variance si 0 38 and 0 7 for cb153 and l pfos respectively for cb153 food contamination was closely followed by the two tk parameters si 0 26 and 0 23 for k e and ae respectively in contrast the influence of food contamination is much higher than tk parameters for l pfos si 0 14 and 0 09 for k e and ae respectively nevertheless for both chemical the influence of k e variability was higher than the influence of ae variability for both these influent inputs and both chemicals sti values were different from si values si sti around 0 75 indicating interactions between inputs the distributions predicted for each output are presented in fig 3 considering the range of environmental variability accounted in this study age at puberty predicted for the purpose of the computation of sobol indices varied by one year i e between 1 6 to 2 7 years old with a median value of 2 2 years old estimates for length at puberty varied from 20 9 to 22 3 cm with a median value of 21 7 cm when considering both environmental and tk parameters variability contamination levels in fish varied by a factor 54 to 124 for l pfos and cb153 respectively between 0 1 and 5 4 ng g 1 ww and between 0 1 and 12 4 ng g 1 ww respectively contrary to biological outputs the median of estimated values for contaminations outputs 1 9 and 1 4 ng g 1 ww for cb153 and l pfos respectively were close to the minimal values 3 2 variance analysis on food contamination since food contamination is one of the main factor influencing the model outputs it was crucial to disentangle the relative effect of diet composition and respective prey contaminations fig 4 almost all the variance 90 in food contamination was induced by only two factors unsurprisingly the variability in diet composition explained 39 and 50 of food contamination variance for cb153 and l pfos respectively for cb153 the variability of contamination levels in gammarids the main prey of sole juveniles explained almost all the remaining variance 57 whereas for l pfos it was nereis i e nereis diversicolor the most contaminated prey species for this contaminant 45 the influence of the other factors was therefore considered as negligible the residual variance that could be associated to interactions was also negligible 5 3 3 data comparison to model predictions when considering environmental and tk parameters variability fish contamination levels were underestimated for both chemicals compared to in situ measurements fig 5 and table 3 levels were underestimated by a factor 3 5 for l pfos and 3 9 for cb153 the maximum values were less underestimated for cb153 factor 1 5 than for l pfos factor 2 4 the minimums were much more underestimated than the maximums i e by a factor 9 and 18 for l pfos and cb153 respectively with the worst case scenario fig 6 a the distributions of the model predictions for cb153 and the observations were similar table 3 even though the upper part of the contamination distribution was higher than the highest measurement on the contrary l pfos contamination was overestimated by a factor 10 table 3 for the experiments scenarios fig 6 b predicted contamination level and range of variability with tk parameters used by mounier et al n d were consistent with observations for cb153 for l pfos predictions with the estimates from goeritz et al 2013 underestimated both level and range of contamination finally de vos et al 2008 scenario fig 6 c produced the best model fit for l pfos with an overestimation of contamination by a factor 2 for both mean level and range of variability 4 discussion 4 1 main goals and outcomes the first aim of this study was to prioritize the influence of the environmental factors involved in global change on the variance of biological traits and contamination level at puberty of juvenile common sole from the gironde estuary for this purpose we developed a mechanistic tk model by combining last updated deb model on s solea with a basic one compartment tk model this allowed to mechanistically model the relative influence of these environmental factors i e water temperature food quality food availability on biological traits that themselves combined with food contamination influence bioaccumulation the analyses conducted in this paper highlighted that diet composition through food energy density and food contamination was the key environmental factor influencing both juvenile sole growth and contamination variabilities as it is a rather opportunistic feeder species cabral 2000 future global change studies should focus on constructing credible scenarios for the future evolution of benthos populations in order to deduce possible changes in the diet of the common sole the second aim was to compare the influence of these environmental factors with that of tk parameters uncertainty on the variability of fish contamination levels finally several scenarios of tk parameters were tested with the model to determine which one would give the best fit to the cb153 and l pfos contamination data of the gironde estuary our results also underlined the strong influence of the tk parameters ae and k e on sole contamination estimations and the importance of using correct values for each chemical species and environment a major direct influence of temperature was shown on age at puberty but not on fish contamination 4 2 sex difference in juvenile ingestion does not influence sole contamination first of all results were obtained for each sex as the deb model used considers sex specific parameters mounier et al n d including one related to food ingestion throughout the entire lifecycle which directly influences dietary contamination in the present work focusing on the juvenile phase spent in nursery grounds the influence of these sex differences on fish contamination was found negligible this result support the assumption that sex differences in fish contamination observed in adults are rather due to sex differences in contaminant elimination through gametes emission than to a differential accumulation during their juvenile phase in contaminated areas bodiguel et al 2009 loizeau and abarnou 1994 peng et al 2010 shi et al 2018 it emphasizes the necessity to use of a deb model considering sex differences especially those regarding gametes emission see mounier et al n d to study fish contamination at the lifecycle scale and sex specific impact of reproduction 4 3 the major role of diet composition food quality based on prey energy density and diet composition was found to be the main factor influencing life history traits of age and length at puberty in our approach the variability of food quality is only due to the diet composition variability the diet variability also appeared to be a major factor influencing food contamination variance for both chemicals and food contamination was the only environmental factor significantly influencing fish contamination variance for both chemicals fish diet was already put forward for biomagnified compounds as a factor that may be responsible for the variability in bioaccumulation between individuals sites and seasons for pcbs masset et al 2019 stapleton et al 2002 van der oost et al 2003 and between fish species for pfass babut et al 2017 diet modifications influence on juvenile sole growth and contamination is all the more topical that in the gironde estuary as in several other ones shifts in ecological communities e g chaalali 2013 chaalali et al 2013a chevillot et al 2016 for the gironde and food web structure and functioning e g chevillot et al 2018 for the gironde tecchio et al 2016 for the seine have been highlighted in relation with global changes and we can assume that if prey abundances are affected by global change common sole diet is expected to change and adapt as sole is rather an opportunistic feeder species pasquaud et al 2010 this feeding behaviour adaptation of the juvenile sole as a function of prey abundance has been demonstrated in the tagus estuary cabral and costa 1999 results from the variance analysis on food contamination indicated the strong influence of gammarids and nereis contamination in cb153 and l pfos respectively nereis is the most consumed prey all year round whereas gammarids are mainly found in the stomachs of sole in spring pasquaud 2006 as a consequence seasonal fluctuations in the gironde estuarine soles diet could have different effects on the two studied chemicals these seasonal variations of food contamination due to variations of diet composition may also enhance the influence of birth date on fish contamination as birth date affects the time of the season when the individual settles in the estuary 4 4 substantial direct impact of temperature on the age puberty our results highlighted that the direct influence of temperature on growth rates induce substantial changes of the age at puberty that could lead to substantial consequences at the population level indeed the implemented variability of the average annual temperature i e a range of 1 6 c was responsible for nearly 11 of the variance of age at puberty as puberty was predicted to vary between 18 and 32 months for females considering all the environmental variability an increase of 1 6 c of the average temperature alone could lead to a decrease of several months in the age puberty e g 17 days for 0 16 c see local sensitivity in supplementary material appendix e such increase of mean annual temperature is a realistic scenario in the context of climate change as during the last 3 decades the water temperature of the gironde estuary already increased by about 2 c chaalali 2013 le treut 2013 as deb models can describe the full life cycle of an individual by combining it with different population models charles et al 2009 jager and klok 2010 this modelling framework allows studying the consequences at the population level of such modifications of female age at puberty our results showed that direct impact of temperature on fish metabolism does not affect fish contamination at puberty indeed considering deb model properties although temperature significantly influences growth rate it does not affect the state variable values at a given point of development e g the length at puberty because it affects each energy flux in the same way however temperature can have indirect impacts on fish by modifying for instance prey distribution and consequently diet composition which could induce changes in age length and contamination at puberty thus the global influence of temperature on fish contamination is difficult to predict simply due to direct and indirect effects on metabolism and ecological traits 4 5 tk parameters estimates 4 5 1 variability of tk parameters tk parameters variability was shown to be more influent on fish contamination variability than environmental factors with the exception of food contamination moreover for cb153 they were almost as influent as food contamination it highlights the importance of the tk parameter values used to study global change influence on fish contamination indeed the amplitude of tk parameters values from the literature reflects both the uncertainty of the estimates from experimental data and the variability due to the different species studied and the experimental conditions used thus the variability considered on tk parameters estimates may reflect the influence of both environmental e g temperature and food composition and biological variabilities e g length and specific metabolic capacities on the chemical fluxes most of these factors are already included in the mechanistic models equations and parameters thus in the present analysis the variability on chemical flux predicted considered both environmental variability from the model and the environmental biological variability implicitly included in tk estimates from literature consequently the apparent strong influence of tk parameters variability mostly indicates that tk estimates must be chosen and wisely chosen from the literature for this particular type of model application in our results unlike cb153 l pfos food contamination was by far the major factor influencing fish contamination compared to tk parameters this difference may be due to the much larger range of food contamination levels for l pfos than for cb153 factor 3 5 reducing the influence of tk parameters comparatively to the one of food contamination thus variability in food contamination can have a greater or lesser impact on fish contamination depending on the chemical the variance analysis showed that for l pfos the variance of nereis contamination supported half of the variance of food contamination however only 3 measurements of nereis contamination were performed and the large range of contamination was mostly dependant on only one sample with particularly high contamination level figure b4 consequently further studies on prey contamination may be necessary to exclude that tk parameters uncertainty is not as important as food contamination variability for l pfos too 4 5 2 uncertainty of tk parameters estimates for s solea in estuarine environment our results highlighted the high variability of tk parameters in the literature and the difficulty to use them in natural environment studies indeed considering the whole range of tk parameters estimates from literature led to an underestimation of fish contamination level and variability in our case study results from the sensitivity analyses i e the global one presented in the main document and the one step at a time local analysis from the supplementary material appendix e highlighted that an underestimation of fish contamination level could be due to several factors there were interactions between food contamination ae and k e values as food contamination was estimated from prey measurements from the gironde estuary we assume that they are reliable on the contrary tk parameters were taken from a large review of the literature since the values of ae and k e interact on fish contamination it was not possible to dissociate the effects of each parameter and to estimate them from in situ contamination data to do so we would have needed contamination decontamination data from controlled experimental conditions i e k e is the only parameter involved in fish contamination kinetics during the decontamination period however we can assume from our results that the underestimation of fish contamination may be rather due to too high values of elimination rate or to the omission of other uptake routes as the maximum value of assimilation efficiency parameter i e full assimilation was included in the range used for simulations moreover results of data comparison to model predictions with the worst case scenario full assimilation and no elimination showed that the hypothesis of too high values of elimination rate is the most likely one for both compounds this conclusion of a smaller error of the model on the assimilation flow i e efficiency from diet assimilation and or other routes of exposure compared to elimination flow is also consistent with the knowledge that exchanges with water through gills can be neglected for highly lipophilic compounds i e with an octanol water partition coefficient logkow larger than 6 6 mackay and fraser 2000 like cb153 logkow 6 92 hawker and connell 1988 moreover this pcb congener does not have any precursor that could be biotransformed into cb153 by the fish metabolism finally the assumption of an overestimation of the elimination flux is also supported by the satisfactory model fits to experimental contamination of s solea in mounier et al n d and to in situ measurements in the present paper both using tk values with no elimination from mounier et al n d pfos is known to be mainly associated with the particulate phase in estuarine environment which reduces exposure via respiration munoz et al 2017b another likely source of uptake might be considered for pfos the biotransformation of precursors themselves accumulated from the environment babut et al 2017 martin et al 2010 yet considering pfos estimates from de vos et al 2008 led to higher fish contamination levels without considering these other sources of pfos consequently an overestimation of k e for pfos may more likely be responsible for fish contamination underestimation indeed de vos et al 2008 in a modelling exercise showed that pfos elimination was best described by mimicking elimination kinetics of metals and used an empirical value of k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 thus a 7 fold lower value compared to the minimum threshold of the range used in the present analysis using de vos et al 2008 values i e ae 0 8 and k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 pfos contamination would only be overestimated by a factor 2 moreover the overestimation with these parameters was likely as the authors also reported that these values led to an overestimation of bioaccumulation factors this indicates that the elimination rate of pfos in our case study is likely to lie between the one used for metals by de vos et al 2008 k e 0 8 10 2 d 1 and the lower bound of the range defined from literature estimates k e 5 2 10 2 d 1 which is close to the one from goeritz et al 2013 overall the results reflect that k e values from literature were too high for our species of interest in our case study context yet there was no information about sole in the literature cited according to arnot et al 2008 the inherent variability amongst species and conditions life stage and sex is not well understood while estimates for most chemicals are derived from only one or two tests it could lead to significantly high estimation uncertainty thus available data in literature probably do not allow for general conclusions about differences in k e values between species routes of exposure and environments to conclude the use of non informative tk parameter values like the common worst case scenario showed that depending on the chemical studied predictions may greatly overestimate fish contamination and thus probably toxic effects in future works to select the best informative tk estimates from the literature and use it properly in such mechanistic models it should be necessary to consider the closest species possible as even amongst fish between common sole and rainbow trout from goeritz et al 2013 results showed that tk parameters seems to differ for l pfos however the underestimation of sole contamination using goeritz et al 2013 estimates for l pfos could come from environmental differences rather than from species specific capacities indeed results showed that elimination rate in sole from the gironde estuary is lower than the one from rainbow trouts from goeritz et al experiment however food contamination was greatly higher in the experiment 500 ng g 1 dw compared to in situ contamination 6 2 79 3 ng g 1 dw and elimination rate is concentration dependant thus the use of tk parameters estimated from contamination decontamination experiment should be preceded by an adaptation of the estimates to this mechanistic model to do so it should be necessary to have as much information as possible on the experimental design and results used to acquire the estimates e g water temperature food composition and assimilation by the studied species

24823,cyanobacteria dominance threats ecological integrity and diminishes ecological service of lakes throughout the world variety kinds of chemical and physical environmental factors have been used to model cyanobacteria condition in lakes except biological environmental factors essential resources competition plays a central role in shaping algae community in lakes cyanobacteria and diatoms are assumed to have conserved species functional traits and use resources and habitats in similar ways therefore diatom metric inferred total phosphorus based on diatoms di tp could be a valuable predictor for cyanobacteria biomass in lakes with data sets from the 2007 national lakes assessment nla of the us environmental protection agency we compared the performance of di tp with tp and other predictors on predicting cyanobacteria biomass cbb by boost regression tree analysis in around 1 000 lakes in light of effects of lake types and diverse cyanobacteria functional groups on model performance we did a priori classification on lakes based on lakes types deep shallow natural man made lakes and cyanobacteria functional groups bloom forming potential toxigenic heterocyst producing and potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria our results showed 1 di tp was informative for modeling cbb in different lake types or various cyanobacteria functional groups but its importance was not as significant as traditional tp 2 performance of di tp on modeling cbb was better in deep man made lakes than in shallow natural lakes 3 di tp performed better on modeling the biomass of potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria than other functional groups of cyanobacteria the lower importance of di tp could be caused by different sampling locations of diatom and cyanobacteria from a same site the uneven distribution of number of shallow lakes along tp gradient could contribute to a better performance of di tp on predicting cbb in deep lakes than in shallow lakes in man made lakes a shorter water residence helped diatoms coexist with cyanobacteria and contributed to a better performance of di tp on predicting cbb we conclude that di tp performed better on modeling cbb in deep man made lakes and potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria biomass further studies are needed to thoroughly assess the valuableness of di tp on predicting cbb in lakes graphicalabstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria diatoms resource competition total phosphorus boost regression tree national lake assessment 1 introduction cyanobacteria dominance threats ecological integrity of lakes and reduces ecosystem goods and services provided by lakes such as cultural aesthetic and provisions fristachi and sinclair 2008 griffiths and saker 2003 nutrient input reduction is the most direct simple and economically feasible cyanobacteria management strategy nutrient predictors either phosphorus nitrogen concentration downing et al 2001 håkanson et al 2007 or ratio of phosphorus to nitrogen schindler 1977 smith 1983 1986 were found to have a great influence on cyanobacteria dominance in lakes meanwhile harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters were favored by rising temperatures enhanced vertical stratification of aquatic ecosystems and alterations in seasonal and interannual weather patterns paerl and huisman 2009 beaulieu et al 2013 found increases in temperature and nitrogen were as important as phosphorus on predicting cyanobacterial biomass in lakes therefore cyanobacteria dominance typically is controlled by a suit of chemical physical which interact synergistically and or antagonistically paerl 2014 however rarely were biological factors used to model cyanobacteria condition in lakes for management purpose it is of great importance to accurately evaluate and refine the relative importance of environmental variables on modeling cyanobacteria biomass in lakes species functional traits of diatoms and cyanobacteria are assumed to be conserved across phylogeneies and they use resources and habitats in similar ways so they compete more strongly with one another than with more distant relatives tilman et al 1982 mittelbach 2012 therefore diatom metric might be a good indicator for modeling cyanobacteria condition in lakes r is the minimum amount of resource r that a consumer species requires to maintain a stable population at a given mortality rate mittelbach 2012 fogg 1973 found blue green species has a lower r on nitrogen while diatom has a lower r on phosphorus tilman et al 1982 grover 1989 figure 1 a diatoms and cyanobacteria cannot coexist on one limiting resource either phosphorus or nitrogen and the one that can maintain positive growth at the lowest resource concentration lowest r will win in competition if phosphorus nitrogen concentration fluctuates over time spatial heterogeneity in the supply of resources in lakes can allow diatoms and cyanobacteria to coexist on two limiting resources strong resource competition between diatoms and cyanobacteria could be helpful for modeling cyanobacteria with diatom metric in lakes secondly diatom can integrate effects of variety kinds of chemical and physical environmental factors so diatom inferred total phosphorus di tp can more accurately assess bioavailable phosphorus orthophosphate than direct measurement of tp smol and stoermer 2010a di tp can better characterize environmental conditions than tp and can better reflect cladophora accumulation conditions than averaged measured tp in streams of michigan and kentucky of the us smol and stoermer 2010a thirdly di tp had a much lower root mean square error than the commonly observed tp concentration range in streams pan et al 1996 the 2007 national lakes assessment nla project of the usepa which collected empirical data for more than 1 000 lakes provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of di tp on modeling cyanobacteria biomass in lakes to the best of our knowledge we have not seen any earlier works on evaluating di tp on predicting cyanobacteria biomass in around 1000 lakes a priori classification on general lake types deep versus shallow natural versus man made could be helpful for modeling cyanobacteria biomass in lakes firstly nutrients concentrations in lakes are not only affected by human disturbance but also by hydrogeomorphic features and lakes origin related factors wetzel 2001 soranno et al 2008 2010 internal nutrient loading from sediment into water column between deep lakes and shallow lakes is generally different wetzel 2001 tp in lakes was found to have a close relationship with maximum depth of lakes and bedrock geology variables such as percent of carbonate hard rock iron etc soranno et al 2008 2010 on the other hand taranu et al 2012 and beaulieu et al 2013 found cyanobacteria biomass is more predictable in deep lakes than in shallow lakes one possible explanation is that cyanobacteria is sensitive to water level changes which are larger in shallow lakes kalff 2002 differences in water residence time of lakes e g natural lakes versus reservoir can also affect phytoplankton community structure carvalho et al 2011 our results based on a long sediment core of muskegon lake mi usa which receives 95 of its input from one river and is with only a 23 d average retention time showed diatom species composition especially planktonic diatoms in the core was significantly affected by the upstream river liu et al 2018 compared with benthic cyanobacteria e g lyngbya planktonic cyanobacteria e g microcystis and aphanizomenon are supposed to experience different nutrient concentrations in lakes moreover some cyanobacteria mainly heterocyst producing cyanobacteria have lower r on nitrogen and higher compensation point of phosphorus than other cyanobacteria because they can fix nitrogen themselves figure 1b therefore different algae groups are supposed to respond to nutrients in different ways and classifying cyanobacteria before the data analysis could allow response patterns to be seen more clearly on the other hand stakeholders are more concerned on those cyanobacteria which are most related with their benefits such as toxigenic bloom forming blue green algae etc griffiths and saker 2003 fristachi and sinclair 2008 in addition allelopathic substances on the cell surface of microalgae could affect interaction among different algae liu et al 2007 and may further influence the prediction ability of using one group to model another all these factors call for a priori classification on cyanobacteria for an accurate evaluation on the performance of diatom metrics on modeling cyanobacteria condition in lakes after cyanobacteria functional groups classification beaulieu et al 2013 found total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn had a better performance on modeling biomass of cyanobacteria which can fix n2 than those which cannot in the present study we evaluated the importance of di tp on predicting cyanobacteria biomass cbb for general lake types shallow vs deep lake and natural lakes vs reservoirs and different cyanobacteria functional groups with the 2007 nla data sets of the usepa based on an extensive literature survey our three hypotheses are 1 compared to the performance of di tp in streams rivers condition assessment inferred tp based on surface sediment diatoms in lakes performs better on modeling cbb than tp 2 di tp performs better on predicting cbb in deep lakes than in shallow lakes and 3 di tp can explain larger amount of biomass variation of potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria than other functional groups of cyanobacteria to do this firstly we reconstructed di tp using the 2007 nla surface sediment diatom data then we classified lakes according to their depth and origin thirdly we calculated the biomass and grouped counted cyanobacteria bloom forming potential toxigenic heterocyst producing and potential n2 fixing finally a suit of natural predictors water temperature ph di tp total nitrogen total phosphorus ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus conductivity and water depth were selected to model all cbb and biomass of each site group to

naphrax six hundred diatom valves were identified to species level when possible and counted at 1000 magnification for diatom counting the qa qc and harmonization process was conducted as well to make sure the similarity between two taxonomists was not lower than 85 usepa 2007b 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 calculating diatom tp optima and di tp reconstruction di tp concentrations were calculated using relative abundances of diatom taxa in the surficial sediments of lakes and measured tp concentrations were natural log transformed to meet conditions of normality weighted average models were developed to calculate inferred ln tp concentrations with relative abundances of diatom taxa in samples their tp optima and methods of ter braak and van dame 1989 tp optima for diatom taxa were determined using the surface sediment diatoms and the ln tp of all lakes in the usepa s 2007 nla data set the tp optimum for a diatom taxon is a weighted average of tp concentration weighted by the relative abundance of that taxon in a set of lakes the tp optima for taxa were calculated by calculating the product of the proportional relative abundances of a diatom taxon times the tp concentration in each lake in a set of lakes summing those products for all lakes in the set and then dividing that sum of products by the sum of proportional relative abundances of that species in the set of lakes tp optima were calculated for all taxa having 5 observations in lakes of the 2007 nla project the weighted average model for tp concentration in a lake is then calculated by calculating the products of matched tp optima and proportional relative abundances of each taxon in the sample from that lake with known tp optima summing those products for all taxa with known tp optima and then dividing that sum of products by the sum of proportional relative abundances of all taxa with known tp optima in that sample the weighted average model for di tp was calibrated with tp optima and relative abundance data for two thirds of the selected nla samples the model was tested with data from the other third of the nla samples because weighted averages were taken twice one in the regression step and the other in the calibration step and thus resulted in shrinkage of the range of inferred tp values function deshrink from r package analogue was used to deshrink weighted averages estimates 2 2 2 lake types classification blue green algae classification and biomass calculation to be consistent with a global lake survey kosten et al 2012 and a similar study conducted in the nla lakes data set beaulieu et al 2013 we used 6 m as a cutoff depth to classify deep and shallow lakes and evaluated how cyanobacterial response models differed in deep and shallow lakes lakes origin data based on which lakes were classified as man made or natural lakes were from the 2007 nla dataset four cyanobacteria functional groups bloom forming potential toxigenic heterocyst producing and potential n2 fixing were classified using the functional classification of cronberg and annodotter 2006 supplementary table 1 both genera of cyanobacteria capable of producing heterocysts and genera with representatives that have been shown to fix dinitrogen in the absence of heterocysts were included in the category of potential n2 fixing taxa bergman et al 1997 average cell volumes for each cyanobacterial group were estimated by using dimensions from taxonomic references komárek and anagnostidis 1998 2008 2012 cronberg and annodotter 2006 the cell volume range of a species was then determined by formulas provided by hillebrand et al 1999 the median volume within this range was used as the estimated cell volume for each taxon the median value of all the documented species within that genus was used to estimate cell biovolume for counts identified to genus level for each sample total cyanobacterial biovolume was determined by summing the estimated biovolume for each taxon recorded cyanobacteria biovolume estimates were then converted into biomass by assuming a specific gravity of 1 g cm 3 beaulieu et al 2013 2 2 3 modeling cbb in lakes data sets subsetting and basic calculation were conducted by access 2016 because boost regression tree brt can model the effects of many different covariates while allowing for nonlinear responses and interactions among variables elith et al 2008 brt analysis was used to model cbb in lakes and it was computed by r r version 3 0 3 www r project org brt models were run using the script provided by elith et al 2008 and the gbm package version 1 5 7 in r was developed by ridgeway 2006 in the function of gbm step laplace was used to minimize the absolute error of modeling because the natural log transformed cbb in lakes is a continuous variable based on literature searching results nine predictor variables were used to predict cbb in lakes which were surface water temperature mean water temperature in upmost 2 m mean ph in upmost 2 m tn tp ratio of tn to tp conductivity maximum lake depth and tpmetric natural log transformed di tp supplementary figure 1 tp tn and conductivity were natural log transformed to meet conditions of normality and homogeneity of variance in the residuals cbbs of different lake types shallow vs stratified systems and natural lakes vs reservoirs were used as response variables to evaluate the performance of the 9 predictor variables cyanobacteria biomass of the four functional groups were used as response variables as well to assess the performance of the 9 predictor variables initially the above nine predictor variables were used to construct brt model for the response variable cyanobacteria biomass after the initial run with the nine predictors gbm simplify function was used to select predictor variables with most relative influence for further analysis separate models were run with different combinations of predictors to analyze the relative importance of each selected predictor for response variable to further analyze contribution of tpmetric to cbb we compared each model s performance which used tpmetric as a predictor with those which did not for the output of summary of brt models we expect a smaller estimated cross validation deviance a larger training data and cross validation correlation 3 results 3 1 di tp reconstruction the resulting diatom inference model for ln tp had a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 50 between measured and model inferred ln tp concentrations figure 2 the proportion of the variance in the tp that is predictable from surface diatoms was acceptable after deshrunk natural transformed di tp and tp had a good positive linear relationship with zero intercept the weighted average tp model had a bootstrapped r2 of 0 49 between measured and model inferred ln tp concentrations di tp of all selected lakes had a much smaller coefficient of variation than tp 0 54 2 53 supplementary table 2 3 2 lake types classification and blue green algae classification biomass calculation in terms of lake origin 468 lakes were natural lakes and 530 lakes were reservoirs table 1 in terms of lake depth 573 lakes were with depth 6 m and classified as shallow lakes other 425 lakes with depth 6 m were assigned to deep lakes in total 998 of the nla lakes were selected for our data analysis the median cbb for all 998 lakes was 262 8 µg l 1 table 2 the potential toxic taxa and or bloom forming taxa were more widespread than other two functional groups across the 998 lakes the numbers of lakes without potential toxigenic bloom forming potential n2 fixing and heterocyst producing cyanobacteria are 111 190 221 and 332 respectively the five most important genera were microcystis oscillatoria planktothrix anabaena chroococcus and lyngbya 3 3 modeling cbb in lakes 3 3 1 modeling cbb in all 998 lakes di tp was an informative variable for modeling cbb in 998 selected lakes table 1 di tp was an important predictor for modeling cbb for almost all site groups except shallow lakes and bloom forming cyanobacteria compared with model without tpmetric performance of model with tpmetric had no significant improvement in terms of estimated cross validation deviance 0 668 vs 0 673 and training data correlation 0 686 vs 0 701 table 3 the relative contribution to modeling cbb of di tp was much lower than that of tp table 4 3 3 2 modeling cbb in different lake types tpmetric is one of the predictors with most relative influence for modeling cbb in deep lakes man made lakes and natural lakes table 1 the training data correlation and cross validation correlation of models developed with tpmetric as one of the predictors are slightly larger than those models without tpmetric for deep lakes and man made lakes table 3 with tpmetric the training data correlation for man made lakes increased from 0 666 to 0 706 for deep lakes and man made lakes the estimated cross validation deviance of models with tpmetric is slightly smaller than those without tpmetric without tp metric training data correlation decreased from 0 71 to 0 67 while estimated cv deviance slightly increased from 1 56 to 1 59 for man made lakes although tpmetric was not as important as tp was in modeling cbb for shallow lakes deep lakes man made lakes and natural lakes the relative contribution of tpmetric was higher than tp for deep man made lakes 15 1 12 table 5 water temperature was an important predictor for cbb in lakes which is in accordance with beaulieu et al 2013 s results the mean water temperature in the upmost 2 m was more important than surface water temperature on modeling cbb in lakes especially for shallow lakes 13 17 and man made lakes 11 78 surface water temperature explained a substantial amount of cbb variation in deep man made lakes 19 1 3 3 3 modeling cbb of different blue green functional groups tpmetric is one of the predictors with most relative influence for modeling potential toxigenic heterocyst producing and potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria biomass in lakes table 1 unlike its performance in different lake types with vs without tpmetric only generated a minor difference on model performance table 3 tpmetric was inferior to tp and tn in terms of modeling biomass of different functional groups but tp metric was important relative contribution 11 42 for modeling biomass of potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria table 4 mean water temperature in the upmost 2 m as a predictor was more important on modeling the biomass of different cyanobacteria functional groups than surface water temperature the relative contribution of mean water temperature in the upmost 2 m for bloom forming potential toxigenic and potential n2 fixing cbbs were 13 87 12 22 10 34 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 modeling cbb in all 998 lakes although di tp was informative for modeling cbb in different lake types or various cyanobacteria functional groups its importance was inferior to tp in the present study the performance of di tp on modeling cbb in all 998 lakes was poor probably because the diatom samples were not exactly comparable to the cyanobacteria samples of the 2007 nla project first diatoms and the corresponding cyanobacteria sample were from the same sampling site but one was from settled sediment and the other was from the water column brothers et al 2008 found the average sedimentation rate was 0 22 cm year based on estimates of sedimentation rates on 125 natural average sized lakes with surface area 500 km2 across global scales for eastern north america 23 40 on the mean sedimentation rate over the past 150 years was 0 219 cm year webb webb 1988 therefore it approximately used 4 5 years to settle down one centimeter depth of sediment cores however cyanobacteria data were from the water samples of one summer of 2007 second optimal growth temperature for different taxonomic groups are different studies showed that as the growth rates of diatom taxa e g asterionella formosa reached their maxima or decline in response to warming cyanobacterial growth rates e g cylindrospermopsis raciborskii reached their optima briand et al 2004 butterwick et al 2005 paerl et al 2011 therefore most diatom taxa of surface sediment could come from the spring while the cyanobacteria samples were mainly from the summer however the above two factors have almost no negative effect on similar studies in streams which explains the different performance of di tp on reflecting lakes and streams conditions 4 2 modeling cbb in different lake types besides the negative effect of shorter water residence time of shallow lakes on the predictability of cyanobacteria see section introduction the uneven distribution of sampling lakes along tp gradient could also result in the poorer performance of di tp on modeling cbb in shallow lakes weighted averaging is sensitive to the distribution of environmental variables in a training set such as tp birks 1995 if we assume that lakes with p 5 µg l are oligotrophic 5 but 30 µg l are mesotrophic and 30 µg l are eutrophic likens 1975 the number of oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic deep lakes are 115 283 508 respectively the uneven distribution of lakes along tp gradient could lead to biased weighted averaging estimates of species optima and tolerances further biased diatom species optima and tolerances result in biased di tp which is shown by the larger residuals between the natural log transformed tp and di tp in shallow lakes than in deep lakes in supplementary figure 2 smol and stoermer 2010b on the other hand from ecological point of view diatoms are cold water flora and do not like strong light intensity warm water temperature and strong light intensity negatively affect species composition of diatom community according to tilman s 1982 resource competition theory and possibly result in an inaccurate di tp in shallow lakes water residence time plays an important role in determining the growth of variety kinds of algae in lakes and in shaping the algae community of lakes reynolds and petersen 2000 and carvalho et al 2011 found that cyanobacteria abundance increased not only with tp concentration but also with retention time wash out of lakes possibly affect losses of cyanobacteria in lakes with retention times 100 days reynolds 2006 relatively slow growth rates of cyanobacteria compared to diatoms could be responsible for the losses of cyanobacteria paerl 2014 in deep lakes environmental variables in summer such as the decrease of surface water viscosity increase of nutrient diffusion towards the cell surface and the strong stratification tend to favor for the dominance of cyanobacteria o neil et al 2012 however the coexistence of diatoms and cyanobacteria a k a a stronger competition with one another is necessary for a better performance of di tp on modeling cbb in lakes tilman et al 1982 mittelbach 2012 man made lakes are featured by a shorter water residence time which favors for the coexistence of diatoms and cyanobacteria physical mixing processes which generates similar effects to that of shorter water residence time could also lead to a significant increase of diatom relative abundance in a lake than when without mixing huisman et al 2004 a shorter water residence time and elevated flow conditions would help diatoms coexist with cyanobacteria according to tilman s resource competition theory 4 3 modeling cbb of different blue green functional groups di tp performed better on modeling cbb for potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria than other functional groups of cyanobacteria such as bloom forming potential toxigenic heterocyst producing cyanobacteria this result confirmed that resource competition such as p and n among algal species played the central mechanism in controlling the composition of phytoplankton communities tilman et al 1982 litchman klausmeier 2008 because potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria can fix dinitrogen themselves they require less nitrogen smaller n to maintain stable populations than other functional groups of cyanobacteria in addition there might be a trade off for resource specialization between potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria and other functional groups of cyanobacteria in other words other groups of cyanobacteria might have a smaller p higher compensation point of phosphorus for potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria might make them more predictable in terms of phosphorus than other groups of blue green algae figure 1b the resource competition theory could also explain how diatoms and different functional groups of cyanobacteria are coexisted if we assume that lakes with n p 20 are n limited and those with n p 50 are p limited guildford and hecky 2000 in terms of resource supply diatom and cyanobacteria might stably coexist when 50 n p 20 where the species zero net growth isoclines of diatom and cyanobacteria intersect and cyanobacteria consumes more tp than tn and diatom consumes more tn than tp figure 1a diatom could outcompete cyanobacteria in the 152 nla lakes with n p 50 similarly the equilibrium is unstable and cyanobacteria might outcompete diatom when n p 20 as well compared with the performance of di tp on indicating cladophora conditions in streams rivers the performance of di tp on indicating cbb in lakes is not as good as we expected sample comparability is a problem for lakes but not for streams rivers for further studies some improvement can be done to accurately evaluate the performance of di tp on modeling cbb in lakes first species variety level identification and quantification of cyanobacteria samples by finding either a better method to preserve cyanobacteria samples or a target oriented laboratory procedure for counting stancheva and sheath 2016 will definitely provide a better foundation for the evaluation second different cyanobacteria species have their own environmental preference and a better characterization on environmental preference of different cyanobacteria groups would be helpful for accurately evaluating the performance of di tp on modeling cbb third because cyanobacteria are among the most temporally dynamic lake variables håkanson et al 2007 and the 2007 nla project only took a single sample from each lake multiple sampling from each lake will be valuable for an accurate evaluation as well acknowledgements

24823,cyanobacteria dominance threats ecological integrity and diminishes ecological service of lakes throughout the world variety kinds of chemical and physical environmental factors have been used to model cyanobacteria condition in lakes except biological environmental factors essential resources competition plays a central role in shaping algae community in lakes cyanobacteria and diatoms are assumed to have conserved species functional traits and use resources and habitats in similar ways therefore diatom metric inferred total phosphorus based on diatoms di tp could be a valuable predictor for cyanobacteria biomass in lakes with data sets from the 2007 national lakes assessment nla of the us environmental protection agency we compared the performance of di tp with tp and other predictors on predicting cyanobacteria biomass cbb by boost regression tree analysis in around 1 000 lakes in light of effects of lake types and diverse cyanobacteria functional groups on model performance we did a priori classification on lakes based on lakes types deep shallow natural man made lakes and cyanobacteria functional groups bloom forming potential toxigenic heterocyst producing and potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria our results showed 1 di tp was informative for modeling cbb in different lake types or various cyanobacteria functional groups but its importance was not as significant as traditional tp 2 performance of di tp on modeling cbb was better in deep man made lakes than in shallow natural lakes 3 di tp performed better on modeling the biomass of potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria than other functional groups of cyanobacteria the lower importance of di tp could be caused by different sampling locations of diatom and cyanobacteria from a same site the uneven distribution of number of shallow lakes along tp gradient could contribute to a better performance of di tp on predicting cbb in deep lakes than in shallow lakes in man made lakes a shorter water residence helped diatoms coexist with cyanobacteria and contributed to a better performance of di tp on predicting cbb we conclude that di tp performed better on modeling cbb in deep man made lakes and potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria biomass further studies are needed to thoroughly assess the valuableness of di tp on predicting cbb in lakes graphicalabstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria diatoms resource competition total phosphorus boost regression tree national lake assessment 1 introduction cyanobacteria dominance threats ecological integrity of lakes and reduces ecosystem goods and services provided by lakes such as cultural aesthetic and provisions fristachi and sinclair 2008 griffiths and saker 2003 nutrient input reduction is the most direct simple and economically feasible cyanobacteria management strategy nutrient predictors either phosphorus nitrogen concentration downing et al 2001 håkanson et al 2007 or ratio of phosphorus to nitrogen schindler 1977 smith 1983 1986 were found to have a great influence on cyanobacteria dominance in lakes meanwhile harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters were favored by rising temperatures enhanced vertical stratification of aquatic ecosystems and alterations in seasonal and interannual weather patterns paerl and huisman 2009 beaulieu et al 2013 found increases in temperature and nitrogen were as important as phosphorus on predicting cyanobacterial biomass in lakes therefore cyanobacteria dominance typically is controlled by a suit of chemical physical which interact synergistically and or antagonistically paerl 2014 however rarely were biological factors used to model cyanobacteria condition in lakes for management purpose it is of great importance to accurately evaluate and refine the relative importance of environmental variables on modeling cyanobacteria biomass in lakes species functional traits of diatoms and cyanobacteria are assumed to be conserved across phylogeneies and they use resources and habitats in similar ways so they compete more strongly with one another than with more distant relatives tilman et al 1982 mittelbach 2012 therefore diatom metric might be a good indicator for modeling cyanobacteria condition in lakes r is the minimum amount of resource r that a consumer species requires to maintain a stable population at a given mortality rate mittelbach 2012 fogg 1973 found blue green species has a lower r on nitrogen while diatom has a lower r on phosphorus tilman et al 1982 grover 1989 figure 1 a diatoms and cyanobacteria cannot coexist on one limiting resource either phosphorus or nitrogen and the one that can maintain positive growth at the lowest resource concentration lowest r will win in competition if phosphorus nitrogen concentration fluctuates over time spatial heterogeneity in the supply of resources in lakes can allow diatoms and cyanobacteria to coexist on two limiting resources strong resource competition between diatoms and cyanobacteria could be helpful for modeling cyanobacteria with diatom metric in lakes secondly diatom can integrate effects of variety kinds of chemical and physical environmental factors so diatom inferred total phosphorus di tp can more accurately assess bioavailable phosphorus orthophosphate than direct measurement of tp smol and stoermer 2010a di tp can better characterize environmental conditions than tp and can better reflect cladophora accumulation conditions than averaged measured tp in streams of michigan and kentucky of the us smol and stoermer 2010a thirdly di tp had a much lower root mean square error than the commonly observed tp concentration range in streams pan et al 1996 the 2007 national lakes assessment nla project of the usepa which collected empirical data for more than 1 000 lakes provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of di tp on modeling cyanobacteria biomass in lakes to the best of our knowledge we have not seen any earlier works on evaluating di tp on predicting cyanobacteria biomass in around 1000 lakes a priori classification on general lake types deep versus shallow natural versus man made could be helpful for modeling cyanobacteria biomass in lakes firstly nutrients concentrations in lakes are not only affected by human disturbance but also by hydrogeomorphic features and lakes origin related factors wetzel 2001 soranno et al 2008 2010 internal nutrient loading from sediment into water column between deep lakes and shallow lakes is generally different wetzel 2001 tp in lakes was found to have a close relationship with maximum depth of lakes and bedrock geology variables such as percent of carbonate hard rock iron etc soranno et al 2008 2010 on the other hand taranu et al 2012 and beaulieu et al 2013 found cyanobacteria biomass is more predictable in deep lakes than in shallow lakes one possible explanation is that cyanobacteria is sensitive to water level changes which are larger in shallow lakes kalff 2002 differences in water residence time of lakes e g natural lakes versus reservoir can also affect phytoplankton community structure carvalho et al 2011 our results based on a long sediment core of muskegon lake mi usa which receives 95 of its input from one river and is with only a 23 d average retention time showed diatom species composition especially planktonic diatoms in the core was significantly affected by the upstream river liu et al 2018 compared with benthic cyanobacteria e g lyngbya planktonic cyanobacteria e g microcystis and aphanizomenon are supposed to experience different nutrient concentrations in lakes moreover some cyanobacteria mainly heterocyst producing cyanobacteria have lower r on nitrogen and higher compensation point of phosphorus than other cyanobacteria because they can fix nitrogen themselves figure 1b therefore different algae groups are supposed to respond to nutrients in different ways and classifying cyanobacteria before the data analysis could allow response patterns to be seen more clearly on the other hand stakeholders are more concerned on those cyanobacteria which are most related with their benefits such as toxigenic bloom forming blue green algae etc griffiths and saker 2003 fristachi and sinclair 2008 in addition allelopathic substances on the cell surface of microalgae could affect interaction among different algae liu et al 2007 and may further influence the prediction ability of using one group to model another all these factors call for a priori classification on cyanobacteria for an accurate evaluation on the performance of diatom metrics on modeling cyanobacteria condition in lakes after cyanobacteria functional groups classification beaulieu et al 2013 found total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn had a better performance on modeling biomass of cyanobacteria which can fix n2 than those which cannot in the present study we evaluated the importance of di tp on predicting cyanobacteria biomass cbb for general lake types shallow vs deep lake and natural lakes vs reservoirs and different cyanobacteria functional groups with the 2007 nla data sets of the usepa based on an extensive literature survey our three hypotheses are 1 compared to the performance of di tp in streams rivers condition assessment inferred tp based on surface sediment diatoms in lakes performs better on modeling cbb than tp 2 di tp performs better on predicting cbb in deep lakes than in shallow lakes and 3 di tp can explain larger amount of biomass variation of potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria than other functional groups of cyanobacteria to do this firstly we reconstructed di tp using the 2007 nla surface sediment diatom data then we classified lakes according to their depth and origin thirdly we calculated the biomass and grouped counted cyanobacteria bloom forming potential toxigenic heterocyst producing and potential n2 fixing finally a suit of natural predictors water temperature ph di tp total nitrogen total phosphorus ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus conductivity and water depth were selected to model all cbb and biomass of each site group to thoroughly evaluate the performance of di tp on modeling cbb 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sets water chemistry condition estimates soft algae and diatom count data and sampled lake information

an inside diameter of 3 2 cm to collect water chemistry and phytoplankton samples from may to october of 2007 usepa 2007a the device allows collection of water from the upper 2 m of the water column within the euphotic zone the field team measured temperature and ph by a multi parameter water quality meter at predefined depth intervals water chemistry samples were shipped the same day as collection laboratory water chemistry analysis was conducted by dynamac corp c o u s epa a set of performance requirements for water chemistry were made for water chemistry assays which included the long term method detection limit objective the laboratory reporting limit the precision objective and the bias objective for each variable because water chemistry and phytoplankton data were from the water samples of the uppermost 2 m we calculated and used mean water temperature and ph from the upper most 2 m as two of our predictor variables the field team collected one 1 l sample bottle for phytoplankton processing a small amount of lugol s solution 10 ml was added until the sample resembles the color of weak tea the bottle was shaken well and placed in the cooler with sealed 1 gal

relative abundances of diatom taxa in the surficial sediments of lakes and measured tp concentrations were natural log transformed to meet conditions of normality weighted average models were developed to calculate inferred ln tp concentrations with relative abundances of diatom taxa in samples their tp optima and methods of ter braak and van dame 1989 tp optima for diatom taxa were determined using the surface sediment diatoms and the ln tp of all lakes in the usepa s 2007 nla data set the tp optimum for a diatom taxon is a weighted average of tp concentration weighted by the relative abundance of that taxon in a set of lakes the tp optima for taxa were calculated by calculating the product of the proportional relative abundances of a diatom taxon times the tp concentration in each lake in a set of lakes summing those products for all lakes in the set and then dividing that sum of products by the sum of proportional relative abundances of that species in the set of lakes tp optima were calculated for all taxa having 5 observations in lakes of the 2007 nla project the weighted average model for tp concentration in a lake is then calculated by calculating the products of matched tp optima and proportional relative abundances of each taxon in the sample from that lake with known tp optima summing those products for all taxa with known tp optima and then dividing that sum of products by the sum of proportional relative abundances of all taxa with known tp optima in that sample the weighted average model for di tp was calibrated with tp optima and relative abundance data for two thirds of the selected nla samples the model was tested with data from the other third of the nla samples because weighted averages were taken twice one in the regression step and the other in the calibration step and thus resulted in shrinkage of the range of inferred tp values function deshrink from r package analogue was used to deshrink weighted averages estimates 2 2 2 lake types classification blue green algae classification and biomass calculation to be consistent with a global lake survey kosten et al 2012 and a similar study conducted in

origin data based on which lakes were classified as man made or natural lakes were from the 2007 nla dataset four cyanobacteria functional groups bloom forming potential toxigenic heterocyst producing

genera with representatives that have been shown to fix dinitrogen in the absence of heterocysts were included in the category of potential n2 fixing taxa bergman et al 1997 average cell volumes for each cyanobacterial group were estimated by using dimensions from taxonomic references komárek and anagnostidis 1998 2008 2012 cronberg and annodotter 2006 the cell volume range of a species was then determined by formulas provided by hillebrand et al 1999 the median volume within this range was used as the estimated cell volume for each taxon the median value of all the documented species within that genus was used to estimate cell biovolume for counts identified to genus level for each sample total cyanobacterial biovolume was determined by summing the estimated biovolume for each taxon recorded cyanobacteria biovolume estimates were then converted into biomass by assuming a specific gravity of 1 g cm 3 beaulieu et al 2013 2 2 3 modeling cbb in lakes data sets subsetting and basic

used to select predictor variables with most relative influence for further analysis separate models were run with different combinations of predictors to analyze the relative importance of each selected predictor for response variable to further analyze contribution of tpmetric to cbb we compared each model s performance which used tpmetric as a predictor with those which did not for the

classification and blue green algae classification biomass calculation in terms of lake origin 468 lakes were natural lakes and 530 lakes were reservoirs table 1 in terms of lake depth 573 lakes were with depth 6 m and classified as shallow lakes other 425 lakes with depth 6 m were assigned to deep lakes in total 998 of the nla lakes were selected for our data analysis the median cbb for all 998

toxigenic bloom forming potential n2 fixing and heterocyst producing cyanobacteria are 111 190 221 and 332 respectively the five most important genera were microcystis oscillatoria planktothrix anabaena chroococcus and lyngbya 3 3 modeling cbb in lakes 3 3 1 modeling cbb in all 998 lakes di tp was an informative variable for modeling cbb in 998 selected lakes table 1 di tp was an important predictor for modeling cbb for almost all site groups except shallow lakes and bloom forming cyanobacteria compared with model without tpmetric performance of model with tpmetric had no significant improvement in terms of estimated cross validation deviance 0 668 vs 0 673 and training data correlation 0 686 vs 0 701 table 3 the relative contribution to modeling cbb of di tp was much lower than that of tp table 4 3 3 2 modeling cbb in different lake types tpmetric is one of the predictors with most relative influence for modeling cbb in deep lakes man made lakes and natural lakes table 1 the training data correlation and cross validation correlation of models developed with tpmetric as one of the predictors are slightly larger than those models without tpmetric for deep lakes and man made lakes table 3 with tpmetric the training data correlation for man made lakes increased from 0 666 to 0 706 for deep lakes and man made lakes the estimated cross validation deviance of models with tpmetric is slightly smaller than those without tpmetric without tp metric training data correlation decreased from 0 71 to 0 67 while estimated cv deviance slightly increased from 1 56 to 1 59 for man made lakes although tpmetric was not as important as tp was in modeling cbb for shallow lakes deep lakes man made lakes and natural lakes the relative contribution of tpmetric was higher than tp for deep man made lakes 15 1 12 table 5 water temperature was an important predictor for cbb in lakes which is in accordance with beaulieu et al 2013 s results the mean water temperature in the upmost 2 m was more important than surface water temperature on modeling cbb in lakes especially for shallow lakes 13 17 and man made lakes 11 78 surface water temperature explained a substantial amount of cbb variation in deep man made lakes 19 1 3 3 3 modeling cbb of different blue green functional groups tpmetric is one of the predictors with most relative influence for modeling potential toxigenic heterocyst producing and potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria biomass in lakes table 1 unlike its performance in different lake types with vs without tpmetric only generated a minor difference on model performance table 3 tpmetric was inferior to tp and tn in terms of modeling biomass of different functional groups but tp metric was important relative contribution 11 42 for modeling biomass of potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria table 4 mean water temperature in the upmost 2 m as a predictor was more important on modeling the biomass of different cyanobacteria functional groups than surface water temperature the relative contribution of mean water temperature in the upmost 2 m for bloom forming potential toxigenic and potential n2 fixing cbbs were 13 87 12 22 10 34 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 modeling cbb in all 998 lakes although di tp was informative for modeling cbb in different lake types or various cyanobacteria functional groups its importance was inferior to tp in the present study the performance of di tp on modeling cbb in all 998 lakes was poor probably because the diatom samples were not exactly comparable to the cyanobacteria samples of the 2007 nla project first diatoms and the corresponding cyanobacteria sample were from the same sampling site but one was from settled sediment and the other was from the water column brothers et al 2008 found the average sedimentation rate was 0 22 cm year based on estimates of sedimentation rates on 125 natural average sized lakes with surface area 500 km2 across global scales for eastern north america 23 40 on the mean sedimentation rate over the past 150 years was 0 219 cm year webb webb 1988 therefore it approximately used 4 5 years to settle down one centimeter depth of sediment cores however cyanobacteria data were from the water samples of one summer of 2007 second optimal growth temperature for different taxonomic groups are different studies showed that as the growth rates of diatom taxa e g asterionella formosa reached their maxima or decline in response to warming cyanobacterial growth rates e g cylindrospermopsis raciborskii reached their optima briand et al 2004 butterwick et al 2005 paerl et al 2011 therefore most diatom taxa of surface sediment could come from the spring while the cyanobacteria samples were mainly from the summer however the above two factors have almost no negative effect on similar studies in streams which explains the different performance of di tp on reflecting lakes and streams conditions 4 2 modeling cbb in different lake types besides the negative effect of shorter water residence time of shallow lakes on the predictability of cyanobacteria see section introduction the uneven distribution of sampling lakes along tp gradient could also result in the poorer performance of di tp on modeling cbb in shallow lakes weighted averaging is sensitive to the distribution of environmental variables in a training set such as tp birks 1995 if we assume that lakes with p 5 µg l are oligotrophic 5 but 30 µg l are mesotrophic and 30 µg l are eutrophic likens 1975 the number of oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic deep lakes are 115 283 508 respectively the uneven distribution of lakes along tp gradient could lead to biased weighted averaging estimates of species optima and tolerances further biased diatom species optima and tolerances result in biased di tp which is shown by the larger residuals between the natural log transformed tp and di tp in shallow lakes than in deep lakes in supplementary figure 2 smol and stoermer 2010b on the other hand from ecological point of view diatoms are cold water flora and do not like strong light intensity warm water temperature and strong light intensity negatively affect species composition of diatom community according to tilman s 1982 resource competition theory and possibly result in an inaccurate di tp in shallow lakes water residence time plays an important role in determining the growth of variety kinds of algae in lakes and in shaping the algae community of lakes reynolds and petersen 2000 and carvalho et al 2011 found that cyanobacteria abundance increased not only with tp concentration but also with retention time wash out of lakes possibly affect losses of cyanobacteria in lakes with retention times 100 days reynolds 2006 relatively slow growth rates of cyanobacteria compared to diatoms could be responsible for the losses of cyanobacteria paerl 2014 in deep lakes environmental variables in summer such as the decrease of surface water viscosity increase of nutrient diffusion towards the cell surface and the strong stratification tend to favor for the dominance of cyanobacteria o neil et al 2012 however the coexistence of diatoms and cyanobacteria a k a a stronger competition with one another is necessary for a better performance of di tp on modeling cbb in lakes tilman et al 1982 mittelbach 2012 man made lakes are featured by a shorter water residence time which favors for the coexistence of diatoms and cyanobacteria physical mixing processes which generates similar effects to that of shorter water residence time could also lead to a significant increase of diatom relative abundance in a lake than when without mixing huisman et al 2004 a shorter water residence time and elevated flow conditions would help diatoms coexist with cyanobacteria according to tilman s resource competition theory 4 3 modeling cbb of different blue green functional groups di tp performed better on modeling cbb for potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria than other functional groups of cyanobacteria such as bloom forming potential toxigenic heterocyst producing cyanobacteria this result confirmed that resource competition such as p and n among algal species played the central mechanism in controlling the composition of phytoplankton communities tilman et al 1982 litchman klausmeier 2008 because potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria can fix dinitrogen themselves they require less nitrogen smaller n to maintain stable populations than other functional groups of cyanobacteria in addition there might be a trade off for resource specialization between potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria and other functional groups of cyanobacteria in other words other groups of cyanobacteria might have a smaller p higher compensation point of phosphorus for potential n2 fixing cyanobacteria might make them more predictable in terms of phosphorus than other groups of blue green algae figure 1b the resource competition theory could also explain how diatoms and different functional groups of cyanobacteria are coexisted if we assume that lakes with n p 20 are n limited and those with n p 50 are p limited guildford and hecky 2000 in terms of resource supply diatom and cyanobacteria might stably coexist when 50 n p 20 where the species zero net growth isoclines of diatom and cyanobacteria intersect and cyanobacteria consumes more tp than tn and diatom consumes more tn than tp figure 1a diatom could outcompete cyanobacteria in the 152 nla lakes with n p 50 similarly the equilibrium is unstable and cyanobacteria might outcompete diatom when n p 20 as well compared with the performance of di tp on indicating cladophora conditions in streams rivers the performance of di tp on indicating cbb in lakes is not as good as we expected sample comparability is a problem for lakes but not for streams rivers for further studies some improvement can be done to accurately evaluate the performance of di tp on modeling cbb in lakes first species variety level identification and quantification of cyanobacteria samples by finding either a better method to preserve cyanobacteria samples or a target oriented laboratory procedure for counting stancheva and sheath 2016 will definitely provide a better foundation for the evaluation second different cyanobacteria species have their own environmental preference and a better characterization on environmental preference of different cyanobacteria groups would be helpful for accurately evaluating the performance of di tp on modeling cbb third because cyanobacteria are among the most temporally dynamic lake variables håkanson et al 2007 and the 2007 nla project only took a single sample from each lake multiple sampling from each lake will be valuable for an accurate evaluation as well acknowledgements

24824,the abundance or yield of a species is an ecological quantity of paramount importance when making management and conservation decisions the linear generalized lotka volterra equations lglve constitute the simplest theoretical framework for predicting such yields however in many ecological communities e g tropical forests the number of coexisting species s can be very large and estimating the entire interaction matrix a from experiments is practically unfeasible here i introduce a method for predicting the yield of a particular species of interest or focal species the method proposed here only requires data on the interaction coefficients of the focal species k referring to the elements of row and column k of the approximate focal interaction matrix a k these interaction coefficients can be obtained from measuring the yields of species in monoculture s experimental treatments and in biculture experiments involving the focal species s 1 treatments the remaining elements of a k are considered equal to 1 i compare the species yields predicted by the focal species method against a data set of experimental studies i compiled from the literature across several taxa plants algae protozoa and crustacean the accuracy of this method is slightly lower than that attained when using the entire lotka volterra interaction matrix the advantage of this method is that it requires a much smaller number of experimental treatments to estimate parameters of the order of s rather than of s 2 therefore it can be a useful quantitative tool for applied sciences like agriculture or fisheries keywords prediction of species yields quantitative ecology agroecology biomass forecasting community matrix i introduction the abundance or yield of a species is an ecological quantity of paramount importance when making management and conservation decisions andrewartha and birch 1954 krebs 1978 gaston 1994 actually for species of value to humans estimates of future abundance will be essential for regulating current and future harvests in addition for species of conservation concern their abundances are an important determinant of their extinction risk the effect of the interspecific interactions on species abundances is quite direct populations of one species are different in the absence and in the presence of a second species the best known mathematical model for describing the dynamics of two species coexisting either sharing the same food source occupying the same space or one preying on or parasitizing the other are the lotka volterra equations lotka 1925 volterra 1926 actually lotka and volterra derived two different sets of equations one set applies to situations involving competition for resources like nutrients or space and the other set to the predator prey interaction these equations which can be extended to ecological communities involving more than two interacting species represent phenomenological summaries of or approximations to some underlying biology so for instance the competition coefficient for the effect of species j on specie i that means there is some underlying mechanism that causes the per capita growth rate of species i to decline by this amount when an individual of species j is added to the system lotka 1925 it doesn t tell you what specific mechanism drives the competitive interaction it only tells you the magnitude of the effect the generalized lotka volterra equations are a set of equations which are more general than either the competitive or predator prey examples of lotka volterra types hofbauer and sigmund 1998 pastor 2008 and thus can accommodate the different kinds of interactions that generally occur among species e g competition facilitation this model in its simplest formulation consists in a set of linear equations for the per capita growth rates in such a way that the linear generalized lotka volterra equations lglve can be written in terms of an interaction matrix denoted by a aij fitting the interaction coefficients aij in order to make quantitative predictions is not a trivial task if we have s species that may be interacting an order of s 2 experimental treatments to estimate these parameters will be required recently i have shown that by obtaining the entire interaction matrix from the experimental yields in monoculture and biculture treatments the lglve can accurately predict most of the species yields in mixtures of s 2 species for the majority of a set of 33 experimental treatments compiled from the literature fort 2018a an assumption of these calculations was the attainment of equilibrium or quasi equilibrium this was checked a priori all the experiments i considered verified that all the species yields vs time seemed to stabilize at constant values an issue when using the lglve for predicting the species abundances is that for communities or polycultures with large s performing all the required experimental treatments to estimate the parameters is not feasible an alternative is to perform a fraction of all required experiments with the consequence of gaining an incomplete knowledge of the interaction coefficients needed to compute the yields through the lglve however in many circumstances we are not interested in the abundances of all the species but just in predicting the abundance of a particular species for instance one might be interested in a crop that coexists with several species of weeds or in assessing the performance of a foreign species introduced into an existing community in such cases it is not necessary to know the entire interaction matrix aij here i introduce a general method for predicting the yield of a particular species the focal species method this approach does not require a complete knowledge on the interaction matrix rather this method only requires knowing the interaction coefficients involving this focal species k i e it uses an approximated focal interaction matrix a k see materials and methods therefore the number of necessary experimental treatments to fit the interaction matrix is reduced from s 2 to an order of s to test the performance of the focal species method i consider the same 33 experiments described in fort 2018a which enables the use of the lglve as a benchmark to assess the accuracy of the method proposed here thus for each of the 33 known interaction matrices a i wrote a focal interaction matrix a k for each species k 1 s then i compared the yield predicted for the focal species against its empirical value i found that the accuracy of the focal species method is slightly lower than the accuracy achieved by the lglve as a counterpart the number of experimental treatments required to fit the focal interaction matrix is much smaller when the number of interacting species s is large hence i conclude that the focal species method can be a useful quantitative tool for forecasting purposes in applied sciences like agriculture or fisheries where experiments are time consuming expensive and often unfeasible ii materials and methods ii 1 working with relative yields it is convenient to work with relative yields ri yi ki where the species yield is normalized by its carrying capacity or ki asymptotic yield in monoculture rather than dealing with absolute yields yi this is because a it allows standardization since depending on the community and taxon the yields are measured by different quantities like biomass density biovolume or individuals density and b working with relative yields is simpler especially when the species yields differ in several orders of magnitude overall ri is less than 1 and rarely larger than 2 the lglve for s interacting species within a single trophic level can be written in terms of relative yields ri as fort 2018a fort and segura 2018 1 d r i d t r i r i 1 j 1 s a i j r j i 1 s where ri denotes the intrinsic growth rate of species i aij is an interaction coefficient quantifying the direct effect of species j on species i which is obtained from the pair of equilibrium experimental relative yields in biculture r i j e x and r j i e x as fort 2018b 2 a i j r i j e x 1 r j i e x f o r i j where the superscript ex denotes experimentally measured quantities to distinguish them from the theoretical ones arising as solutions of the lglve 1 the asterisk represents quantities at equilibrium and the subscripts i j and j i stand for the relative yield of species i in presence of species j and vice versa thus if the relative yield of species i in biculture with species j is smaller greater than 1 aij is negative positive and the interaction of species j over species i is competitive facilitative the diagonal elements of the a matrix corresponding to intraspecific interaction coefficients are taken as aii 1 for all i in order to recover the logistic equation for a single species d r i d t r i r i 1 r i henceforth since it is common practice to assume an equilibrium state we will omit the for all relative yields experimental or theoretical in the understanding that all of them are quantities at equilibrium from eq 1 the theoretical relative species yields at equilibrium verify 3 r i 1 j 1 s a i j r j 0 i 1 s ii 2 the focal species method when the knowledge of lglve parameters is incomplete it is still possible to predict species yields in fort 2018b and fort and segura 2018 a method capable of accurately predicting aggregate quantities like the relative yield total r y t i 1 s r i de wit 1970 or the mean relative yield mry ryt s has been recently proposed suppose one is interested in the performance yield of a particular or focal species k that coexists with other s 1 species thus in order to make a more accurate prediction for the focal species than the one resulted from the mry one possibility is to measure only the interaction coefficients involving this species k that is all the interaction coefficients of species j 1 2 s j k on species k akj and the interaction coefficients of species k on all the other species j ajk i e the k row and column of the interaction matrix since one is not interested in quantifying the yields of the species different from the focal species k one can treat all of them as a single average species in this way all the aij i k j k can be regarded as intraspecific interaction coefficients which as mentioned are all equal to 1 hence this is equivalent to use an interaction matrix of the form 4 a k 1 1 a 1 k 1 1 1 1 a 2 k 1 1 a k 1 a k 2 1 a k s 1 a k s 1 1 a s 1 k 1 1 1 1 a s k 1 1 the above description is what i call the focal species approximation obtaining r k i would be straightforward from eqs 3 and 4 if a the theoretical coexisting equilibrium were feasible i e r k i 0 for all species and b the matrix a k were invertible by simple inversion of the matrix equation between parentheses in eq 3 however it is easy for s 3 species to prove that the focal matrix is non invertible the det a k 0 this determinant can be immediately computed by expanding the determinant of matrix 4 along its focal row or column for example to expand along the k row of matrix 4 we have to multiply each of the coefficients in this k row by the determinant of the s 1 s 1 matrix that results from the original matrix by removing the k th row and the k th column called the minor the resulting expansion now contains s determinants of s 1 s 1 matrices instead of the s s determinant we started with notice that all s 1 s 1 determinants contain at least s 2 2 columns with all elements equal to 1 and therefore they are 0 the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns or rows is 0 which proves that the above condition b is not fulfilled see appendix i for s 3 species there is generally only one row or column with all elements equal to 1 and the determinant is not necessarily zero however in this case it is easy to show that at least one of the species must become extinct at equilibrium see appendix i and thus condition a is not fulfilled meaning that the equilibrium state with all species coexisting is unfeasible i e r k l 0 for some species l therefore since either conditions a or b are violated one cannot obtain the equilibrium relative yields by inverting 1 j 1 s a i j r j 0 and has to obtain the equilibria of focal matrices by numerically integrating the dynamical equations 5 d r i k d t r i r i k 1 j 1 s a k i j r j k i 1 s to do this i used both a simple finite differences method and the ode45 matlab ordinary differential equation solver and checked that the two methods produce the same results once the set of s relative yields r k i is obtained the next step is to consider the relative yield for the focal species r k k neglecting the values r k j for j k that is from a matrix of the form 4 we obtain just one relative yield r k k ii 3 data set i considered a set of 33 experimental treatments described in fort 2018a each involves a multispecies community s 2 with species belonging to the same taxonomic group plants algae etc some of these experiments were completed in laboratory and others in the field under natural conditions including mostly plants but also algae crustacean and protozoa see table 1 for a comprehensive list of experiments used and their references these studies included measurements of i the yields of each of the s coexisting species one treatment ii the yields of each species in monoculture s treatments and iii the yields of all species in bicultures s s 1 2 treatments as mentioned above the experiments also verified that all the species yields biomass density in most of the cases but also biovolume and number of individuals vs time seemed to stabilize at constant values the experimental polyculture yields yi ex and monoculture yields ki ex are obtained respectively by taking averages over replicas of i and ii likewise the biculture yields y i j e x and y j i e x and their standard errors se were obtained from replicas of iii and then the interaction coefficient between species i and j were in turn computed by inserting r i j e x y i j e x k i and r j i e x y j i e x k j into eq 2 to test the performance of the focal species method i considered the 33 studies of fort 2018a listed in table 1 for each of these studies i first took species 1 as the focal species and wrote the focal matrix a 1 as if we wouldn t know the interaction coefficients between species different from species 1 then we used this matrix to compute the s relative yields but only took into account the relative yield r 1 1 and neglected the values r 1 j for j 1 next i took species 2 as the focal species and wrote the focal matrix a 2 and so on so forth until i completed the computation of the s relative yields for the s species of this experimental study each one taken in turn as the focal species thus each experiment involving a polyculture of s species generates s predicted yields we repeated the same procedure for the 33 experimental studies box 1 illustrates this procedure for the four species polyculture a ibf og iw picasso et al 2008 it shows above the experimental relative yields left hand side the interaction matrix for this polyculture center and the predictions using the full lotka volterra interaction matrix right hand side the focal species part of the interaction matrix and the four focal interaction matrices that result by choosing the focal species as a ibf og or iw are shown in the middle sector of box 1 the corresponding predictions of the focal method appear at the bottom of box 1 ii 4 error accuracy metrics to quantitative evaluate the performance of the method to quantify how well the focal species method fits the observed data i use the same four metrics used in fort 2018a see appendix 2 for their definitions justification and details a the relative mean absolute error rmae b the percentage of predictions which fall within 95 confidence intervals around experimental values i e 1 96 se or p95 c the modified coefficient of efficiency e 1 legates and mccabe 1999 and d the modified index of agreement d 1 legates and mccabe 1999 to compute these indices for each experiment i consider the s predicted yields that result from applying the focal species method each of them corresponding to a different choice of the focal species for example for the four species polyculture a ibf og iw picasso et al 2008 of box 1 when choosing each species a ibf og or iw as the focal species the approximation renders an absolute error r k e x r k k smaller than the se for a og and iw species denoted with a 1 in the in out column and lager than the se for iw denoted with a 0 in the in out column therefore p95 75 as it was done in fort 2018a i took into account the following error accuracy indices to distinguish accurate from inaccurate predictions a rmae 50 b p95 66 7 c e 1 0 and d d 1 1 3 iii results table 1 summarizes the rmae and the three accuracy metrics p95 e 1 and d 1 it shows highlighted in gray when the indices violate the above inequalities indicating inaccuracy of the focal species method 1 1 the detailed results and data including focal interaction matrices a k rk and r k k as well as the contribution of each species to the four metrics used for estimating error accuracy will be provided under request notice that for the majority of the experiments 22 out of the 33 all the four error accuracy indices indicate good performance of the focal species method if restricts only to p95 which is the most widely used accuracy index in population ecology the focal species method performs well for 27 out of 33 of the experimental studies i e p95 is greater or equal to 66 7 for 27 experimental studies and its global average is 73 iii 1 accuracy of the focal species method compared with the accuracy of the lglve fig 1 compares the accuracy of the focal species method with the accuracy of the lglve using the complete interaction matrix the four error accuracy indices are shown each one in a different panel for the 33 experimental studies ordered from smaller to larger rmae produced by the focal method results from the rmae index were similar for the focal species approach and the lglve fig 1 a though p95 and e1 indices showed a greater number of experiments below the established accuracy value for the species focal approach fig 1 b and c overall the accuracy shown for the proposed focal species method is similar to that of lglve therefore the focal species method can predict the yield of focal species with reasonable accuracy fig 2 compares the results of using the focal species method with those when using the lglve for six experimental studies involving different taxa as one can observe the accuracy with which the focal species method predicts the focal species is comparable to the one obtained when using the lglve actually the same holds for most of the 33 experimental studies considered in this study iv discussion the ability to predict the abundance or biomass of different species of value to humans is essential to achieve sustainable production as well as to ensure food security and economic gain fao 2015 turral et al 2011 in the case of agriculture crop yield forecasting methods provide a tool for finding combinations of management strategies to reach multiple goals required for sustainable crop production basso et al 2013 this is critical to improve food security by increasing yield and productivity while protecting the environment godfray et al 2010 mueller et al 2012 srinivasan 2006 fisheries provide another example in which yield forecasting is helpful for fishery managers quantitative stock assessment tools serve to estimate the current status of the fishery for estimating maximum sustainable yield and for precautionary management hoggarth et al 2006 quantitative methods commonly employed to forecast the yield and production of agricultural crops have been mostly linear statistical models nass smb 2012 descriptive models have in general a short computing time and they usually contain few state variables making them helpful tools for reliable predictions however the use of descriptive or phenomenological modelling of biomass production and yield of crops has been rare but see marcelis et al 1998 in fort 2018a i showed that the lglve can accurately predict the majority of the species yields in the mixtures of s species for most of the 33 experiments considered however a limitation of this approach is that the number of experimental treatments required to estimate the lotka volterra model parameters is proportional to s 2 thus the application of lglve quickly becomes unfeasible for relatively modest species richness in this study i introduced the focal species method as a method for predicting the yield of a species of particular interest while treating the other species as a mean field in which this focal species is immersed by varying the species which is taken as focal this approximation is able to predict in almost three quarters of the cases the yield of this species within 95 confidence intervals around the corresponding experimentally measured value iv 1 comparing the performance of the focal species method and lglve from comparing the performance of the focal species method to the one of the lglve that use the full interaction matrix a it is noteworthy that the percentage of predicted yields that fall within 95 confidence intervals around the corresponding experimentally measured yields for the two methods are very similar roughly in both for three quarters of the experimental studies p95 above the 67 threshold the difference is that the focal species method only requires a much smaller number of experimental pairwise treatments s rather than s s 1 2 to fit the focal interaction matrix this is an important advantage regarding applications of this method to natural or artificial communities involving a large number of interacting species s indices rmae e 1 and d 1 favour the lglve over the focal species method i e the former leads to lower relative absolute errors and higher accuracy than the latter this is expected since the lglve include a more fine grained description of the interspecific interactions still taking averages over the 33 experimental studies for these three indices we obtain for the focal species method r m a e 42 e 1 0 29 d 1 0 69 which are pretty descent values iv 2 possible applications the method proposed in his study can be a useful tool in agriculture for instance in crop agribusiness forecasting the yield of crops is essential for any short or long term economic analysis in that sense this method allows obtaining the yield of a particular species in different polyculture crops which is something that has been recently done for perennial herbaceous polycultures through the lglve halty et al 2017 thus the focal species method could complement more basic agronomic models like the linear statistical models which are currently used in forecasting and estimating crop yields and production nass smb 2012 to obtain the final net yield per acre or ha it could also be employed in combination with other more specific models that only simulate part of the crop production system such as photosynthesis partitioning or development marcelis et al 1998 additionally the focal species method could contribute in agroecology for describing predicting and ultimately prescribing ecologically sound and sustainable management practices martin and isaac 2018 as well as avoiding environmental damage with the use of herbicides guglielmini et al 2017 a specific example is to assess and optimize the performance of a crop coexisting with weeds rejmanek et al 1989 weeds have to be controlled both tactically minimizing their adverse influence in the current crop and strategically anticipating these effects in future crops spitters 1989 the success of weed management programs which are directed towards the minimization of herbicide use largely depends upon the ability to predict the effects of weeds on crop yield kropff and spitters 1991 the main novelty of this method compared with models currently used spitters 1989 is that it takes explicitly into account the interaction effects between weeds and crop designing rational weed management practices another field in which this method could be used is in fisheries management focused on target species melnychuk et al 2017 the focal species approach could be of help in analysing the effects of non target species on target ones in this case the target species coincides with the focal species indeed the need for ecosystem based approaches to fisheries management has been widely recognized throughout the world pikitch et al 2004 iv 3 caveats and future extensions it is worth mentioning that the essence of the focal species method namely considering the elements of the interaction matrix dealing with the interactions of all other species as 1 means that the community being modelled is structured mainly by competition this is a reasonable assumption for single trophic communities schoener 1983 against which the approach is being tested nevertheless this is no longer the case for communities in which the dominant interactions are different from mutual competition for example in communities in which asymmetrical interactions of the kind of predator prey or parasite host interactions dominate in such communities antisymmetric non focal interactions could be used for instance one could randomly set each element of the focal matrix a k above the diagonal to 1 or 1 and set the corresponding symmetric element to 1 or 1 respectively mutualistic communities constitute another example in which the focal species method can be straightforwardly extended in this case all non focal elements should be set to 1 these other types of communities are beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in future work v conclusion the focal species method represents a reasonable trade off between accuracy and feasibility on the one hand when we just know the pairwise interaction coefficients involving a given species it allows predicting the yield of this species with accuracy this is a step forward with respect to the mean field like approximation considered in fort 2018b since it allows more accurate specific predictions for this focal species than just the mean relative yield on the other hand the accuracy of the focal species method is in general a little lower than that of the lglve but provided the number of interacting species s is large enough the number of experimental treatments it requires to fit its parameters is much lower natural communities like grasslands or tropical forests or plankton where s can be of the order of hundreds might be ideal scenarios for the application of the focal species approach in such natural communities to estimate the interaction coefficients is unfeasible thus precluding the use of lglve and the focal species method is a worthy approach to consider this approach is likely

appendix 1 obtaining the theoretical relative yields linear algebra and simulations the relative yields at equilibrium verify eq 3 this equation for an equilibrium in which all the theoretical relative yields are different from zero reduces to a1 1 1 j 1 s a i j r j 0 i 1 s or in matrix from ar 1 where r and 1 are column vectors of s entries with respectively the relative yields ri and ones in the case of the focal method in which a k denotes the s s focal interaction matrix 4 one has a1 1 1 j 1 s a i j k r k j 0 i 1 s or in matrix from a k r k 1 the straightforward way of calculating r k would be by inverting the eq a1 1 to obtain this vector as a1 2 r k a k 1 1 however this simple procedure doesn t work because the focal matrix a k is not invertible for s 3 and for s 3 the yield of at least one species predicted by this method is zero and thus one no longer can obtain the equilibrium yields from eq a1 2 that a k is not invertible for s 3 can be easily shown by writing the determinant this matrix as an expansion along a row or column suppose one was to expand the determinant of 4 4 matrix a a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 34 a 41 a 42 a 43 a 44 along its first row then one has to multiply each of the coefficients of the first row by the left over part of the determinant after blocking out the row and the column containing that coefficient one thus obtains ai 3 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 34 a 41 a 42 a 43 a 44 a 11 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 32 a 33 a 34 a 42 a 43 a 44 a 12 a 21 a 23 a 24 a 31 a 33 a 34 a 41 a 43 a 44 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 24 a 31 a 32 a 34 a 41 a 42 a 44 a 14 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33 the above expansion now contains four 3 3 determinants called the minors instead of the 4 4 determinant one started with in the case in which the focal matrix for species 1 a 1 onegets a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 21 1 1 1 a 31 1 1 1 a 41 1 1 1 a 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 a 12 a 21 1 1 a 31 1 1 a 41 1 1 a 13 a 21 1 1 a 31 1 1 a 41 1 1 a 14 a 21 1 1 a 31 1 1 a 41 1 1 all the above minor determinants are zero because they have at least two equal columns all 1 s this proof can be extended for larger values of s and independently of the chosen focal species k therefore one concludes that a k is non invertible for s 3 for s 3 the determinant of a 1 is not necessarily zero a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 1 1 a 31 1 1 a 11 1 1 1 1 a 12 a 21 1 a 31 1 a 13 a 21 1 a 31 1 0 a 13 a 12 a 21 1 a 31 1 and thus this matrix can in generally be inverted suppose one assumes that the theoretical coexisting equilibrium is feasible i e r k i 0 for all species however equation ai 2 with matrix a 1 produces a vector of relative yields given by r 1 0 a 13 1 a 13 a 12 a 12 1 a 13 a 12 i e r 1 1 0 similarly eq ai 2 with matrix a 2 produces a vector of relative yields given by r 2 a 23 1 a 23 a 21 0 a 21 1 a 23 a 21 i e r 2 2 0 finally eq ai 2 with matrix a 3 produces a vector of relative yields given by r 3 a 32 1 a 32 a 31 a 31 1 a 33 a 31 0 i e r 3 3 0 that is in the three cases the yield of the focal species is zero and thus one arrives to a contradiction the theoretical equilibrium in which all species coexist is not feasible this implies that eq 3 for the equilibria does not reduce to the simpler eq a1 2 therefore to obtain the equilibrium yields we have to resort to numerical integration of the differential equations 1 to integrate the dynamical equations the initial condition for the relative yields is a random set of initial values taken from a uniform random distribution between 0 and 1 then i used both a simple finite differences method and the ode45 matlab ordinary differential equation solver and checked that the two methods produce the same results appendix 2 accuracy measures to quantitative evaluate the performance of the focal species method how well a model fits the observed data usually is determined by comparing model predicted values with observations frequently evaluations of model performance utilize statistics based on the familiar pearson s correlation coefficient r or its square the coefficient of determination r 2 unfortunately these two statistics describe the degree of collinearity between the observed and model predicted values but suffer from limitations that make them poor measures of model performance willmott 1984 in fact by their very definition both indices are insensitive to additive and proportional differences between the model predictions and observations willmott 1984 for further discussion on why r and r 2 are incorrect measures of predictive accuracy see li 2017 and reference there in here to quantitative assess the degree to which the focal species method matches the observations i used the metrics summarized in table 2 all the above metrics are in terms of the absolute value instead of the square of differences this is because it was noticed that absolute values are preferable over squares since by using absolute values errors and differences are given a more appropriate weighting not inflated by their squared values willmott 1981 squaring in statistics is useful because squares are easier to manipulate mathematically than are absolute values but use of squares forces an arbitrarily greater influence on the statistic by way of the larger values legates and mccabe 1999 the relative mean absolute error rmae is obtained from dividing the mean absolute error mae between the mean of the species yields mae and the similar root mean square error rmse are two commonly used measures for assessing the predictive accuracy in the environmental sciences li and heap 2008 to avoid any dependence of mae on s i used the relative metric rmae in order to quantify the accuracy one needs to introduce some reference point actually error measures like rmae are not accuracy measures so they can only tell which model produce less error but there are unable to tell how accurate a model is li 2017 at any event a possible very general and tolerant measure of model goodness is rmae 100 i e every quantity is measured with an error smaller than the size of the quantity itself instead i considered the more stringent threshold of rmae 50 p95 measures the percentage of predictions which fall within the confidence intervals of 1 96σ within the error bars shown in fig 2 p95 100 0 means that all none of the yields predicted by the model fall within the error bars around the corresponding experimental values for p95 i considered the arbitrary threshold of 66 7 so that p95 66 7 indicates the model does a decent job e 1 legates and mccabe 1999 is a modified version of the coefficient of efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined by e 1 mse σ 2 mse mean square error but in terms of absolute differences rather than square differences it ranges from minus infinity to 1 with higher values indicating better agreement and e 1 1 indicating perfect match between model and experimental data for example if the absolute differences between the model and the observation is as large as the variability in the observed data measured by i 1 s r i e x r e x then e 1 0 0 and if it exceeds it then e 1 0 0 i e the observed mean is a better predictor than ri thus a value of zero for e 1 indicates that the observed mean r e x is as good a predictor as the model while negative values indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model wilcox et al 1990 d 1 is similar to e 1 an advantage over the modified efficiency is that it is bounded i e it varies from 0 0 to 1 0 again with higher values indicating better agreement between the model and observation by the same token it loses the meaningful reference point of 0 0 for the coefficient of efficiency which serves to assess when the model is a better predictor than the observed mean however it is possible to introduce a reference point for d 1 by observing that for two completely uncorrelated random vectors drawn from a uniform distribution d 1 is on average 1 3 supp mat of fort 2018a therefore if d 1 1 3 one concludes that the model is a poor predictor 
24824,the abundance or yield of a species is an ecological quantity of paramount importance when making management and conservation decisions the linear generalized lotka volterra equations lglve constitute the simplest theoretical framework for predicting such yields however in many ecological communities e g tropical forests the number of coexisting species s can be very large and estimating the entire interaction matrix a from experiments is practically unfeasible here i introduce a method for predicting the yield of a particular species of interest or focal species the method proposed here only requires data on the interaction coefficients of the focal species k referring to the elements of row and column k of the approximate focal interaction matrix a k these interaction coefficients can be obtained from measuring the yields of species in monoculture s experimental treatments and in biculture experiments involving the focal species s 1 treatments the remaining elements of a k are considered equal to 1 i compare the species yields predicted by the focal species method against a data set of experimental studies i compiled from the literature across several taxa plants algae protozoa and crustacean the accuracy of this method is slightly lower than that attained when using the entire lotka volterra interaction matrix the advantage of this method is that it requires a much smaller number of experimental treatments to estimate parameters of the order of s rather than of s 2 therefore it can be a useful quantitative tool for applied sciences like agriculture or fisheries keywords prediction of species yields quantitative ecology agroecology biomass forecasting community matrix i introduction the abundance or yield of a species is an ecological quantity of paramount importance when making management and conservation decisions andrewartha and birch 1954 krebs 1978 gaston 1994 actually for species of value to humans estimates of future abundance will be essential for regulating current and future harvests in addition for species of conservation concern their abundances are an important determinant of their extinction risk the effect of the interspecific interactions on species abundances is quite direct populations of one species are different in the absence and in the presence of a second species the best known mathematical model for describing the dynamics of two species coexisting either sharing the same food source occupying the same space or one preying on or parasitizing the other are the lotka volterra equations lotka 1925 volterra 1926 actually lotka and volterra derived two different sets of equations one set applies to situations involving competition for resources like nutrients or space and the other set to the predator prey interaction these equations which can be extended to ecological communities involving more than two interacting species represent phenomenological summaries of or approximations to some underlying biology so for instance the competition coefficient for the effect of species j on specie i that means there is some underlying mechanism that causes the per capita growth rate of species i to decline by this amount when an individual of species j is added to the system lotka 1925 it doesn t tell you what specific mechanism drives the competitive interaction it only tells you the magnitude of the effect the generalized lotka volterra equations are a set of equations which are more general than either the competitive or predator prey examples of lotka volterra types hofbauer and sigmund 1998 pastor 2008 and thus can accommodate the different kinds of interactions that generally occur among species e g competition facilitation this model in its simplest formulation consists in a set of linear equations for the per capita growth rates in such a way that the linear generalized lotka volterra equations lglve can be written in terms of an interaction matrix denoted by a aij fitting the interaction coefficients aij in order to make quantitative predictions is not a trivial task if we have s species that may be interacting an order of s 2 experimental treatments to estimate these parameters will be required recently i have shown that by obtaining the entire interaction matrix from the experimental yields in monoculture and biculture treatments the lglve can accurately predict most of the species yields in mixtures of s 2 species for the majority of a set of 33 experimental treatments compiled from the literature fort 2018a an assumption of these calculations was the attainment of equilibrium or quasi equilibrium this was checked a priori all the experiments i considered verified that all the species yields vs time seemed to stabilize at constant values an issue when using the lglve for predicting the species abundances is that for communities or polycultures with large s performing all the required experimental treatments to estimate the parameters is not feasible an alternative is to perform a fraction of all required experiments with the consequence of gaining an incomplete knowledge of the interaction coefficients needed to compute the yields through the lglve however in many circumstances we are not interested in the abundances of all the species but just in predicting the abundance of a particular species for instance one might be interested in a crop that coexists with several species of weeds or in assessing the performance of a foreign species introduced into an existing community in such cases it is not necessary to know the entire interaction matrix aij here i introduce a general method for predicting the yield of a particular species the focal species method this approach does not require a complete knowledge on the interaction matrix rather this method only requires knowing the interaction coefficients involving this focal species k i e it uses an approximated focal interaction matrix a k see materials and methods therefore the number of necessary experimental treatments to fit the interaction matrix is reduced from s 2 to an order of s to test the performance of the focal species method i consider the same 33 experiments described in fort 2018a which enables the use of the lglve as a benchmark to assess the accuracy of the method proposed here thus for each of the 33 known interaction matrices a i wrote a focal interaction matrix a k for each species k 1 s then i compared the yield predicted for the focal species against its empirical value i found that the accuracy of the focal species method is slightly lower than the accuracy achieved by the lglve as a counterpart the number of experimental treatments required to fit the focal interaction matrix is much smaller when the number of interacting species s is large hence i conclude that the focal species method can be a useful quantitative tool for forecasting purposes in applied sciences like agriculture or fisheries where experiments are time consuming expensive and often unfeasible ii materials and methods ii 1 working with relative yields it is convenient to work with relative yields ri yi ki where the species yield is normalized by its carrying capacity or ki asymptotic yield in monoculture rather than dealing with absolute yields yi this is because a it allows standardization since depending on the community and taxon the yields are measured by different quantities like biomass density biovolume or individuals density and b working with relative yields is simpler especially when the species yields differ in several orders of magnitude overall ri is less than 1 and rarely larger than 2 the lglve for s interacting species within a single trophic level can be written in terms of relative yields ri as fort 2018a fort and segura 2018 1 d r i d t r i r i 1 j 1 s a i j r j i 1 s where ri denotes the intrinsic growth rate of species i aij is an interaction coefficient quantifying the direct effect of species j on species i which is obtained from the pair of equilibrium experimental relative yields in biculture r i j e x and r j i e x as fort 2018b 2 a i j r i j e x 1 r j i e x f o r i j where the superscript ex denotes experimentally measured quantities to distinguish them from the theoretical ones arising as solutions of the lglve 1 the asterisk represents quantities at equilibrium and the subscripts i j and j i stand for the relative yield of species i in presence of species j and vice versa thus if the relative yield of species i in biculture with species j is smaller greater than 1 aij is negative positive and the interaction of species j over species i is competitive facilitative the diagonal elements of the a matrix corresponding to intraspecific interaction coefficients are taken as aii 1 for all i in order to recover the logistic equation for a single species d r i d t r i r i 1 r i henceforth since it is common practice to assume an equilibrium state we will omit the for all relative yields experimental or theoretical in the understanding that all of them are quantities at equilibrium from eq 1 the theoretical relative species yields at equilibrium verify 3 r i 1 j 1 s a i j r j 0 i 1 s ii 2 the focal species method when the knowledge of lglve parameters is incomplete it is still possible to predict species yields in fort 2018b and fort and segura 2018 a method capable of accurately predicting aggregate quantities like the relative yield total r y t i 1 s r i de wit 1970 or the mean relative yield mry ryt s has been recently proposed suppose one is interested in the performance yield of a particular or focal species k that coexists with other s 1 species thus in order to make a more accurate prediction for the focal species than the one resulted from the mry one possibility is to measure only the interaction coefficients involving this species k that is all the interaction coefficients of species j 1 2 s j k on species k akj and the interaction coefficients of species k on all the other species j ajk i e the k row and column of the interaction matrix since one is not interested in quantifying the yields of the species different from the focal species k one can treat all of them as a single average species in this way all the aij i k j k can be regarded as intraspecific interaction coefficients which as mentioned are all equal to 1 hence this is equivalent to use an interaction matrix of the form 4 a k 1 1 a 1 k 1 1 1 1 a 2 k 1 1 a k 1 a k 2 1 a k s 1 a k s 1 1 a s 1 k 1 1 1 1 a s k 1 1 the above description is what i call the focal species approximation obtaining r k i would be straightforward from eqs 3 and 4 if a the theoretical coexisting equilibrium were feasible i e r k i 0 for all species and b the matrix a k were invertible by simple inversion of the matrix equation between parentheses in eq 3 however it is easy for s 3 species to prove that the focal matrix is non invertible the det a k 0 this determinant can be immediately computed by expanding the determinant of matrix 4 along its focal row or column for example to expand along the k row of matrix 4 we have to multiply each of the coefficients in this k row by the determinant of the s 1 s 1 matrix that results from the original matrix by removing the k th row and the k th column called the minor the resulting expansion now contains s determinants of s 1 s 1 matrices instead of the s s determinant we started with notice that all s 1 s 1 determinants contain at least s 2 2 columns with all elements equal to 1 and therefore they are 0 the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns or rows is 0 which proves that the above condition b is not fulfilled see appendix i for s 3 species there is generally only one row or column with all elements equal to 1 and the determinant is not necessarily zero however in this case it is easy to show that at least one of the species must become extinct at equilibrium see appendix i and thus condition a is not fulfilled meaning that the equilibrium state with all species coexisting is unfeasible i e r k l 0 for some species l therefore since either conditions a or b are violated one cannot obtain the equilibrium relative yields by inverting 1 j 1 s a i j r j 0 and has to obtain the equilibria of focal matrices by numerically integrating the dynamical equations 5 d r i k d t r i r i k 1 j 1 s a k i j r j k i 1 s to do this i used both a simple finite differences method and the ode45 matlab ordinary differential equation solver and checked that the two methods produce the same results once the set of s relative yields r k i is obtained the next step is to consider the relative yield for the focal species r k k neglecting the values r k j for j k that is from a matrix of the form 4 we obtain just one relative yield r k k ii 3 data set i considered a set of 33 experimental treatments described in fort 2018a each involves a multispecies community s 2 with species belonging to the same taxonomic group plants algae etc some of these experiments were completed in laboratory and others in the field under natural conditions including mostly plants but also algae crustacean and protozoa see table 1 for a comprehensive list of experiments used and their references these studies included measurements of i the yields of each of the s coexisting species one treatment ii the yields of each species in monoculture s treatments and iii the yields of all species in bicultures s s 1 2 treatments as mentioned above the experiments also verified that all the species yields biomass density in most of the cases but also biovolume and number of individuals vs time seemed to stabilize at constant values the experimental polyculture yields yi ex and monoculture yields ki ex are obtained respectively by taking averages over replicas of i and ii likewise the biculture yields y i j e x and y j i e x and their standard errors se were obtained from replicas of iii and then the interaction coefficient between species i and j were in turn computed by inserting r i j e x y i j e x k i and r j i e x y j i e x k j into eq 2 to test the performance of the focal species method i considered the 33 studies of fort 2018a listed in table 1 for each of these studies i first took species 1 as the focal species and wrote the focal matrix a 1 as if we wouldn t know the interaction coefficients between species different from species 1 then we used this matrix to compute the s relative yields but only took into account the relative yield r 1 1 and neglected the values r 1 j for j 1 next i took species 2 as the focal species and wrote the focal matrix a 2 and so on so forth until i completed the computation of the s relative yields for the s species of this experimental study each one taken in turn as the focal species thus each experiment involving a polyculture of s species generates s predicted yields we repeated the same procedure for the 33 experimental studies box 1 illustrates this procedure for the four species polyculture a ibf og iw picasso et al 2008 it shows above the experimental relative yields left hand side the interaction matrix for this polyculture center and the predictions using the full lotka volterra interaction matrix right hand side the focal species part of the interaction matrix and the four focal interaction matrices that result by choosing the focal species as a ibf og or iw are shown in the middle sector of box 1 the corresponding predictions of the focal method appear at the bottom of box 1 ii 4 error accuracy metrics to quantitative evaluate the performance of the method to quantify how well the focal species method fits the observed data i use the same four metrics used in fort 2018a see appendix 2 for their definitions justification and details a the relative mean absolute error rmae b the percentage of predictions which fall within 95 confidence intervals around experimental values i e 1 96 se or p95 c the modified coefficient of efficiency e 1 legates and mccabe 1999 and d the modified index of agreement d 1 legates and mccabe 1999 to compute these indices for each experiment i consider the s predicted yields that result from applying the focal species method each of them corresponding to a different choice of the focal species for example for the four species polyculture a ibf og iw picasso et al 2008 of box 1 when choosing each species a ibf og or iw as the focal species the approximation renders an absolute error r k e x r k k smaller than the se for a og and iw species denoted with a 1 in the in out column and lager than the se for iw denoted with a 0 in the in out column therefore p95 75 as it was done in fort 2018a i took into account the following error accuracy indices to distinguish accurate from inaccurate predictions a rmae 50 b p95 66 7 c e 1 0 and d d 1 1 3 iii results table 1 summarizes the rmae and the three accuracy metrics p95 e 1 and d 1 it shows highlighted in gray when the indices violate the above inequalities indicating inaccuracy of the focal species method 1 1 the detailed results and data including focal interaction matrices a k rk and r k k as well as the contribution of each species to the four metrics used for estimating error accuracy will be provided under request notice that for the majority of the experiments 22 out of the 33 all the four error accuracy indices indicate good performance of the focal species method if restricts only to p95 which is the most widely used accuracy index in population ecology the focal species method performs well for 27 out of 33 of the experimental studies i e p95 is greater or equal to 66 7 for 27 experimental studies and its global average is 73 iii 1 accuracy of the focal species method compared with the accuracy of the lglve fig 1 compares the accuracy of the focal species method with the accuracy of the lglve using the complete interaction matrix the four error accuracy indices are shown each one in a different panel for the 33 experimental studies ordered from smaller to larger rmae produced by the focal method results from the rmae index were similar for the focal species approach and the lglve fig 1 a though p95 and e1 indices showed a greater number of experiments below the established accuracy value for the species focal approach fig 1 b and c overall the accuracy shown for the proposed focal species method is similar to that of lglve therefore the focal species method can predict the yield of focal species with reasonable accuracy fig 2 compares the results of using the focal species method with those when using the lglve for six experimental studies involving different taxa as one can observe the accuracy with which the focal species method predicts the focal species is comparable to the one obtained when using the lglve actually the same holds for most of the 33 experimental studies considered in this study iv discussion the ability to predict the abundance or biomass of different species of value to humans is essential to achieve sustainable production as well as to ensure food security and economic gain fao 2015 turral et al 2011 in the case of agriculture crop yield forecasting methods provide a tool for finding combinations of management strategies to reach multiple goals required for sustainable crop production basso et al 2013 this is critical to improve food security by increasing yield and productivity while protecting the environment godfray et al 2010 mueller et al 2012 srinivasan 2006 fisheries provide another example in which yield forecasting is helpful for fishery managers quantitative stock assessment tools serve to estimate the current status of the fishery for estimating maximum sustainable yield and for precautionary management hoggarth et al 2006 quantitative methods commonly employed to forecast the yield and production of agricultural crops have been mostly linear statistical models nass smb 2012 descriptive models have in general a short computing time and they usually contain few state variables making them helpful tools for reliable predictions however the use of descriptive or phenomenological modelling of biomass production and yield of crops has been rare but see marcelis et al 1998 in fort 2018a i showed that the lglve can accurately predict the majority of the species yields in the mixtures of s species for most of the 33 experiments considered however a limitation of this approach is that the number of experimental treatments required to estimate the lotka volterra model parameters is proportional to s 2 thus the application of lglve quickly becomes unfeasible for relatively modest species richness in this study i introduced the focal species method as a method for predicting the yield of a species of particular interest while treating the other species as a mean field in which this focal species is immersed by varying the species which is taken as focal this approximation is able to predict in almost three quarters of the cases the yield of this species within 95 confidence intervals around the corresponding experimentally measured value iv 1 comparing the performance of the focal species method and lglve from comparing the performance of the focal species method to the one of the lglve that use the full interaction matrix a it is noteworthy that the percentage of predicted yields that fall within 95 confidence intervals around the corresponding experimentally measured yields for the two methods are very similar roughly in both for three quarters of the experimental studies p95 above the 67 threshold the difference is that the focal species method only requires a much smaller number of experimental pairwise treatments s rather than s s 1 2 to fit the focal interaction matrix this is an important advantage regarding applications of this method to natural or artificial communities involving a large number of interacting species s indices rmae e 1 and d 1 favour the lglve over the focal species method i e the former leads to lower relative absolute errors and higher accuracy than the latter this is expected since the lglve include a more fine grained description of the interspecific interactions still taking averages over the 33 experimental studies for these three indices we obtain for the focal species method r m a e 42 e 1 0 29 d 1 0 69 which are pretty descent values iv 2 possible applications the method proposed in his study can be a useful tool in agriculture for instance in crop agribusiness forecasting the yield of crops is essential for any short or long term economic analysis in that sense this method allows obtaining the yield of a particular species in different polyculture crops which is something that has been recently done for perennial herbaceous polycultures through the lglve halty et al 2017 thus the focal species method could complement more basic agronomic models like the linear statistical models which are currently used in forecasting and estimating crop yields and production nass smb 2012 to obtain the final net yield per acre or ha it could also be employed in combination with other more specific models that only simulate part of the crop production system such as photosynthesis partitioning or development marcelis et al 1998 additionally the focal species method could contribute in agroecology for describing predicting and ultimately prescribing ecologically sound and sustainable management practices martin and isaac 2018 as well as avoiding environmental damage with the use of herbicides guglielmini et al 2017 a specific example is to assess and optimize the performance of a crop coexisting with weeds rejmanek et al 1989 weeds have to be controlled both tactically minimizing their adverse influence in the current crop and strategically anticipating these effects in future crops spitters 1989 the success of weed management programs which are directed towards the minimization of herbicide use largely depends upon the ability to predict the effects of weeds on crop yield kropff and spitters 1991 the main novelty of this method compared with models currently used spitters 1989 is that it takes explicitly into account the interaction effects between weeds and crop designing rational weed management practices another field in which this method could be used is in fisheries management focused on target species melnychuk et al 2017 the focal species approach could be of help in analysing the effects of non target species on target ones in this case the target species coincides with the focal species indeed the need for ecosystem based approaches to fisheries management has been widely recognized throughout the world pikitch et al 2004 iv 3 caveats and future extensions it is worth mentioning that the essence of the focal species method namely considering the elements of the interaction matrix dealing with the interactions of all other species as 1 means that the community being modelled is structured mainly by competition this is a reasonable assumption for single trophic communities schoener 1983 against which the approach is being tested nevertheless this is no longer the case for communities in which the dominant interactions are different from mutual competition for example in communities in which asymmetrical interactions of the kind of predator prey or parasite host interactions dominate in such communities antisymmetric non focal interactions could be used for instance one could randomly set each element of the focal matrix a k above the diagonal to 1 or 1 and set the corresponding symmetric element to 1 or 1 respectively mutualistic communities constitute another example in which the focal species method can be straightforwardly extended in this case all non focal elements should be set to 1 these other types of communities are beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in future work v conclusion the focal species method represents a reasonable trade off between accuracy and feasibility on the one hand when we just know the pairwise interaction coefficients involving a given species it allows predicting the yield of this species with accuracy this is a step forward with respect to the mean field like approximation considered in fort 2018b since it allows more accurate specific predictions for this focal species than just the mean relative yield on the other hand the accuracy of the focal species method is in general a little lower than that of the lglve but provided the number of interacting species s is large enough the number of experimental treatments it requires to fit its parameters is much lower natural communities like grasslands or tropical forests or plankton where s can be of the order of hundreds might be ideal scenarios for the application of the focal species approach in such natural communities to estimate the interaction coefficients is unfeasible thus precluding the use of lglve and the focal species method is a worthy approach to consider this approach is likely

appendix 1 obtaining the theoretical relative yields linear algebra and simulations the relative yields at equilibrium verify eq 3 this equation for an equilibrium in which all the theoretical relative yields are different from zero reduces to a1 1 1 j 1 s a i j r j 0 i 1 s or in matrix from ar 1 where r and 1 are column vectors of s entries with respectively the relative yields ri and ones in the case of the focal method in which a k denotes the s s focal interaction matrix 4 one has a1 1 1 j 1 s a i j k r k j 0 i 1 s or in matrix from a k r k 1 the straightforward way of calculating r k would be by inverting the eq a1 1 to obtain this vector as a1 2 r k a k 1 1 however this simple procedure doesn t work because the focal matrix a k is not invertible for s 3 and for s 3 the yield of at least one species predicted by this method is zero and thus one no longer can obtain the equilibrium yields from eq a1 2 that a k is not invertible for s 3 can be easily shown by writing the determinant this matrix as an expansion along a row or column suppose one was to expand the determinant of 4 4 matrix a a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 34 a 41 a 42 a 43 a 44 along its first row then one has to multiply each of the coefficients of the first row by the left over part of the determinant after blocking out the row and the column containing that coefficient one thus obtains ai 3 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 34 a 41 a 42 a 43 a 44 a 11 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 32 a 33 a 34 a 42 a 43 a 44 a 12 a 21 a 23 a 24 a 31 a 33 a 34 a 41 a 43 a 44 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 24 a 31 a 32 a 34 a 41 a 42 a 44 a 14 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33 the above expansion now contains four 3 3 determinants called the minors instead of the 4 4 determinant one started with in the case in which the focal matrix for species 1 a 1 onegets a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 21 1 1 1 a 31 1 1 1 a 41 1 1 1 a 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 a 12 a 21 1 1 a 31 1 1 a 41 1 1 a 13 a 21 1 1 a 31 1 1 a 41 1 1 a 14 a 21 1 1 a 31 1 1 a 41 1 1 all the above minor determinants are zero because they have at least two equal columns all 1 s this proof can be extended for larger values of s and independently of the chosen focal species k therefore one concludes that a k is non invertible for s 3 for s 3 the determinant of a 1 is not necessarily zero a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 1 1 a 31 1 1 a 11 1 1 1 1 a 12 a 21 1 a 31 1 a 13 a 21 1 a 31 1 0 a 13 a 12 a 21 1 a 31 1 and thus this matrix can in generally be inverted suppose one assumes that the theoretical coexisting equilibrium is feasible i e r k i 0 for all species however equation ai 2 with matrix a 1 produces a vector of relative yields given by r 1 0 a 13 1 a 13 a 12 a 12 1 a 13 a 12 i e r 1 1 0 similarly eq ai 2 with matrix a 2 produces a vector of relative yields given by r 2 a 23 1 a 23 a 21 0 a 21 1 a 23 a 21 i e r 2 2 0 finally eq ai 2 with matrix a 3 produces a vector of relative yields given by r 3 a 32 1 a 32 a 31 a 31 1 a 33 a 31 0 i e r 3 3 0 that is in the three cases the yield of the focal species is zero and thus one arrives to a contradiction the theoretical equilibrium in which all species coexist is not feasible this implies that eq 3 for the equilibria does not reduce to the simpler eq a1 2 therefore to obtain the equilibrium yields we have to resort to numerical integration of the differential equations 1 to integrate the dynamical equations the initial condition for the relative yields is a random set of initial values taken from a uniform random distribution between 0 and 1 then i used both a simple finite differences method and the ode45 matlab ordinary differential equation solver and checked that the two methods produce the same results appendix 2 accuracy measures to quantitative evaluate the performance of the focal species method how well a model fits the observed data usually is determined by comparing model predicted values with observations frequently evaluations of model performance utilize statistics based on the familiar pearson s correlation coefficient r or its square the coefficient of determination r 2 unfortunately these two statistics describe the degree of collinearity between the observed and model predicted values but suffer from limitations that make them poor measures of model performance willmott 1984 in fact by their very definition both indices are insensitive to additive and proportional differences between the model predictions and observations willmott 1984 for further discussion on why r and r 2 are incorrect measures of predictive accuracy see li 2017 and reference there in here to quantitative assess the degree to which the focal species method matches the observations i used the metrics summarized in table 2 all the above metrics are in terms of the absolute value instead of the square of differences this is because it was noticed that absolute values are preferable over squares since by using absolute values errors and differences are given a more appropriate weighting not inflated by their squared values willmott 1981 squaring in statistics is useful because squares are easier to manipulate mathematically than are absolute values but use of squares forces an arbitrarily greater influence on the statistic by way of the larger values legates and mccabe 1999 the relative mean absolute error rmae is obtained from dividing the mean absolute error mae between the mean of the species yields mae and the similar root mean square error rmse are two commonly used measures for assessing the predictive accuracy in the environmental sciences li and heap 2008 to avoid any dependence of mae on s i used the relative metric rmae in order to quantify the accuracy one needs to introduce some reference point actually error measures like rmae are not accuracy measures so they can only tell which model produce less error but there are unable to tell how accurate a model is li 2017 at any event a possible very general and tolerant measure of model goodness is rmae 100 i e every quantity is measured with an error smaller than the size of the quantity itself instead i considered the more stringent threshold of rmae 50 p95 measures the percentage of predictions which fall within the confidence intervals of 1 96σ within the error bars shown in fig 2 p95 100 0 means that all none of the yields predicted by the model fall within the error bars around the corresponding experimental values for p95 i considered the arbitrary threshold of 66 7 so that p95 66 7 indicates the model does a decent job e 1 legates and mccabe 1999 is a modified version of the coefficient of efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined by e 1 mse σ 2 mse mean square error but in terms of absolute differences rather than square differences it ranges from minus infinity to 1 with higher values indicating better agreement and e 1 1 indicating perfect match between model and experimental data for example if the absolute differences between the model and the observation is as large as the variability in the observed data measured by i 1 s r i e x r e x then e 1 0 0 and if it exceeds it then e 1 0 0 i e the observed mean is a better predictor than ri thus a value of zero for e 1 indicates that the observed mean r e x is as good a predictor as the model while negative values indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model wilcox et al 1990 d 1 is similar to e 1 an advantage over the modified efficiency is that it is bounded i e it varies from 0 0 to 1 0 again with higher values indicating better agreement between the model and observation by the same token it loses the meaningful reference point of 0 0 for the coefficient of efficiency which serves to assess when the model is a better predictor than the observed mean however it is possible to introduce a reference point for d 1 by observing that for two completely uncorrelated random vectors drawn from a uniform distribution d 1 is on average 1 3 supp mat of fort 2018a therefore if d 1 1 3 one concludes that the model is a poor predictor
