9630,the main purpose of this study is to evaluate evaporation estimation methods for water surfaces under floating coverage in arid areas the natural water surface evaporation methods namely the mass transfer method mt bowen ratio energy balance breb method penman method the penman monteith method pm and the priestley taylor method pt are corrected to establish the covered water surface evaporation methods which are based on the micrometeorology near the covered water surface energy balance components and bowen ratio the radiation term of the natural water surface evaporation model is corrected by introducing the bowen ratio of the entire surface which includes the uncovered water surface and the floating cover surface the mass transfer coefficient and aerodynamic impedance in the aerodynamic terms of the natural water surface evaporation model were corrected taking the evaporation of the water surface covered by spheres coverage rate of spheres is 76 4 as an example based on the rose change characteristics of the above parameters the effects of these modified evaporation models are comprehensively evaluated from three different time scales even months odd months and the complete test period the evaluation methods include the root mean square error rmse index of agreement d mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 the results show that under three different time scales the penman monteith model is the most promising and superior in estimating water surface evaporation under floating coverage for the complete test period rmse 0 11 mm d 1 d 0 99 mbe 0 07 mm d 1 and r2 0 99 the priestley taylor model is slightly less effective in estimating evaporation than the penman monteith model and the mass transfer model and the penman model are less effective in estimating evaporation furthermore the analysis of the penman monteith model shows that the evaporation of the radiation term 69 5 is higher than that of the aerodynamic term 30 5 during the evaporation of the water surface under floating coverage while the evaporation of the radiation term is dominant moreover during the complete test period the weights of the radiation evaporation and aerodynamic evaporation changed significantly with time the proportion of radiation evaporation varies from 54 8 to 81 7 while that of aerodynamic evaporation varies from 18 3 to 45 2 keywords bowen ratio energy balance radiation term aerodynamic term sphere 1 introduction in arid and semi arid areas the water surface evaporation loss of plain reservoirs is large resulting in low water resource utilization in the reservoirs which severely restricts the sustainable development of local agriculture and ecology daniel et al 2019 tian et al 2021 researchers have successively carried out anti evaporation and water saving studies of different coverage methods in arid and semi arid areas and have achieved results such as chemical molecular coverage gavin et al 2017 wandel et al 2017 saggaï et al 2018 sunshade net of suspension coverage martínez alvarez et al 2009 gallego elvira et al 2012 and floating boards or spheres of floating coverage silva et al 2017 aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 shalaby et al 2021 assouline and narkis 2021 for arid area plain reservoirs with large water areas floating coverage spheres is an ideal way to suppress water surface evaporation haghighi et al 2018 compared with other coverage methods floating coverage has strong wind and wave resistance lower initial investment and lower operation and maintenance costs jiang et al 2015 han et al 2019 studies have shown that the evaporation reduction rate of water surfaces covered by floating benzene boards is 51 25 jiang et al 2016 and the evaporation reduction rate of the water surface covered by spheres was as high as 70 6 the coverage rate was 76 4 han et al 2020 to evaluate the performance of different floating cover materials it is necessary to estimate the evaporation loss of the water surface under the floating cover based on relevant meteorological data there are three main methods for estimating natural water surface evaporation based on meteorological data mass transmission method singh et al 1997 xu et al 1998 energy budget and combination methods penman 1948 monteith 1965 priestley and taylor 1972 valiantzas et al 2006 mcjannet et al 2013 xu et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 these methods are widely used to estimate natural water surface evaporation according to existing research there are few studies on evaporation estimation methods for covered water surfaces especially for floating coverage gallego elvira et al 2012 proposed a free or mixed convective mass transfer formula based on the sherwood number to estimate water surface evaporation this formula estimated the evaporation of the water surface under a suspended cover shading net and achieved better results notably the formula requires the water surface temperature to be higher than the atmospheric temperature gallego elvira et al 2012 pauken 1998 bower and saylor 2009 however the relationship between the water surface temperature and atmospheric temperature is related to the regions and seasons the water surface temperature was not higher than the atmospheric temperature in any region han et al 2019 2020 tang et al 2016 for floating coverage owing to the contact of the cover with the water surface the cover and the water surface are often taken as a whole surface to study the water surface evaporation loss and energy balance cooley 1970 aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 han et al 2020 rezazadeh et al 2020 compared with the energy balance system of a natural water body the net radiation absorbed by the entire surface is principally distributed to the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux the percentage of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux in the available energy the difference between net radiation and heat storage flux for evaporation has changed significantly and the sign of sensible heat flux is negative which is the opposite of the positive value of natural water surface sensible heat flux the bowen ratio which is the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux is a common parameter for the change in the energy balance components for example han et al 2020 found that the average bowen ratio of the natural water surface during the complete non freezing period march to october was 0 10 and the average bowen ratio of the whole surface covered by the silver gray spheres was 1 97 aminzadeh et al 2018 found that the bowen ratio of the whole surface under a floating disk plate was much higher than that of the uncovered water surface and the sensible heat flux changed from a negative value to a positive value lehmann et al 2019 found that the bowen ratio of the overall surface is 3 1 and 1 37 respectively when the black disk and the black sphere are used as the floating cover and the bowen ratio of the overall surface is 2 0 and 0 75 when the white disk and white spheres are used as the floating cover respectively this is much higher than the bowen ratio of the natural water surface however for natural water bodies almost all the net radiation and sensible heat flux absorbed by the water surface are used for evaporative consumption shakir et al 2008 gallego elvira et al 2010 han et al 2020 the reduction in wind speed near the water surface covered by the floating or suspended cover and the change in the diffusion channel of water vapor molecules would cause changes in the water vapor transmission coefficient between the water surface and the atmosphere which in turn affects the aerodynamic term of the evaporation process of the water surface for example the wind speed near the water surface covered by the shading net is reduced by approximately 91 and the water vapor transmission coefficient is reduced by approximately 55 gallego elvira et al 2011 when the sphere coverage rate was 76 4 the water vapor transmission coefficient was reduced by approximately 75 3 han et al 2020 from the above analysis it can be seen that if rn g is used as the available energy of the water surface evaporation radiation term like the natural water surface evaporation methods it is bound to seriously overestimate the available energy rn g of the water surface evaporation under the floating cover if the empirical parameters in the aerodynamic term of natural water surface evaporation such as mass transfer coefficient aerodynamic impedance wind function etc are used in the aerodynamic term of water surface evaporation under floating coverage it would inevitably lead to a large relative error in estimating the evaporation of the aerodynamic term therefore it is necessary to study the water surface evaporation methods under floating coverage separately from the radiation term and the aerodynamic term and establish an evaporation estimation method suitable for water surfaces under floating cover the main purpose of this study was to examine the following two aspects 1 based on the evaporation calculation model of the natural water surface including the mass transfer model penman monteith model and priestley taylor model and the change characteristics of various meteorological parameters under floating coverage the radiation term introducing bowen ratio and aerodynamic terms in evaporation calculation models of the natural water surface were corrected and the evaporation calculation model of the water surface under floating coverage was established 2 based on the monthly variation characteristics of the microclimate near the water surface covered by spheres and the overall surface energy balance components the accuracy of each corrected method used to estimate the evaporation of the water surface under floating coverage was tested at three different time scales finally a water surface evaporation model suitable for floating cover was developed 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 mass transfer mt method the mass transfer method was proposed by studying the vortex transfer process of water vapor from the evaporation surface to the atmosphere based on dalton s law in the case of high mass transfer coefficient accuracy this method can achieve better results shakir et al 2008 burston 2002 the mass transfer formula of the natural water surface evaporation rate can generally be expressed as 1 e m t μ u 2 e s e a where e mt is the evaporation rate mm day 1 µ is the mass transfer coefficient empirical constant u 2 is the wind speed at a distance of 2 m from the ground m s 1 e s is the saturated water vapor pressure on the water surface kpa and e a is the vapor pressure of the atmosphere kpa the atmospheric water vapor pressure has the following relationship with the temperature and humidity 2 e s t 0 6105 exp 17 27 t t 237 7 3 e a r h e s t a where t a is the air temperature rh is the measured relative humidity the wind speed at the measured height can be converted to the wind speed at a height of 2 m above the ground using eq 4 shakir et al 2008 allen et al 1998 4 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 where u z is the wind speed at height above the ground m s 1 the mass transfer coefficient can be determined based on the slope of the origin shakir et al 2008 sturrock et al 1992 sacks et al 1994 with μ as the slope emt as the dependent variable and u2 e s e a as the independent variable formula 1 becomes y k x 2 2 bowen ration energy balance breb method in the evaporation method for natural water surfaces the available energy the difference between net radiation and heat storage flux for evaporation in the radiation term is almost all used for evaporation the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux is smaller bowen ratio is 0 1 han et al 2020 0 07 shakir et al 2008 0 103 gallego elvira et al 2011 the latent heat flux is much higher than the sensible heat flux it seems reasonable to use the difference between the net radiation and heat storage flux as the energy available for evaporation of the radiation term as for the entire surface formed by the floating cover surface and the uncovered water surface part of the heat radiation absorbed by the entire surface is used for the consumption of the water surface evaporation and the latent heat flux is negative the other part is used for heat dissipation from the entire surface to the atmosphere and the sensible heat flux is negative which means that the overall surface conducts heat to the atmosphere the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux the bowen ratio is 0 75 3 1 aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 han et al 2020 is much higher than that of the natural water surface it can be seen that the available energy for evaporation of the radiation term in the evaporation methods only accounts for a part of the difference between the net radiation and heat storage flux on the entire surface the energy balance equation is described as 5 r n λ e h s g where r n is the surface radiation w m 2 λe is the latent heat flux w m 2 g is the heat storage flux w m 2 and h s is the sensible heat flux w m 2 the net radiation of the whole surface under the floating cover water surface and cover surface can be monitored by the net radiometer sensor or calculated by the following formula cooley 1970 aminzadeh et al 2018 han et al 2020 6 r n p 1 α s w p 2 α s c s p

coefficient h v m s 1 the overall surface temperature can be expressed as cooley 1970 han et al 2020 9 t s p 1 t w p 2 t c the heat storage flux g can be calculated from the rate of change of the surface temperature of the floating cover and the water body han et al 2020 10 g c c n m δ t δ t ρ w c w i 0 i 7 d i δ t w i δ t c c n m t c t t c t 1 δ t ρ w c w i 0 i 7 d i t i w t t i w t 1 δ t

water temperature of each layer the bowen ratio is described as 11 β h s λ e by combining the energy balance equation eq 5 and the commonly used parameter bowen ratio the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux eq 11 the bowen ratio energy balance equation eq 12 can be obtained which can better reflect the changes in the radiation term available energy for evaporation in water surface evaporation ikebughi et al 1988 stannard et al 1991 shakir et al 2008 in this study the right term of eq 12 is defined as the energy available for evaporation on the water surface under floating coverage the bowen ratio energy balance equation can be described as 12 λ e r n g 1 β 2 3 combination method the combination methods include both radiant energy radiation term and aerodynamic energy aerodynamic term required to maintain evaporation commonly used evaporation combination methods are the penman model penman monteith pm model and priestley taylor pt model 2 3 1 penman method the penman method divides the energy required for evaporation into radiation and aerodynamic terms this is a semi theoretical and semi empirical evaporation calculation formula the aerodynamic term is a function of wind speed and is an empirical term penman 1948 gallego elvira et al 2012 13 λ e p λ e r λ e a δ r n g δ γ 6 34 γ 1 0 536 u e s e a δ γ where r n is the net radiation on the natural water

3 2 penman monteith pm method the penman monteith method is an evaporation combined model proposed by monteith based on the penman method monteith 1965 this method does not include an empirical wind function researchers modified the aerodynamic term of the original penman monteith method and established the penman monteith method for natural water surface evaporation craig 2006 mcjannet et al 2008 yao et al 2010 16 λ e p m λ e r λ e a δ r n g δ γ 86400 ρ a c a e s e a r a δ γ the evaporative radiation term in eq 16 is corrected by introducing the available energy for water surface

γ λ e 2 3 3 priestley taylor pt method priestley and taylor proposed a pt method for a water surface evaporation model based on the penman method priestley and taylor 1972 this method simplifies and merges the radiation and aerodynamic terms by introducing a dimensionless quantity α and can still estimate the evaporation without wind speed records this method has been verified by many researchers parlange and katul 1992 wang et al 2004 yang et al 2013 guo et al 2015 20 λ e p t α δ δ γ r n g the pt method for water surface evaporation of floating cover can be described as 21 λ e p t α δ δ γ r n g α λ e r 22 α 1 e a e r compared with natural water surface evaporation the most significant changes in the energy balance components under floating coverage are the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux the coefficient α is the only parameter in the pt formula that can correlate latent heat flux with sensible heat flux and can generally be obtained using the following two methods α 1 is a function of bowen ratio β α 1 can be calculated by the following formula gallego elvira et al 2012 shakir et al 2008 23 α δ γ δ 1 β it should be noted that when formula 23 is substituted into eq 21 as a parameter the bowen ratio energy balance equation eq 12 can be obtained therefore the pt1 method is the same as the bowen ratio energy balance breb method the estimation effects of the two evaporation methods are the same the coefficient α 2 can also be determined according to the slope of the origin with the coefficient α 2 as the slope and e pt as the dependent variable and r n g δ δ γ as the independent variable eq 21 can be changed to y kx 2 4 parameter determination and evaluation criteria according to the monthly changes in the parameters in the above methods during the test period from march to october the bowen ratio aerodynamic impedance and pt coefficient exhibited significant seasonal changes see section 4 3 these parameters can be determined from the following three aspects 1 based on the measured meteorological data and evaporation data from march to october the parameters for each evaporation method can be calculated during the test period the calculated parameters were used to estimate the evaporation of each method during the test period 2 based on the measured meteorological data and evaporation data in the odd months march may july and september these parameters in each evaporation method can be calculated during the odd months the calculated parameters are used to estimate the evaporation of each method in even months april june august and october 3 based on the measured meteorological data and evaporation data in the even months these parameters in each evaporation method can be calculated during even months the calculated parameters were used to estimate the evaporation of each method in odd months the accuracy of the simulated values of various models was evaluated based on the statistical characteristics of the estimated evaporation of the model and the measured evaporation these statistical characteristics are the root mean square error rmse index of agreement d mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 3 materials and methods 3 1 description of test site the test site is located at the soil and water conservation reservoir in turpan xinjiang the small reservoir has a surface area of 2 0 hm2 and a storage capacity of 60 000 m3 fig 1 the experiment was conducted on the dam of the reservoir during the period from march 2018 to october 2018 covering the entire non freezing period two identical evaporators with a diameter of 1 20 m and a height of 0 80 m were arranged on the reservoir dam to minimize the energy exchange between the side wall of the evaporators and the atmosphere the side wall and bottom of the evaporators were wrapped with thermal insulation cotton and reflective film the water surface of evaporator a was without the covering material the water surface of evaporator b was completely covered with high density polyethylene spheres with a diameter of 100 mm and the number of spheres and coverage rate were 110 and 76 4 respectively 3 2 evaporation and micrometeorological measurements a water level probe model sw1 1 was used to monitor the water level change in the evaporator the daily evaporation of the two evaporators was directly derived from the water level measurements and then the monthly data were obtained because of the different evaporation intensities the water in the evaporators was supplemented to the same water level every four days according to existing research han et al 2020 the experiment studied the heat flux exchange process between the whole surface water surface spherical surface and the atmospheric interface 1 5 m above the water surface from march to october the meteorological sensors were installed above the water surface to monitor meteorological data at the atmospheric interface 1 5 m above the water surface including atmospheric temperature fr ts wind speed fr ws relative humidity fr hs etc eight water temperature sensors fr wts were arranged in each evaporator at equal intervals in each evaporator to monitor the changes of water temperature at different depths a temperature sensor fr sts was installed on the floating cover surface to monitor the surface temperature each sensor recorded the data every hour and then the daily data were obtained fig 2 daily data were processed to obtain the monthly mean values of each parameter based on the above monthly data the monthly mean values of the latent heat flux sensible heat flux and heat storage flux can be obtained the monthly mean values of net radiation can be obtained as the only unknown term in the energy balance equation eq 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 temperature gradient and water vapor pressure difference fig 3 shows the monthly variation trend of atmospheric temperature water surface temperature in evaporator a and water surface temperature in evaporator b from march to october the atmospheric temperature the water surface temperature of the covered group and the water surface temperature of the uncovered group first increased and then decreased reaching a maximum in july from april to september owing to the increase in solar radiation intensity the heat absorbed by the spheres is transferred to the water body causing the water surface temperature to be higher than that of the uncovered group this phenomenon is similar to the existing research results mady et al 2021 lehmann et al 2019 aminzadeh et al 2018 these research results show that from spring to autumn the solar radiation intensity gradually increased and gradually decreased in summer july the solar radiation reaches the maximum value and the temperature of the uncovered water surface and covered water body increased and then decreased the temperature difference between the covered water surface and the uncovered water surface primarily depends on the thermal conductivity of the covering material to the water body aminzadeh et al 2018 for the covering material with poor thermal conductivity the water surface temperature of the covered group may have the opposite effect to the results of this study mady et al 2021 for the water body covered by suspension because the suspended cover does not contact the water surface and acts as a sunshade the temperature of the water surface under the suspended cover is lower than that of the uncovered water surface gallego elvira et al 2011 according to formula 2 the saturated vapor pressure difference of the covered group was higher than that of the uncovered group fig 4 from april to september in march and october the solar radiation intensity was lower the heat absorbed by the spheres decreased and the water surface temperature under the cover was lower than that of the uncovered group the saturated vapor pressure difference of the covered group was lower than that of the uncovered group in march and october fig 4 during the test period the monthly average water surface temperature of the covered group was 1 2 higher than that of the uncovered group and the saturated water vapor pressure difference of the covered group was 0 26 kpa higher than that of the uncovered group according to the surface temperature of the spheres and the uncovered water surface temperature for the covered evaporator measured in each month the monthly average value of the overall surface temperature for the covered evaporator during the test period was obtained using formula 9 table 1 shows the differences between the atmospheric temperature and the water surface temperature for the uncovered evaporator and the overall surface water surface and the surface of spheres temperature during the test period for the uncovered evaporator the water surface temperature is higher than the atmospheric temperature from march to may and water body transfers heat to the atmosphere the water surface temperature is lower than the atmospheric temperature and the atmosphere transfers heat to the water body from june to october the average temperature gradient between the water surface of the uncovered evaporator and the atmosphere was 1 7 during the test period the overall surface temperature of the covered evaporator is higher than the atmospheric temperature from march to october and the overall surface transfers heat to the atmosphere during the test period the average temperature gradient between the overall surface of the covered evaporator and the atmosphere was 45 9 which means that the amount of heat available for water surface evaporation under floating coverage is significantly reduced lehmann et al 2019 found that the temperature of the black floating disk surface was as high as 55 60 c the temperature of the white floating disk surface was as high as 35 40 c and the temperature of the floating cover surface was much higher than the atmospheric temperature this is primarily due to the high absorption rate of solar radiation by the floating cover surface and the low thermal conductivity of the water body which is concentrated on the surface of the floating cover and the temperature of the floating cover surface increases significantly when the temperature gradient between the floating cover surface and the atmosphere is high compared with the temperature difference between the uncovered water surface and the atmosphere the overall surface sensible heat flux of the covered group increased significantly eq 8 mady et al 2021 aminzadeh et al 2018 according to the energy balance equation in the case of insignificant changes in net radiation and heat storage flux the sensible heat flux increased significantly and the latent heat flux used for evaporation decreased significantly han et al 2020 section 4 2 4 2 energy flux fig 5 shows the monthly variation in the energy flux of the overall surface covered by the spheres the size sign and relative weight of the energy balance components on the overall surface of the covered evaporator changed significantly the overall surface net radiation is mainly composed of two parts one part is the net radiation absorbed by the sphere surface and the other part is the net radiation absorbed by the water surface among the pores of the spheres during the test period the change range on the overall surface net radiation was 89 43 w m 2 313 14 w m 2 and the monthly average was 203 80 w m 2 compared with the net radiation on the natural water surface the net radiation on the overall surface is reduced by only 2 8 han et al 2020 this is mainly related to factors such as the shape color and coverage of the floating cover cooley 1970 aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 during the test period the overall surface temperature was always higher than that of the uncovered evaporator the sensible heat flux was negative 213 59 w m 2 to 56 69 w m 2 and the monthly average was 135 27 w m 2 the overall surface transfers heat to the atmosphere and the transmission direction is opposite to that of the natural water surface the latent heat flux of the covered evaporator varied from 99 58 w m 2 to 26 29 w m 2 with a monthly average of 68 51 w m 2 compared with the natural water surface the latent heat flux of the covered evaporator was reduced by approximately 70 6 this is related to a reduction in the water surface coverage rate of 76 4 similar to the heat storage flux of the natural water body the covered water body stores heat from march to july and releases heat from august to october the heat storage flux varies within a small range 0 01 w m 2 7 70 w m 2 compared with other energy fluxes the heat storage flux is much smaller and can be ignored on a long term scale han et al 2020 during the test period the available energy rn g for evaporation was 203 78 w m 2 for the covered evaporator the latent heat flux was 0 33 times the available energy for evaporation λe 0 33 rn g r2 0 98 and the sensible heat flux was 0 67 times of the available energy for evaporation hs 0 67 rn g r2 0 996 it can be seen that part of the available energy for evaporation is used for the heat consumed by water surface evaporation and the other part is used for the heat transferred from the entire surface to the atmosphere the available energy rn g for natural water surface evaporation is 209 60 w m 2 and the latent heat flux is 1 12 times the available energy for evaporation λe 1 12 rn g r2 0 98 the main reason why the latent heat flux is higher than the available energy for evaporation is that the heat conducted from the water surface to the atmosphere during the test period is lower than the heat conducted from the atmosphere to the water body and the sensible heat flux is a positive value the sensible heat flux net radiation and part of the heat storage flux of the natural water body are used for the heat consumed by water surface evaporation in summary when the water body is covered by spheres the heat used for evaporation on the water surface changes significantly 4 3 parameter determination 4 3 1 mass transfer coefficient the mass transfer coefficient μ was calculated from the slope of the straight line fitted to the data point through the origin where the evaporation e is the dependent variable and u2 es ea is the independent variable fig 6 the monthly average values of the saturated water vapor pressure difference es ea are listed in table 1 and the monthly average values of wind speed u2 are listed in table 2 the mt coefficient in odd months was 0 101 r2 0 94 the mt coefficient in even months was 0 112 r2 0 85 and the mt coefficient in the complete experimental period was 0 106 r2 0 91 this is similar to the mass transfer coefficient of water surface evaporation covered by a floating white aquacap burston 2002 this may be related to the geometric shape of the two types of cover or the boundary of interstitial water between the covers li et al 2011 aminzadeh et al 2017 lehmann et al 2019 for example when the spheres aquacaps are closely arranged the boundary of water in contact with the atmosphere consists of three tangent arcs han et al 2019 that is the boundary conditions of the gap water evaporation between the coverings are similar 4 3 2 bowen ratio the bowen ratio β can be calculated using formula 11 the range of bowen ratio in the covered evaporator is 1 30 2 47 during the test period table2 and the monthly average bowen ratio is 2 00 the average bowen ratio in odd months was 2 10 and the average bowen ratio in even months was 1 90 this result is similar to the bowen ratio of existing floating cover methods which is related to factors such as the color and shape of the cover aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 4 3 3 aerodynamic impedance the aerodynamic impedance in the evaporation of the water surface covered by spheres was calculated using eq 19 the aerodynamic impedance during the complete non freezing period is between 349 70 s m 1 and 632 21 s m 1 table 2 the monthly average aerodynamic impedance is 464 56 s m 1 the aerodynamic impedance exhibited a significant change trend with time the average aerodynamic impedance in odd months was 436 60 s m 1 and the average aerodynamic impedance in even months was 491 92 s m 1 4 3 4 pt coefficient incorporating the bowen ratio of each month into eq 23 the pt coefficient α varied from 0 39 to 0 60 during the test period table 2 and the monthly average value was 0 47 the pt coefficient has significant seasonal changes table 2 in which the average value of the pt coefficient in odd months was 0 45 and the average value of the pt coefficient in even months was 0 49 α can be determined according to the slope across the origin where λe is the dependent variable and r n g δ δ γ is the independent variable pt coefficient in odd months is 0 42 r2 0 978 pt coefficient in even months is 0 44 r2 0 973 average monthly pt coefficient is 0 43 r2 0 979 during the test period fig 7 the pt coefficients obtained by the above two methods is similar but has a large deviation from the value 1 2 1 32 originally proposed by priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 this is principally because the bowen ratio of the overall surface is much higher than that of the natural water surface and the pt coefficient is inversely proportional to the bowen ratio eq 23 4 4 performance of different evaporation estimation methods when simulating water surface evaporation under floating coverage in odd months the parameters of each evaporation model take the parameter values in even months the mass transfer coefficient μ in the mt method was 0 112 the bowen ratio β in the breb method was 1 90 the bowen ratio β in the penman method was 1 90 the bowen ratio β in the penman monteith method was 1 90 the aerodynamic impedance r a was 491 92 s m 1 the priestley taylor coefficient α1 was 0 49 and α2 was 0 44 when simulating water surface evaporation under floating coverage in even months the parameters of each evaporation model take the parameter values in odd months the mass transfer coefficient μ in the mt method was 0 101 the bowen ratio β in the breb method is 2 10 the bowen ratio β in the penman method was 2 10 the bowen ratio β in the penman monteith method was 2 10 the aerodynamic impedance r a is 436 60 s m 1 the priestley taylor coefficient α1 was 0 45 and α2 was 0 42 when simulating water surface evaporation under floating coverage during the test period the parameters of each evaporation model take the parameter values in 3 10 months the mass transfer coefficient μ in the mt method was 0 106 the bowen ratio β in the breb method was 2 0 the bowen ratio β in the penman method was 2 0 the bowen ratio β in the penman monteith method was 2 0 the aerodynamic impedance r a was 464 26 s m 1 the priestley taylor coefficient α1 was 0 47 and α2 was 0 43 fig 8 shows the observed evaporation during the complete test period march to october and the simulated evaporation values of the different methods table 3 shows the statistical characteristics of the observed and measured values of evaporation at the three different time scales the root mean square error corresponding to the penman monteith method under three different time scales is the smallest 0 09 mm d 1 0 15 mm d 1 0 11 mm d 1 respectively and the method has the best simulation effect the root mean square error of the pt breb method is relatively low and its simulation effect is better than that of the penman and mt methods the root mean square error corresponding to the mt method was the largest and the simulation effect was the worst the average deviation error mbe of the measured evaporation and simulated evaporation of each method shows that the mt and penman methods underestimate the water surface evaporation under the floating cover in odd months even months and the entire test period both the pm method and the pt breb method underestimated the water surface evaporation under the floating cover in even months and overestimated the water surface evaporation under floating coverage in odd months during the entire test period only the pt1 breb method underestimated water surface evaporation under floating coverage comprehensive analysis of the mbe value and its variation range corresponding to each model under three different time scales the pm method estimates that evaporation is better than other models under three different time scales the evaluation effect of the consistency index d and determination coefficient r2 of the measured and simulated evaporation of each method is similar to that of the root mean square error rmse the consistency index and the determination coefficient r2 corresponding to the pm method were the highest and the simulation effect of the pm method was the best the consistency index and the determination coefficient r2 corresponding to the pt method are higher and the simulation effect of the pt breb method is better than that of the penman and mt methods the consistency index and the determination coefficient r2 corresponding to the mt method are the lowest and the simulation effect of the mt method is the worst from the above analysis it can be seen that under three different time scales the mt method and the penman method are obviously not suitable for the estimation of water surface evaporation under floating coverage while the pt2 method can provide a good and reasonable estimation and the pm method is most suitable as a model for estimating water surface evaporation under floating coverage 4 4 1 breb method and mt method under floating coverage compared with the bowen ratio energy balance method the water surface evaporation estimated by the mt method under floating coverage is quite different from the actual evaporation that is the bowen ratio energy method is better than the mass transfer method this is similar to findings in other studies in arid or semi arid areas with low relative humidity and large changes in wind speed solar radiation plays a leading role in water surface evaporation and evaporation estimation methods based on wind speed and water vapor pressure difference are not suitable shakir et al 2008 sacks et al 1994 abtew 2001 4 4 2 combination methods under floating coverage the evaporation estimated by the pm method was significantly better than the penman method the radiant flux of the two methods is the same as the usable energy flux rn g 1 β and shows a similar pattern to the actual evaporation although the evaporation of the radiation term was reduced by approximately 24 the evaporation of the radiation term was approximately 0 76 times the measured evaporation r2 0 97 the difference in the estimated evaporation between the two types of methods lies in the composition of the aerodynamic term the aerodynamic term in the penman method is a wind function that includes the wind speed and water vapor pressure difference it can be seen from the mass transfer method that the wind function is not applicable in arid or semi arid areas where the range of wind speed varies greatly shakir et al 2008 sacks et al 1994 abtew 2001 and it significantly underestimates the evaporation of aerodynamic terms the aerodynamic term of the pm method replaces the empirical wind function with aerodynamic impedance which does not lead to substantial underestimation compared with the bowen ratio β 0 23 to 0 05 of the natural water surface where the inter monthly changes are not significant han et al 2020 the bowen ratio β of the overall surface under the floating cover is more significantly affected by the change in time the monthly variation range during the complete non freezing period is larger 1 30 2 47 resulting in a large monthly change in the pt coefficient α formula 23 during the complete non freezing period the α1 derived from the monthly average value and the α2 derived from the linear fitting used in the pt method to calculate the evaporation may be the cause of the unsatisfactory estimation effect of the pt method 4 4 3 theoretical analysis of the estimated effect of each evaporation method the estimation effects of the mt and penman methods in this study are poor mainly because the empirical wind functions in these two models are proposed based on natural water surface evaporation the use of these wind functions has certain limitations in determining the aerodynamic term evaporation of floating covered water surfaces at the same time the change in wind speed near the water surface aerodynamic effect becomes more complicated owing to the floating cover li et al 2011 aminzadeh et al 2017 lehmann et al 2019 which complicates the evaporation estimation model of the covered water surface for the pt method the method simplifies the evaporation estimation method by introducing a dimensionless quantity the estimation effect of this method was better than that of the mt and penman methods however the method was originally proposed under the condition of minimal advection no convection for large area wet surface evaporation han et al 2021 and the aerodynamic effect near the covered water surface still needs to be further studied this may be one of the reasons why the pt model is a poor model for estimating the evaporation of floating covered water surfaces the aerodynamic term of the pm model replaces the empirical wind function with aerodynamic impedance which greatly reduces the error caused by the uncertainty of the aerodynamic effect on the estimation of water surface evaporation 4 5 evaporation distribution of radiant and aerodynamic terms under floating coverage based on the evaporation of the radiation term and the evaporation of the aerodynamic term in the pm method and the evaporation of the radiation term and the coefficient α in the pt2 method the ratio of the evaporation of the radiation term to the aerodynamic term accounts for the total amount of evaporation is different in different time periods during the complete non freezing period march october the evaporation of the radiative term accounts for 69 5 and 68 0 of the total evaporation respectively in the two methods the evaporation of the aerodynamic term accounted for 30 5 and 32 of the total evaporation respectively in the two methods it can be seen that the proportion of the radiation term in the coverage group is higher than that of the aerodynamic term and the radiation term plays a leading role in water surface evaporation the above conclusion can be obtained from eq 22 because the pt method coefficient is less than 1 and the ratio of the aerodynamic term to the radiation term is negative in the pt method it should be noted that during the complete non freezing period the proportions of radiation and aerodynamic terms changed significantly with time for example in the pm method with the change in solar radiation intensity during the test period first increases and then decreases the proportion of radiation term in water surface evaporation first increases and then decreases which varies from 54 8 to 81 7 reaching a maximum in july the proportion of aerodynamic term first decreased and then increased varying from 18 3 to 45 2 reaching a minimum in july 5 conclusions based on the research on the interface energy balance components and micrometeorology in the floating coverage mode the bowen ratio of the overall surface and aerodynamic impedance in the floating coverage mode are introduced to the open water evaporation models mt breb penman pm and pt to correct the radiation term and aerodynamic term and establish evaporation models suitable for water surfaces under floating coverage through comprehensive statistical evaluation of the simulated evaporation values and measured evaporation values at the three different time scales the most promising evaporation method for water surfaces under floating coverage has been proposed the following conclusions were drawn from the analysis under the three different time scales the pm method is the most promising and superior evaporation method for water surfaces under floating coverage the estimated evaporation effect of the pt2 method α taking the linear fitting value is slightly lower than that of the pm method but better than that of the pt1 breb method α taking the average value which may be related to the larger variation range of the β value or α value owing to the inclusion of empirical wind functions the mass transfer method and the penman method have large errors in the water surface evaporation estimation under floating coverage from the combined methods pm and pt2 it can be seen that the evaporation of the radiation term is dominant in the water surface evaporation under floating coverage and the evaporation of the radiation term is higher than that of the aerodynamic term moreover during the complete non freezing period the weights of the radiation term evaporation and aerodynamic term evaporation in the water surface evaporation change significantly over time the proportion of evaporation of the radiation term varies from 54 8 to 81 7 the highest value in july and the proportion of evaporation of the aerodynamic term varies from 18 3 to 45 2 the lowest value in july the theoretical analysis of this study provides a good basis for the estimation of evaporation of water surface under floating cover especially the introduction of the bowen ratio of the overall surface in the evaporation radiation term from a practical point of view the modified penman monteith formula proved to be an ideal model for estimating water surface evaporation under floating cover and explained that the radiation term evaporation plays a dominant role in water surface evaporation under floating cover declaration of competing interest the authors

9630,the main purpose of this study is to evaluate evaporation estimation methods for water surfaces under floating coverage in arid areas the natural water surface evaporation methods namely the mass transfer method mt bowen ratio energy balance breb method penman method the penman monteith method pm and the priestley taylor method pt are corrected to establish the covered water surface evaporation methods which are based on the micrometeorology near the covered water surface energy balance components and bowen ratio the radiation term of the natural water surface evaporation model is corrected by introducing the bowen ratio of the entire surface which includes the uncovered water surface and the floating cover surface the mass transfer coefficient and aerodynamic impedance in the aerodynamic terms of the natural water surface evaporation model were corrected taking the evaporation of the water surface covered by spheres coverage rate of spheres is 76 4 as an example based on the rose change characteristics of the above parameters the effects of these modified evaporation models are comprehensively evaluated from three different time scales even months odd months and the complete test period the evaluation methods include the root mean square error rmse index of agreement d mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 the results show that under three different time scales the penman monteith model is the most promising and superior in estimating water surface evaporation under floating coverage for the complete test period rmse 0 11 mm d 1 d 0 99 mbe 0 07 mm d 1 and r2 0 99 the priestley taylor model is slightly less effective in estimating evaporation than the penman monteith model and the mass transfer model and the penman model are less effective in estimating evaporation furthermore the analysis of the penman monteith model shows that the evaporation of the radiation term 69 5 is higher than that of the aerodynamic term 30 5 during the evaporation of the water surface under floating coverage while the evaporation of the radiation term is dominant moreover during the complete test period the weights of the radiation evaporation and aerodynamic evaporation changed significantly with time the proportion of radiation evaporation varies from 54 8 to 81 7 while that of aerodynamic evaporation varies from 18 3 to 45 2 keywords bowen ratio energy balance radiation term aerodynamic term sphere 1 introduction in arid and semi arid areas the water surface evaporation loss of plain reservoirs is large resulting in low water resource utilization in the reservoirs which severely restricts the sustainable development of local agriculture and ecology daniel et al 2019 tian et al 2021 researchers have successively carried out anti evaporation and water saving studies of different coverage methods in arid and semi arid areas and have achieved results such as chemical molecular coverage gavin et al 2017 wandel et al 2017 saggaï et al 2018 sunshade net of suspension coverage martínez alvarez et al 2009 gallego elvira et al 2012 and floating boards or spheres of floating coverage silva et al 2017 aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 shalaby et al 2021 assouline and narkis 2021 for arid area plain reservoirs with large water areas floating coverage spheres is an ideal way to suppress water surface evaporation haghighi et al 2018 compared with other coverage methods floating coverage has strong wind and wave resistance lower initial investment and lower operation and maintenance costs jiang et al 2015 han et al 2019 studies have shown that the evaporation reduction rate of water surfaces covered by floating benzene boards is 51 25 jiang et al 2016 and the evaporation reduction rate of the water surface covered by spheres was as high as 70 6 the coverage rate was 76 4 han et al 2020 to evaluate the performance of different floating cover materials it is necessary to estimate the evaporation loss of the water surface under the floating cover based on relevant meteorological data there are three main methods for estimating natural water surface evaporation based on meteorological data mass transmission method singh et al 1997 xu et al 1998 energy budget and combination methods penman 1948 monteith 1965 priestley and taylor 1972 valiantzas et al 2006 mcjannet et al 2013 xu et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 these methods are widely used to estimate natural water surface evaporation according to existing research there are few studies on evaporation estimation methods for covered water surfaces especially for floating coverage gallego elvira et al 2012 proposed a free or mixed convective mass transfer formula based on the sherwood number to estimate water surface evaporation this formula estimated the evaporation of the water surface under a suspended cover shading net and achieved better results notably the formula requires the water surface temperature to be higher than the atmospheric temperature gallego elvira et al 2012 pauken 1998 bower and saylor 2009 however the relationship between the water surface temperature and atmospheric temperature is related to the regions and seasons the water surface temperature was not higher than the atmospheric temperature in any region han et al 2019 2020 tang et al 2016 for floating coverage owing to the contact of the cover with the water surface the cover and the water surface are often taken as a whole surface to study the water surface evaporation loss and energy balance cooley 1970 aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 han et al 2020 rezazadeh et al 2020 compared with the energy balance system of a natural water body the net radiation absorbed by the entire surface is principally distributed to the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux the percentage of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux in the available energy the difference between net radiation and heat storage flux for evaporation has changed significantly and the sign of sensible heat flux is negative which is the opposite of the positive value of natural water surface sensible heat flux the bowen ratio which is the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux is a common parameter for the change in the energy balance components for example han et al 2020 found that the average bowen ratio of the natural water surface during the complete non freezing period march to october was 0 10 and the average bowen ratio of the whole surface covered by the silver gray spheres was 1 97 aminzadeh et al 2018 found that the bowen ratio of the whole surface under a floating disk plate was much higher than that of the uncovered water surface and the sensible heat flux changed from a negative value to a positive value lehmann et al 2019 found that the bowen ratio of the overall surface is 3 1 and 1 37 respectively when the black disk and the black sphere are used as the floating cover and the bowen ratio of the overall surface is 2 0 and 0 75 when the white disk and white spheres are used as the floating cover respectively this is much higher than the bowen ratio of the natural water surface however for natural water bodies almost all the net radiation and sensible heat flux absorbed by the water surface are used for evaporative consumption shakir et al 2008 gallego elvira et al 2010 han et al 2020 the reduction in wind speed near the water surface covered by the floating or suspended cover and the change in the diffusion channel of water vapor molecules would cause changes in the water vapor transmission coefficient between the water surface and the atmosphere which in turn affects the aerodynamic term of the evaporation process of the water surface for example the wind speed near the water surface covered by the shading net is reduced by approximately 91 and the water vapor transmission coefficient is reduced by approximately 55 gallego elvira et al 2011 when the sphere coverage rate was 76 4 the water vapor transmission coefficient was reduced by approximately 75 3 han et al 2020 from the above analysis it can be seen that if rn g is used as the available energy of the water surface evaporation radiation term like the natural water surface evaporation methods it is bound to seriously overestimate the available energy rn g of the water surface evaporation under the floating cover if the empirical parameters in the aerodynamic term of natural water surface evaporation such as mass transfer coefficient aerodynamic impedance wind function etc are used in the aerodynamic term of water surface evaporation under floating coverage it would inevitably lead to a large relative error in estimating the evaporation of the aerodynamic term therefore it is necessary to study the water surface evaporation methods under floating coverage separately from the radiation term and the aerodynamic term and establish an evaporation estimation method suitable for water surfaces under floating cover the main purpose of this study was to examine the following two aspects 1 based on the evaporation calculation model of the natural water surface including the mass transfer model penman monteith model and priestley taylor model and the change characteristics of various meteorological parameters under floating coverage the radiation term introducing bowen ratio and aerodynamic terms in evaporation calculation models of the natural water surface were corrected and the evaporation calculation model of the water surface under floating coverage was established 2 based on the monthly variation characteristics of the microclimate near the water surface covered by spheres and the overall surface energy balance components the accuracy of each corrected method used to estimate the evaporation of the water surface under floating coverage was tested at three different time scales finally a water surface evaporation model suitable for floating cover was developed 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 mass transfer mt method the mass transfer method was proposed by studying the vortex transfer process of water vapor from the evaporation surface to the atmosphere based on dalton s law in the case of high mass transfer coefficient accuracy this method can achieve better results shakir et al 2008 burston 2002 the mass transfer formula of the natural water surface evaporation rate can generally be expressed as 1 e m t μ u 2 e s e a where e mt is the evaporation rate mm day 1 µ is the mass transfer coefficient empirical constant u 2 is the wind speed at a distance of 2 m from the

be converted to the wind speed at a height of 2 m above the ground using eq 4 shakir et al 2008 allen et al 1998 4 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 where u z is the wind speed at height above the ground m s 1 the mass transfer coefficient can be determined based on the slope of the origin shakir et al 2008 sturrock et al 1992 sacks et al 1994 with μ as the slope emt as the dependent variable and u2 e s e a as the independent variable formula 1 becomes y k x 2 2 bowen ration energy balance breb method in the evaporation method for natural water surfaces the available energy the difference between net radiation and heat storage flux for evaporation in the radiation term is almost all used for evaporation the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux is smaller bowen ratio is 0 1 han et al 2020 0 07 shakir et al 2008 0 103 gallego elvira et al 2011 the latent heat flux is much higher than the sensible heat flux it seems reasonable to use the difference between the net radiation and heat storage flux as the energy available for evaporation of the radiation term as for the entire surface formed by the floating cover surface and the uncovered water surface part of the heat radiation absorbed by the entire surface is used for the consumption of the water surface evaporation and the latent heat flux is negative the other part is used for heat dissipation from the entire surface to the atmosphere and the sensible heat flux is negative which means that the overall surface conducts heat to the atmosphere the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux the bowen ratio is 0 75 3 1 aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 han et al 2020 is much higher than that of the natural water surface it can be seen that the available energy for evaporation of the radiation term in the evaporation methods only accounts for a part of the difference between the net radiation and heat storage flux on the entire surface the energy balance equation is described as 5 r n λ e h s g where r n is the surface radiation w m 2 λe is the latent heat flux w m 2 g is the heat storage flux w m 2 and h s is the sensible heat flux w m 2 the net radiation of the whole surface under the floating

to latent heat flux eq 11 the bowen ratio energy balance equation eq 12 can be obtained which can better reflect the changes in the radiation term available energy for evaporation in water surface evaporation ikebughi et al 1988 stannard et al 1991 shakir et al 2008 in this study the right term of eq 12 is defined as the energy available for evaporation on the water surface under floating coverage the bowen ratio energy balance equation can be described as 12 λ e r n g 1 β 2 3 combination method the combination methods include both radiant energy radiation term and aerodynamic energy aerodynamic term required to maintain evaporation commonly used evaporation combination methods are the penman model penman monteith pm model and priestley taylor pt model 2 3 1 penman method the penman method divides the energy required for evaporation into radiation and aerodynamic terms this is a semi theoretical and semi empirical evaporation calculation formula the aerodynamic term is a

function researchers modified the aerodynamic term of the original penman monteith method and established the penman monteith method for natural water surface evaporation craig 2006 mcjannet et al

merges the radiation and aerodynamic terms by introducing a dimensionless quantity α and can still estimate the evaporation without wind speed records this method has been verified by many researchers parlange and katul 1992 wang et al 2004 yang et al 2013 guo et al 2015 20 λ e p t α δ δ γ r n g the pt method for water surface evaporation of floating cover can be described as 21 λ e p t α δ δ γ r n

function of bowen ratio β α 1 can be calculated by the following formula gallego elvira et al 2012 shakir et al 2008 23 α δ γ δ 1 β it should be noted that when formula 23 is substituted into eq 21 as a parameter the bowen ratio energy balance equation eq 12 can be obtained therefore the pt1 method is the same as the bowen ratio energy balance breb method the estimation effects of the two evaporation methods are the same the coefficient α 2 can also be determined according to the slope of the origin with the coefficient α 2 as the slope and e pt as the dependent variable and r n g δ δ γ as the independent variable eq 21 can be changed to y kx 2 4 parameter determination and evaluation criteria according to the monthly changes in the parameters in the above methods during the test period from march to october the bowen ratio aerodynamic impedance and pt coefficient exhibited significant seasonal changes see section 4 3 these parameters can be determined from the following three aspects 1 based on the measured meteorological data and evaporation data from march to october the parameters for each evaporation method can be calculated during the test period the calculated parameters were used to estimate the evaporation of each method during the test period 2 based on the measured meteorological data and evaporation data in the odd months march may july and september these parameters in each evaporation method can be calculated during the odd months the calculated parameters are used to estimate the evaporation of each method in even months april june august and october 3 based on the measured meteorological data and evaporation data in the even months these parameters in each evaporation method can be calculated during even months the calculated parameters were used to estimate the evaporation of each method in odd months the accuracy of the simulated values of various models was evaluated based on the statistical characteristics of the estimated evaporation of the model and the measured evaporation these statistical characteristics are the root mean square error rmse index of agreement d mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 3 materials and methods 3 1 description of test site the test site is located at the soil and water conservation reservoir in turpan xinjiang the small reservoir has a surface area of 2 0 hm2 and a storage capacity of 60 000 m3 fig 1 the experiment was conducted on the dam of the reservoir during the period from march 2018 to october 2018 covering the entire non freezing period two identical evaporators with a diameter of 1 20 m and a height of 0 80 m were arranged on the reservoir dam to minimize the energy exchange between the side wall of the evaporators and the atmosphere the side wall and bottom of the evaporators were wrapped with thermal insulation cotton and reflective film the water surface of evaporator a was without the covering material the water surface of evaporator b was completely covered with high density polyethylene spheres with a diameter of 100 mm and the number of spheres and coverage rate were 110 and 76 4 respectively 3 2 evaporation and micrometeorological measurements a water level probe model sw1 1 was used to monitor the water level change in the evaporator the daily evaporation of the two evaporators was directly derived from the water level measurements and then the monthly data were obtained because of the different evaporation intensities the water in the evaporators was supplemented to the same water level every four days according to existing research han et al 2020 the experiment studied the heat flux exchange process between the whole surface water surface spherical surface and the atmospheric interface 1 5 m above the water surface from march to october the meteorological sensors were installed above the water surface to monitor meteorological data at the atmospheric interface 1 5 m above the water surface including atmospheric temperature fr ts wind speed fr ws relative humidity fr hs etc eight water temperature sensors fr wts were arranged in each evaporator at equal intervals in each evaporator to monitor the changes of water temperature at different depths a temperature sensor fr sts was installed on the floating cover surface to monitor the surface temperature each sensor recorded the data every hour and then the daily data were obtained fig 2 daily data were processed to obtain the monthly mean values of each parameter based on the above monthly data the monthly mean values of the latent heat flux sensible heat flux and heat storage flux can be obtained the monthly mean values of net radiation can be obtained as the only unknown term in the energy balance equation eq 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 temperature gradient and water vapor pressure difference fig 3 shows the monthly variation trend of atmospheric temperature water surface temperature in evaporator a and water surface temperature in evaporator b from march to october the atmospheric temperature the water surface temperature of the covered group and the water surface temperature of the uncovered group first increased and then decreased reaching a maximum in july from april to september owing to the increase in solar radiation intensity the heat absorbed by the spheres is transferred to the water body causing the water surface temperature to be higher than that of the uncovered group this phenomenon is similar to the existing research results mady et al 2021 lehmann et al 2019 aminzadeh et al 2018 these research results show that from spring to autumn the solar radiation intensity gradually increased and gradually decreased in summer july the solar radiation reaches the maximum value and the temperature of the uncovered water surface and covered water body increased and then decreased the temperature difference between the covered water surface and the uncovered water surface primarily depends on the thermal conductivity of the covering material to the water body aminzadeh et al 2018 for the covering material with poor thermal conductivity the water surface temperature of the covered group may have the opposite effect to the results of this study mady et al 2021 for the water body covered by suspension because the suspended cover does not contact the water surface and acts as a sunshade the temperature of the water surface under the suspended cover is lower than that of the uncovered water surface gallego elvira et al 2011 according to formula 2 the saturated vapor pressure difference of the covered group was higher than that of the uncovered group fig 4 from april to september in march and october the solar radiation intensity was lower the heat absorbed by the spheres decreased and the water surface temperature under the cover was lower than that of the uncovered group the saturated vapor pressure difference of the covered group was lower than that of the uncovered group in march and october fig 4 during the test period the monthly average water surface temperature of the covered group was 1 2 higher than that of the uncovered group and the saturated water vapor pressure difference of the covered group was 0 26 kpa higher than that of the uncovered group according to the surface temperature of the spheres and the uncovered water surface temperature for the covered evaporator measured in each month the monthly average value of the overall surface temperature for the covered evaporator during the test period was obtained using formula 9 table 1 shows the differences between the atmospheric temperature and the water surface temperature for the uncovered evaporator and the overall surface water surface and the surface of spheres temperature during the test period for the uncovered evaporator the water surface temperature is higher than the atmospheric temperature from march to may and water body transfers heat to the atmosphere the water surface temperature is lower than the atmospheric temperature and the atmosphere transfers heat to the water body from june to october the average temperature gradient between the water surface of the uncovered evaporator and the atmosphere was 1 7 during the test period the overall surface temperature of the covered evaporator is higher than the atmospheric temperature from march to october and the overall surface transfers heat to the atmosphere during the test period the average temperature gradient between the overall surface of the covered evaporator and the atmosphere was 45 9 which means that the amount of heat available for water surface evaporation under floating coverage is significantly reduced lehmann et al 2019 found that the temperature of the black floating disk surface was as high as 55 60 c the temperature of the white floating disk surface was as high as 35 40 c and the temperature of the floating cover surface was much higher than the atmospheric temperature this is primarily due to the high absorption rate of solar radiation by the floating cover surface and the low thermal conductivity of the water body which is concentrated on the surface of the floating cover and the temperature of the floating cover surface increases significantly when the temperature gradient between the floating cover surface and the atmosphere is high compared with the temperature difference between the uncovered water surface and the atmosphere the overall surface sensible heat flux of the covered group increased significantly eq 8 mady et al 2021 aminzadeh et al 2018 according to the energy balance equation in the case of insignificant changes in net radiation and heat storage flux the sensible heat flux increased significantly and the latent heat flux used for evaporation decreased significantly han et al 2020 section 4 2 4 2 energy flux fig 5 shows the monthly variation in the energy flux of the overall surface covered by the spheres the size sign and relative weight of the energy balance components on the overall surface of the covered evaporator changed significantly the overall surface net radiation is mainly composed of two parts one part is the net radiation absorbed by the sphere surface and the other part is the net radiation absorbed by the water surface among the pores of the spheres during the test period the change range on the overall surface net radiation was 89 43 w m 2 313 14 w m 2 and the monthly average was 203 80 w m 2 compared with the net radiation on the natural water surface the net radiation on the overall surface is reduced by only 2 8 han et al 2020 this is mainly related to factors such as the shape color and coverage of the floating cover cooley 1970 aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 during the test period the overall surface temperature was always higher than that of the uncovered evaporator the sensible heat flux was negative 213 59 w m 2 to 56 69 w m 2 and the monthly average was 135 27 w m 2 the overall surface transfers heat to the atmosphere and the transmission direction is opposite to that of the natural water surface the latent heat flux of the covered evaporator varied from 99 58 w m 2 to 26 29 w m 2 with a monthly average of 68 51 w m 2 compared with the natural water surface the latent heat flux of the covered evaporator was reduced by approximately 70 6 this is related to a reduction in the water surface coverage rate of 76 4 similar to the heat storage flux of the natural water body the covered water body stores heat from march to july and releases heat from august to october the heat storage flux varies within a small range 0 01 w m 2 7 70 w m 2 compared with other energy fluxes the heat storage flux is much smaller and can be ignored on a long term scale han et al 2020 during the test period the available energy rn g for evaporation was 203 78 w m 2 for the covered evaporator the latent heat flux was 0 33 times the available energy for evaporation λe 0 33 rn g r2 0 98 and the sensible heat flux was 0 67 times of the available energy for evaporation hs 0 67 rn g r2 0 996 it can be seen that part of the available energy for evaporation is used for the heat consumed by water surface evaporation and the other part is used for the heat transferred from the entire surface to the atmosphere the available energy rn g for natural water surface evaporation is 209 60 w m 2 and the latent heat flux is 1 12 times the available energy for evaporation λe 1 12 rn g r2 0 98 the main reason why the latent heat flux is higher than the available energy for evaporation is that the heat conducted from the water surface to the atmosphere during the test period is lower than the heat conducted from the atmosphere to the water body and the sensible heat flux is a positive value the sensible heat flux net radiation and part of the heat storage flux of the natural water body are used for the heat consumed by water surface evaporation in summary when the water body is covered by spheres the heat used for evaporation on the water surface changes significantly 4 3 parameter determination 4 3 1 mass transfer coefficient the mass transfer coefficient μ was calculated from the slope of the straight line fitted to the data point through the origin where the evaporation e is the dependent variable and u2 es ea is the independent variable fig 6 the monthly average values of the saturated water vapor pressure difference es ea are listed in table 1 and the monthly average values of wind speed u2 are listed in table 2 the mt coefficient in odd months was 0 101 r2 0 94 the mt coefficient in even months was 0 112 r2 0 85 and the mt coefficient in the complete experimental period was 0 106 r2 0 91 this is similar to the mass transfer coefficient of water surface evaporation covered by a floating white aquacap burston 2002 this may be related to the geometric shape of the two types of cover or the boundary of interstitial water between the covers li et al 2011 aminzadeh et al 2017 lehmann et al 2019 for example when the spheres aquacaps are closely arranged the boundary of water in contact with the atmosphere consists of three tangent arcs han et al 2019 that is the boundary conditions of the gap water evaporation between the coverings are similar 4 3 2 bowen ratio the bowen ratio β can be calculated using formula 11 the range of bowen ratio in the covered evaporator is 1 30 2 47 during the test period table2 and the monthly average bowen ratio is 2 00 the average bowen ratio in odd months was 2 10 and the average bowen ratio in even months was 1 90 this result is similar to the bowen ratio of existing floating cover methods which is related to factors such as the color and shape of the cover aminzadeh et al 2018 lehmann et al 2019 4 3 3 aerodynamic impedance the aerodynamic impedance in the evaporation of the water surface covered by spheres was calculated using eq 19 the aerodynamic impedance during the complete non freezing period is between 349 70 s m 1 and 632 21 s m 1 table 2 the monthly average aerodynamic impedance is 464 56 s m 1 the aerodynamic impedance exhibited a significant change trend with time the average aerodynamic impedance in odd months was 436 60 s m 1 and the average aerodynamic impedance in even months was 491 92 s m 1 4 3 4 pt coefficient incorporating the bowen ratio of each month into eq 23 the pt coefficient α varied from 0 39 to 0 60 during the test period table 2 and the monthly average value was 0 47 the pt coefficient has significant seasonal changes table 2 in which the average value of the pt coefficient in odd months was 0 45 and the average value of the pt coefficient in even months was 0 49 α can be determined according to the slope across the origin where λe is the dependent variable and r n g δ δ γ is the independent variable pt coefficient in odd months is 0 42 r2 0 978 pt coefficient in even months is 0 44 r2 0 973 average monthly pt coefficient is 0 43 r2 0 979 during the test period fig 7 the pt coefficients obtained by the above two methods is similar but has a large deviation from the value 1 2 1 32 originally proposed by priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 this is principally because the bowen ratio of the overall surface is much higher than that of the natural water surface and the pt coefficient is inversely proportional to the bowen ratio eq 23 4 4 performance of different evaporation estimation methods when simulating water surface evaporation under floating coverage in odd months the parameters of each evaporation model take the parameter values in even months the mass transfer coefficient μ in the mt method was 0 112 the bowen ratio β in the breb method was 1 90 the bowen ratio β in the penman method was 1 90 the bowen ratio β in the penman monteith method was 1 90 the aerodynamic impedance r a was 491 92 s m 1 the priestley taylor coefficient α1 was 0 49 and α2 was 0 44 when simulating water surface evaporation under floating coverage in even months the parameters of each evaporation model take the parameter values in odd months the mass transfer coefficient μ in the mt method was 0 101 the bowen ratio β in the breb method is 2 10 the bowen ratio β in the penman method was 2 10 the bowen ratio β in the penman monteith method was 2 10 the aerodynamic impedance r a is 436 60 s m 1 the priestley taylor coefficient α1 was 0 45 and α2 was 0 42 when simulating water surface evaporation under floating coverage during the test period the parameters of each evaporation model take the parameter values in 3 10 months the mass transfer coefficient μ in the mt method was 0 106 the bowen ratio β in the breb method was 2 0 the bowen ratio β in the penman method was 2 0 the bowen ratio β in the penman monteith method was 2 0 the aerodynamic impedance r a was 464 26 s m 1 the priestley taylor coefficient α1 was 0 47 and α2 was 0 43 fig 8 shows the observed evaporation during the complete test period march to october and the simulated evaporation values of the different methods table 3 shows the statistical characteristics of the observed and measured values of evaporation at the three different time scales the root mean square error corresponding to the penman monteith method under three different time scales is the smallest 0 09 mm d 1 0 15 mm d 1 0 11 mm d 1 respectively and the method has the best simulation effect the root mean square error of the pt breb method is relatively low and its simulation effect is better than that of the penman and mt methods the root mean square error corresponding to the mt method was the largest and the simulation effect was the worst the average deviation error mbe of the measured evaporation and simulated evaporation of each method shows that the mt and penman methods underestimate the water surface evaporation under the floating cover in odd months even months and the entire test period both the pm method and the pt breb method underestimated the water surface evaporation under the floating cover in even months and overestimated the water surface evaporation under floating coverage in odd months during the entire test period only the pt1 breb method underestimated water surface evaporation under floating coverage comprehensive analysis of the mbe value and its variation range corresponding to each model under three different time scales the pm method estimates that evaporation is better than other models under three different time scales the evaluation effect of the consistency index d and determination coefficient r2 of the measured and simulated evaporation of each method is similar to that of the root mean square error rmse the consistency index and the determination coefficient r2 corresponding to the pm method were the highest and the simulation effect of the pm method was the best the consistency index and the determination coefficient r2 corresponding to the pt method are higher and the simulation effect of the pt breb method is better than that of the penman and mt methods the consistency index and the determination coefficient r2 corresponding to the mt method are the lowest and the simulation effect of the mt method is the worst from the above analysis it can be seen that under three different time scales the mt method and the penman method are obviously not suitable for the estimation of water surface evaporation under floating coverage while the pt2 method can provide a good and reasonable estimation and the pm method is most suitable as a model for estimating water surface evaporation under floating coverage 4 4 1 breb method and mt method under floating coverage compared with the bowen ratio energy balance method the water surface evaporation estimated by the mt method under floating coverage is quite different from the actual evaporation that is the bowen ratio energy method is better than the mass transfer method this is similar to findings in other studies in arid or semi arid areas with low relative humidity and large changes in wind speed solar radiation plays a leading role in water surface evaporation and evaporation estimation methods based on wind speed and water vapor pressure difference are not suitable shakir et al 2008 sacks et al 1994 abtew 2001 4 4 2 combination methods under floating coverage the evaporation estimated by the pm method was significantly better than the penman method the radiant flux of the two methods is the same as the usable energy flux rn g 1 β and shows a similar pattern to the actual evaporation although the evaporation of the radiation term was reduced by approximately 24 the evaporation of the radiation term was approximately 0 76 times the measured evaporation r2 0 97 the difference in the estimated evaporation between the two types of methods lies in the composition of the aerodynamic term the aerodynamic term in the penman method is a wind function that includes the wind speed and water vapor pressure difference it can be seen from the mass transfer method that the wind function is not applicable in arid or semi arid areas where the range of wind speed varies greatly shakir et al 2008 sacks et al 1994 abtew 2001 and it significantly underestimates the evaporation of aerodynamic terms the aerodynamic term of the pm method replaces the empirical wind function with aerodynamic impedance which does not lead to substantial underestimation compared with the bowen ratio β 0 23 to 0 05 of the natural water surface where the inter monthly changes are not significant han et al 2020 the bowen ratio β of the overall surface under the floating cover is more significantly affected by the change in time the monthly variation range during the complete non freezing period is larger 1 30 2 47 resulting in a large monthly change in the pt coefficient α formula 23 during the complete non freezing period the α1 derived from the monthly average value and the α2 derived from the linear fitting used in the pt method to calculate the evaporation may be the cause of the unsatisfactory estimation effect of the pt method 4 4 3 theoretical analysis of the estimated effect of each evaporation method the estimation effects of the mt and penman methods in this study are poor mainly because the empirical wind functions in these two models are proposed based on natural water surface evaporation the use of these wind functions has certain limitations in determining the aerodynamic term evaporation of floating covered water surfaces at the same time the change in wind speed near the water surface aerodynamic effect becomes more complicated owing to the floating cover li et al 2011 aminzadeh et al 2017 lehmann et al 2019 which complicates the evaporation estimation model of the covered water surface for the pt method the method simplifies the evaporation estimation method by introducing a dimensionless quantity the estimation effect of this method was better than that of the mt and penman methods however the method was originally proposed under the condition of minimal advection no convection for large area wet surface evaporation han et al 2021 and the aerodynamic effect near the covered water surface still needs to be further studied this may be one of the reasons why the pt model is a poor model for estimating the evaporation of floating covered water surfaces the aerodynamic term of the pm model replaces the empirical wind function with aerodynamic impedance which greatly reduces the error caused by the uncertainty of the aerodynamic effect on the estimation of water surface evaporation 4 5 evaporation distribution of radiant and aerodynamic terms under floating coverage based on the evaporation of the radiation term and the evaporation of the aerodynamic term in the pm method and the evaporation of the radiation term and the coefficient α in the pt2 method the ratio of the evaporation of the radiation term to the aerodynamic term accounts for the total amount of evaporation is different in different time periods during the complete non freezing period march october the evaporation of the radiative term accounts for 69 5 and 68 0 of the total evaporation respectively in the two methods the evaporation of the aerodynamic term accounted for 30 5 and 32 of the total evaporation respectively in the two methods it can be seen that the proportion of the radiation term in the coverage group is higher than that of the aerodynamic term and the radiation term plays a leading role in water surface evaporation the above conclusion can be obtained from eq 22 because the pt method coefficient is less than 1 and the ratio of the aerodynamic term to the radiation term is negative in the pt method it should be noted that during the complete non freezing period the proportions of radiation and aerodynamic terms changed significantly with time for example in the pm method with the change in solar radiation intensity during the test period first increases and then decreases the proportion of radiation term in water surface evaporation first increases and then decreases which varies from 54 8 to 81 7 reaching a maximum in july the proportion of aerodynamic term first decreased and then increased varying from 18 3 to 45 2 reaching a minimum in july 5 conclusions based on the research on the interface energy balance components and micrometeorology in the floating coverage mode the bowen ratio of the overall surface and aerodynamic impedance in the floating coverage mode are introduced to the open water evaporation models mt breb penman pm and pt to correct the radiation term and aerodynamic term and establish evaporation models suitable for water surfaces under floating coverage through comprehensive statistical evaluation of the simulated evaporation values and measured evaporation values at the three different time scales the most promising evaporation method for water surfaces under floating coverage has been proposed the following conclusions were drawn from the analysis under the three different time scales the pm method is the most promising and superior evaporation method for water surfaces under floating coverage the estimated evaporation effect of the pt2 method α taking the linear fitting value is slightly lower than that of the pm method but better than that of the pt1 breb method α taking the average value which may be related to the larger variation range of the β value or α value owing to the inclusion of empirical wind functions the mass transfer method and the penman method have large errors in the water surface evaporation estimation under floating coverage from the combined methods pm and pt2 it can be seen that the evaporation of the radiation term is dominant in the water surface evaporation under floating coverage and the evaporation of the radiation term is higher than that of the aerodynamic term moreover during the complete non freezing period the weights of the radiation term evaporation and aerodynamic term evaporation in the water surface evaporation change significantly over time the proportion of evaporation of the radiation term varies from 54 8 to 81 7 the highest value in july and the proportion of evaporation of the aerodynamic term varies from 18 3 to 45 2 the lowest value in july the theoretical analysis of this study provides a good basis for the estimation of evaporation of water surface under floating cover especially the introduction of the bowen ratio of the overall surface in the evaporation radiation term from a practical point of view the modified penman monteith formula proved to be an ideal model for estimating water surface evaporation under floating cover and explained that the radiation term evaporation plays a dominant role in water surface evaporation under floating cover declaration of competing interest the authors

by drip or microspray irrigation to which soluble nutrients are often applied in a combined practice called fertigation drip fertigation is regarded as a precise and efficient method of supplying water and nutrients due to the large degree of control over application timing placement and amount klein et al 1989 van der kooij et al 2013 in theory drip irrigation should enable growers to accurately meet tree water and nitrogen requirements thereby minimising losses via leaching beneath the root zone gärdenäs et al 2005 thorburn et al 2003 much of the difficulty in managing fertigation in commercial apple orchards results from the complexity of nitrogen transformations rapid mobilisation of nitrogen through the soil and the internal dynamics of tree storage and remobilisation of nitrogen lehmann and schroth 2003 neilsen and neilsen 2002 this is exacerbated by the relatively shallow low density nature of apple tree roots sokalska et al 2009 in practice many orchardists rely on generic guidelines for nutrient management that ignore site specific conditions including irrigation requirement crop load tree size quality specifications and the soil s capacity to retain and supply

have the complexity of processes needed to simulate nitrogen mobilisation storage and transformation processes that occur in apple production systems furthermore in most cases the data required to parameterise and calibrate the large number of input parameters required to account for these processes are lacking consequently this study has adopted a coupled measurement modelling approach using the perennial tree crop soil plant atmosphere system model spasmo to capture and monitor the source loss and management of irrigation and nitrogen fertigation in a mature commercial apple orchard the

irrigation treatments respectively 2 6 soil moisture soil moisture content was measured using 30 cm long tdr time domain reflectometry waveguides in a single replicate for each of the high medium and low irrigation treatments in the high and low irrigation treatments 3 probes were installed at 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth whilst 2 probes were installed at 60 90 cm depth in the medium treatment probes were only installed at 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth no probes were installed at 60 90 cm depth in the medium irrigation treatment data were collected via a cr1000 logger installed with a campbell scientific tdr100 3x sdmx multiplexer unfortunately many of the tdr sensors were irreparably damaged in september 2013 due to root pruning operations 2 7 drainage collection and leachate analysis twelve drainage flux meters dfm tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north new zealand or passive wick lysimeters green et al 2012 were installed to monitor the quality and quantity of drainage water beneath the rootzone at 60 cm depth passive wick flux meters operate by maintaining tension on the base of the soil via a fiberglass wick which creates a self priming hanging water column gee et al 2009 2004 fig 1 nine 200 mm diameter 2000 mm pvc dfm s were installed in the tree row beneath or adjacent to a fertigation emitter three dfm s were installed in a single replicate for each of the high medium and low irrigation rate treatments an additional three dfm s were installed on the mound shoulder of the high irrigation treatment approximately 0 3 m from the tree line and midway between two trees to monitor for potential lateral flow from the centre of the tree row installation of each dfm involved carefully hand augering to a depth of 60 cm in which each soil layer was placed in individual buckets for repacking after the dfm was lowered into the hole a mechanised auger was used to extend the holes to 2 0 m depth before installation each dfm was packed with wetted diatomaceous earth then a layer of pure silica sand and subsequently followed by each soil layer in turn from deepest to shallowest to the top of the dfm after installation the remaining soil from the original hole was repacked around the dfm to the surface fig 1 drainage samples were manually collected from the flux meter reservoirs every month between november 2012 and june 2016 filtered aliquots of approximately 30 40 ml were extracted from each fluxmeter and stored at 20 c the nitrate content was determined by cd cu reduction according to the us epa method 353 3 o dell 1993 the monthly nitrate flux kg no3 ha

soil including recycling of nutrients and organic material to the soil biomass cichota and snow 2009 green and clothier 2016 green et al 2012 2003d rosen et al 2004 the soil water balance is calculated by considering the inputs rainfall and irrigation and losses plant uptake evaporation runoff and drainage of water from the soil profile the flow of water through the soil profile is simulated using a capacity model hutson and wagenet 1993 in which soil water is divided into mobile and immobile phases the mobile domain is used to represent the soil s macropores e g worm holes and cracks and the immobile domain represents the soil matrix infiltrating water first fills the immobile domain which when full then fills the mobile domain as the water travels progressively downward through the soil profile subsequently on days when there is no significant rainfall there is a slow approach to equilibrium between the mobile and immobile phases driven by a difference in water content between the two domains rosen et al 2004 crop water use is estimated daily using the standard single crop coefficient approach fao 56 allen et al 1998 in which the kc coefficient is determined by dividing transpiration measured by sap flow by reference evapotranspiration surface runoff is modelled using the soil conservation service scs curve number approach which is predicted from daily rainfall plus irrigation nutrient runoff is modelled using the revised universal soil loss equation renard 1991 the soil nitrogen balance accounts for nitrogen uptake by plants exchange and transformation processes in the soil loss of gaseous nitrogen to the atmosphere fertiliser application and the leaching of nitrogen below the root zone spasmo considers both organic nitrogen in the soil biomass and the mineral nitrogen of urea ammonium and nitrate as detailed in green et al 2007 and rosen et al 2004 dissolved nitrate is considered to be mobile and able to percolate freely through the profile whilst movement of dissolved ammonium is retarded the soil can receive inputs of organic carbon and organic nitrogen from decaying plant residues which are added to the litter layer of the topsoil green et al 2003b potential nitrogen mineralisation was measured by anaerobic incubation described by curtin and cambell 2008 the data is reported in gentile et al 2016b mathematical description of the model is provided in green et al 2001 and rosen et al 2004 model parameterisation was based on a combination of measured values including soil water retention bulk density climate sapflow and soil carbon content from which appropriate values for the model inputs were derived values for other parameters such as light use efficiency dry matter allocation fractions and rate constants for mineralisation were derived from literature values or past research at other sites green et al 2003b 2012 2003d green and clothier 1988 soil carbon nitrogen and mineralisation values for the lucaston site were provided by gentile et al 2016a 2016b model output was then compared to measured values and where necessary values were tuned to improve model performance 2 9 scenario analysis model simulations were conducted over a range of values to explore the effects of site characteristics and management on nitrogen leaching including soil water holding capacity tree size rainfall irrigation amount and fertilizer rate table 3 simulations were conducted at a nitrogen fertiliser rate of 60 kg n ha 1 except for the nitrogen fertilizer scenarios using four applications pre harvest and two applications post harvest in order to simulate the effects of different soil types on the water balance and nutrient flux the plant available water content pawc between field capacity 10 kpa and the permanent wilting point 1500 kpa for the soil profile to 100 cm depth was varied 70 130 from the measured pawc of 184 mm likewise the long term average rainfall 1980 2014 of 726 mm bureau of meteorology grove was varied 70 130 to explore the effects of variable rainfall the base irrigation value of 217 5 mm was determined by triggering the model to irrigate to field capacity when half the readily available soil moisture raw had been extracted from the root zone model simulations were conducted for irrigation trigger points between 30 and 150 of the base 50 raw value variation in tree size or tree age were mimicked by manipulating the fao56 crop coefficient kc between 0 15 and 0 9 based on to the dependence of kc on leaf area index and thus canopy size and age 3 results 3 1 tree water use and kc coefficients tree water use occurred between mid september and early may peaking at around 15 l tree 1 day 1 in late january fig 2 average tree water use for the 2013 2014 season was 8 58 l tree 1 day 1 6 39 l tree 1 day 1 and 6 47 l tree 1 day 1 for the high medium and low irrigation treatments respectively differences in tree water use between treatments were attributed to differences in leaf area measured in april 2014 which averaged 8 33 m2 7 73 m2 and 6 83 m2 in the high medium and low irrigation treatments respectively the crop coefficient kc increased from budburst late september through to late december then plateaued between late december and harvest mid march fig 3 the mid season kc mid values relate to irrigation treatment and thus lai ranging from 0 71 to 0 53 and 0 52 for the high medium and low irrigation treatments respectively post harvest kc coefficients are noted to decline after early april in the low and medium irrigation treatments due to leaf senescence no decline in kc was observed in the high irrigation treatment notably the mid season crop coefficients were similar kc mid 0 71 between both years all measured kc coefficients were substantially lower than the recommended kc mid coefficient for apples of 0 9 allen et al 1998 pearson correlation between sap flow and spasmo estimates of daily tree water use were r 0 38 in the 2012 13 season and r 0 48 in 2013 14 season however on a bi monthly basis the measured and modelled tree water use appeared remarkably similar as demonstrated by the 15 day moving average plots fig 4 3 2 soil moisture the soil moisture between october 2012 and september 2013 was similar between the irrigation treatments fig 5 within the tree rootzone 0 60 cm depth the medium irrigation treatment had the highest average cumulative soil moisture content of 176 mm followed by the low treatment at 167 mm and lastly the high irrigation treatment at 163 mm however at the 15 cm depth the irrigation treatments appeared to influence soil moisture as the average soil moisture content over the 11 month monitoring period was 27 8 25 9 and 23 5 vol in the high medium and low irrigation treatments respectively 3 3 drainage drainage rates were extremely variable within and between the irrigation treatments the cumulative drainage flux over the 30 month monitoring period were 86 mm in the medium 236 mm in the high and 381 mm in the low irrigation treatments and 534 mm in the shoulder area fig 6b the cumulative yearly drainage ranged from 13 to 46 mm yr 1 mean 29 mm yr 1 sd 17 mm yr 1 in the medium treatment followed by 32 145 mm yr 1 mean 79 mm yr 1 sd 58 mm yr 1 in the high treatment 77 197 mm mean 127 mm yr 1 sd 62 mm yr 1 in the low treatment and 78 305 mm yr 1 mean 178 mm yr 1 sd 116 mm yr 1 in the shoulder area adjacent to the high treatment the average annual drainage from the three treatments excluding shoulder area was 78 mm yr 1 sd 61 mm yr 1 or 103 mm yr 1 sd 85 mm yr 1 for the three treatments including the shoulder area large drainage events 50 mm mostly occurred in winter between july to october in 2013 and june and july in 2014 whilst a smaller drainage event 20 mm occurred in february 2015 following 162 mm rainfall between january and february fig 6a monthly drainage flux was moderately correlated with irrigation application r2 0 20 soil moisture 0 45 cm depth r2 0 43 0 55 and rainfall r2 0 05 0 29 depending on irrigation treatment 3 4 nitrate concentration in leachate the nitrate concentration of the recovered drainage water from the lysimeters was highly variable both between and within treatments as well as over time fig 7 the nitrate concentration was weakly related to rainfall in which r squared values were 0 02 0 17 and 0 24 for the high medium and low treatments respectively the highest nitrate concentrations occurred in the low and medium irrigation treatments a large spike in nitrate concentration occurred in the last measurement in may june 2015 this spike was observed shortly after the post harvest nitrogen fertigation treatments were applied and following 101 mm monthly rainfall however similar spikes were not observed in previous years in which monthly rainfall in may 2013 was 41 mm and 64 mm in 2014 nitrate concentration in the shoulder area adjacent the tree row was noted to be lower than the other treatments 3 5 nitrate flux nitrate leaching was highly variable fig 8a for example in may june 2015 two adjacent fluxmeters in the same irrigation treatment recorded 0 0 versus 77 2 kg no3 ha 1 month 1 the average nitrate flux from under the tree row all irrigation treatments was 33 2 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrate leaching was not related to the irrigation treatments as leaching from the high and medium irrigation treatments averaged 9 70 and 10 62 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1respectively compared to 79 20 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 in the low treatment the nitrate flux was event based in which 50 of all nitrate flux and 41 of all drainage occurred over a 3 month period between june to august 2013 especially in the low treatment and the shoulder area fig 8b the measured water and nitrate balance for the 30 month monitoring period is presented in table 4 3 6 long term average simulations the long term 1980 2015 average rainfall for the site was 726 mm which was substantially lower than the two monitoring seasons 2013 14 at 995 mm rainfall and 2014 15 at 846 mm the measured amounts of drainage from beneath the tree row exclude shoulder were 25 0 94 2 and 99 8 mm yr 1 for the 2012 13 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons respectively whereas the long term modelling indicated the average seasonal drainage was 136 mm yr 1 likewise the average measured nitrate leaching over the three growing seasons were 9 96 39 16 and 34 3 kg no3 ha 1 respectively whereas the long term modelling indicated the average nitrate leaching was 12 5 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 table 5 spasmo predicted that tree age or canopy size modelled as kc coefficient had a substantial effect on all aspects of the water balance excluding rainfall in which the irrigation requirement ranged from 80 mm yr 1 ha 1 for a young tree kc 0 3 to 230 mm yr 1 ha 1 for a mature tree kc 0 9 in which transpiration increased from 183 mm yr 1 for the young tree to 517 mm yr 1 for the mature tree table 5 the effect of tree age on drainage and runoff were minor in which drainage and runoff decreased 41 5 mm and 3 3 mm between the young and mature tree simulations tree age also influenced nitrogen fertilizer requirement from 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in young trees to 75 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in mature trees table 5 3 7 scenario analysis the strongest influence on nitrate leaching was tree size crop coefficient for which predicted nitrate leaching decreased from 53 to 16 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 as the kc coefficient increased from 0 15 to 0 45 after which increased tree canopy kc coefficient had minimal influence on nitrogen leaching fig 9a nitrogen leaching also increased with irrigation rainfall and nitrogen fertilizer rate and decreased with pawc fig 9b e drainage below 1 0 m depth decreased with tree size kc coefficient and pawc and increased with rainfall and irrigation likewise the irrigation requirement increased as tree size increased and decreased with increasing rainfall and pawc spasmo indicated that nitrogen leaching was relatively insensitive to irrigation rate at the lucaston site decreased irrigation from 217 mm to 96 mm 56 reduction only reduced nitrogen leaching by 1 4 kg n ha 1 10 despite drainage having reduced by 51 6 mm 38 the scenario analysis also demonstrated that nitrogen leaching was relatively insensitive to nitrogen fertilizer application rate below 120 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reducing the nitrogen fertilizer application from the industry standard application of 60 15 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reduced nitrogen leaching by only 1 1 kg n ha 1 yr 1 8 whilst doubling nitrogen fertilizer to 120 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and increased nitrogen leaching by 4 0 kg n ha 1 29 interestingly a zero synthetic fertilizer regime was predicted to result in 12 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 nitrogen leaching which is only a 9 6 reduction in nitrogen leaching compared to the current practice of applying kg n ha 1 yr 1 fig 9e 4 discussion 4 1 error and variability drainage fluxes and the leached nitrate concentrations were highly variable between fluxmeters even within the same treatment for example within the medium irrigation treatment fluxmeter 7 recorded a total of 113 mm drainage whilst fluxmeter 8 located only 2 m away recorded 32 mm drainage over the 30 month monitoring period likewise nitrate concentrations were also highly variable for example adjacent fluxmeters 8 9 in august 2014 had nitrate concentrations of 0 5 mg l 1 and 45 2 mg l 1 we consider this kind of variation is natural and predominantly results from preferential flow pathways in the soil previous research at the site demonstrated that infiltration and soil water redistribution principally resulted from a combination of finger flow in the a11 and a12 horizons lateral flow along a12 a2 horizon boundary and macropore flow within the bhs and b22 horizons hardie et al 2018 similar levels of variability between fluxmeters was also observed in a nearby site on a bleached mottled grey kurosol in the huon valley tasmania hardie et al 2015 potential also exists that variability in the drainage and nitrate flux may have also resulted from differences in proximity to drippers and variability caused by repacking the soil profile above the fluxmeters the fluxmeters installed within the shoulder area between the tree line and the inter row of the high treatment had substantially higher drainage fluxes average 534 mm than the fluxmeters installed within the tree line average 236 mm despite being in the same treatment the nitrate concentration in the shoulder fluxmeters average 7 1 mg l 1 was also noted to be substantially lower than the adjacent tree line fluxmeters average 21 9 mg l 1 notably 59 of the drainage and 94 of the leached nitrate in the shoulder region was collected over a 3 month period between june to august 2013 evidence from piezometers located in an adjacent tree row indicates that the peek in drainage recorded from the shoulder area between may to august 2013 resulted from the formation of a perched water table and subsurface lateral flow following saturation of the soil profile development of intermittent perched water tables and subsurface lateral flows are a widely reported feature of the texture contrast soils including kurosols chittleborough et al 1994 eastham et al 2000 hardie et al 2012 resulting in downslope movement of soil water and nutrients stevens et al 1999 4 2 nitrate flux nitrate concentration in the leachate averaged 27 3 mg l 1 with individual flux meters recording nitrate concentrations as high as 235 mg l 1 the nitrate nitrogen concentration in the fertigation supply water varied between 800 and 1500 mg l 1 consequently concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the drainage water at a depth of 600 mm was reduced by a coefficient of 20 or more as a result of dilution from irrigation and antecedent soil water as well as uptake by the tree s root system notably monthly nitrate concentration exceeded the drinking water standard dws of 50 mg n no3 l 1 of nitrate nitrogen nhmrc armcanz 2011 44 times out of 279 samples over the 30 month monitoring period similar nitrate concentrations have been reported in the leachate from other apple orchards atucha et al 2011 reported that monthly nitrate concentration in leachate from an apple orchard with four different groundcover treatments ranged from 0 51 to 32 74 mg l 1 using lysimeters toselli et al 2011 reported that nitrate concentration in leachate beneath an apple orchard ranged from less than 10 mg l 1 in late summer to more than 40 mg l 1 in winter whilst stevenson and neilsen 1990 reported that annual average nitrate concentration in leachate from lysimeters installed in an apple orchard ranged from 211 to 439 mg l 1 nitrate flux below the rootzone appeared to be highly related to drainage flux but did not appear to be related to irrigation treatment as the nitrate flux in the high irrigation treatment was 9 7 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 compared to 79 2 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 in the low treatment the average nitrate flux below 60 cm depth was 33 17 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 from below the tree row excluding likely nitrate additions from mineralisation this represents a loss of 55 of the applied nitrogen fertilizer 60 kg n ha 1 yr 1 from the tree row average monthly nitrate flux following pre harvest october to february nitrogen application was 0 54 kg n ha 1 month 1 compared to 1 03 kg n ha 1 month 1 post harvest fertilizer application march to may these relate to tree nitrogen uptake efficiencies of 32 and 17 respectively for 14 year old gala on m26 similarly fertigated pre and post harvest in the derwent valley of tasmania unpublished measured rates of nitrate flux were substantially higher than the spasmo predicted average long term nitrate leaching rate kc 0 75 at 12 5 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 on a whole orchard basis rather than just the tree row potentially due to the higher than average rainfall recorded during the two monitoring seasons nitrate leaching at the lucaston site appears to be at the mid to lower end of reported rates for apple orchards filipović et al 2013 stevenson and neilsen 1990 toselli et al 2011 ventura et al 2013 potentially due to the relatively flat topography and carbon rich a1 3 46 and bhs 5 19 at the lucaston site differences between sites and studies are expected due to differences in soil type topography and grower expertise for example stevenson and neilsen 1990 reported nitrate leaching below 1 5 m in a macspur mcintosh apple orchard averaged 42 271 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrate atucha et al 2011 reported nitrogen leaching from the subsoil of an apple orchard at 5 2 20 9 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 whilst filipović et al 2013 reported seasonal nitrate leaching from an apple orchard was around 17 kg no3 ha 1 rates of nitrate leaching beneath the tree row at the lucaston site at 30 25 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 all treatment plus shoulder area were substantially lower than those recorded at the nearby mountain river site at 220 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 hardie 2017 hardie et al 2015 the mountain creek site is also located on a kurosol and has similar climate and management practices to that of the lucaston site the average nitrate concentration at the lucaston site at 27 3 mg l 1 was lower than that at the mountain river site at 40 4 mg l 1 whilst drainage flux at the mountain creek site at 73 1 mm month 1 was substantially higher than at the lucaston site at 7 8 mm month 1 given the similarity in soils and rainfall at the two sites the difference in drainage flux nitrate concentration and thus nitrate leaching was attributed to the smaller tree size at mountain river lai 0 34 and the shallower installation of the fluxmeters at mountain river at 30 cm at the base of the a1 horizon as opposed to 60 cm depth in the b21 horizon at lucaston 4 3 management the modelling scenarios provide an insight to management at the site spasmo predicts that for the current tree size kc 0 71 and annual rainfall of 726 mm that the irrigation requirement is 217 mm yr 1 whilst drainage is predicted to be 136 mm yr 1 and nitrate leaching 12 4 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrogen leached 13 6 kg n ha 1 a 30 reduction in rainfall to 508 mm yr 1 was predicted to reduce irrigation requirement to 293 mm yr 1 resulting in 38 mm yr 1 drainage and 8 9 kg no3ha 1 yr 1 less nitrate leaching nitrogen leached 9 7 kg n ha 1 this suggests that whilst a 30 reduction in rainfall would reduce nitrate leaching and drainage the additional irrigation required to prevent crop moisture stress kept the soil profile sufficiently moist such that drainage and nitrogen leaching were not greatly affected by the decreased rainfall in wet years with 30 above the average annual rainfall at 943 mm similar to 2013 14 annual rainfall of 909 mm the irrigation requirement was reduced to 166 mm yr 1 drainage increased to 259 mm yr 1 whilst nitrate leaching increased to 17 5 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrogen leached 17 0 kg n ha 1 this analysis indicates that even in a wet year supplementary irrigation is still required due to the mismatch in timing between rainfall events and crop water requirements which resulted in greater moisture storage within the soil profile and thus increased drainage and nitrate leaching notably the 30 increase in rainfall resulted in a modest increase in leached nitrate of an additional 5 1 kg no3 ha outputs of the spasmo modelling predicted that the current fertilizer practice of applying split pre and post harvest 30 30 kg n of nitrogen resulted in an average of 12 4 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrate leaching zero application of nitrogen fertilizer was predicted to still result in 11 2 kg no3 ha 1 nitrate leaching as spasmo predicted soil mineralisation to be in the order of 185 kg n ha 1 yr 1 consequently efforts to eliminate nitrate leaching by shifting management to a zero inorganic nitrogen system are predicted to be ineffective at preventing nitrate leaching doubling the current fertilizer application to 120 kg n ha 1 was predicted to marginally increase nitrate leaching from 12 4 to 16 1 kg no3 ha 1 outputs of the spasmo modelling for the lucaston site predicts that nitrate leaching is somewhat insensitive to both irrigation and fertilizer application rates and thus is largely beyond the control or influence of orchard management spasmo modelling suggests that the amount of nitrate leaching at the site was most strongly influenced by the kc coefficient a surrogate for canopy size or tree age in which nitrate leaching reduced up to a kc coefficient of 0 4 after which nitrate leaching was largely unaffected by further increases in canopy size hydrus 2d modelling at the nearby mountain river site hardie 2017 also found that nitrate leaching was largely influenced by canopy size in which nitrate leaching could be substantially reduced in mature but not young trees by conversion from spray to drip irrigation and ceasing manure application neither of which are relevant to the lucaston site 5 conclusion our results demonstrate that over a wetter than average 30 month monitoring period water movement below the 60 cm depth within the tree row of a commercial apple orchard excluding the shoulder area resulted in an average of 93 mm yr 1 drainage and 33 2 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrate leaching at an average nitrate concentration of 30 5 mg l 1 irrigation treatment had no obvious effect on drainage volume or nitrate leaching differences between the measured and modelled drainage and nitrate flux were attributed to the extreme variability between fluxmeters even within the same irrigation treatment this variability probably arose from preferential flow processes and occurrence of subsurface lateral flows options to reduce nitrate leaching are limited as spasmo modelling indicated that both the drainage flux and nitrate leaching were largely insensitive to irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application rate declaration of competing interest

9631,leaching of nitrogen from intensive agriculture to groundwater and waterways is a source of environmental harm nitrate leaching beneath a commercial 10 year old galaxy apple orchard was investigated using a combined measurement and modelling approach measurement of sapflow climate soil moisture deep drainage and nitrate leaching beneath the root zone were monitored for 30 months in order to parameterise and calibrate the soil plant atmosphere system model spasmo sap flow peaked at around 15 l tree 1 day 1 in late january with average sap flow for the 2013 14 season of 8 58 6 39 and 6 47 l tree 1 day 1 for the high 4 0 l ha 1 medium 2 3 l ha 1 and low 1 6 l ha 1 irrigation treatments respectively deep drainage and nitrate leaching were highly variable and did not appear to be influenced by irrigation rate over the 30 month monitoring period drainage beneath the rootzone averaged 89 mm yr 1 whilst nitrate leaching averaged 33 2 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 equivalent to 55 of the applied fertilizer average nitrate concentration in the leachate exceeded the world health organisation threshold for drinking water of 50 mg l 1 in 41 out of 279 samples long term modelling indicated the average amount of drainage and nitrate leaching were 136 mm yr 1 and 11 4 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 respectively scenario analysis indicated that few options existed to reduce nitrate leaching at the site

water and nutrients due to the large degree of control over application timing placement and amount klein et al 1989 van der kooij et al 2013 in theory drip irrigation should enable growers to accurately meet tree water and nitrogen requirements thereby minimising losses via leaching beneath the root zone gärdenäs et al 2005 thorburn et al 2003 much of the difficulty in managing fertigation in commercial apple orchards results from the complexity of nitrogen transformations rapid mobilisation of nitrogen through the soil and the internal dynamics of tree storage and remobilisation of nitrogen lehmann and schroth 2003 neilsen and neilsen 2002 this is exacerbated by the relatively shallow low density nature of apple tree roots sokalska et al 2009 in practice many orchardists rely on generic guidelines for nutrient management that ignore site specific conditions including irrigation requirement crop load tree size quality specifications and the soil s capacity to retain and supply

have the complexity of processes needed to simulate nitrogen mobilisation storage and transformation processes that occur in apple production systems furthermore in most cases the data required to parameterise and calibrate the large number of input parameters required to account for these processes are lacking consequently this study has adopted a coupled measurement modelling approach using the perennial tree crop soil plant atmosphere system model spasmo to capture and monitor the source loss and management of irrigation and nitrogen fertigation in a mature commercial apple orchard the objectives of this study were to quantify the rates of nitrate leaching in a mature commercial apple orchard evaluate the utility of spasmo to predict the effects of irrigation and nitrogen management on nitrogen leaching in a commercial apple orchard explore how fertiliser and irrigation management can be improved to minimise nitrate leaching 2 methods 2 1 field site the trial was located in a commercial apple orchard in the huon valley tasmania australia 42 59 36 97 s 147 59 29 04 e as reported in swarts et al 2016a and hardie et al 2018 the region has a temperate maritime climate with an average rainfall of 745 mm distributed evenly throughout the year mean minimum and maximum temperature range from 5 8 c to 17 1 c and mean daily sunshine hours of 5 5 h bom 2015 the orchard consisted of 10 year old galaxy trees grown on m26 rootstock pruned to a central leader training system with 1 2 m tree spacing and 4 m row spacing 2100 trees ha 1 on a 0 3 m high mounded tree row prior to the research trial the orchard was drip irrigated by a single lateral 13 mm in line drip emitters netafim located in the centre of the row which delivered 2 3 l hr 1 at 0 5 m spacing 2 2 soils soils were classified according to isbell 2002 as a grey eutrophic humose bleached kurosol duplex or texture contrast soil the soil profile consisted of a reworked a11p 0 0 12 m sandy loam over an a12 0 12 0 30

the soil physical properties table 1 were determined from a single location adjacent the trial area soil cores 5 0 cm 5 2 cm and 6 0 9 0 cm were collected in triplicate from each of the four soil horizons bulk density was determined at the field moisture content for the 5 0 cm 5 2 cm cores according to mckenzie et al 2002 soil water release curves were determined on 6 0 9 0 cm cores using the evaporative flux method according to the procedure described by wendroth et al 1993 and peters and durner 2008 using the hyprop approach and tensioview software ums 2013 the soil water retention curve was fitted using the van genuchten mualem equation mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the a11 horizon was measured in triplicate using a 20 mm diameter single ring constant head infiltrometer in both the treeline and inter row areas following reynolds 2008 reynolds and elrick 1990 in which alpha was estimated to be 0 12 cm 1 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the a2e b21 and b22 horizons was determined on 5 0 cm 5 2 cm cores by darcy s law at a constant head of 0 1 kpa soil chemical analysis was conducted by csbp laboratories western australia according to rayment and higginson 1992 table 2 2 3 trial design the research presented in this manuscript is a subset of a larger randomised irrigation by fertigation block design trial described in swarts et al 2016b the randomised block experiment consisted of four tree rows as replicates three irrigation rate treatments high 4 l ha 1 medium 2 3 l ha 1 and low 1 6 l ha 1 and five nitrogen fertigation treatments and a zero rate control each of the 60 replicates consisted of four trees two of which were guard trees with the two middle trees used for monitoring and sampling the nitrogen treatments of the split 30 kg n ha 1 pre harvest and 30 kg n ha 1 post harvest nitrogen treatments were selected for intensive monitoring for nitrogen leaching soil moisture and sap flow in a single replicate plot for each of the three irrigation treatments results reported in this manuscript were limited to the 50 nitrogen pre and 50 nitrogen post fertigation treatment 2 4 fertilizer and irrigation management nitrogen was applied at 60 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which was equivalent to 29 g n per tree this rate was determined in discussion with industry as being the upper range of industry practice in order to represent current over use of n fertilizer nitrogen was applied through the drip irrigation system as fertiliser grade ca no3 2 mixed with water in a 220 l drum header tank and delivered via a fire fighting pump at a constant 70 kpa fertiliser application followed standard fertigation practice in which a 10 min water only wetting up period was followed by a 40 min application of the nitrogen treatments followed by a 10 min water only rinse at each application interval treatments including the control 0 n were applied once per week for four weeks in approximately 50 l water timing of fertigation events was at the grower s discretion based on agronomic best practice pre harvest fertigation treatments commenced in november 2012 2013 and 2014 coinciding with the first irrigation application for the season and timed to match maximum demand by the tree during leaf canopy development post harvest treatments were applied in march april 2013 2014 and 2015 the irrigation treatments were applied using different rate drippers high 4 0 l ha 1 medium 2 3 l ha 1 and low 1 6 l ha 1 operated for the same duration the timing and duration of irrigation was at the grower s discretion based on agronomic best practice 2 5 tree water use tree water use mm ha 1 day 1 was predicted using the standard crop coefficient approach fao 56 allen et al 1998 as et c kc et 0 in which et c is the combined crop evaporation and transpiration kc is the crop coefficient which is related to the amount of light intercepted by the leaf canopy as a function of the leaf area index lai m2 of leaf per m2 of ground area green et al 2003b and et 0 is reference evapotranspiration calculated daily by the penman monteith equation from global radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed obtained from the grove bureau of meteorology station located 2 km from the field site the kc was calculated from the transpiration rate l tree 1 day 1 divided by the et 0 in which transpiration was determined by tree sap flow sap flow probes hp4tc s tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north new zealand were installed in three trees in separate replicates of the high irrigation treatment the probes comprised two 1 8 mm diameter temperature probes and a 1 8 mm diameter heater probe each containing 4 thermocouples housed in a stainless steel hypodermic tube insulated with a teflon sheath measurements were taken using the compensation heat pulse method green et al 2003a 2018 green and clothier 1988 controlled by a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific logan usa with a standard probe spacing of 5 mm upstream and 10 mm downstream from the heater probe sap flow readings were conducted every 30 min and summed to give a value of the daily water use the leaf area measured using 360 camera and gap light analyser v2 software frazer et al 1999 in april 2014 from the monitored trees averaged 8 33 m2 7 73 m2 and 6 83 m2 in the high medium and low irrigation treatments respectively 2 6 soil moisture soil moisture content was measured using 30 cm long tdr time domain reflectometry waveguides in a single replicate for each of the high medium and low irrigation treatments in the high and low irrigation treatments 3 probes were installed at 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth whilst 2 probes were installed at 60 90 cm depth in the medium treatment probes were only installed at 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth no probes were installed at 60 90 cm depth in the medium irrigation treatment data were collected via a cr1000 logger installed with a campbell scientific tdr100 3x sdmx multiplexer unfortunately many of the tdr sensors were irreparably damaged in september 2013 due to root pruning operations 2 7 drainage collection and leachate analysis twelve drainage flux meters dfm tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north new zealand or passive wick lysimeters green et al 2012 were installed to monitor the quality and quantity of drainage water beneath the rootzone at 60 cm depth passive wick flux meters operate by maintaining tension on the base of the soil via a fiberglass wick which creates a self priming hanging water column gee et al 2009 2004 fig 1 nine 200 mm diameter 2000 mm pvc dfm s were installed in the tree row beneath or adjacent to a fertigation emitter three dfm s were installed in a single replicate for each of the high medium and low irrigation rate treatments an additional three dfm s were installed on the mound shoulder of the high irrigation treatment approximately 0 3 m from the tree line and midway between two trees to monitor for potential lateral flow from the centre of the tree row installation of each dfm involved carefully hand augering to a depth of 60 cm in which each soil layer was placed in individual buckets for repacking after the dfm was lowered into the hole a mechanised auger was used to extend the holes to 2 0 m depth before installation each dfm was packed with wetted diatomaceous earth then a layer of pure silica sand and subsequently followed by each soil layer in turn from deepest to shallowest to the top of the dfm after installation the remaining soil from the original hole was repacked around the dfm to the surface fig 1 drainage samples were manually collected from the flux meter reservoirs every month between november 2012 and june 2016 filtered aliquots of approximately 30 40 ml were extracted from each fluxmeter and stored at 20 c the nitrate content was determined by cd cu reduction according to the us epa method 353 3 o dell 1993 the monthly nitrate flux kg no3 ha 1 was calculated by the volume of collected leachate cm3 divided by the surface area of the flux meter cm2 multiplied by the nitrate concentration mg l 1 of the leachate divided by 10 2 8 spasmo soil plant atmosphere system model spasmo soil plant atmosphere system model is a generic 1d daily time step soil plant climate model developed to simulate water and solute transport through a one dimensional soil profile cichota and snow 2009 green et al 2003c spasmo has been widely used for evaluating nitrogen leaching green et al 2012 2003c rosen et al 2004 determining tree and crop water

a daily time step in which nutrient leaching is determined by mass balance green and clothier 2016 the model accounts for fertilisation plant uptake volatilisation exchanges and transformations in the soil including recycling of nutrients and organic material to the soil biomass cichota and snow 2009 green and clothier 2016 green et al 2012 2003d rosen et al 2004 the soil water balance is calculated by considering the inputs rainfall and irrigation and losses plant uptake evaporation runoff and drainage of water from the soil profile the flow of water through the soil profile is simulated using a capacity model hutson and wagenet 1993 in which soil water is divided into mobile and immobile phases the mobile domain is used to represent the soil s macropores e g worm holes and cracks and the immobile domain represents the soil matrix infiltrating water first fills the immobile domain which when full then fills the mobile domain as the water travels progressively downward through the soil profile subsequently on days when there is no significant rainfall there is a slow approach to equilibrium between the mobile and immobile phases driven by a difference in water content between the two domains rosen et al 2004 crop water use is estimated daily using the standard single crop coefficient approach fao 56 allen et al 1998 in which the kc coefficient is determined by dividing transpiration measured by sap flow by reference evapotranspiration surface runoff is modelled using the soil conservation service scs curve number approach which is predicted from daily rainfall plus irrigation nutrient runoff is modelled using the revised universal soil loss equation renard 1991 the soil nitrogen balance accounts for nitrogen uptake by plants exchange and transformation processes in the soil loss of gaseous nitrogen to the atmosphere fertiliser application and the leaching of nitrogen below the root zone spasmo considers both organic nitrogen in the soil biomass and the mineral nitrogen of urea ammonium and nitrate as detailed in green et al 2007 and rosen et al 2004 dissolved nitrate is considered to be mobile and able to percolate freely through the profile whilst movement of dissolved ammonium is retarded the soil can receive inputs of organic carbon and organic nitrogen from decaying plant residues which are added to the litter layer of the topsoil green et al 2003b potential nitrogen mineralisation was measured by anaerobic incubation described by curtin and cambell 2008 the data is reported in gentile et al 2016b mathematical description of the model is provided in green et al 2001 and rosen et al 2004 model parameterisation was based on a combination of measured values including soil water retention bulk density climate sapflow and soil carbon content from which appropriate values for the model inputs were derived values for other parameters such as light use efficiency dry matter allocation fractions and rate constants for mineralisation were derived from literature values or past research at other sites green et al 2003b 2012 2003d green and clothier 1988 soil carbon nitrogen and mineralisation values for the lucaston site were provided by gentile et al 2016a 2016b model output was then compared to measured values and where necessary values were tuned to improve model performance 2 9 scenario analysis model simulations were conducted over a range of values to explore the effects of site characteristics and management on nitrogen leaching including soil water holding capacity tree size rainfall irrigation amount and fertilizer rate table 3 simulations were conducted at a nitrogen fertiliser rate of 60 kg n ha 1 except for the nitrogen fertilizer scenarios using four applications pre harvest and two applications post harvest in order to simulate the effects of different soil types on the water balance and nutrient flux the plant available water content pawc between field capacity 10 kpa and the permanent wilting point 1500 kpa for the soil profile to 100 cm depth was varied 70 130 from the measured pawc of 184 mm likewise the long term average rainfall 1980 2014 of 726 mm bureau of meteorology grove was varied 70 130 to explore the effects of variable rainfall the base irrigation value of 217 5 mm was determined by triggering the model to irrigate to field capacity when half the readily available soil moisture raw had been extracted from the root zone model simulations were conducted for irrigation trigger points between 30 and 150 of the base 50 raw value variation in tree size or tree age were mimicked by manipulating the fao56 crop coefficient kc between 0 15 and 0 9 based on to the dependence of kc on leaf area index and thus canopy size and age 3 results 3 1 tree water use and kc coefficients tree water use occurred between mid september and early may peaking at around 15 l tree 1 day 1 in late january fig 2 average tree water use for the 2013 2014 season was 8 58 l tree 1 day 1 6 39 l tree 1 day 1 and 6 47 l tree 1 day 1 for the high medium and low irrigation treatments respectively differences in tree water use between treatments were attributed to differences in leaf area measured in april 2014 which averaged 8 33 m2 7 73 m2 and 6 83 m2 in the high medium and low irrigation treatments respectively the crop coefficient kc increased from budburst late september through to late december then plateaued between late december and harvest mid march fig 3 the mid season kc mid values relate to irrigation treatment and thus lai ranging from 0 71 to 0 53 and 0 52 for the high medium and low irrigation treatments respectively post harvest kc coefficients are noted to decline after early april in the low and medium irrigation treatments due to leaf senescence no decline in kc was observed in the high irrigation treatment notably the mid season crop coefficients were similar kc mid 0 71 between both years all measured kc coefficients were substantially lower than the recommended kc mid coefficient for apples of 0 9 allen et al 1998 pearson correlation between sap flow and spasmo estimates of daily tree water use were r 0 38 in the 2012 13 season and r 0 48 in 2013 14 season however on a bi monthly basis the measured and modelled tree water use appeared remarkably similar as demonstrated by the 15 day moving average plots fig 4 3 2 soil moisture the soil moisture between october 2012 and september 2013 was similar between the irrigation treatments fig 5 within the tree rootzone 0 60 cm depth the medium irrigation treatment had the highest average cumulative soil moisture content of 176 mm followed by the low treatment at 167 mm and lastly the high irrigation treatment at 163 mm however at the 15 cm depth the irrigation treatments appeared to influence soil moisture as the average soil moisture content over the 11 month monitoring period was 27 8 25 9 and 23 5 vol in the high medium and low irrigation treatments respectively 3 3 drainage drainage rates were extremely variable within and between the irrigation treatments the cumulative drainage flux over the 30 month monitoring period were 86 mm in the medium 236 mm in the high and 381 mm in the low irrigation treatments and 534 mm in the shoulder area fig 6b the cumulative yearly drainage ranged from 13 to 46 mm yr 1 mean 29 mm yr 1 sd 17 mm yr 1 in the medium treatment followed by 32 145 mm yr 1 mean 79 mm yr 1 sd 58 mm yr 1 in the high treatment 77 197 mm mean 127 mm yr 1 sd 62 mm yr 1 in the low treatment and 78 305 mm yr 1 mean 178 mm yr 1 sd 116 mm yr 1 in the shoulder area adjacent to the high treatment the average annual drainage from the three treatments excluding shoulder area was 78 mm yr 1 sd 61 mm yr 1 or 103 mm yr 1 sd 85 mm yr 1 for the three treatments including the shoulder area large drainage events 50 mm mostly occurred in winter between july to october in 2013 and june and july in 2014 whilst a smaller drainage event 20 mm occurred in february 2015 following 162 mm rainfall between january and february fig 6a monthly drainage flux was moderately correlated with irrigation application r2 0 20 soil moisture 0 45 cm depth r2 0 43 0 55 and rainfall r2 0 05 0 29 depending on irrigation treatment 3 4 nitrate concentration in leachate the nitrate concentration of the recovered drainage water from the lysimeters was highly variable both between and within treatments as well as over time fig 7 the nitrate concentration was weakly related to rainfall in which r squared values were 0 02 0 17 and 0 24 for the high medium and low treatments respectively the highest nitrate concentrations occurred in the low and medium irrigation treatments a large spike in nitrate concentration occurred in the last measurement in may june 2015 this spike was observed shortly after the post harvest nitrogen fertigation treatments were applied and following 101 mm monthly rainfall however similar spikes were not observed in previous years in which monthly rainfall in may 2013 was 41 mm and 64 mm in 2014 nitrate concentration in the shoulder area adjacent the tree row was noted to be lower than the other treatments 3 5 nitrate flux nitrate leaching was highly variable fig 8a for example in may june 2015 two adjacent fluxmeters in the same irrigation treatment recorded 0 0 versus 77 2 kg no3 ha 1 month 1 the average nitrate flux from under the tree row all irrigation treatments was 33 2 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrate leaching was not related to the irrigation treatments as leaching from the high and medium irrigation treatments averaged 9 70 and 10 62 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1respectively compared to 79 20 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 in the low treatment the nitrate flux was event based in which 50 of all nitrate flux and 41 of all drainage occurred over a 3 month period between june to august 2013 especially in the low treatment and the shoulder area fig 8b the measured water and nitrate balance for the 30 month monitoring period is presented in table 4 3 6 long term average simulations the long term 1980 2015 average rainfall for the site was 726 mm which was substantially lower than the two monitoring seasons 2013 14 at 995 mm rainfall and 2014 15 at 846 mm the measured amounts of drainage from beneath the tree row exclude shoulder were 25 0 94 2 and 99 8 mm yr 1 for the 2012 13 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons respectively whereas the long term modelling indicated the average seasonal drainage was 136 mm yr 1 likewise the average measured nitrate leaching over the three growing seasons were 9 96 39 16 and 34 3 kg no3 ha 1 respectively whereas the long term modelling indicated the average nitrate leaching was 12 5 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 table 5 spasmo predicted that tree age or canopy size modelled as kc coefficient had a substantial effect on all aspects of the water balance excluding rainfall in which the irrigation requirement ranged from 80 mm yr 1 ha 1 for a young tree kc 0 3 to 230 mm yr 1 ha 1 for a mature tree kc 0 9 in which transpiration increased from 183 mm yr 1 for the young tree to 517 mm yr 1 for the mature tree table 5 the effect of tree age on drainage and runoff were minor in which drainage and runoff decreased 41 5 mm and 3 3 mm between the young and mature tree simulations tree age also influenced nitrogen fertilizer requirement from 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in young trees to 75 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in mature trees table 5 3 7 scenario analysis the strongest influence on nitrate leaching was tree size crop coefficient for which predicted nitrate leaching decreased from 53 to 16 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 as the kc coefficient increased from 0 15 to 0 45 after which increased tree canopy kc coefficient had minimal influence on nitrogen leaching fig 9a nitrogen leaching also increased with irrigation rainfall and nitrogen fertilizer rate and decreased with pawc fig 9b e drainage below 1 0 m depth decreased with tree size kc coefficient and pawc and increased with rainfall and irrigation likewise the irrigation requirement increased as tree size increased and decreased with increasing rainfall and pawc spasmo indicated that nitrogen leaching was relatively insensitive to irrigation rate at the lucaston site decreased irrigation from 217 mm to 96 mm 56 reduction only reduced nitrogen leaching by 1 4 kg n ha 1 10 despite drainage having reduced by 51 6 mm 38 the scenario analysis also demonstrated that nitrogen leaching was relatively insensitive to nitrogen fertilizer application rate below 120 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reducing the nitrogen fertilizer application from the industry standard application of 60 15 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reduced nitrogen leaching by only 1 1 kg n ha 1 yr 1 8 whilst doubling nitrogen fertilizer to 120 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and increased nitrogen leaching by 4 0 kg n ha 1 29 interestingly a zero synthetic fertilizer regime was predicted to result in 12 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 nitrogen leaching which is only a 9 6 reduction in nitrogen leaching compared to the current practice of applying kg n ha 1 yr 1 fig 9e 4 discussion 4 1 error and variability drainage fluxes and the leached nitrate concentrations were highly variable between fluxmeters even within the same treatment for example within the medium irrigation treatment fluxmeter 7 recorded a total of 113 mm drainage whilst fluxmeter 8 located only 2 m away recorded 32 mm drainage over the 30 month monitoring period likewise nitrate concentrations were also highly variable for example adjacent fluxmeters 8 9 in august 2014 had nitrate concentrations of 0 5 mg l 1 and 45 2 mg l 1 we consider this kind of variation is natural and predominantly results from preferential flow pathways in the soil previous research at the site demonstrated that infiltration and soil water redistribution principally resulted from a combination of finger flow in the a11 and a12 horizons lateral flow along a12 a2 horizon boundary and macropore flow within the bhs and b22 horizons hardie et al 2018 similar levels of variability between fluxmeters was also observed in a nearby site on a bleached mottled grey kurosol in the huon valley tasmania hardie et al 2015 potential also exists that variability in the drainage and nitrate flux may have also resulted from differences in proximity to drippers and variability caused by repacking the soil profile above the fluxmeters the fluxmeters installed within the shoulder area between the tree line and the inter row of the high treatment had substantially higher drainage fluxes average 534 mm than the fluxmeters installed within the tree line average 236 mm despite being in the same treatment the nitrate concentration in the shoulder fluxmeters average 7 1 mg l 1 was also noted to be substantially lower than the adjacent tree line fluxmeters average 21 9 mg l 1 notably 59 of the drainage and 94 of the leached nitrate in the shoulder region was collected over a 3 month period between june to august 2013 evidence from piezometers located in an adjacent tree row indicates that the peek in drainage recorded from the shoulder area between may to august 2013 resulted from the formation of a perched water table and subsurface lateral flow following saturation of the soil profile development of intermittent perched water tables and subsurface lateral flows are a widely reported feature of the texture contrast soils including kurosols chittleborough et al 1994 eastham et al 2000 hardie et al 2012 resulting in downslope movement of soil water and nutrients stevens et al 1999 4 2 nitrate flux nitrate concentration in the leachate averaged 27 3 mg l 1 with individual flux meters recording nitrate concentrations as high as 235 mg l 1 the nitrate nitrogen concentration in the fertigation supply water varied between 800 and 1500 mg l 1 consequently concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the drainage water at a depth of 600 mm was reduced by a coefficient of 20 or more as a result of dilution from irrigation and antecedent soil water as well as uptake by the tree s root system notably monthly nitrate concentration exceeded the drinking water standard dws of 50 mg n no3 l 1 of nitrate nitrogen nhmrc armcanz 2011 44 times out of 279 samples over the 30 month monitoring period similar nitrate concentrations have been reported in the leachate from other apple orchards atucha et al 2011 reported that monthly nitrate concentration in leachate from an apple orchard with four different groundcover treatments ranged from 0 51 to 32 74 mg l 1 using lysimeters toselli et al 2011 reported that nitrate concentration in leachate beneath an apple orchard ranged from less than 10 mg l 1 in late summer to more than 40 mg l 1 in winter whilst stevenson and neilsen 1990 reported that annual average nitrate concentration in leachate from lysimeters installed in an apple orchard ranged from 211 to 439 mg l 1 nitrate flux below the rootzone appeared to be highly related to drainage flux but did not appear to be related to irrigation treatment as the nitrate flux in the high irrigation treatment was 9 7 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 compared to 79 2 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 in the low treatment the average nitrate flux below 60 cm depth was 33 17 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 from below the tree row excluding likely nitrate additions from mineralisation this represents a loss of 55 of the applied nitrogen fertilizer 60 kg n ha 1 yr 1 from the tree row average monthly nitrate flux following pre harvest october to february nitrogen application was 0 54 kg n ha 1 month 1 compared to 1 03 kg n ha 1 month 1 post harvest fertilizer application march to may these relate to tree nitrogen uptake efficiencies of 32 and 17 respectively for 14 year old gala on m26 similarly fertigated pre and post harvest in the derwent valley of tasmania unpublished measured rates of nitrate flux were substantially higher than the spasmo predicted average long term nitrate leaching rate kc 0 75 at 12 5 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 on a whole orchard basis rather than just the tree row potentially due to the higher than average rainfall recorded during the two monitoring seasons nitrate leaching at the lucaston site appears to be at the mid to lower end of reported rates for apple orchards filipović et al 2013 stevenson and neilsen 1990 toselli et al 2011 ventura et al 2013 potentially due to the relatively flat topography and carbon rich a1 3 46 and bhs 5 19 at the lucaston site differences between sites and studies are expected due to differences in soil type topography and grower expertise for example stevenson and neilsen 1990 reported nitrate leaching below 1 5 m in a macspur mcintosh apple orchard averaged 42 271 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrate atucha et al 2011 reported nitrogen leaching from the subsoil of an apple orchard at 5 2 20 9 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 whilst filipović et al 2013 reported seasonal nitrate leaching from an apple orchard was around 17 kg no3 ha 1 rates of nitrate leaching beneath the tree row at the lucaston site at 30 25 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 all treatment plus shoulder area were substantially lower than those recorded at the nearby mountain river site at 220 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 hardie 2017 hardie et al 2015 the mountain creek site is also located on a kurosol and has similar climate and management practices to that of the lucaston site the average nitrate concentration at the lucaston site at 27 3 mg l 1 was lower than that at the mountain river site at 40 4 mg l 1 whilst drainage flux at the mountain creek site at 73 1 mm month 1 was substantially higher than at the lucaston site at 7 8 mm month 1 given the similarity in soils and rainfall at the two sites the difference in drainage flux nitrate concentration and thus nitrate leaching was attributed to the smaller tree size at mountain river lai 0 34 and the shallower installation of the fluxmeters at mountain river at 30 cm at the base of the a1 horizon as opposed to 60 cm depth in the b21 horizon at lucaston 4 3 management the modelling scenarios provide an insight to management at the site spasmo predicts that for the current tree size kc 0 71 and annual rainfall of 726 mm that the irrigation requirement is 217 mm yr 1 whilst drainage is predicted to be 136 mm yr 1 and nitrate leaching 12 4 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrogen leached 13 6 kg n ha 1 a 30 reduction in rainfall to 508 mm yr 1 was predicted to reduce irrigation requirement to 293 mm yr 1 resulting in 38 mm yr 1 drainage and 8 9 kg no3ha 1 yr 1 less nitrate leaching nitrogen leached 9 7 kg n ha 1 this suggests that whilst a 30 reduction in rainfall would reduce nitrate leaching and drainage the additional irrigation required to prevent crop moisture stress kept the soil profile sufficiently moist such that drainage and nitrogen leaching were not greatly affected by the decreased rainfall in wet years with 30 above the average annual rainfall at 943 mm similar to 2013 14 annual rainfall of 909 mm the irrigation requirement was reduced to 166 mm yr 1 drainage increased to 259 mm yr 1 whilst nitrate leaching increased to 17 5 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrogen leached 17 0 kg n ha 1 this analysis indicates that even in a wet year supplementary irrigation is still required due to the mismatch in timing between rainfall events and crop water requirements which resulted in greater moisture storage within the soil profile and thus increased drainage and nitrate leaching notably the 30 increase in rainfall resulted in a modest increase in leached nitrate of an additional 5 1 kg no3 ha outputs of the spasmo modelling predicted that the current fertilizer practice of applying split pre and post harvest 30 30 kg n of nitrogen resulted in an average of 12 4 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrate leaching zero application of nitrogen fertilizer was predicted to still result in 11 2 kg no3 ha 1 nitrate leaching as spasmo predicted soil mineralisation to be in the order of 185 kg n ha 1 yr 1 consequently efforts to eliminate nitrate leaching by shifting management to a zero inorganic nitrogen system are predicted to be ineffective at preventing nitrate leaching doubling the current fertilizer application to 120 kg n ha 1 was predicted to marginally increase nitrate leaching from 12 4 to 16 1 kg no3 ha 1 outputs of the spasmo modelling for the lucaston site predicts that nitrate leaching is somewhat insensitive to both irrigation and fertilizer application rates and thus is largely beyond the control or influence of orchard management spasmo modelling suggests that the amount of nitrate leaching at the site was most strongly influenced by the kc coefficient a surrogate for canopy size or tree age in which nitrate leaching reduced up to a kc coefficient of 0 4 after which nitrate leaching was largely unaffected by further increases in canopy size hydrus 2d modelling at the nearby mountain river site hardie 2017 also found that nitrate leaching was largely influenced by canopy size in which nitrate leaching could be substantially reduced in mature but not young trees by conversion from spray to drip irrigation and ceasing manure application neither of which are relevant to the lucaston site 5 conclusion our results demonstrate that over a wetter than average 30 month monitoring period water movement below the 60 cm depth within the tree row of a commercial apple orchard excluding the shoulder area resulted in an average of 93 mm yr 1 drainage and 33 2 kg no3 ha 1 yr 1 nitrate leaching at an average nitrate concentration of 30 5 mg l 1 irrigation treatment had no obvious effect on drainage volume or nitrate leaching differences between the measured and modelled drainage and nitrate flux were attributed to the extreme variability between fluxmeters even within the same irrigation treatment this variability probably arose from preferential flow processes and occurrence of subsurface lateral flows options to reduce nitrate leaching are limited as spasmo modelling indicated that both the drainage flux and nitrate leaching were largely insensitive to irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application rate declaration of competing interest

9632,agricultural practices in intensively managed landscapes are thought to be shifting hydro bio geochemical behavior from transformation to transport dominated systems here we explore the impacts of a best management practice known as tile outlet terraces tot tiles at this site are a set of perforated vertical pipes that can receive direct surface water soil water and groundwater inputs that are connected to horizontal pipes that transport water to a receiving pond terraces are constructed horizontal areas created to divide sloping terrains to reduce slope steepness and erosion and in so doing they redirect surface water toward standpipes and promote soil and groundwater discharge as a result bisecting local flowpaths while the impact of tiles on hydrologic behavior has been well studied the combined impact of tots has not been well quantified to address this knowledge gap we focus on the response of tot discharge and biogeochemical behavior across three adjacent agroecosystems in kansas over three growing seasons 2016 2018 tot discharge was measured every minute at each location and discharge during storm events was collected and analyzed for dissolved and total nutrients as well as major anion and cation chemistry additionally suction cup lysimeters were installed at the ridges and depression of the terraces to capture soil water solute chemistry prior to storm events recession curve analysis revealed that tile inlet density was not directly related to the proportion of quickflow mixing models showed that antecedent conditions played a critical role in the degree of connectivity of event water to the tiles and concentration discharge behavior showed the dominant behavior for all constituents was chemostatic across all tile densities interestingly these findings suggest that while tots shift the hydrology of agroecosystems away from natural conditions the storm event size and antecedent conditions can still dominate the hydrologic and

2004 evidence is mounting to suggest that agriculture practices are shifting landscape processes from transformers to transporters blann et al 2009 kumar et al 2018 schilling and helmers 2008a this describes how the hydrologic response is shifting from a longer residence time enabling more water mineral interactions a transformer controlled system to those with shorter residence times due to

discharge after a storm event from tile drained watersheds were more linear than less tiled drained watersheds implying more homogenous flow paths in tile drained systems schilling and helmers 2008a what remains less understood is the impact of multiple interacting surface and subsurface manipulations on landscape hydrology and the cascading biogeochemical response this work specifically focuses on the impact of tile outlet terraces tot density on discharge following storm events through the use of a recession curve approach in order to understand the overall impact of altered hydrology on biogeochemical behavior due to the controlled partitioning of runoff water infiltration and soil moisture conditions 1 1 tile outlet terraces for decades tile outlets or tile lines subsurface drainage systems that collect surface and shallow subsurface water through perforated pipes and transport them through unperforated horizontal pipes to a receiving pond similar to sewer systems and terraces constructed horizontal areas created to divide sloping terrains by reducing slope steepness have been two best management practices bmps often used to reduce the impact of overland flow on soil erosion in agricultural environments wei et al 2016 skaggs and van schilfgaarde 1999 fig 1 hydrologically these two approaches differ as tiles move the energy from overland flow into the subsurface thus reducing surface erosion skaggs and van schilfgaarde 1999 kladivko et al 2004 and alter peak flows by reducing it drying out soil in between events or increasing it by allowing faster collection of drainage water boland brien et al 2013 terraces slow the energy of overland flow by reducing the topographic gradient kladivko et al 2004 schilling and helmers 2008a and generally increase infiltration arnáez et al 2015 wei et al 2016 since the 1960s tots have combined the use of tile outlets and terraces to further reduce surface water runoff during storm events nrcs 2021 and alter the hydrologic flow paths and spatial variability in soil moisture these hydrologic alterations coupled with fertilizer applications can reorient the transformation and transport of nutrients and alter fluxes from chemical weathering yet the degree to which either controls biogeochemical fluxes is not well understood with much of the central usa underlain by tiles or tots blann et al 2009 there is a need to understand how altered landscapes subsurface hydrologic processes and their combined impact shifts the terrestrial biogeochemical processes as of 2017 tiles were reported to drain over 56 million acres across the us an increase of 12 over the previous 5 years usda nass 2017 1 2 characterizing tile outlet terrace hydrology the analytical methods of recession curve analysis from karst aquifer flow systems provide a potential conceptual tool for understanding tot hydrology schilling and helmers 2008b 2008a analyses of tots can leverage the fact that karst aquifers are often characterized by a triple permeability white 2003 where subsurface water flow is evolved from the interaction of diffuse intermediate and conduit permeability porosity palmer et al 1999 white 2003 diffuse permeability is the intergranular porosity of un fractured bedrock intermediate permeability are mechanical joints joint swarms and bedding plane partings conduit permeability are pipe like openings that start at 1 cm white 2003 if a single point of outflow or discharge q can be measured in a karst system then these locations are thought to integrate various hydrologic flow paths contributing to discharge e g runoff flow conduit flow matrix flow diffuse flow and intermediate flow a mixture of both runoff and matrix flow that occur at different rates in time and space within a catchment baedke and krothe 2001 milanovic 1981 if tot agriculture systems operate in an analogous manner to that of karst the integrated signal at the outlet of a tile drain may represent all three flow regimes schilling and helmers 2008a applied this same approach to tiled agriculture watersheds for three storm events and found that 66 5 of the events had two flow regimes conduit and intermediate and 33 5 had three flow regimes that contributed to the hydrograph response where the contribution of three flow regimes was concomitant with a discharge response elevated soil moisture or heavy rainfall events could both be invoked to explain faster discharge responses in this work the relationship between tile terrace density on the flashiness of the landscape and the resultant effect on concentration discharge behavior is investigated 2 study site three tile terraced cropland systems located within the upper wakarusa watershed in douglas county ks that drain to clinton lake were compared fig 2 harvest hills north hhn 38 59 05 5 n 95 27 19 0 w harvest hills middle hhm 38 59 05 5 n 95 27 19 0 w and cain 38 59 21 9 n 95 25 19 9 w all sites have similar landscape and management characteristics specifically they 1 are terraced with ridges and depressions across the landscape 2 have perforated standpipes through the soil located in the depressions that are connected to the tile outlet to help drain standing water and soil water and 3 have tile drains non perforated that are all connected to wetlands before being discharged to nearby streams and eventually to clinton lake the only exception to this design is a surface inlet on one of the terraces at hhn compared to a perforated pipe that goes through the soil as bedrock is close to the surface at this terrace siddiqui 2020 hhn drains 5 88 ha and consists of three terraces hhm drains 7 04 ha and consists of three terraces whereas cain drains 16 73 ha and consists of six terraces terraces are hill type bench terraces which grade reversely toward the hill mean slopes of the harvest hills sites hhn and hhm are 7 69 compared to 6 09 at the cain site peltier et al 2020 siddiqui 2020 each of the terraces is connected to the tile lines and thus to calculate tile inlet density we use the terraces as a proxy for the tiles thus while cain has the largest contributing area tile inlet density is lowest at 0 36 tiles ha and increases to hhm at 0 43 tiles ha and hhn at 0 51 tile ha it is expected that both drainage area and tile inlet density will affect tot discharge and solute concentrations as would crop rotation luckily all three fields were planted with nitrogen fixing soybeans over the entire study period while cain was also mixed with corn over the three years fields were planted in the spring and conservation tillage practices and light disking prior to planting were employed at each site unfortunately information on the fertilizer type and application timing and amount are not available for these sites the general lithology of douglas county which encompasses the research sites consists of limestone shale and sandstone frye 1952 the three study sites consist entirely of argiudolls soil a great group of the mollisol order that are found in humid climates with an udic moisture regime the average annual temperature is 12 4 c with an average high of 30 3 c in the summer and an average low of 6 3 c in the winter while average annual precipitation is 960 mm with 70 of the total precipitation falling in the spring and summer months petrie et al 2012 approximately 75 of the total precipitation falls within the growing season which spans 180 days petrie et al 2012 3 methods data collection and analyses were completed to characterize the flow and transport at each study site data collection included measurements of precipitation and the velocity and stage from each tot discharge location tot discharge and soil waters were also collected and analyzed to characterize the biogeochemical response to storm events data analyses include the use of recession curves end member mixing analysis and concentration discharge c q relationships to understand the impact of tots on the hydrologic flow and transport behavior of the landscape 3 1 data collection 3 1 1 precipitation precipitation was measured at the discharge point of each tot with a standard tipping bucket rain gauge 674 tipping rain isco all measurements were collected at 1 minute intervals continuously during the growing season of 2016 2018 generally starting in may june through october missing precipitation data due to rain gauge malfunctions were replaced with precipitation data from the nearest weather observatory clinton lake located 10 km from the site 3 1 2 tot and soil water the tot sampling setup consisted of automated samplers isco model 6712 full size portable positioned at the tile outlet e g where the tile discharged into the receiving wetland hereafter termed tot discharge at the three study sites see fig 2 automated samplers were outfitted with isco model 750 area velocity probes which have an accuracy of 0 03 m s for velocity and 0 01 m for water depth all measurements were collected at 1 minute intervals continuously during the growing season of 2016 2018 generally starting in may june through october discharge q m3 s from the tots was determined as the product of the water velocity m s and the water filled area a m2 of the tile pipe where a is solved using the following equation 1 a r2 2 θ sinθ r is the radius in m of the circle and θ is the central angle in radians storm event discharge samples were collected using programmed isco autosamplers at 15 or 30 min rates of collection depending on observed flow duration collection began once flow velocity or stage surpassed either 1 0 m s or 0 15 m and continued until the end of the flow event or until 24 bottles were collected capacity of isco samplers bottles were collected from the field within 48 hrs of events transported back to the lab and sequentially filtered event samples were sub sampled and preserved according to proper standard laboratory methods given enough sample 500 ml 60 ml of unfiltered water was used for total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp analysis 250 ml was filtered through a 0 8 µm filter for total suspended solids tss analysis 60 ml of this filtrate was used for total dissolved nitrogen tdn and phosphorus tdp and 120 ml of the filtrate was passed through 0 45 µm filter for anion and cation analysis nitric hno3 acid was used for preservation of cations tss was determined through vacuum filtration of event water through pre weighed dried 100 105 c for 24 hrs 47 mm filter papers fisher scientific 09 874 35 or equivalent after filtration the filter paper was dried 100 105 c for 24 hrs cooled and weighed again total and dissolved nitrogen concentrations were determined using alkaline persulfate methods for oxidation of inorganic and organic nitrogenous compounds to nitrate according to standard methods 4500 no3 b apha 2012 while total and dissolved phosphorus were determined using the acidic persulfate oxidation method for converting organo phosphate to inorganic orthophosphate according to standard method 4500 p e rice et al 2017 all total and dissolved nutrients were analyzed with a shimadzu 1650 pc uv visible light spectrophotometer with tn and tdn determined using the difference between absorbance at 220 nm and 275 nm to correct for doc while tp and tdp were measured at 885 nm cations and anions were analyzed on an inductively coupled plasma optical emissions spectrometry icp oes horiba jy ultima 2 and an ion chromatograph dionex ics 1600 respectively sources of solute contributing to runoff at the tots were quantified using soil water suction cup lysimeters sk20 decagon nested at depths of 30 cm 60 cm and 90 cm at two landscape positions the ridge of a terrace referred to as site r and at the depression of the terrace referred to as site d at each site fig 1 red dashed lines suction of 90 kpa was applied at least a week before each sampling event these samples were collected following events and filtered using a 0 45 µm filter and followed the same procedure for anion and cation analysis as the event water 3 2 data analyses 3 2 1 hydrograph analysis to perform hydrograph separation analyses on the tot discharge data the respective discharges at each site were smoothed using a 15 minute sliding mean window that bracketed the actual measurement storm events where tot discharge flow exceeded 0 05 m3 s at cain and hhn or 0 01 m3 s at hhm and had a duration greater than 10 min were used to understand the hydrologic response in tot systems the relationship to overall hydrologic state prior to the event here defined as the precipitation received 1 day 1 week and 1 month prior to storm event flow was examined when tiles are used alone research has shown that typical exponential fitting barns 1939 and master recession curves tallaksen 1995 can be used to understand the components of runoff that make up the discharge signal baedke and krothe 2001 schilling and helmers 2008b this technique however is not valid in these watersheds because it requires that discharge behave linearly in log space and tile tot discharge does not as such baseflow separation was conducted using a recursive digital filter nathan and mcmahon 1990 in the form 2 fk afk 1 1 a 2 yk yk 1 where fk is the filtered quick response at the kth sampling instant or the discharge at some given time after the onset of the event yk is the original streamflow and a is the filter parameter the filtered baseflow is thus defined as yk fk nathan and mcmahon 1990 the digital recursive filter baseflowseparation function in the ecohydrology r package fuka et al 2018 was used employing the digital filter parameter of 0 925 as recommended by nathan and mcmahon 1990 3 2 2 mixing model analysis mixing models of streamflow assume that conservative tracers can be used to calculate the proportions of compositional end members that are mixed in sample waters these proportions of end members can give an indication of geochemical processes and flow paths contributing to runoff seven potential end members were examined for this approach wet deposition from national atmospheric deposition program nadp nadp sws uiuc edu and soil water from ridge and base of the terraces at 30 60 and 90 cm fig 1 here we relied on three fairly mobile anions chloride cl which is mainly delivered through meteoric inputs nitrate no3 which is mainly delivered through fertilizer applications and sulfate so4 2 which is primarily geogenic though can be included in the applied fertilizers we used the ratios of nitrate to chloride and sulfate to chloride to help distinguish the sources of water surficial vs subsurface that contributed to the tot discharge chemistry over a given storm event 3 2 3 concentration discharge c q behavior and weathering fluxes two methods were used to determine if and how c q behavior differs with tile inlet density 1 the slope m of the power law relationship c aqm between solute concentrations and discharge godsey et al 2009 and 2 solute concentration coefficient of variation cvc and the discharge coefficient of variation cvq musolff et al 2015 thompson et al 2011 for the first method the c q is considered chemostatic or lacking a relationship between solute concentration and discharge when m 0 conversely the relationship is considered chemodynamic or that solute concentrations are sensitive to changes in discharge when m 0 for the second method chemostatic behavior is identified if the c q relationship exhibits low concentration variability cvc cvq 1 while chemodynamic behavior is identified by large concentration variability cvc cvq 1 once the contribution of water sources e g conduit intermediate and diffuse were determined for each precipitation event the solute concentrations together with results from the end member mixing analysis and c q relationship allowed us to understand how hydrologic connectivity across these agroecosystems differ with storm events and the resultant impact on the biogeochemical signatures of the tot discharge 4 results rainfall during the growing season over this three year study was greatest in 2017 796 mm and lowest in 2018 534 mm which bookends the mean 685 mm the monthly distribution of rainfall ranged from 42 to 232 mm between may and october appendix a figure a 1 whereas the 30 year monthly means ranged from 85 to 130 mm the median event based tot discharge for hhm hhn and cain was 25 m3 442 m3 and 33 m3 respectively not surprisingly the largest discharge events tended to occur when precipitation events were large though in may and june discharge events were often characterized by precipitation from multiple events as precipitation at that time of year is more frontal while during the height of summer it is more convective 4 1 hydrographs and baseflow hydrograph responses of tot discharge differed in terms of duration frequency of events and rising falling limb dynamics appendix a figure a 3 flow events at hhn and cain had a consistent response though the response at cain frequently sustained larger discharge values for a longer duration than at hhn and hhm a plateau shape was observed for several events at hhn and like other tile drainage systems it is indicative of the maximum system discharge in other words the water available to drain is likely restricted by the size of perforations and pipe dimensions baseflow separation was conducted using a recursive digital filter nathan and mcmahon 1990 appendix a table a1 3 very small storm events often less than 10 min in duration were excluded from the analysis as the resultant discharge ranged within instrument error quickflow dominated discharge composition early in events fig 3 and comprised most of the discharge if events were short in duration 1 hr the proportion of baseflow from the total discharge was 38 51 and 46 for hhm hhn and cain respectively the median baseflow for the three sites were 0 22 m3 s 3 5 m3 s and 0 24 m3 s respectively this metric indicates the degree of flashiness is greatest in hhm and lowest in hhn yet the greatest total discharge was observed at hhn when we examined the relationship between precipitation a week prior to the event we observed a positive relationship significant at a p value 0 10 table 1 for all three sites as opposed to the relationship between precipitation a day and month prior to events which was only significant at the cain site relationships between precipitation a week prior to the event at hhm and cain had similarly high slopes while the hhn response was lower in general cain had strong and significant positive slopes regardless of the evaluated period while hhn had a significant relationship to antecedent precipitation at 1 week and 1 month and hhm only had a significant relationship at 1 week interestingly long duration storm events were observed to have the largest baseflow component as determined using the digital recursive filter appendix a tables a1 3 both the tot discharge and proportion of baseflow often demonstrated a pulsed signature or high frequency signature throughout the storm event at all three sites e g fig 3b in comparison short duration storm events maintained a much more typical low frequency bell shaped hydrograph e g fig 3a 4 2 tot discharge sources and behavior water chemistry was collected in eighteen lysimeters and at the tot discharge at all three sites fig 4 the highest solute concentrations were observed in hhn where sulfate so4 2 had the highest concentration at the depression hhn d at 6 mg l followed by nitrate no3 at the ridge hhn r at 4 mg l interestingly this pattern in so4 and no3 repeated at the other two agroecosystems where higher values of so4 2 were observed in the depressions while elevated values of no3 were observed in the ridges overall hhn had a larger range of nutrient concentrations amongst the three agriculture sites specifically hhn depressions were significantly anova post hoc tukey test ɑ 0 05 elevated with respect to so4 2 at all depths and cl was significantly elevated in both the depressions and ridges of hhn at all depths compared to all sites hhn was also significantly elevated in no3 in both the ridge and depression as well as the hhm ridge compared to all other sites we used a range in mixing model chemistry fig 5 one standard deviation from the mean of the end members precipitation lysimeters on ridge and depressions of the terraces to account for variability throughout the sampling in general the mixing model end members confined the tot discharge concentration across all sites though a potential fourth component or end member may contribute to the chemical signature from the tots this fourth end member may result from analytical error or may represent standing water in the tile pipe that has undergone biogeochemical reactions imparting a specific signature due to an extended interaction with surface sediments that are also transported through the tots during the driest periods of the year august tot composition most closely mirrored direct precipitation while the wettest periods during june july show contributions of all three end members and varied between storm events during september and october under rewetting conditions the values more closely resembled soil water fig 5 to gain a better picture of the behavior addition or dilution from all events the power law behavior of concentration discharge c q relationships was examined at each site for 16 solutes appendix b generally the behavior of each solute across sites rarely showed the same behavior with the exception of tss and tn which always showed addition behavior and k which always showed dilution behavior while most sites demonstrated chemostatic behavior with the respect to geogenic species hhn had the greatest number of solutes that demonstrated addition behavior slope of the c q relationship b 0 1 e g so4 2 fe3 al3 while most solutes at cain demonstrated dilution behavior b 0 1 e g mg k the cvc cvq analysis showed most of the nutrients and solutes had a value less than 0 3 indicating a tendency toward chemostatic behavior see fig 6 5 discussion anthropogenic changes to the landscape have shifted their hydrologic response and reduced residence time of water in agricultural environments kumar et al 2018 below we present discuss the hydrologic and biogeochemical behavior observed between 2016 and 2018 on three agroecosystems under varying tile and terrace densities 5 1 hydrographs and baseflow using the median baseflow discharge derived from the recursive digital filter as a metric for indicating flashiness or response to storm events i e small values indicate greater quickflow for the tot systems we observed that baseflow contributed the least at hhm making up only 38 of discharge 0 22 m3 s followed by 46 0 24 m3 s at cain and 51 3 5 m3 s at hhn this indicates that the proportion of discharge from event water or overland flow is thus highest at hhm 62 and lowest at hhn 49 interestingly these baseflow values show little relationship to tile inlet density which is inconsistent with the expectation that hydrologic responsiveness to storm events or flashiness of the subsurface contributions would increase with increased tile densities sloan et al 2016 here we observed the lowest overland flow linked with highest tile inlet density hhn but the difference in surface routing based on difference in the overall size of the system may play a critical role in changing the flashiness behavior as cain is more than double the size of the other two sites the literature also suggests tile drained systems increase baseflow contributions to total discharge during storm events up to 77 using a tracer based hydrograph separation method schilling and helmers 2008b but our data suggest that the combined tot systems may reduce the baseflow response to storm events at all sites the long duration storm events caused a high frequency response to be superimposed on the typical low frequency hydrograph response fig 3 this suggests that the tot systems provide a mechanism for pulsed discharge component that is not normally observed in unaltered landscapes a possible mechanism for this pulsed flow is the transition from negative to positive pore pressures in the capillary fringe when it is located at depths consistent with the tile system much like the pulse of pre event discharge along a streambank e g jones et al 2006 sklash and farvolden 1979 the transition to positive pore pressure in the capillary fringe allows for drainage of water previously held in the capillary region this can drain the subsurface in proximity to the tile drain returning it to negative pore pressures and stopping flow until pressures increase again causing a pulsed signal this is just one possible mechanism for the high frequency signal in the hydrographs further work needs to be completed to confirm mechanisms causing this response 5 2 tot discharge sources and behavior while mixing models have been used to better understand the impacts of tile discharge on stream water behavior e g schilling et al 2019 less attention has been focused on the hydrologic connectivity within given agroecosystems and its impact on the chemical behavior of tile discharge modeling efforts show that discharge in tiled systems moves toward a more homogeneous response sloan et al 2016 but the interaction with terraces remains elusive our work shows spatial and temporal variability in waters that contribute to tot discharge which is likely a function of both the storm intensity and antecedent soil moisture conditions if we first focus on august when inputs from precipitation are low no irrigation at these sites and plant water uptake is likely near it maximum given the growing season any tot flows should result from a direct connection of event water to tiles during or right after the event this connectivity is likely aided by the high shrink swell capacity of these soils where under extended dry conditions dry conditions large cracks propagate from the surface to depth e g stewart et al 2015 interestingly during august it appears that storm event water is closely connected with the tots and the residence time of the water is extremely low during this time when large macropore cracks are open the overall interaction of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration may strongly influence change in soil fabric which appears to reduce the time water interacts with the soil matrix and thus does not allow the soil matrix to alter the chemical behavior of the infiltrating water before it discharges the tot under wetter conditions early in the growing season the strong spatial variability in the contributions of water derived from all end members suggests changing flow paths are likely occurring fig 5 this could be a result of a transition toward horton overland flow where locally water is being contributed from shallow soils in the terrace ridges and depressions but also from direct overland flow using the data from fig 4 the largest variation of no3 concentrations were found at depths of 30 and 60 cm on the ridges of the terraces so4 concentrations were highest in the depression of terraces for all sites with the largest variations found at depths of 60 and 90 cm fig 4 this suggests that during storm events shallow ridges are a significant source of no3 we also observe that later in the growing season when the system is rewetting with fall storms and a reduction in evapotranspiration that flow paths indicate that storm events may have a greater residence time imparting a signature of ridge and depression soil water when c q observations are coupled with metrics of flashiness we see that the site with the greatest degree of flashiness indicated by the inputs of quickflow is the site with the most chemostatic behavior hhm evidenced from the lack of spreading in fig 6 interestingly hhn and cain showed divergent behavior where hhn had the lowest proportion of quickflow but the greatest addition behavior and cain had quickflow proportions comparable to hhm but more dilution behavior overall these data are inconsistent with the expectation that more chemodynamic behavior would be associated with higher tile densities and more flashy hydrograph responses one reason for this difference may be the observed higher levels of surface soil erosion observed at hhn as a result of poor ineffective tile design in particular one terrace at hhn has a surface inlet to the tile outlet system rather than the rise used at all other terraces across the three sites which allow for greater entry of suspended solids into the drain system 6 conclusions intensively managed landscapes artificial subsurface drainage and terraces and their resultant change in hydrology affects the transformation transport and fate of applied fertilizers and their effect on other solute behavior increased density of tots was expected to increase the flashiness of the hydrologic response however results across our three sites were not consistent with this expectation indicating that other hydrologic features were also significantly contributing to the flow response the interaction of tots did lead to irregular storm water discharge events which reveal hydrological flow responses with both low and high frequency signals the low frequency signals are consistent with hydrograph responses in unaltered landscapes fig 3a and we suggest that the high frequency signal may be due to movement of the capillary zone within the area of the tile drains mixing model results suggest other mechanisms that may control spatial and temporal variability in hydrologic controls on tot discharge specifically event water appears to move unaltered through the soil fabric under dry conditions when large soil cracks are present conversely the soil fabric has strong spatial control due to increased residence time early in the growing season when these preferential flowpaths are not present and antecedent conditions drive both toward the terraces and tiles the c q responses of the agroecosystems were also inconsistent with expected results as we expected more chemostatic behavior to accompany lower tile densities and less flashy hydrograph responses it is clear from this work that while the tots contribute to changes in the hydrologic and biogeochemical behavior of the sites that antecedent conditions and size of storm event were more significant drivers of the flow and biogeochemical responses further work is needed to elucidate the controls tots have over hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to storm events in different environmental conditions particularly in regions without significant preferential flow paths that can obscure and dominant system response

nutrients and solutes have the highest concentrations at the hhn sites figure 12 it must be noted that in the growing season of 2017 at the hhn site there was a large amount of standing water that was

9632,agricultural practices in intensively managed landscapes are thought to be shifting hydro bio geochemical behavior from transformation to transport dominated systems here we explore the impacts of a best management practice known as tile outlet terraces tot tiles at this site are a set of perforated vertical pipes that can receive direct surface water soil water and groundwater inputs that are connected to horizontal pipes that transport water to a receiving pond terraces are constructed horizontal areas created to divide sloping terrains to reduce slope steepness and erosion and in so doing they redirect surface water toward standpipes and promote soil and groundwater discharge as a result bisecting local flowpaths while the impact of tiles on hydrologic behavior has been well studied the combined impact of tots has not been well quantified to address this knowledge gap we focus on the response of tot discharge and biogeochemical behavior across three adjacent agroecosystems in kansas over three growing seasons 2016 2018 tot discharge was measured every minute at each location and discharge during storm events was collected and analyzed for dissolved and total nutrients as well as major anion and cation chemistry additionally suction cup lysimeters were installed at the ridges and depression of the terraces to capture soil water solute chemistry prior to storm events recession curve analysis revealed that tile inlet density was not directly related to the proportion of quickflow mixing models showed that antecedent conditions played a critical role in the degree of connectivity of event water to the tiles and concentration discharge behavior showed the dominant behavior for all constituents was chemostatic across all tile densities interestingly these findings suggest that while tots shift the hydrology of agroecosystems away from natural conditions the storm event size and antecedent conditions can still dominate the hydrologic and

2004 evidence is mounting to suggest that agriculture practices are shifting landscape processes from transformers to transporters blann et al 2009 kumar et al 2018 schilling and helmers 2008a this describes how the hydrologic response is shifting from a longer residence time enabling more water mineral interactions a transformer controlled system to those with shorter residence times due to increased flow rates which decreases water mineral interactions a transporter controlled system kumar et al 2018 the hydrologic impact of artificial manipulation to the land surface e g tilling berms terraces and subsurface drainage systems e g tiles in agroecosystems is well established in the literature with a consensus that flow contributions from these transporter systems increases inputs of

discharge after a storm event from tile drained watersheds were more linear than less tiled drained watersheds implying more homogenous flow paths in tile drained systems schilling and helmers 2008a what remains less understood is the impact of multiple interacting surface and subsurface manipulations on landscape hydrology and the cascading biogeochemical response this work specifically focuses on the impact of tile outlet terraces tot density on discharge following storm events through the use of a recession curve approach in order to understand the overall impact of altered hydrology on biogeochemical behavior due to the controlled partitioning of runoff water infiltration and soil moisture conditions 1 1 tile outlet terraces for decades tile outlets or tile lines subsurface drainage systems that collect surface and shallow subsurface water through perforated pipes and transport them through unperforated horizontal pipes to a receiving pond similar to sewer systems and terraces constructed horizontal areas created to divide sloping terrains by reducing slope steepness have been two best management practices bmps often used to reduce the impact of overland flow on soil erosion in agricultural environments wei et al 2016 skaggs and van schilfgaarde 1999 fig 1 hydrologically these two approaches differ as tiles move the energy from overland flow into the subsurface thus reducing surface erosion skaggs and van schilfgaarde 1999 kladivko et al 2004 and alter peak flows by reducing it drying out soil in between events or increasing it by allowing faster collection of drainage water boland brien et al 2013 terraces slow the energy of overland flow by reducing the topographic gradient kladivko et al 2004 schilling and helmers 2008a and generally increase infiltration arnáez et al 2015 wei et al 2016 since the 1960s tots have combined the use of tile outlets and terraces to further reduce surface water runoff during storm events nrcs 2021 and alter the hydrologic flow paths and spatial variability in soil moisture these hydrologic alterations coupled with fertilizer applications can reorient the transformation and transport of nutrients and alter fluxes from chemical weathering yet the degree to which either controls biogeochemical fluxes is not well understood with much of the central usa underlain by tiles or tots blann et al 2009 there is a need to understand how altered landscapes subsurface hydrologic processes and their combined impact shifts the terrestrial biogeochemical processes as of 2017 tiles were reported to drain over 56 million acres across the us an increase of 12 over the previous 5 years usda nass 2017 1 2 characterizing tile outlet terrace hydrology the analytical methods of recession curve analysis from karst aquifer flow systems provide a potential conceptual tool for understanding tot hydrology schilling and helmers 2008b 2008a analyses of tots can leverage the fact that karst aquifers are often characterized by a triple permeability white 2003 where subsurface water flow is evolved from the interaction of diffuse intermediate and conduit permeability porosity palmer et al 1999 white 2003 diffuse permeability is the intergranular porosity of un fractured bedrock intermediate permeability are mechanical joints joint swarms and bedding plane partings conduit permeability are pipe like openings that start at 1 cm white 2003 if a single point of outflow or discharge q can be measured in a karst system then these locations are thought to integrate various hydrologic flow paths contributing to discharge e g runoff flow conduit flow matrix flow diffuse flow and intermediate flow a mixture of both runoff and matrix flow that occur at different rates in time and space within a catchment baedke and krothe 2001 milanovic 1981 if tot agriculture systems operate in an analogous manner to that of karst the integrated signal at the outlet of a tile drain may represent all three flow regimes schilling and helmers 2008a applied this same approach to tiled agriculture watersheds for three storm events and found that 66 5 of the events had two flow regimes conduit and intermediate and 33 5 had three flow regimes that contributed to the hydrograph response where the contribution of three flow regimes was concomitant with a discharge response elevated soil moisture or heavy rainfall events could both be invoked to explain faster discharge responses in this work the relationship between tile terrace density on the flashiness of the landscape and the resultant effect on concentration discharge behavior is investigated 2 study site three tile terraced cropland systems located within the upper wakarusa watershed in douglas county ks that drain to clinton lake were compared fig 2 harvest hills north hhn 38 59 05 5 n 95 27 19 0 w harvest hills middle hhm 38 59 05 5 n 95 27 19 0 w and cain 38 59 21 9 n 95 25 19 9 w all sites have similar landscape and management characteristics specifically they 1 are terraced with ridges and depressions across the landscape 2 have perforated standpipes through the soil located in the depressions that are connected to the tile outlet to help drain standing water and soil water and 3 have tile drains non perforated that are all connected to wetlands before being discharged to nearby streams and eventually to clinton lake the only exception to this design is a surface inlet on one of the terraces at hhn compared to a perforated pipe that goes through the soil as bedrock is close to the surface at this terrace siddiqui 2020 hhn drains 5 88 ha and consists of three terraces hhm drains 7 04 ha and consists of three terraces whereas cain drains 16 73 ha and consists of six terraces terraces are hill type bench terraces which grade reversely toward the hill mean slopes of the harvest hills sites hhn and hhm are 7 69 compared to 6 09 at the cain site peltier et al 2020 siddiqui 2020 each of the terraces is connected to the tile lines and thus to calculate tile inlet density we use the terraces as a proxy for the tiles thus while cain has the largest contributing area tile inlet density is lowest at 0 36 tiles ha and increases to hhm at 0 43 tiles ha and hhn at 0 51 tile ha it is expected that both drainage area and tile inlet density will affect tot discharge and solute concentrations as would crop rotation luckily all three fields were planted with nitrogen fixing soybeans over the entire study period while cain was also mixed with corn over the three years fields were planted in the spring and conservation tillage practices and light disking prior to planting were employed at each site unfortunately information on the fertilizer type and application timing and amount are not available for these sites the general lithology of douglas county which encompasses the research sites consists of limestone shale and sandstone frye 1952 the three study sites consist entirely of argiudolls soil a great group of the mollisol order that are found in humid climates with an udic moisture regime the average annual temperature is 12 4 c with an average high of 30 3 c in the summer and an average low of 6 3 c in the winter while average annual precipitation is 960 mm with 70 of the total precipitation falling in the spring and summer months petrie et al 2012 approximately 75 of the total precipitation falls within the growing season which spans 180 days petrie et al 2012 3 methods data collection and analyses were completed to characterize the flow and transport at each study site data collection included measurements of precipitation and the velocity and stage from each tot discharge location tot discharge and soil waters were also collected and analyzed to characterize the biogeochemical response to storm events data analyses include the use of recession curves end member mixing analysis and concentration discharge c q relationships to understand the impact of tots on the hydrologic flow and transport behavior of the landscape 3 1 data collection 3 1 1 precipitation precipitation was measured at the discharge point of each tot with a standard tipping bucket rain gauge 674 tipping rain isco all measurements were collected at 1 minute intervals continuously during the growing season of 2016 2018 generally starting in may june through october missing precipitation data due to rain gauge malfunctions were replaced with precipitation data from the nearest weather observatory clinton lake located 10 km from the site 3 1 2 tot and soil water the tot sampling setup consisted of automated samplers isco model 6712 full size portable positioned at the tile outlet e g where the tile discharged into the receiving wetland hereafter termed tot discharge at the three study sites see fig 2 automated samplers were outfitted with isco model 750 area velocity probes which have an accuracy of 0 03 m s for velocity and 0 01 m for water depth all measurements were collected at 1 minute intervals continuously during the growing season of 2016 2018 generally starting in may june through october discharge q m3 s from the tots was determined as the product of the water velocity m s and the water filled area a m2 of the tile pipe where a is solved using the following equation 1 a r2 2 θ sinθ r is the radius in m of the circle and θ is the central angle in radians storm event discharge samples were collected using programmed isco autosamplers at 15 or 30 min rates of collection depending on observed flow duration collection began once flow velocity or stage surpassed either 1 0 m s or 0 15 m and continued until the end of the flow event or until 24 bottles were collected capacity of isco samplers bottles were collected from the field within 48 hrs of events transported back to the lab and sequentially filtered event samples were sub sampled and preserved according to proper standard laboratory methods given enough sample 500 ml 60 ml of unfiltered water was used for total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp analysis 250 ml was filtered through a 0 8 µm filter for total suspended solids tss analysis 60 ml of this filtrate was used for total dissolved nitrogen tdn and phosphorus tdp and 120 ml of the filtrate was passed through 0 45 µm filter for anion and cation analysis nitric hno3 acid was used for preservation of cations tss was determined through vacuum filtration of event water through pre weighed dried 100 105 c for 24 hrs 47 mm filter papers fisher scientific 09 874 35 or equivalent after filtration the filter paper was dried 100 105 c for 24 hrs cooled and weighed again total and dissolved nitrogen concentrations were determined using alkaline persulfate methods for oxidation of inorganic and organic nitrogenous compounds to nitrate according to standard methods 4500 no3 b apha 2012 while total and dissolved phosphorus were determined using the acidic persulfate oxidation method for converting organo phosphate to inorganic orthophosphate according to standard method 4500 p e rice et al 2017 all total and dissolved nutrients were analyzed with a shimadzu 1650 pc uv visible light spectrophotometer with tn and tdn determined using the difference between absorbance at 220 nm and 275 nm to correct for doc while tp and tdp were measured at 885 nm cations and anions were analyzed on an inductively coupled plasma optical emissions spectrometry icp oes horiba jy ultima 2 and an ion chromatograph dionex ics 1600 respectively sources of solute contributing to runoff at the tots were quantified using soil water suction cup lysimeters sk20 decagon nested at depths of 30 cm 60 cm and 90 cm at two landscape positions the ridge of a terrace referred to as site r and at the depression of the terrace referred to as site d at each site fig 1 red dashed lines suction of 90 kpa was applied at least a week before each sampling event these samples were collected following events and filtered using a 0 45 µm filter and followed the same procedure for anion and cation analysis as the event water 3 2 data analyses 3 2 1 hydrograph analysis to perform hydrograph separation analyses on the tot discharge data the respective discharges at each site were smoothed using a 15 minute sliding mean window that bracketed the actual measurement storm events where tot discharge flow exceeded 0 05 m3 s at cain and hhn or 0 01 m3 s at hhm and had a duration greater than 10 min were used to understand the hydrologic response in tot systems the relationship to overall hydrologic state prior to the event here defined as the precipitation received 1 day 1 week and 1 month prior to storm event flow was examined when tiles are used alone research has shown that typical exponential fitting barns 1939 and master recession curves tallaksen 1995 can be used to understand the components of runoff that make up the discharge signal baedke and krothe 2001 schilling and helmers 2008b this technique however is not valid in these watersheds because it requires that discharge behave linearly in log space and tile tot discharge does not as such baseflow separation was conducted using a recursive digital filter nathan and mcmahon 1990 in the form 2 fk afk 1 1 a 2 yk yk 1 where fk is the filtered quick response at the kth sampling instant or the discharge at some given time after the onset of the event yk is the original streamflow and a is the filter parameter the filtered baseflow is thus defined as yk fk nathan and mcmahon 1990 the digital recursive filter baseflowseparation function in the ecohydrology r package fuka et al 2018 was used employing the digital filter parameter of 0 925 as recommended by nathan and mcmahon 1990 3 2 2 mixing model analysis mixing models of streamflow assume that conservative tracers can be used to calculate the proportions of compositional end members that are mixed in sample waters these proportions of end members can give an indication of geochemical processes and flow paths contributing to runoff seven potential end members were examined for this approach wet deposition from national atmospheric deposition program nadp nadp sws uiuc edu and soil water from ridge and base of the terraces at 30 60 and 90 cm fig 1 here we relied on three fairly mobile anions chloride cl which is mainly delivered through meteoric inputs nitrate no3 which is mainly delivered through fertilizer applications and sulfate so4 2 which is primarily geogenic though can be included in the applied fertilizers we used the ratios of nitrate to chloride and sulfate to chloride to help distinguish the sources of water surficial vs subsurface that contributed to the tot discharge chemistry over a given storm event 3 2 3 concentration discharge c q behavior and weathering fluxes two methods were used to determine if and how c q behavior differs with tile inlet density 1 the slope m of the power law relationship c aqm between solute concentrations and discharge godsey et al 2009 and 2 solute concentration coefficient of variation cvc and the discharge coefficient of variation cvq musolff et al 2015 thompson et al 2011 for the first method the c q is considered chemostatic or lacking a relationship between solute concentration and discharge when m 0 conversely the relationship is considered chemodynamic or that solute concentrations are sensitive to changes in discharge when m 0 for the second method chemostatic behavior is identified if the c q relationship exhibits low concentration variability cvc cvq 1 while chemodynamic behavior is identified by large concentration variability cvc cvq 1 once the contribution of water sources e g conduit intermediate and diffuse were determined for each precipitation event the solute concentrations together with results from the end member mixing analysis and c q relationship allowed us to understand how hydrologic connectivity across these agroecosystems differ with storm events and the resultant impact on the biogeochemical signatures of the tot discharge 4 results rainfall during the growing season over this three year study was greatest in 2017 796 mm and lowest in 2018 534 mm which bookends the mean 685 mm the monthly distribution of rainfall ranged from 42 to 232 mm between may and october appendix a figure a 1 whereas the 30 year monthly means ranged from 85 to 130 mm the median event based tot discharge for hhm hhn and cain was 25 m3 442 m3 and 33 m3 respectively not surprisingly the largest discharge events tended to occur when precipitation events were large though in may and june discharge events were often characterized by precipitation from multiple events as precipitation at that time of year is more frontal while during the height of summer it is more convective 4 1 hydrographs and baseflow hydrograph responses of tot discharge differed in terms of duration frequency of events and rising falling limb dynamics appendix a figure a 3 flow events at hhn and cain had a consistent response though the response at cain frequently sustained larger discharge values for a longer duration than at hhn and hhm a plateau shape was observed for several events at hhn and like other tile drainage systems it is indicative of the maximum system discharge in other words the water available to drain is likely restricted by the size of perforations and pipe dimensions baseflow separation was conducted using a recursive digital filter nathan and mcmahon 1990 appendix a table a1 3 very small storm events often less than 10 min in duration were excluded from the analysis as the resultant discharge ranged within instrument error quickflow dominated discharge composition early in events fig 3 and comprised most of the discharge if events were short in duration 1 hr the proportion of baseflow from the total discharge was 38 51 and 46 for hhm hhn and cain respectively the median baseflow for the three sites were 0 22 m3 s 3 5 m3 s and 0 24 m3 s respectively this metric indicates the degree of flashiness is greatest in hhm and lowest in hhn yet the greatest total discharge was observed at hhn when we examined the relationship between precipitation a week prior to the event we observed a positive relationship significant at a p value 0 10 table 1 for all three sites as opposed to the relationship between precipitation a day and month prior to events which was only significant at the cain site relationships between precipitation a week prior to the event at hhm and cain had similarly high slopes while the hhn response was lower in general cain had strong and significant positive slopes regardless of the evaluated period while hhn had a significant relationship to antecedent precipitation at 1 week and 1 month and hhm only had a significant relationship at 1 week interestingly long duration storm events were observed to have the largest baseflow component as determined using the digital recursive filter appendix a tables a1 3 both the tot discharge and proportion of baseflow often demonstrated a pulsed signature or high frequency signature throughout the storm event at all three sites e g fig 3b in comparison short duration storm events maintained a much more typical low frequency bell shaped hydrograph e g fig 3a 4 2 tot discharge sources and behavior water chemistry was collected in eighteen lysimeters and at the tot discharge at all three sites fig 4 the highest solute concentrations were observed in hhn where sulfate so4 2 had the highest concentration at the depression hhn d at 6 mg l followed by nitrate no3 at the ridge hhn r at 4 mg l interestingly this pattern in so4 and no3 repeated at the other two agroecosystems where higher values of so4 2 were observed in the depressions while elevated values of no3 were observed in the ridges overall hhn had a larger range of nutrient concentrations amongst the three agriculture sites specifically hhn depressions were significantly anova post hoc tukey test ɑ 0 05 elevated with respect to so4 2 at all depths and cl was significantly elevated in both the depressions and ridges of hhn at all depths compared to all sites hhn was also significantly elevated in no3 in both the ridge and depression as well as the hhm ridge compared to all other sites we used a range in mixing model chemistry fig 5 one standard deviation from the mean of the end members precipitation lysimeters on ridge and depressions of the terraces to account for variability throughout the sampling in general the mixing model end members confined the tot discharge concentration across all sites though a potential fourth component or end member may contribute to the chemical signature from the tots this fourth end member may result from analytical error or may represent standing water in the tile pipe that has undergone biogeochemical reactions imparting a specific signature due to an extended interaction with surface sediments that are also transported through the tots during the driest periods of the year august tot composition most closely mirrored direct precipitation while the wettest periods during june july show contributions of all three end members and varied between storm events during september and october under rewetting conditions the values more closely resembled soil water fig 5 to gain a better picture of the behavior addition or dilution from all events the power law behavior of concentration discharge c q relationships was examined at each site for 16 solutes appendix b generally the behavior of each solute across sites rarely showed the same behavior with the exception of tss and tn which always showed addition behavior and k which always showed dilution behavior while most sites demonstrated chemostatic behavior with the respect to geogenic species hhn had the greatest number of solutes that demonstrated addition behavior slope of the c q relationship b 0 1 e g so4 2 fe3 al3 while most solutes at cain demonstrated dilution behavior b 0 1 e g mg k the cvc cvq analysis showed most of the nutrients and solutes had a value less than 0 3 indicating a tendency toward chemostatic behavior see fig 6 5 discussion anthropogenic changes to the landscape have shifted their hydrologic response and reduced residence time of water in agricultural environments kumar et al 2018 below we present discuss the hydrologic and biogeochemical behavior observed between 2016 and 2018 on three agroecosystems under varying tile and terrace densities 5 1 hydrographs and baseflow using the median baseflow discharge derived from the recursive digital filter as a metric for indicating flashiness or response to storm events i e small values indicate greater quickflow for the tot systems we observed that baseflow contributed the least at hhm making up only 38 of discharge 0 22 m3 s followed by 46 0 24 m3 s at cain and 51 3 5 m3 s at hhn this indicates that the proportion of discharge from event water or overland flow is thus highest at hhm 62 and lowest at hhn 49 interestingly these baseflow values show little relationship to tile inlet density which is inconsistent with the expectation that hydrologic responsiveness to storm events or flashiness of the subsurface contributions would increase with increased tile densities sloan et al 2016 here we observed the lowest overland flow linked with highest tile inlet density hhn but the difference in surface routing based on difference in the overall size of the system may play a critical role in changing the flashiness behavior as cain is more than double the size of the other two sites the literature also suggests tile drained systems increase baseflow contributions to total discharge during storm events up to 77 using a tracer based hydrograph separation method schilling and helmers 2008b but our data suggest that the combined tot systems may reduce the baseflow response to storm events at all sites the long duration storm events caused a high frequency response to be superimposed on the typical low frequency hydrograph response fig 3 this suggests that the tot systems provide a mechanism for pulsed discharge component that is not normally observed in unaltered landscapes a possible mechanism for this pulsed flow is the transition from negative to positive pore pressures in the capillary fringe when it is located at depths consistent with the tile system much like the pulse of pre event discharge along a streambank e g jones et al 2006 sklash and farvolden 1979 the transition to positive pore pressure in the capillary fringe allows for drainage of water previously held in the capillary region this can drain the subsurface in proximity to the tile drain returning it to negative pore pressures and stopping flow until pressures increase again causing a pulsed signal this is just one possible mechanism for the high frequency signal in the hydrographs further work needs to be completed to confirm mechanisms causing this response 5 2 tot discharge sources and behavior while mixing models have been used to better understand the impacts of tile discharge on stream water behavior e g schilling et al 2019 less attention has been focused on the hydrologic connectivity within given agroecosystems and its impact on the chemical behavior of tile discharge modeling efforts show that discharge in tiled systems moves toward a more homogeneous response sloan et al 2016 but the interaction with terraces remains elusive our work shows spatial and temporal variability in waters that contribute to tot discharge which is likely a function of both the storm intensity and antecedent soil moisture conditions if we first focus on august when inputs from precipitation are low no irrigation at these sites and plant water uptake is likely near it maximum given the growing season any tot flows should result from a direct connection of event water to tiles during or right after the event this connectivity is likely aided by the high shrink swell capacity of these soils where under extended dry conditions dry conditions large cracks propagate from the surface to depth e g stewart et al 2015 interestingly during august it appears that storm event water is closely connected with the tots and the residence time of the water is extremely low during this time when large macropore cracks are open the overall interaction of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration may strongly influence change in soil fabric which appears to reduce the time water interacts with the soil matrix and thus does not allow the soil matrix to alter the chemical behavior of the infiltrating water before it discharges the tot under wetter conditions early in the growing season the strong spatial variability in the contributions of water derived from all end members suggests changing flow paths are likely occurring fig 5 this could be a result of a transition toward horton overland flow where locally water is being contributed from shallow soils in the terrace ridges and depressions but also from direct overland flow using the data from fig 4 the largest variation of no3 concentrations were found at depths of 30 and 60 cm on the ridges of the terraces so4 concentrations were highest in the depression of terraces for all sites with the largest variations found at depths of 60 and 90 cm fig 4 this suggests that during storm events shallow ridges are a significant source of no3 we also observe that later in the growing season when the system is rewetting with fall storms and a reduction in evapotranspiration that flow paths indicate that storm events may have a greater residence time imparting a signature of ridge and depression soil water when c q observations are coupled with metrics of flashiness we see that the site with the greatest degree of flashiness indicated by the inputs of quickflow is the site with the most chemostatic behavior hhm evidenced from the lack of spreading in fig 6 interestingly hhn and cain showed divergent behavior where hhn had the lowest proportion of quickflow but the greatest addition behavior and cain had quickflow proportions comparable to hhm but more dilution behavior overall these data are inconsistent with the expectation that more chemodynamic behavior would be associated with higher tile densities and more flashy hydrograph responses one reason for this difference may be the observed higher levels of surface soil erosion observed at hhn as a result of poor ineffective tile design in particular one terrace at hhn has a surface inlet to the tile outlet system rather than the rise used at all other terraces across the three sites which allow for greater entry of suspended solids into the drain system 6 conclusions intensively managed landscapes artificial subsurface drainage and terraces and their resultant change in hydrology affects the transformation transport and fate of applied fertilizers and their effect on other solute behavior increased density of tots was expected to increase the flashiness of the hydrologic response however results across our three sites were not consistent with this expectation indicating that other hydrologic features were also significantly contributing to the flow response the interaction of tots did lead to irregular storm water discharge events which reveal hydrological flow responses with both low and high frequency signals the low frequency signals are consistent with hydrograph responses in unaltered landscapes fig 3a and we suggest that the high frequency signal may be due to movement of the capillary zone within the area of the tile drains mixing model results suggest other mechanisms that may control spatial and temporal variability in hydrologic controls on tot discharge specifically event water appears to move unaltered through the soil fabric under dry conditions when large soil cracks are present conversely the soil fabric has strong spatial control due to increased residence time early in the growing season when these preferential flowpaths are not present and antecedent conditions drive both toward the terraces and tiles the c q responses of the agroecosystems were also inconsistent with expected results as we expected more chemostatic behavior to accompany lower tile densities and less flashy hydrograph responses it is clear from this work that while the tots contribute to changes in the hydrologic and biogeochemical behavior of the sites that antecedent conditions and size of storm event were more significant drivers of the flow and biogeochemical responses further work is needed to elucidate the controls tots have over hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to storm events in different environmental conditions particularly in regions without significant preferential flow paths that can obscure and dominant system response

nutrients and solutes have the highest concentrations at the hhn sites figure 12 it must be noted that in the growing season of 2017 at the hhn site there was a large amount of standing water that was

reserves in the vegetative parts before anthesis can play a buffering role and reduce the adverse environmental effects during grain filling on final grain yield schnyder 1993 masoni et al 2007 ma et al 2015 liu et al 2020 under drought conditions remobilization of pre stored photo assimilates in the wheat mainly stem reserves to grain has a significant contribution to yield the stem is an essential source of carbon for grain filling which under adequate moisture conditions its contribution in grain yield reaches 20 under terminal drought stress conditions the share of dry matter transfer of stem to grain can get more than 50 aggarwal and sinha 1984 schnyder 1993 overall under dry ﬁeld conditions carbohydrate source retransfers for grain filling can contribute to about 75 100 grain yield compared with 37 39 under high precipitation conditions van herwaarden et al 1998 although drought stress after the flowering stage increased the contributions of pre anthesis carbohydrates to the grain it significantly reduces the current photosynthesis zhang et al 2019 post flowering drought stress and heat reduce current photosynthesis in the mediterranean climate and increase the demand for translocation of stored assimilate before flowering to grain papakosta and gagianas 1991 limited irrigation before anthesis increases current photosynthesis and dry matter remobilization xue et al 2006 environmental conditions such as soil water content have different effects on nitrogen uptake and accumulation in different cultivars during the grain filling stage

concentration gpc obviously previous studies show a negative relationship between grain yield and gpc genetic and environmental factors that delay leaf senescence increase grain yield by prolonged carbohydrate accumulation leading to increased grain weight and grain yield but reduce nitrogen remobilization efficiency ultimately reducing the protein to starch ratio in the grain van herwaarden et

precipitation in the mediterranean regions during the growing season of rainfed wheat leads to drought stress shortage of soil moisture occurs chiefly during the most acute stages anthesis and grain filling negatively affecting growth and consequently reducing supplemental irrigation si at critical stages of wheat growth can increase the rate of photosynthesis dry matter dm production increase remobilization and ultimately higher crop yield compared to non irrigated conditions wang et al 2013 meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 dm accumulation above ground is an important indicator of plant growth biomass production and grain yield are negatively affected by drought stress si et al 2020 dm accumulated in vegetative organs by wheat plants until the anthesis stage is critical under mediterranean conditions because grain yield largely depends on remobilization of pre anthesis dm to grain papakosta and gagianas 1991 our results indicated that dm of crop components at anthesis leaf stem ear and maturity leaf stem ear and grain and post anthesis dm accumulation in plants during 2015 2016 was higher than the 2016 2017 growing season table 5 and fig 2 which might be associated with more precipitation in the first growing season table 2 besides si caused enhanced dm in different plant parts at both stages anthesis and grain filling than rainfed conditions table 5 and fig 1 when crops were irrigated twice i2 si at booting and anthesis stages and three times i3 si at booting anthesis and grain filling stages increased post anthesis dm accumulation by 55 56 and 108 08 compared to no irrigation condition treatment respectively table 5 si in different stages booting anthesis and grain filling by providing the required moisture of the plant caused the preservation of stay green and continued photosynthetic activity and finally the accumulation of more dm in these conditions correlation analysis showed that dm accumulation at anthesis and post anthesis dm accumulation were closely correlated with grain yield table 9 papakosta and gagianas 1991 conducted a genetic difference between wheat cultivars in dm accumulation in different organs in general dry matter accumulation in various organs in sirwan cultivar in flowering and maturity stages was higher than in other cultivars in three si treatments grain weight in sirwan cultivars increased by 48 12 than in rainfed conditions demonstrating that sirwan cultivar showed the highest response to si among cultivars fig 1 and table 5 grain growth during the grain filling stage depends on current photosynthesis and translocation of pre anthesis assimilates stored in vegetative organs to grain meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in general drought stress at the end of the growing season induces earlier leaf senescence the re transfer of pre anthesis stored assimilates in the vegetative parts to the grain is done earlier and the efficiency of re transfer in these conditions is higher than soil moisture adequate wang et al 2013 farooq et al 2014 although the remobilized dm was higher under si conditions in the present study the dmre in rainfed conditions and once irrigation in the booting stage was higher than other irrigation treatments table 6 and figs 4 and 7 blum 1998 under drought stress reserves decrease due to reduced photosynthesis so the total remobilization is less than irrigation conditions previous studies showed that dmr and dmre in various cultivars depending on environmental conditions are different masoni et al 2007 ma et al 2015 meng et al 2017 in the current study there was a difference among cultivars in dmr and dmre except leaf dmre table 6 the lowest total dmr and dmre were observed in sardari cultivar under three si i3 conditions fig 3b and fig 7b in general the average dmr of the stem 0 476 g plant 1 was higher than the leaves 0 129 g plant 1 and ear 0 063 g plant 1 however leaf dmre 41 77 higher than stem 38 07 and ear dmre 17 45 table 6 the relationship between grain yield and total dmr was positive whereas the relationship between grain yield and dmre negatively significant correlation analysis also showed that dmre closely correlated with post anthesis dm accumulation r 0 51 p 0 01 table 9 si at anthesis and grain filling stages by providing moisture to the plant increased dm accumulation after anthesis resulting in a decrease in dmre previous research demonstrated that under drought stress dmr contribution to grain increased van herwaarden et al 1998 zhang et al 2019 our results indicated that total dmr contribution to grain under rainfed 76 79 and once si 74 69 conditions were higher than other irrigation treatments crop components leaf stem and ear dmr contribution to grain under three si i3 was lower than other irrigation treatments table 7 papakosta and gagianas 1991 estimated the share of ear straw reserves in yield from 2 to 16 and the share of stems before flowering from zero to 57 researchers have reported the contribution of stem reserves in grain yield from about 3 under optimal conditions to about 73 under stress conditions papakosta and gagianas 1991 schnyder 1993 in this study on average stem dmr contributed to grain 50 36 higher than leaf 13 76 and ear 6 75 table 7 as the results showed the contribution of pre anthesis dmr to grain from maximum to minimum was stem leaf and ear which was consistent with the observations of zhang et al 2014 in general the contribution of pre anthesis resources in grain yield was higher in sardari and azar2 cultivars which had lower grain yields than other cultivars tables 7 and 8 we found a negative association between grain yield and total dmr contribution to grain r 0 57 p 0 01 table 9 n utilization eﬃciency nutile is the determination of the

processes such as the amount of n uptake and utilization by the plant si provides the moisture needed to uptake n and continues photosynthetic activity at the grain filling stage ultimately increasing grain yield per unit of n consumed and improving nue our results indicated nhi in 2015 2016 higher than the 2016 2017 growing season which may be due to more rainfall in the first growing season table

drought stress in the terminal stages of rainfed wheat growth in the mediterranean due to inadequate rainfall distribution causes a decline in yield in this crop in such conditions supplemental irrigation si at critical growth stages improves yield by maintaining soil moisture in this study we determined the effect of si at booting anthesis and grain filling stages on dry matter dm accumulation and remobilization n utilization and grain protein concentration gpc in five wheat cultivars during two growing seasons our results indicated si treatments enhanced grain yield

9633,supplemental irrigation si is the primary strategy to reduce the adverse effects of drought stress on rainfed wheat growth and grain yield in the mediterranean region the study aimed to evaluate

during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 wheat growing seasons the average higher precipitation in the first growing seasons increased the dm accumulation in vegetative organs grain yield and n use

yield n utilization eﬃciency nutile n harvest index nhi nue and grain protein concentration gpc in wheat cultivars was assessed results showed that overall si increased dm accumulation at anthesis and post anthesis dmr grain yield nutile and nue in cultivars si at anthesis and grain filling stages decreased dmre nhi and gpc the difference between cultivars was evident in studied traits and in general the sirwan cultivar had more dm accumulation at anthesis and post anthesis and eventually higher grain yield than other cultivars si reduced the dependence of the plant on dmr for grain

rainfed wheat growth oweis and hachum 2006 under such conditions supplemental irrigation si is a highly efficient practice to reduce the adverse effects of drought stress and improve yield si applies limited amounts of water during critical crop growth stages when rainfall cannot provide enough moisture to ensure plant growth oweis and hachum 2006 2009 drought stress during anthesis and grain filling stages induces pollen sterility decreases kernels number induces early senescence reduced photosynthesis shortened grain filling period decreased grain weight and eventually reduced grain yield farooq et al 2014 carbon metabolism is one of the most sensitive physiological processes to environmental stresses in plants and determines plants growth yield and grain quality two sources support grain growth during the grain filling stage in wheat 1 current photosynthesis 2 remobilization of photo assimilates stored in the stem and other parts of the plant gebbing et al 1999 zhang et al 2019 the importance of each source of grain filling varies among genotypes and depends on the environmental conditions during the grain filling period blum 1998 therefore the photo assimilates reserves in the vegetative parts before anthesis can play a buffering role and reduce the adverse environmental effects during grain filling on final grain yield schnyder 1993 masoni et al 2007 ma et al 2015 liu et al 2020 under drought conditions remobilization of pre stored photo assimilates in the wheat mainly stem reserves to grain has a significant contribution to yield the stem is an essential source of carbon for grain filling which under adequate moisture conditions its contribution in grain yield reaches 20 under terminal drought stress conditions the share of dry matter transfer of stem to grain can get more than 50 aggarwal and sinha 1984 schnyder 1993 overall under dry ﬁeld conditions carbohydrate source retransfers for grain filling can contribute to about 75 100 grain yield compared with 37 39 under high precipitation conditions van herwaarden et al 1998 although drought stress after the flowering stage increased the contributions of pre anthesis

precipitation in the mediterranean regions during the growing season of rainfed wheat leads to drought stress shortage of soil moisture occurs chiefly during the most acute stages anthesis and grain filling negatively affecting growth and consequently reducing supplemental irrigation si at critical stages of wheat growth can increase the rate of photosynthesis dry matter dm production increase remobilization and ultimately higher crop yield compared to non irrigated conditions wang et al 2013 meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 dm accumulation above ground is an important indicator of plant growth biomass production and grain yield are negatively affected by drought stress si et al 2020 dm accumulated in vegetative organs by wheat plants until the anthesis stage is critical under mediterranean conditions because grain yield largely depends on remobilization of pre anthesis dm to grain papakosta and gagianas 1991 our results indicated that dm of crop components at anthesis leaf stem ear and maturity leaf stem ear and grain and post anthesis dm accumulation in plants during 2015 2016 was higher than the 2016 2017 growing season table 5 and fig 2 which might be associated with more precipitation in the first growing season table 2 besides si caused enhanced dm in different plant parts at both stages anthesis and grain filling than rainfed conditions table 5 and fig 1 when crops were irrigated twice i2 si at booting and anthesis stages and three times i3 si at booting anthesis and grain filling stages increased post anthesis dm accumulation by 55 56 and 108 08 compared to no irrigation condition treatment respectively table 5 si in different stages booting anthesis and grain filling by providing the required moisture of the plant caused the preservation of stay green and continued photosynthetic activity and finally the accumulation of more dm in these conditions correlation analysis showed that dm accumulation at anthesis and post anthesis dm accumulation were closely correlated with grain yield table 9 papakosta and gagianas 1991 conducted a genetic difference between wheat cultivars in dm accumulation in different organs in general dry matter accumulation in various organs in sirwan cultivar in flowering and maturity stages was higher than in other cultivars in three si treatments grain weight in sirwan cultivars increased by 48 12 than in rainfed conditions demonstrating that sirwan cultivar showed the highest response to si among cultivars fig 1 and table 5 grain growth during the grain filling stage depends on current photosynthesis and translocation of pre anthesis assimilates stored in vegetative organs to grain meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in general drought stress at the end of the growing season induces earlier leaf senescence the re transfer of pre anthesis stored assimilates in the vegetative parts to the grain is done earlier and the efficiency of re transfer in these conditions is higher than soil moisture adequate wang et al 2013 farooq et al 2014 although the remobilized dm was higher under si conditions in the present study the dmre in rainfed conditions and once irrigation in the booting stage was higher than other irrigation treatments table 6 and figs 4 and 7 blum 1998 under drought stress reserves decrease due to reduced photosynthesis so the total remobilization is less than irrigation conditions previous studies showed that dmr and dmre in various cultivars depending on environmental conditions are different masoni et al 2007 ma et al 2015 meng et al 2017 in the current study there was a difference among cultivars in dmr and dmre except leaf dmre table 6 the lowest total dmr and dmre were observed in sardari cultivar under three si i3 conditions fig 3b and fig 7b in general the average dmr of the stem 0 476 g plant 1 was higher than the leaves 0 129 g plant 1 and ear 0 063 g plant 1 however leaf dmre 41 77 higher than stem 38 07 and ear dmre 17 45 table 6 the relationship between grain yield and total dmr was positive whereas the relationship between grain yield and dmre negatively significant correlation analysis also showed that dmre closely correlated with post anthesis dm accumulation r 0 51 p 0 01 table 9 si at anthesis and grain filling stages by providing moisture to the plant increased dm accumulation after anthesis resulting in a decrease in dmre previous research demonstrated that under drought stress dmr contribution to grain increased van herwaarden et al 1998 zhang et al 2019 our results indicated that total dmr contribution to grain under rainfed 76 79 and once si 74 69 conditions were higher than other irrigation treatments crop components leaf stem and ear dmr contribution to grain under three si i3 was lower than other irrigation treatments table 7 papakosta and gagianas 1991 estimated the share of ear straw reserves in yield from 2 to 16 and the share of stems before flowering from zero to 57 researchers have reported the contribution of stem reserves in grain yield from about 3 under optimal conditions to about 73 under stress conditions papakosta and gagianas 1991 schnyder 1993 in this study on average stem dmr contributed to grain 50 36 higher than leaf 13 76 and ear 6 75 table 7 as the results showed the contribution of pre anthesis dmr to grain from maximum to minimum was stem leaf and ear which was consistent with the observations of zhang et al 2014 in general the contribution of pre anthesis resources in grain yield was higher in sardari and azar2 cultivars which had lower grain yields than other cultivars tables 7 and 8 we found a negative association between grain yield and total dmr contribution to grain r 0 57 p 0 01 table 9 n utilization eﬃciency nutile is the determination of the

studies showed a decrease in nutile and nue under drought stress conditions whereas nhi under water shortage increases fan and li 2001 lupini et al 2020 in this study nutile and nue in plants under three times si were higher than other irrigation treatments as well as highest nutile and nue were observed in sirwan under three si table 8 and fig 10 nue is a complex trait that involves a set of processes such as the amount of n uptake and utilization by the plant si provides the moisture needed to uptake n and continues photosynthetic activity at the grain filling stage ultimately increasing grain yield per unit of n consumed and improving nue our results indicated nhi in 2015 2016 higher than the 2016 2017 growing season which may be due to more rainfall in the first growing season table

2016 nehe et al 2020 grain protein concentration in sardari and azar2 cultivars were higher than other cultivars while the lowest grain yield was observed in these cultivars table 8 5 conclusion drought stress in the terminal stages of rainfed wheat growth in the mediterranean due to inadequate rainfall distribution causes a decline in yield in this crop in such conditions supplemental irrigation si at critical growth stages improves yield by maintaining soil moisture in this study we determined the effect of si at booting anthesis and grain filling stages on dry matter dm accumulation and remobilization n utilization and grain protein concentration gpc in five wheat cultivars during two growing seasons our results indicated si treatments enhanced grain yield significantly through increased dm accumulation at anthesis and post anthesis and dm remobilization from vegetative organs to grain overall si improved n utilization eﬃciency and n use efficiency whereas decreased dm remobilization efficiency dm remobilization contribution to grain and gpc variation was observed among the cultivars in terms of the studied traits on average the amount of dm accumulation during pre anthesis and post anthesis the amount of dm remobilization and dm grain yield in the sirwan cultivar was higher than other cultivars more studies are required to assess si in

9634,the changes taking place in the marine coastal zones are extremely important as about 40 of the human population currently lives in the coastal areas within 100 kilometres of the coastline increasing anthropogenic pressure on the marine ecosystems agriculture is a significant source of nutrients to the marine environment that increase hypoxia eutrophication and may pose a threat to the services provided by ecosystems in particular surface water and submarine groundwater discharge sgd are dominant pathways of nutrient loads the main aim of this study is to present the capabilities and results of an innovative and complex toolkit that enables researchers to identify the sources of nutrient and pesticide pollution calculate their flux via rivers and sgd and directly assess the influence of pesticides and nutrient flux on the coastal ecosystem we combined the in situ sampling of surface water groundwater soil sgd and seawater with a model study to create a set of tools for assessing the influence of agriculture on the marine environment the maximum concentrations of nitrates and phosphates were measured in the drainage ditches and were equal to 15 5 mg n no 3 l 1 and 7 7 mg p po 4 3 l 1 respectively the nutrients concentrations varied from 0 1 to 12 9 mg n no 3 l 1 and from 0 0 to 0 5 mg p po 4 3 l 1 in all freshwater samples in contrast the lowest concentrations were observed in seawater with maximum levels of 0 8 mg n no 3 l 1 and 0 1 mg p po 4 3 l 1 respectively the collected data were used to establish an innovative and interdisciplinary online toolkit in which surface run off was modelled with soil and water assessment tool swat groundwater flow with modflow and marine waters using the ecopuckbay model additionally the tool includes two interactive calculators for calculation of the nutrient balance and nitrogen leaching for single fields on farms graphical abstract ga1 keywords coastal management agriculture water quality nutrients pesticides 1 introduction marine coastal areas are the most productive areas in the world and therefore are extensively and increasingly used for numerous activities in addition about 40 of the human population currently lives in coastal areas that further increase the anthropogenic pressure and enhance climate change anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and farming result in freshwater groundwater and surface water pollution with many chemical substances mainly nutrients but also others such as pesticides the interaction of groundwater and surface water is a complex process as contaminated aquifers that discharge into ditches and streams can cause long term contamination of surface water conversely streams can be a major source of contamination to aquifers surface water usually is hydraulically coupled to groundwater but the connections are difficult to observe and quantify therefore commonly have been ignored in water management considerations and policies enhanced nutrient inputs from land are the main drivers for coastal eutrophication and hypoxia therefore proper understanding of the sources of the pollution the processes changing their concentrations on the way to the sea and their impact on the functioning of the marine ecosystem are of the highest importance the baltic sea similarly to many inland seas is an example of the marine environment being under high anthropogenic pressures the baltic sea is one of the most polluted seas in the world due to its geographical and oceanographical characteristics its water residence time accounts for 20 25 years and additionally baltic sea is surrounded by agriculture areas of highly industrialised countries as a result nutrients loads mainly nitrogen and phosphorous to the baltic sea are high increased nutrients load to the baltic sea results in a declining environmental status of the sea with widespread eutrophication gustafsson et al 2012 eutrophication together with physical factors particularly the frequency and intensity of inflow of saltier water markus meier 2007 reissmann et al 2009 causes hypoxia österblom et al 2007 zillén and conley 2010 helsinki commission 2018 usually defined as oxygen concentrations less than 2 mg l 1 at least 97 per cent of the region was assessed as eutrophicated in 2011 2016 according to the integrated status assessment while large areas in the baltic sea suffer from low hypoxic conditions the occurrence of both eutrophication and hypoxia significantly affect the aquatic life and nutrient cycling carstensen et al 2014 despite the considerable decrease of total nitrogen and phosphorous loads from anthropogenic sources in the last 20 years eutrophication of the baltic sea still remains one of the major concerns baltic sea hydrographic commission 2013 the baltic marine environment protection commission which is also known as the helsinki commission helcom 2021 is an intergovernmental organisation that gives a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem health of the entire regional sea these major assessments assist the region s environmental managers and decision makers so that they can base their work on sound up to date knowledge of the status of the sea helcom is also responsible for providing the programme to restore the good ecological status of the baltic marine environment called baltic sea action plan bsap 2021 bsap incorporates the latest scientific knowledge and innovative management approaches into strategic policy implementation and stimulates goal oriented multilateral cooperation around the baltic sea region in order to fulfil the goals of bsap innovative approaches for environmental management are necessary although there have been many projects conducting the subject of nutrients loads from agriculture there is still a lack of comprehensive studies merging the land and ocean based investigations the baltic sea is just an example of the marine environment lacking tools for proper coastal ocean management many earlier studies used soil and water assessment tool swat to evaluate watershed scale hydrological cycle and the associated transport of nutrients and pesticides neitsch et al 2011 applications related to the baltic sea watershed include among others piniewski et al 2014 2017 thodsen et al 2017 trolle et al 2019 however swat uses a simplified representation of groundwater flow which does not allow quantifying the direct groundwater discharge to the sea submarine groundwater discharge sgd and for this and other reasons may be insufficient for complex post glacial multi aquifer systems occurring e g on the polish baltic coast in order to overcome the limitations of groundwater modelling several authors used swat in combination with dedicated groundwater flow and transport models usually based on the modflow mt3d family of computer programs harbaugh 2005 zheng and wang 1999 application of swat modflow coupled models is described e g in pulido velazquez et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 ehtiat et al 2018 however only few of such studies focus on coastal zone and sgd quantification galbiati et al 2006 estimates nutrient load discharged to an adriatic coastal lagoon with the use of swat modflow mt3d and a stream water quality model in the work of welch et al 2019 the recharge estimates obtained from swat were fed to the modflow mt3d groundwater model to estimate sgd on one of the samoan islands coupling of land and sea eco hydrological models to represent water and nutrient cycling in the coastal zone has rarely been undertaken too trolle et al 2019 applied mike she and swat models to estimate nutrient loads to odense fiord on the danish coast under different climate change scenarios the resulting evolution of ecological state indicators in seawater was calculated with empirical models usually scientists evaluate anthropogenic pressure by characterizing the flux of contaminants using separate models such as swat for surface run off modflow for groundwater flow and 3d models for presenting complex processes in the marine environment being under contaminants discharge neitsch et al 2011 ehtiat et al 2018 adu and kumarasamy 2018 torres bejarano et al 2013 dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2018 as far as the authors are concerned up to date there is only one attempt to couple environment observations together with different models in the way that is similar to our approach that is kimberley marine research program kmrp by the western australian marine science institution however kmrp has not developed an online tool and therefore we cannot compare with their solution this was the main motivation for developing the waterpuck project which is an interdisciplinary and innovative approach integrating knowledge of different disciplines into the implementation of the environmental protection policy sustainable growth and improvement of the competitiveness of the polish economy dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2018 dzierzbicka glowacka 2019 in this project different components and methods such as retrospective analyses of existing monitoring data sets in situ measures and the application of various models were used to estimate main mechanisms and threats responsible for the pollution transport from the agricultural holdings and land use structure to the surface and groundwater and potential predictability of environment change of the baltic sea coastal area the main aim of this study is to present the capabilities and results of the waterpuck online toolkit waterpuck is an innovative and complex toolkit that enables researchers to identify the sources of nutrient and pesticide pollution understand the main mechanisms responsible for the transport of these pollutants in surface and groundwater calculate their flux via rivers and sgd and directly assess the influence of pesticides and nutrient flux on the bay of puck ecosystem including the creation of scenarios projecting the effects of changes in land use on chemical loads from the puck commune that are transported via surface and groundwater to the bay of puck additionally within the service we present the way the different environmental data such as in situ measures and model outcomes can be operated the paper focuses on the description of the full modelling framework detailed presentation of some components can be found in earlier publications from our group dzierzbicka glowacka 2019 dybowski et al 2019 2020a 2020b szymkiewicz et al 2020 kalinowska et al 2020 wielgat et al 2021 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptual scheme of the solution the method of modelling the impact of farms and land use structure on the quality of land surface water and groundwater and coastal waters was developed and verified as part of the waterpuck project the service is a set of computer models interconnected with each other operating continuously forced with meteorological data and combines four main modules fig 1 1 agricultural holdings survey system and two calculators for farms as interactive applications 2 land water a comprehensive model of surface water run off based on swat model and a numerical model of groundwater flow based on modflow which we named groundpuck 3 coastal water a three dimensional numerical model of coastal ecosystem consisting of a hydrodynamic and biochemical part with a nutrient spread module based on community earth system model cesm 4 marine water a three dimensional numerical model of the marine ecosystem providing boundary condition to coastal water module a schematic flowchart of the modelling system is presented in fig 2 we coupled the ecopuckbay model from the land side with two models swat surface water and groundpuck groundwater information about the water volume discharged by rivers is being provided by the hydrological model swat that has been implemented as one of the waterpuck project s stages kalinowska et al 2020 the swat model includes the preparation of the innovative and complex hydrological model coupled with the nutrient concentration module including meteorological data precipitation wind temperature and atmospheric pressure the transformation of precipitation data into surface run off have been achieved with the scs soil conservation service curve number procedure through the accumulated run off volume and the time of concentration the time from the beginning of a rainfall event until the entire subbasin area contributes to flow at the outlet kalinowska et al 2020 a numerical transport model based on the modflow code groundpuck allows determining the nitrate load in the groundwater flowing into the bay of puck the mt3dms numerical code was applied to solve the advection reaction dispersion equation zheng and wang 1999 transient calculations were performed with the third order total variational diminishing tvd numerical method for the advective term while for the steady state solution the standard finite difference discretization was applied this model was calibrated based on actual no 3 concentration values and was joined with the ecopuckbay model through a coupling module the results of the 3d ecopuckbay model are limited to the area of the bay of puck however the entire model grid covers a wider area dybowski et al 2020b this is to ensure that boundary conditions are properly simulated along the line of the northern border of the 3d ecopuckbay model data from the 2 3 km three dimensional coupled ecosystem model of the baltic sea 3d cembs prediction model are transferred to the ecopuckbay model results from 3d cembs dzierzbicka głowacka 2013a 2013b are used to provide forcing fields in the ecopuckbay model through sequential information transfer the mechanism of this module is to interpolate values from 3d cembs to ecopuckbay model s grids 2 2 study area and database the entire tool has been designed and assembled regardless of geographical location this means that the application of methods developed within the described solution is possible after calibration to a specific region in any coastal area however the area of the puck commune and the bay of puck fig 3 was chosen to test and verify the developed methods the study area is located in northern poland on the southern coast of the baltic sea it includes the bay of puck drainage basin located in the puck commune with an area of 176 km2 the puck commune is of agricultural character its area is 57 3 covered by utilised agricultural area uaa the vast majority of which is characterised by high yield potential witek 1994 igras and pastuszak 2009 the remaining area of the municipality is covered by forests and areas classified as forest 33 7 roads and areas under buildings 7 1 as well as waterlogged land and unused land 1 9 among the agricultural lands the largest area is occupied by arable land 77 of uaa followed by grassland about 20 5 of uaa arable land al is mainly used to grow cereals such as rye winter wheat spring wheat spring barley oat winter triticale cereal mixture their sowing area occupies more than 2 3 of the al other major crops include ground vegetables rape potatoes and maize for green fodder agricultural activity in the puck commune apart from crop production also includes milk and pig production the average livestock density in the municipality is less than 0 5 livestock unit per 1 ha of uaa the puck commune area represents a typical young postglacial landscape with relatively high relief from 0 5 to 113 5 m above sea level it consists of isolated fragments of the moraine plateau separated from each other by deeply cut ice marginal valleys the whole area is covered with quaternary deposits the quaternary deposits consist of moraine glacial till with sand and gravel layers and glacifluvial or river sand and silty sand in the valleys the dominant soil types are sandy loam glacial till sandy loam covered by loamy sand weathered glacial till sand of glacifluvial origin and peat in larger river valleys the thickness of the sediment ranges from 40 m in the east to 95 100 m in the west such a significant difference is probably a result of a diversified land surface or large range in altitude of the top of older layers jereczek korzeniewska and jegliński 2011 groundwater forms a complex system with several aquifer units fig 4 shallow groundwater occurs in small perched aquifers and in sand lenses enclosed in moraine deposits fig 4 these aquifers do not play an important role in water supply but they are exploited locally by farms and summer houses two deeper quaternary aquifers span most of the area the upper inter moraine aquifer q1 and the lower sub moraine aquifer q2 they were formed in glacifluvial deposits sand and gravel separated by a layer of moraine till these two large aquifers are hydraulically connected shallow groundwater is recharged by the infiltration of rainwater deeper aquifers are influenced by inflow from the west and take the seepage water from the layers above the entire hydrosystem is drained mainly by the baltic sea bay of puck either directly via sgd or indirectly via streams and rivers aquifers q1 and q2 are the main source of water supply in the region szymkiewicz et al 2020 there are seven streams flowing through the area of puck commune reda river zagórksa struga mrzezino canal gizdepka bładzikowski stream and płutnica river together with its inflow darżlubie stream the streams discharge directly to the bay of puck all stream catchments are covered with a dense hydrographic network drainage ditches canals as well as tiles serving regulation of water level for agriculture average concentrations of nutrients in the analysed streams flowing through the puck commune area zagórska struga reda mrzezino canal gizdepka bładzikowski stream płutnica and darżlubie stream generally fulfilled the requirements for the i or the ii class of quality according to the regulation of the ministry of marine management and inland navigation of 11th october 2019 concerning classification of ecological status of surface waters and environmental quality classes for priority pollutants dz u 2019 poz 2149 the worst quality status was observed in the case of bładzikowski stream and gizdepka which flow through intensively used agricultural terrain the episodes with elevated nutrients concentrations especially during summer months the catchment of bładzikowski stream is characterized by predominating agricultural land use with almost 90 share of agricultural land in the total land area the relationship between n surplus in the agricultural farms in the bładzikowski stream catchment and the elevated concentrations of total nitrogen was proved wojciechowska et al 2019b also for płutnica river and its tributary darżlubie stream the incidental situations when nutrient concentrations exceeded the requirements of the ii class were observed mostly in summer months or after intensive rainfalls on the other hand reda river and zagórska struga were characterized by very good status regarding nutrient concentrations average flows in the analysed watercourses are gizdepka 0 178 m3s 1 bładzikowski stream 0 035 m3s 1 płutnica river 0 718 m3s 1 bogdanowicz and cysewski 2008 water quality in individual rivers varies depending on the season vegetation intensity and stage of agricultural practices wojciechowska et al 2019a despite intensive agriculture in the catchment area soils are characterised by low ph this results in the conversion of phosphate fertilisers into insoluble compounds unavailable to plants and forces the use of increased doses of nitrogen fertilisers the climate of this region is temperate maritime in the period 2011 2020 the annual average temperature was about 7 5 c and the average annual precipitation was 712 mm the highest precipitation during summer wielgat et al 2021 the southern part of the baltic sea enclosing the puck commune is a popular tourist region that is also heavily influenced by an anthropogenic activity of local residents and farming this makes the bay of puck a natural reservoir for waste deposition of fertilisers and other inputs delivered through the soil groundwater rivers or direct deposition this region is massively shaped and influenced by several factors that can pressure the state of physical and biochemical parameters one of the most important factors influencing the region s unique ecosystem is topography the average depth of the gulf of gdańsk is about 50 m with a maximum depth gdańsk deep of 118 m from the northeast it is surrounded by hel peninsula which serves as a natural barrier for mixing with the open waters of the baltic sea keeping the salinity ranging mostly within the range of 7 8 with a deviation of around 1 bay of puck is also heavily influenced by the river discharge from land resulting in lowered salinity especially in the coastal surface waters the largest river in the region is the vistula discharging an average of over 1000 m3s 1 of freshwater water temperature in the region ranges from over 20 c at the surface during summer with the maximum usually in august to around 2 c in february water stratification is frequent during the warmer months leading to the occurrence of seasonal thermoclines during winter thermocline declines and the water becomes well mixed dybowski et al 2020b the ecosystem of the bay of puck especially its inner part called puck lagoon due to the geomorphological separation from the rest of the bay marked with a dashed line in fig 3 is very prone to degradation from land based pollution the area of the bay of puck is equal to 356 km2 and maximal depth is 55 m the exchange of water between puck lagoon and outer bay of puck is very limited and therefore any contaminants getting directly into puck lagoon with watercourses from the puck commune pose a real threat to which special attention should be paid this applies especially to agriculture which is a dominant land use type in the puck commune 2 2 1 the ph of the soils and abundance of arable land in macro nutrients in the spring of 2018 soil samples from 61 agricultural plots on 22 farms with a total area of 171 05 ha were taken based on the guidelines included in the polish standard pn r 04031 1997 ph measurement of soil was conducted in suspension of 1 mol kcl l 1 solution by the potentiometric method

commune was composed of 9 parts with total of 64 questions entitled as follows 1 identification of the farm and farmer 2 farm type 3 crops 4 breeding 5 storage of natural fertilisers 6 fertilisation management 7 plant protection products 8 purchased sold and used products 9 comments and remarks the survey was carried out on a representative group of 31 farms with a diversified agricultural production profile and its aim was to determine in detail how farmers in puck commune manage their farms the questionnaires were conducted using a specially prepared online form which significantly improved the subsequent post processing and data analysis in the next step which was at the same time an element of research and resulted as a support tool for farmers we developed two interactive calculators to help farmers determine the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk balance on the farm called calcgospuck and the amount of nitrogen leaching from the field called calcnpuck the calculators were designed to directly use the data from the farmers surveys detailed information on the at the farm gate method and the leaching of n from the individual field have been described in detail in the following papers dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2019 and dybowski et al 2020a 2 3 2 swat surface run off model the swat model is a tool for complex agricultural catchment area analysis based on weather and spatial data such as digital elevation model land use and soil maps swat model calculates the hydrological response of the basin and water balance additionally based on information about plants method of cultivation doses and types of fertilisers and pesticides it calculates yields as well as water and soil chemical quality depending on meteorological information sources this model can be used for real time calculations forecasting or simulation of archival events the swat model in our configuration uses data from the institute of meteorology and water management station

neogene clay and silt 2 3 4 ecopuckbay ecosystem model of the coastal environment the marine environment specifically the coastal zone is represented by an ecohydrodynamic model of the bay of puck called ecopuckbay epb the epb is a high resolution three dimensional model that originates from the community earth system model cesm 2021 developed by national center for atmospheric research ncar the epb s ecosystem part is based on the nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd approach moore et al 2001 the model predicts nutrient distributions n si and p three phytoplankton functional types diatoms picophytoplankton nanophytoplankton and diazotrophs nitrogen fixing organisms chlorophyll a as separate variables zooplankton pelagic detritus dissolved oxygen and pesticides glyphosate diflufenican metazachlor chlorpyrifos and antrachinon sources of nutrients include atmospheric deposition and sedimentary sources sinking particles can be associated with ballast and the presence of ballast changes the remineralization length scale assumed for the model many though not all models can be cast in a general form as a coupled set of time dependent advection diffusion reaction equations dybowski et al 2020b 2 4 boundary conditions calibration and validation 2 4 1 swat the swat model was required to provide data on water balance water quality and infiltration dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2018 2019 due to the lack of sufficient data on water flows and water levels in watercourses it was decided to perform calibration using the manual trial and error procedure szymkiewicz et al 2020 the method of calibration was chosen not only because of the small amount and short time series of measurement data it also results from the purpose of the model it was created as part of the larger project the combination of the 3 models dependent on the same variable daily rainfall was a challenge from the point of view of calibration because each of the models processes the same parameters in a slightly different way the authors wanted to maintain consistency in defining the study area parameters of the basin soil watercourses etc thus it was necessary to calibrate 3 completely different models simultaneously additionally some of the calibrated parameters or their ranges were limited in this situation the simplest solution seemed to be to perform manual trial and error calibration meteorological data from 2000 to 2009 were used for the calibration the criteria for calibration and validation represented the components of hydrological budget and biomass for which reliable estimates were reported in earlier studies references available in szymkiewicz et al 2020 wielgat et al 2021 kalinowska et al 2020 specifically we aimed to obtain the average annual groundwater recharge in the range between 3 and 30 of the average annual precipitation depending on soil type and land use duda et al 2013 jaworska szulc 2015 moreover the average annual evaporation calculated by swat was required to be in the range 450 495 mm as measured for a location in poland with very similar climate and land use conditions czyżyk and steinhoff wrześniewska 2017 as the third calibration goal we used the average annual production of biomass in pine forests orzeł et al 2006 in the calibration process we modified i scs curve numbers which describe the partitioning between runoff and infiltration their values were increased to the range 80 94 ii maximum water storage in canopy canmx increased in forests from 0 to 2 mm iii fraction of water in the shallow aquifer returning to the root zone revap increased in forests from 0 to 0 06 and iv parameters describing growth of pine trees blai 4 50 frgrw1 0 01 laimx1 0 01 frgrw2 0 10 alai min 2 99 for a detailed description of these parameters see arnold et al 2011 validation of swat model was performed by comparing the observed and calculated average daily outflow from the gizdepka river marked in fig 5 the gizdepka river was chosen because it flows through all the land use types existing in the analysed basin especially through agricultural land used in different ways to validate the model monitoring in the years 2018 2019 was used the monitoring consisted of a water level measurement station then the water level was converted into the flow rate using a rating curve based on measurements carried out in the years 2017 2019 we used the following measures defined in appendix a to verify the model mean error me mean square error mse and root mean square error rmse additional validation criteria included the weight of the yield of the major crops in the area winter wheat rape canola and silage corn and hay production on grassland model predictions for the period 2000 2009 were compared to data obtained from local farmers szymkiewicz et al 2020 average crop yields from questionnaires conducted among farmers with crops in the study catchment were used as reference values dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2019 based on information from farmers and agricultural advisors we assumed that the fraction of dry mass in yield is 85 for winter wheat 90 for rape canola 35 for silage corn and 85 for hay dried 2 4 2 groundpuck the sea boundary was represented by a constant head boundary in the q1 aquifer direct hydraulic contact with water in the bay of puck and by a general head boundary ghb third type in the q2 aquifer which represented the outflow through a distant outcrop at the sea bottom the discharge zones are situated in the bottom of the bay of puck at a distance of 2 3 km from the coast the ghb boundary was also used to simulate the lateral flow across the land part of the boundary in q1 q2 and those perched aquifers q0 which were intersected by the model boundary wells were assumed to be constantly in operation and the pumping rates were identified based on the available reports from groundwater administration rivers were represented by the third type boundary conditions river package the results obtained from swat were processed by scripts written in the python language using the flopy library bakker et al 2016 in order to set the recharge values in the modflow model in steady state simulations we used the average values for each hru from the period of 2000 2009 for transient simulations monthly averages were calculated for each hru from swat daily results we followed the approach described by bailey et al 2016 to transfer hru based swat results to the grid based modflow input calibration of the groundwater flow model was based on the steady state solution representing the average conditions in the period of 2000 2009 we used groundwater head measurements from 95 points in the area as shown in fig 6 to estimate model accuracy we made calculation using standard measures such as mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse that we described in detail in the appendix a based on the groundwater flow model developed in modflow a simulation of n no 3 transport was carried out mt3dms numerical code was applied to solve the advection reaction dispersion equation transient calculations were performed with the third order total variational diminishing tvd numerical method for the advective term while for steady state solution the standard finite difference discretization was applied denitrification of nitrates was described with the first order kinetic reaction we used a constant reaction rate of biodegradation equal to 1 10 5 h 1 which was established by model calibration in the model we considered only diffuse sources of nitrates concentrations of n no 3 in water reaching the groundwater table were calculated from the results of swat simulation for the years of 2000 2009 for each hru as in the case of groundwater recharge the transfer of hru based swat data to grid based mt3dms data was carried out with the aid of python scripts making use of the flopy library the model of nitrate nitrogen transport was calibrated manually by adjusting the reaction rate in order to obtain a satisfactory agreement between range of the calculated n no 3 concentrations and the results of chemical analysis of the 60 samples taken from the aquifers calibration was based on a steady state flow and transport simulation using average values of recharge and n no 3 loads from the period 2000 2009 and the current land use and agricultural practices the land side pesticide propagation was modelled only in the swat surface run off but not in the modflow groundwater flow 2 4 3 ecopuckbay from the land side the ecopuckbay model is coupled with swat surface run off and modflow groundwater flow while from the open sea side forcing data from the 3d cembs dzierzbicka głowacka 2013a 2013b nowicki et al 2019 after the previous interpolation is delivered to the domain s borders the epb model has been validated and runs in operational mode producing a 60 h forecast for physicochemical conditions of the bay of puck s environment dybowski et al 2019 2020b we used the following standard measures described in detail in the appendix a to test the quality of the ecopuckbay model pearson s correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse standard deviation std and mean error me to evaluate ecopuckbay model we used several sources of in situ samples that includes measurements taken throughout the monitoring activities of the voivodship inspector of environmental protection viep in gdańsk and vertical profiles of temperature and salinity recorded in 2018 during one of the measurement campaigns of the s y oceania along the southern baltic coast fig 5 in addition we compared our results with the numerical data of hydrodynamic and biochemical parameters calculated with the ice ocean model nemo nordic nucleus for european modelling of the ocean coupled with the biogeochemical model scobi swedish coastal and ocean biogeochemical model acquired from the marine copernicus database the most commonly used pesticides in the studied area which are glyphosate diflufenican metazachlor chlorpyrifos and antrachinon are modelled in the ecopuckbay model 3 results 3 1 environmental studies the set of environmental measurement data was divided into two parts one part of the data was used as a set forcing numerical models directly but also for parameterization calibration the second part of the environmental data was used to verify and test the correctness of the developed methods implemented in numerical models 3 1 1 the ph of the soils and abundance of arable land in macro nutrients based on the results of the granulometric composition the analysed mineral soils were classified taking into account fraction content below 0 02 mm into agronomic categories of very light up to 10 of fraction content below 0 02 mm light 11 20 medium 21 35 and heavy 35 soil acidification was assessed according to the accepted standards and soils were also categorised by their reaction classes as very acidic measured ph was 4 5 acidic 4 5 5 5 slightly acidic 5 5 6 5 neutral 6 5 7 2 and alkaline 7 2 the studied soils in the 0 30 cm layer had a ph in the range of 4 2 7 2 average 5 4 the content of available p for plants in the 0 30 cm layer of studied soils ranged from 3 6 to 66 5 mg per kg 1 average 33 3 mg per kg 1 in mineral soils and from 171 0 to 707 0 mg phcl kg 1 average 340 6 phcl kg 1 in organic soils pietrzak et al 2020 the mineral soils were characterised by a good abundance of exchangeable potassium ions from 0 604 to 2 15 mg k kg 1 on average 1 19 mg k kg 1 over 96 of soil samples had at least an average or higher level of potassium content all organic soils were characterised by very low content of exchangeable potassium ions the content of exchangeable magnesium ions in mineral soils ranged from 0 305 to 1 92 mg mg kg 1 average 0 96 mg mg kg 1 and was high and very high in 92 of soil samples while the organic soils of the studied area in terms of exchangeable magnesium ions content were classified as low and very low at level 0 994 5 14 mg mg kg 1 average 2 04 mg mg kg 1 3 1 2 nutrients in stream water the concentrations of nutrients and chemical oxygen demand cod measured during the study period are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively the tn concentrations ranged from 0 50 mg n l 1 to 13 10 mg n l 1 the highest concentrations were measured in bładzikowski stream general observation for bładzikowski stream mrzezino canal gizdepka river płutnica river and reda river in and out showed lower tn concentrations in the summer and autumn months followed by a substantial increase in winter and spring from january to april or may exceeding the limits of first class or even second class according to polish standards regulation of the ministry of marine development and inland shipping the second class limits for tn occurred first of all in bładzikowski stream but also in gizdepka and on some occasions in płutnica river in comparison to two main rivers in poland vistula and oder the mean concentrations reported by pastuszak et al 2018 were in 2016 2 3 and 3 3 mg n l 1 respectively regarding many european countries the tn concentration of 3 6 mg n l 1 was normally noted in high proportion while in catchments intensively used for agricultural purposes the concentration over 5 6 mg n l 1 was frequently observed european environment agency 2018 on the other hand concentrations below 0 8 mg n l 1 are characteristic of unaffected rivers scandinavian rivers stålnacke et al 1999 analysis of n species shows that in the case of bładzikowski stream and gizdepka with catchments intensively used by agriculture n no 3 constituted the most abundant nitrogen species which indicates the input of surface run off from fertilised fields the adverse trend with a higher share of n nh 4 was observed in the case of płutnica river and its inflow darżlubie stream similar tendency was observed by baczkowska et al 2021 in karwianka river located in approx 20 km distance from the investigated area which was justified by discharges of untreated wastewater this could be explained by some manure spills domestic wastewater discharge or by the discharge of fish processing industrial plant located in this catchment which are frequently considered as a sources in polish rivers preisner et al 2021 the impact of an industrial plant can also explain the higher cod concentrations in płutnica river and darżlubie sream in comparison to other watercourses the lowest n concentrations were observed in zagórska struga and reda river which flow through meadows wetlands and natural reserve area regarding tp the concentrations were generally below 0 2 mg p l 1 the limit concentration of the first quality class according to polish regulations the worst situation was observed in darżlubie stream where not only the first class limit was regularly exceeded but also incidentally the second class limit 0 3 mg p l 1 was exceeded too according to european environment agency 2018 the concentrations above 0 1 mg p l 1 are considered as relatively high the elevated concentrations in the contributory darżlubie stream influenced also płutnica river in bładzikowski stream and gizdepka river the elevated tp concentrations reaching the maximum of 1 89 mg p l 1 in bładzikowski stream persisted during the first months of the study june september 2017 with only incidental elevations in the later period in mrzezino canal tp concentrations corresponded to the first class limit except for summer peak concentrations in summer 2018 in zagorska struga and reda river the elevated first class limit tp concentrations were observed only incidentally in water samples of piaśnica karwianka and czarna wda rivers located in the northern region of poland the po 4 3 ions were in the range of 0 11 0 62 mg p l 1 baczkowska et al 2021 3 1 3 nutrients in surface waters from drainage ditches the assessment of the state of water pollution was carried out in the scope of nitrate pollution and susceptibility to eutrophication the assessment of nitrate pollution was done based the population of results falling within the water quality classes 0 24 99 25 39 99 40 50 and 50 mg no 3 l 1 in accordance with the guidelines for preparing reports on the implementation of the nitrates directive by the member states the assessment of the susceptibility of waters to eutrophication was carried out based on a comparison of the obtained results nitrate nitrogen total nitrogen and total phosphorus with the limit values of the basic indicators of eutrophication of waters above which eutrophication occurs according to the regulation of the minister of the environment of december 23 2002 on the criteria for determining waters sensitive to nitrogen pollution from agricultural sources journal of laws 2002 241 2093 currently considered repealed the assessment of the state of water pollution with nutrients in drainage ditches in the puck commune showed in particular that only 5 2 of the samples tested had water contaminated with nitrates or threatened with nitrate contamination due to exceeding the limit values of eutrophication indicators nitrate total nitrogen and total phosphorus the share of the analysed water samples was relatively small one eutrophication indicator was exceeded at most in 29 of the samples as an annual average fig 9 in comparison at least one eutrophication rate was found to be exceeded at nearly 70 of the monitoring points located in drainage ditches in the whole country the limit value of the eutrophication rate in flowing waters annual average is as follows total phosphorus ptot 0 25 mg p l 1 total nitrogen ntot 5 0 mg n l 1 nitrate nitrogen 2 2 mg n no 3 l 1 however similar results from the other tests performed in the region are not available in literature the drainage ditches are located mainly in agricultural areas the obtained results of nutrient concentrations confirm the seasonal variability typical for agricultural areas matej lukowicz et al 2020 wojciechowska et al 2019a 3 1 4 nutrients distribution and flux via sgd details related to the groundwater sgd influence on pore water salinity and sgd rate in the bay of puck can be found in kłostowska et al 2020 generally the usual seawater salinity in the bay of puck oscillates around 7 0 and typically significantly lower surface water salinities indicate the freshwater source such as precipitation and or rivers within all collected samples the oxidation reduction potential eh ranged from 11 6 to 36 mv the dissolved oxygen concentrations ranged from 0 7 to 9 8 mg l 1 and the ph levels ranged from 4 9 to 8 3 the nutrients concentrations ranged from 0 2 to 45 1 mg n l 1 for po 4 3 from 3 1 to 488 9 mg n l 1 for nh 4 and from 0 0 to 506 6 mg n l 1 for no 3 in all collected samples szymczycha et al 2012 obtained similar results for po 4 3 and nh 4 apart from the nitrates concentrations observed in autumn that were significantly higher in this study szymczycha et al 2020 in order to estimate the nitrate ammonium and phosphate fluxes via sgd we used nutrients concentrations measured within the salinity gradients and depth profiles while the sgd was adopted from the previous study by kłostowska et al 2020 firstly we identified the minimum maximum average and median concentration for each measured nutrient and for each season the obtained data did not have a normal distribution therefore we calculated nutrients loads using median concentrations the seasonal fluxes of nutrients via sgd were calculated by multiplying median concentrations minimum and maximum rates finally the obtained nutrients loads corresponded to the average values standard deviation the estimated seasonal and annual loads of both dissolved inorganic nitrogen din 9303 t yr 1 and po 4 3 950 t yr 1 via sgd were the most significant source of nutrients to the bay of puck and remarkably higher than quantified before fresh sgd nutrients loads 50 t yr 1 and 56 t yr 1 for din and po 4 3 respectively the sgd fluxes reported here show some of the highest rates of sediment water fluxes reported in the baltic sea 3 1 5 nutrients in groundwater there were clear differences in nutrients concentration between shallow aquifers q0 and q1 and deeper aquifer q2 the concentrations of nutrients were higher in shallow wells fig 10 the nitrate no 3 concentrations in perched aquifer q0 ranged from 2 to 49 mg l 1 median 26 mg l 1 and in the upper quaternary aquifer q1 ranged from 0 1 92 mg l 1 median 10 mg l 1 while in contrast in the deeper quaternary aquifer q2 ranged from 0 1 1 mg l 1 median 0 3 mg l 1 the concentrations of ammonium nh 4 were similar in all aquifers but still slightly higher in shallow aquifers the obtained values in aquifers q0 q1 and q2 were respectively from 0 01 3 56 mg l 1 median 0 03 mg l 1 from 0 01 to 3 32 mg l 1 median 0 03 mg l 1 and from 0 01 0 37 mg l 1 median 0 14 mg l 1 the concentrations of phosphate po4 were clearly higher in the shallow wells the obtained values were in range from 0 16 to 6 38 mg l 1 median 0 5 mg l 1 in q0 aquifer from 0 1 3 06 mg l 1 median 0 37 mg l 1 in q1 aquifer and from 0 09 to 0 49 mg l 1 median 0 14 mg l 1 in q2 aquifer potrykus et al 2020 field and laboratory research of groundwater quality shows a local contamination caused by human activity the contamination is limited to shallow aquifers and has a local extent the analysis of groundwater samples indicates agricultural activity and municipal wastes as main reasons of groundwater contamination potrykus et al 2020 3 1 6 pesticides in waters and soils in all analysed water and soil samples the concentrations of organochlorine pesticides aldrin dieldrin endrin isodrine dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its isomers and alpha beta gamma and delta isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane were below the limit of detection of the used methodology pazikowska sapota et al 2020 however in soil samples surface waters from drainage ditches and watercourses as well as in groundwater samples out of 309 active substances examined the following pesticides have been detected organophosphatic insecticides chlorpyrifos ethyl fungicides boscalid epoxiconazole difenoconazole fluopicolide herbicides dimetachlor diflufenican metazachlor glyphosate and its metabolite ampa repellents anthraquinone the concentrations of detected pesticides in soil samples chlorpyrifos ethyl anthraquinone glyphosate and ampa ranged from 0 05 to 0 35 mg kg 1 the highest concentrations were obtained in august in water from drainage ditches for metazachlor 2 0 mg l 1 glyphosate 4 7 mg l 1 and ampa 2 0 mg l 1 in the surface water samples and sediment samples taken from the bay of puck none of the 309 substances from the pesticides group were found pazikowska sapota et al 2020 on the base of obtained results it can be concluded that the overall level of impact of farms from the puck commune on the environment including the quality of the waters of the bay of puck is relatively low it should be noted however that among the studied farms there were some whose environmental pressure determined by the surveys and specified pressure indicators had an unusually large dimension 3 2 calibration and validation results 3 2 1 swat swat calibration allowed to meet all 3 calibration criteria described earlier the annual groundwater recharge fluxes obtained from the model were 36 146 mm yr 1 vs the reference range of 19 186 mm yr 1 average annual evapotranspiration in the model was 459 mm yr 1 vs the reference range 450 495 mm yr 1 finally the average annual biomass dry mass production in the forest hru s was 6 1 8 5 t ha 1 yr 1 vs the reference range of 6 5 7 5 t ha 1 yr 1 validation was performed by comparing the daily simulated and observed flow rates for the period of operation of the monitoring network i e 01 06 2018 30 07 2019 the parameter me equals to 0 012 mse 0 032 and rmse 0 18 in the case of biomass crop yields obtained in the modelled basin are depending on hru parameters for example for winter wheat from 5 9 to 7 3 t ha 1 yr 1 average according to surveys 6 4 t ha 1 yr 1 for canola from 2 6 to 3 4 t ha 1 yr 1 surveys 3 8 t ha 1 yr 1 dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2019 overall the model performance was considered satisfactory and no further attempt was undertaken to improve biomass and yield predictions pesticide calibration was not included because in the watercourses modelled the presence of diflufenican was detected in only 1 sample pazikowska sapota et al 2020 3 2 2 groundpuck fig 10 and fig 11 shows that in most control points a satisfactory agreement between the measured and calculated groundwater heads was obtained the indicators of fit quality were as follows mean error 0 29 m mean absolute error 1 10 m root mean square error 1 79 m the lowest convergence is observed in the upper aquifer q1 mainly in the southwestern part of the model area it is a result of difficulties in the spatial projection of the aquifer layer variation of hydraulic conductivity values and probability of perched aquifer q0 occurrence which can be responsible for the increase of groundwater recharge taking into account the number of chemical analysis the distribution of sampling points and the mosaic variability of the nitrates concentrations in groundwater that may indicate the local influence of pollution source it would be difficult and less reliable to compare the results of simulations with use of reference points method therefore we approached the validation holistically and operated with the observed and simulated range values of n no 3 concentrations for the whole area of groundwater study table 1 shows a reasonable agreement between measurements and model in each aquifer in addition the calculated amount of water discharged from the upper q1 and lower q2 aquifers are in a good agreement with the results of previous studies related to groundwater outflow to the bay of puck piekarek jankowska 1994 kryza and kryza 2006 jaworska szulc 2009 lidzbarski 2015 in our model the total groundwater discharge to the sea from q1 and q2 is 1286 m3 h 1 which corresponds to 92 m3 h 1 per kilometer of the coastline the flow rate varies from 58 m3 h 1 km 1 in the upland areas to 152 m3 h 1 km 1 in the river valleys piekarek jankowska 1994 reported the rate of groundwater discharge to the bay of puck in the same area ranging from 21 to 165 m3 h 1 km 1 with an average of 98 m3 h 1 km 1 while jaworska szulc 2009 estimated the rate of groundwater discharge to the bay of puck in the reda river valley as 165 m3 h 1 km 1 3 2 3 ecopuckbay we validated the ecopuckbay model for two hydrodynamic parameters temperature and salinity and four biochemical parameters oxygen nitrates phosphates chlorophyll a detailed results for the hydrodynamic part of the epb model validation have been described in dybowski et al 2019 while biochemical part validation of the epb model has been extensively presented in dybowski et al 2020b in both cited studies we used modified taylor diagrams because in our opinion their use together with mean error is the best way to present the quality of model data in relation to environmental measurements the epb model simulation run has been performed for the time period from january 2011 to december 2018 the voivodship inspectorate of environmental protection viep in gdańsk provided monitoring data from january 2014 to decemver 2017 the nemo nordic model data covered 2014 2016 years and nemo scobi model data covered 2014 2017 measurement data from s y oceania was taken during the 2018 summer cruise table 2 summarizes the statistical comparison between the epb modelled results and reference data the correlation coefficients ranges from 0 92 to 0 98 for temperature from 0 17 to 0 90 for salinity where 0 17 is for comparison with the numerical model nemo scobi which horizontal resolution is about 40 times lower than epb and from 0 56 to 0 75 for biochemical variables o2 no 3 po 4 3 chlorophyll a correct stratification of temperature and salinity especially in vertical profiles using data from s y oceania indirectly also gives information about the correctness of vertical mixing in the model while the spatio temporal agreement with viep monitoring data allows us to state that the currents are also correctly represented in the model in the case of sea surface height ssh the resolution of the model data also the fact that the model produced mean values from the 6 hour time window and the lack of access to measurement data forced us to abandon direct validation of ssh it should be emphasized that the ssh is not of main interest in the presented tool but is only an additional variable that we have decided to show for ammonia and silicates we have compared for the purpose of this article our results from epb model to the international council for the exploration of the sea ices data https www ices dk data and summarized in table 3 comparing the mean values and their standard deviations we conclude that the range of variability of the concentration of ammonia and silicates is correct in the case of pesticides as a result of extensive monitoring in the waters of the bay of puck no pesticides were detected only 1 sample with diflufenican detected the epb model based on the inflow of pesticides from the swat model distributes the biochemical load including pesticides inside the bay of puck and these values are below the limit of quantification the last parameter group of epb labelled as nutrient spread nitrate phosphate ammonia max spread is described in the article by dybowski et al 2020b the nutrient spread module describes the diffusion and advection of nutrients under the influence of sea currents data on the flow and concentration of nutrients are provided once a day at the land water border from the swat model there are no references in the literature to studies using numerical models with such high resolution as the epb for the studied area however the concentration of nutrients in the gulf of gdańsk of which the bay of puck is a part is monitored and thoroughly investigated lysiak pastuszak 2000 kot wasik et al 2003 kruk dowgiałło 2008 and the use of the epb model should make it easier to assess the environmental state of the bay of puck 3 3 waterpuck toolkit s capabilities the real potential of the waterpuck toolkit lies in its practical implementation in the form of an online service that is easy to access and simple to use the whole set of developed tools is available through the website https waterpuck pl en products tab in the following subsections we are presenting the capabilities offered by key modules of the created toolkit 3 3 1 database the waterpuck database is a tool that connects and enables the communication between the individual elements of the solution it is operated from the map view level and allows the user to find the necessary data and meta information in a short time all measurement points collected in the database are visualised in the form of markers placed on the map the data can be downloaded directly to the local device and can also be presented in the form of a graph in a web browser table 4 shows the ranges of nitrate nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus measured concentrations for different environments in the studied area the maximum observed nitrate nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus concentrations decrease with the subsequent environments in which they are propagated an exception to this rule is the transition from surface water to groundwater here we observe higher concentrations in groundwater than in surface water for phosphates phosphorus data on nitrate and phosphate concentrations in surface run off for puck commune s watershed were published matej lukowicz et al 2020 wojciechowska et al 2019a 2019b and the range of variation of n no 3 and p po 4 3 presented in the table 4 is consistent with previous studies the concentration of orthophosphates for sgd is consistent with the szymczycha et al 2012 study while the maximum concentration of nitrates for sgd is significantly higher than in the quoted study measurements of nutrients concentrations with the highest possible spatial and temporal resolution while maintaining an accurate and high quality database allows for the highest quality studies in the field of water contamination from agricultural activity 3 3 2 surface water model the user can perform using a web interface a simulation of agricultural pollution entering the bay of puck with surface run off the quality and quantity of water inflow are calculated in the swat model two modes for visualising the results are available 1 general data where one can simulate and produce forecast for the concentrations of selected nutrients and pesticides in surface run off and rivers within the puck commune waterpuck swat 2021b 2 calculator allows the user to perform simulations after making changes regarding crops doses and types of fertilisers and plant protection products waterpuck swat 2021a in the general data view it is possible to select two parameters for presentation soil and channel assessment soil assessment shows the spatial variability of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus compounds present in surface run off channel assessment shows the time variability of flow rate and the amount of nutrients present in watercourses kg as well as pesticides as mg of active substance meteorological conditions have a significant impact on the amount of nutrients leached out by surface run off the optimal dose of the fertiliser should depend on the forecasted rainfall therefore through the online interface the user has to choose one of the following rainfall scenarios real rainfall dry year simulation 70 real rainfall and wet year 120 real rainfall general data mode allows presenting results in two ways graphical presentation of the entire analysed area with the option of choosing a displayed period the exact value for the selected place or section of the river in addition for watercourse results it is possible to present a time series of nutrient and or pesticide concentrations in the watercourses over a selected period of time in the calculator mode one should mark the field location for which the simulation will be carried out in the place indicated on the map a house symbol appears and at the same time a list of required inputs shows up the user should enter the size of the analysed field and the planned doses of fertiliser and pesticide from the drop down lists plant type fertiliser type and pesticide type can be chosen after selecting the plant based on the tested agricultural calendars input files for the swat model will be generated regarding the agricultural practices used e g date of sowing ploughing fertilising harvesting etc files are created for each agricultural hru after performing a full simulation for the changed land development and dosing of fertilisers and pesticides a preview known from the general view will be displayed enabling a thorough analysis of the results obtained in addition under the map a comment on the amount of nutrients leaching will appear 3 3 3 groundpuck the associated web interface service allows the user to visualise the results of simulations groundwater heads and concentrations of nitrogen in nitrate form n no 3 for a selected day from the simulation period visualisation is possible for one of the three layers of the model representing aquifers water bearing layer q0 layer 1 of the model q1 layer 3 of the model and q2 layer 5 of the model as shown in fig 4 the user has to choose the date using the calendar shown on the webpage from the dropdown lists below the calendar one can choose the type of data groundwater head or n no 3 concentration and the considered aquifer q0 q1 q2 next one has to click the generate map button to display the data of interest on the map the groundwater head values are given in m a s l the values can be higher than the ground surface elevation due to artesian pressures in some regions of the model the concentrations of n no 3 are given in mg l 1 the results of groundwater simulations are passed to the hydrodynamic and ecological models of the bay of puck the rate of groundwater discharge from q1 and q2 aquifers to the sea and the corresponding loads of n no 3 3 3 4 ecopuckbay another tool that is directly fed with data from both the swat and groundpuck models is the epb model for the convenience of presentation we have created separate entries for individual components of the model i e the hydrodynamic part of epb the biochemical part of epb and the nutrient spread model the presentation of data from the epb model is handled in a very intuitive way in each of the three presentation modes in the first step a day is selected from the calendar then for the hydrodynamic part one of the four physical parameters i e temperature salinity sea level or currents for the biochemical part one of the seven parameters i e nitrate phosphate ammonia silicate chlorophyll a oxygen or pesticide and for the nutrient spread model one of the four options i e nitrate phosphate ammonia or maximum spread range finally for the hydrodynamic and biochemical part one of the three available data presentation methods i e area maps time series or vertical section is selected using the nutrient spread model it is possible to model the expected distribution of agricultural substances in the waters of the bay in a short period of time 10 days which can be helpful when extreme events occur and in making decisions to mitigate the negative effects associated with them for example when the forecast predicts very intense rainfall regulations may be issued encouraging farmers to postpone fertilisation which will also be beneficial for them 3 3 5 use of the waterpuck toolkit by farmers according to the nitrates directive farmers have to calculate the doses of nitrogen fertiliser this ensures that fertilisation is appropriate to the plants nutritional requirements and is economical and sustainable the waterpuck product makes it possible to calculate the environmental impact of a selected fertilisation scheme it focuses on the nutrients that have the most destructive effect on the ecosystem nitrogen and phosphorus the farmer can estimate the fertiliser losses during the production cycle by selecting different available fertilizers and applying them at a chosen location the farmer using the waterpuck toolkit can also calculate nitrogen losses for different fertilisation plans for example on a field of 100 ha of winter wheat with expected yield of 5 tonnes ha 1 a pre sowing application of 75 kg ha 1 of urea then 218 kg ha 1 of nitrochalk calcium ammonium nitrate in the first dose and finally 130 kg ha 1 of urea in the second dose resulted in 2578 kg of nitrogen and 312 kg of phosphorus including mineral 77 kg n 9 kg p for entire year however when we increase the expected value of the yield to 7 tonnes ha 1 using 75 kg ha 1 of urea in pre sowing 316 kg ha 1 of nitrochalk in the first dose and 186 kg ha 1 in the second dose then we get 2647 kg of nitrogen and 314 kg of phosphorus including mineral 118 kg n 9 kg p for entire year the above example was presented for a field located close to the coastline not further than 2 km however if we apply the same data for a field located approximately three times further from the coastline the following results will be obtained 1128 kg of nitrogen and 130 kg of phosphorus including mineral 42 kg n 2 kg p for entire year expected yield of 5 tonnes ha 1 and 1140 kg of nitrogen and 136 kg of phosphorus including mineral 65 kg n 2 kg p for entire year expected yield of 7 tonnes ha 1 from the previous examples we know what nitrogen losses occur when using urea for pre sowing so let s replace it with polifoska 17 17 18 with a dose of 200 kg ha 1 in order to keep the amount of nitrogen similar to the amount used in the example using urea then we will get 2564 kg of nitrogen and 315 kg of phosphorus including mineral 64 kg n 12 kg p for entire year expected yield of 5 tonnes ha 1 from filed located near the coastline in the last example we will check what the result of nitrogen loss will be when replacing urea used in the second dose with ammonium sulfate with a dose of 176 kg ha which does not change the amount of nitrogen compared to the example with urea and then we will get 2568 kg of nitrogen and 312 kg of phosphorus including mineral 72 kg n 9 kg p for entire year expected yield of 5 tonnes ha 1 from filed located near the coastline 4 discussion the online waterpuck toolkit which is the result of both environmental research aimed at verifying the mathematical models and their correct parameterisation and numerical research gives a real advantage to several target groups the first group of recipients of the created toolkit are farmers using the tools available from waterpuck online interface they can calculate the nutrient balance nutrient efficiency and the amount of nitrogen that is leached out of the field when planning the fertilisation these tools allow farmers to make more efficient use of the means of production available on their farms while respecting the environment and as a result reduce the amount of substances that could potentially endanger them important information for the farmer is the amount of nutrient loss depending on the form of nitrogen in the fertiliser the user can compare possible fertilisation variants and thus evaluate their efficiency and reduce losses calculate what losses will occur when using different forms of nitrogen e g amides and nitrates the product takes into account the spatial variation of soil parameters so that each farmer has an individual view of fertiliser losses the diversity of soils and a large database of fertilisers makes it possible to analyse many variants of cultivation and fertilisation this makes the tool flexible and gives it potential in local agricultural advisory services the calculator makes it possible to visualise the spatial variation of nutrient losses over the whole municipality the swat model is a tool that also contributes to increasing knowledge on the optimal production means dosage the use of swat is very intuitive as the farmer indicates on the map the location of his farm and enters data on the planned crop fertilisation and protection plans for the next production period as a result receives feedback on the environmental impact of the changes for different assessments and rainfall scenarios another group are scientists for whom quick access to detailed data on the state of environmental pollution from the place of application through propagation to various places of its accumulation is essential it also creates the possibility of conducting research in a comprehensive manner without omitting the complexity of the issue in addition the knowledge gathered in such a comprehensive way makes it possible to develop predictions of possible long term environmental effects which is necessary to implement effective strategies to protect the environment quick access to very detailed phenomena taking place in the environment may be also extremely important for testing hypotheses about the dynamic of those processes for example using the data presentation interface for the epb model we can observe a very interesting phenomenon of anti cyclonal eddy and its impact on all monitored variables inside the bay this kind of knowledge is highly important for a short term assessment of the impact of various types of extreme pollution that may arise from water treatment system failures the interest group for which the use of our solution may be beneficial is the policymakers with the help of solutions developed and described in this study it is expected to benefit from provided expert knowledge and make responsible long term decisions respecting the assumptions of sustainable development of rural areas with particular attention to environmental protection it should be mentioned that there are currently solutions in use that partially overlap with the toolkit we proposed and were collected and briefly described in the table 5 although there are many common features among the solutions presented in the table 5 our solution is the only one that comprehensively addresses the environmental impact of agriculture from the production planning stage to the final propagation of pollution in the aquatic environment both land and marine for example a cool farm tool and comet farm vetter et al 2018 ziegler et al 2016 focuses mainly on the carbon cycle or for aquatic environment on water footprint caused by irrigation there is also an interesting study on so called healthy farm index by quinn et al 2013 but it is mainly focused on biodiversity 5 conclusions solutions that comprehensively connect the marine and land environment are essential for resource monitoring and management especially in the coastal zone which plays a beneficial role for humans moreover considering the individual elements of the solution as separate and unconnected may lead to an underestimation overestimation of the potential effects of planned regulation improved understanding of sea land interactions in the context of hazardous substances will contribute to achieving the goals set by european legislation which aims to improve the state of marine waters that is also the ultimate result of waterpuck project implementation the systematic use of the waterpuck toolkit by farmers particularly the farm balance calculator nitrogen leaching calculator and swat s calculator mode allows for more efficient management of production means while respecting the environment creation of environmental database and its availability for decision makers environmental ngos and other interested stakeholders is an additional indirect benefit for the society achieved from waterpuck toolkit implementation the environmental database gathers data from the literature monitoring and adds new data obtained within the project with the aim to inform management authorities of the bay of puck including public consultations this is especially important as publicly available data are still scarce and access to them is often restricted the waterpuck toolkit is designed so that it can be applied to other regions around the world a necessary condition for the success of its application is to carry out the calibration process described in this study the key was to set up the database in such a way that each of the system s component tools could easily use the necessary information for its correct operation which was ensured in our solution funding this research was funded by national centre for research and development of poland within the biostrateg

9634,the changes taking place in the marine coastal zones are extremely important as about 40 of the human population currently lives in the coastal areas within 100 kilometres of the coastline increasing anthropogenic pressure on the marine ecosystems agriculture is a significant source of nutrients to the marine environment that increase hypoxia eutrophication and may pose a threat to the services provided by ecosystems in particular surface water and submarine groundwater discharge sgd are dominant pathways of nutrient loads the main aim of this study is to present the capabilities and results of an innovative and complex toolkit that enables researchers to identify the sources of nutrient and pesticide pollution calculate their flux via rivers and sgd and directly assess the influence of pesticides and nutrient flux on the coastal ecosystem we combined the in situ sampling of surface water groundwater soil sgd and seawater with a model study to create a set of tools for assessing the influence of agriculture on the marine environment the maximum concentrations of nitrates and phosphates were measured in the drainage ditches and were equal to 15 5 mg n no 3 l 1 and 7 7 mg p po 4 3 l 1 respectively the nutrients concentrations varied from 0 1 to 12 9 mg n no 3 l 1 and from 0 0 to 0 5 mg p po 4 3 l 1 in all freshwater samples in contrast the lowest concentrations were observed in seawater with maximum levels of 0 8 mg n no 3 l 1 and 0 1 mg p po 4 3 l 1 respectively the collected data were used to establish an innovative and interdisciplinary online toolkit in which surface run off was modelled with soil and water assessment tool swat groundwater flow with modflow and marine waters using the ecopuckbay model additionally the tool includes two interactive calculators for calculation of the nutrient balance and nitrogen leaching for single fields on farms graphical abstract ga1 keywords coastal management agriculture water quality nutrients pesticides 1 introduction marine coastal areas are the most productive areas in the world and therefore are extensively and increasingly used for numerous activities in addition about 40 of the human population currently lives in coastal areas that further increase the anthropogenic pressure and enhance climate change anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and farming result in freshwater groundwater and surface water pollution with many chemical substances mainly nutrients but also others such as pesticides the interaction of groundwater and surface water is a complex process as contaminated aquifers that discharge into ditches and streams can cause long term contamination of surface water conversely streams can be a major source of contamination to aquifers surface water usually is hydraulically coupled to groundwater but the connections are difficult to observe and quantify therefore commonly have been ignored in water management considerations and policies enhanced nutrient inputs from land are the main drivers for coastal eutrophication and hypoxia therefore proper understanding of the sources of the pollution the processes changing their concentrations on the way to the sea and their impact on the functioning of the marine ecosystem are of the highest importance the baltic sea similarly to many inland seas is an example of the marine environment being under high anthropogenic pressures the baltic sea is one of the most polluted seas in the world due to its geographical and oceanographical characteristics its water residence time accounts for 20 25 years and additionally baltic sea is surrounded by agriculture areas of highly industrialised countries as a result nutrients loads mainly nitrogen and phosphorous to the baltic sea are high increased nutrients load to the baltic sea results in a declining environmental status of the sea with widespread eutrophication gustafsson et al 2012 eutrophication together with physical factors particularly the frequency and intensity of inflow of saltier water markus meier 2007 reissmann et al 2009 causes hypoxia österblom et al 2007 zillén and conley 2010 helsinki commission 2018 usually defined as oxygen concentrations less than 2 mg l 1 at least 97 per cent of the region was assessed as eutrophicated in 2011 2016 according to the integrated status assessment while large areas in the baltic sea suffer from low hypoxic conditions the occurrence of both eutrophication and hypoxia significantly affect the aquatic life and nutrient cycling carstensen et al 2014 despite the considerable decrease of total nitrogen and phosphorous loads from anthropogenic sources in the last 20 years eutrophication of the baltic sea still remains one of the major concerns baltic sea hydrographic commission 2013 the baltic marine environment protection commission which is also known as the helsinki commission helcom 2021 is an intergovernmental organisation that gives a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem health of the entire regional sea these major assessments assist the region s environmental managers and decision makers so that they can base their work on sound up to date knowledge of the status of the sea helcom is also responsible for providing the programme to restore the good ecological status of the baltic marine environment called baltic sea action plan bsap 2021 bsap incorporates the latest scientific knowledge and innovative management approaches into strategic policy implementation and stimulates goal oriented multilateral cooperation around the baltic sea region in order to fulfil the goals of bsap innovative approaches for environmental management are necessary although there have been many projects conducting the subject of nutrients loads from agriculture there is still a lack of comprehensive studies merging the land and ocean based investigations the baltic sea is just an example of the marine environment lacking tools for proper coastal ocean management many earlier studies used soil and water assessment tool swat to evaluate watershed scale hydrological cycle and the associated transport of nutrients and pesticides neitsch et al 2011 applications related to the baltic sea watershed include among others piniewski et al 2014 2017 thodsen et al 2017 trolle et al 2019 however swat uses a simplified representation of groundwater flow which does not allow quantifying the direct groundwater discharge to the sea submarine groundwater discharge sgd and for this and other reasons may be insufficient for complex post glacial multi aquifer systems occurring e g on the polish baltic coast in order to overcome the limitations of groundwater modelling several authors used swat in combination with dedicated groundwater flow and transport models usually based on the modflow mt3d family of computer programs harbaugh 2005 zheng and wang 1999 application of swat modflow coupled models is described e g in pulido velazquez et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 ehtiat et al 2018 however only few of such studies focus on coastal zone and sgd quantification galbiati et al 2006 estimates nutrient load discharged to an adriatic coastal lagoon with the use of swat modflow mt3d and a stream water quality model in the work of welch et al 2019 the recharge estimates obtained from swat were fed to the modflow mt3d groundwater model to estimate sgd on one of the samoan islands coupling of land and sea eco hydrological models to represent water and nutrient cycling in the coastal zone has rarely been undertaken too trolle et al 2019 applied mike she and swat models to estimate nutrient loads to odense fiord on the danish coast under different climate change scenarios the resulting evolution of ecological state indicators in seawater was calculated with empirical models usually scientists evaluate anthropogenic pressure by characterizing the flux of contaminants using separate models such as swat for surface run off modflow for groundwater flow and 3d models for presenting complex processes in the marine environment being under contaminants discharge neitsch et al 2011 ehtiat et al 2018 adu and kumarasamy 2018 torres bejarano et al 2013 dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2018 as far as the authors are concerned up to date there is only one attempt to couple environment observations together with different models in the way that is similar to our approach that is kimberley marine research program kmrp by the western australian marine science institution however kmrp has not developed an online tool and therefore we cannot compare with their solution this was the main motivation for developing the waterpuck project which is an interdisciplinary and innovative approach integrating knowledge of different disciplines into the implementation of the environmental protection policy sustainable growth and improvement of the competitiveness of the polish economy dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2018 dzierzbicka glowacka 2019 in this project different components and methods such as retrospective analyses of existing monitoring data sets in situ measures and the application of various models were used to estimate main mechanisms and threats responsible for the pollution transport from the agricultural holdings and land use structure to the surface and groundwater and potential predictability of environment change of the baltic sea coastal area the main aim of this study is to present the capabilities and results of the waterpuck online toolkit waterpuck is an innovative and complex toolkit that enables researchers to identify the sources of nutrient and pesticide pollution understand the main mechanisms responsible for the transport of these pollutants in surface and groundwater calculate their flux via rivers and sgd and directly assess the influence of pesticides and nutrient flux on the bay of puck ecosystem including the creation of scenarios projecting the effects of changes in land use on chemical loads from the puck commune that are transported via surface and groundwater to the bay of puck additionally within the service we present the way the different environmental data such as in situ measures and model outcomes can be operated the paper focuses on the description of the full modelling framework detailed presentation of some components can be found in earlier publications from our group dzierzbicka glowacka 2019 dybowski et al 2019 2020a 2020b szymkiewicz et al 2020 kalinowska et al 2020 wielgat et al 2021 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptual scheme of the solution the method of modelling the impact of farms and land use structure on the quality of land surface water and groundwater and coastal waters was developed and verified as part of the waterpuck project the service is a set of computer models interconnected with each other operating continuously forced with meteorological data and combines four main modules fig 1 1 agricultural holdings survey system and two calculators for farms as interactive applications 2 land water a comprehensive model of surface water run off based on swat model and a numerical model of groundwater flow based on modflow which we named groundpuck 3 coastal water a three dimensional numerical model of coastal ecosystem consisting of a hydrodynamic and biochemical part with a nutrient spread module based on community earth system model cesm 4 marine water a three dimensional numerical model of the marine ecosystem providing boundary condition to coastal water module a schematic flowchart of the modelling system is presented in fig 2 we coupled the ecopuckbay model from the land side with two models swat surface water and groundpuck groundwater information about the water volume discharged by rivers is being provided by the hydrological model swat that has been implemented as one of the waterpuck project s stages kalinowska et al 2020 the swat model includes the preparation of the innovative and complex hydrological model coupled with the nutrient concentration module including meteorological data precipitation wind temperature and atmospheric pressure the transformation of precipitation data into surface run off have been achieved with the scs soil conservation service curve number procedure through the accumulated run off volume and the time of concentration the time from the beginning of a rainfall event until the entire subbasin area contributes to flow at the outlet kalinowska et al 2020 a numerical transport model based on the modflow code groundpuck allows determining the nitrate load in the groundwater flowing into the bay of puck the mt3dms numerical code was applied to solve the advection reaction dispersion equation zheng and wang 1999 transient calculations were performed with the third order total variational diminishing tvd numerical method for the advective term while for the steady state solution the standard finite difference discretization was applied this model was calibrated based on actual no 3 concentration values and was joined with the ecopuckbay model through a coupling module the results of the 3d ecopuckbay model are limited to the area of the bay of puck however the entire model grid covers a wider area dybowski et al 2020b this is to ensure that boundary conditions are properly simulated along the line of the northern border of the 3d ecopuckbay model data from the 2 3 km three dimensional coupled ecosystem model of the baltic sea 3d cembs prediction model are transferred to the ecopuckbay model results from 3d cembs dzierzbicka głowacka 2013a 2013b are used to provide forcing fields in the ecopuckbay model through sequential information transfer the mechanism of this module is to interpolate values from 3d cembs to ecopuckbay model s grids 2 2 study area and database the entire tool has been designed and assembled regardless of geographical location this means that the application of methods developed within the described solution is possible after calibration to a specific region in any coastal area however the area of the puck commune and the bay of puck fig 3 was chosen to test and verify the developed methods the study area is located in northern poland on the southern coast of the baltic sea it includes the bay of puck drainage basin located in the puck commune with an area of 176 km2 the puck commune is of agricultural character its area is 57 3 covered by utilised agricultural area uaa the vast majority of which is characterised by high yield potential witek 1994 igras and pastuszak 2009 the remaining area of the municipality is covered by forests and areas classified as forest 33 7 roads and areas under buildings 7 1 as well as waterlogged land and unused land 1 9 among the agricultural lands the largest area is occupied by arable land 77 of uaa followed by grassland about 20 5 of uaa arable land al is mainly used to grow cereals such as rye winter wheat spring wheat spring barley oat winter triticale cereal mixture their sowing area occupies more than 2 3 of the al other major crops include ground vegetables rape potatoes and maize for green fodder agricultural activity in the puck commune apart from crop production also includes milk and pig production the average livestock density in the municipality is less than 0 5 livestock unit per 1 ha of uaa the puck commune area represents a typical young postglacial landscape with relatively high relief from 0 5 to 113 5 m above sea level it consists of isolated fragments of the moraine plateau separated from each other by deeply cut ice marginal valleys the whole area is covered with quaternary deposits the quaternary deposits consist of moraine glacial till with sand and gravel layers and glacifluvial or river sand and silty sand in the valleys the dominant soil types are sandy loam glacial till sandy loam covered by loamy sand weathered glacial till sand of glacifluvial origin and peat in larger river valleys the thickness of the sediment ranges from 40 m in the east to 95 100 m in the west such a significant difference is probably a result of a diversified land surface or large range in altitude of the top of older layers jereczek korzeniewska and jegliński 2011 groundwater forms a complex system with several aquifer units fig 4 shallow groundwater occurs in small perched aquifers and in sand lenses enclosed in moraine deposits fig 4 these aquifers do not play an important role in water supply but they are exploited locally by farms and summer houses two deeper quaternary aquifers span most of the area the upper inter moraine aquifer q1 and the lower sub moraine aquifer q2 they were formed in glacifluvial deposits sand and gravel separated by a layer of moraine till these two large aquifers are hydraulically connected shallow groundwater is recharged by the infiltration of rainwater deeper aquifers are influenced by inflow from the west and take the seepage water from the layers above the entire hydrosystem is drained mainly by the baltic sea bay of puck either directly via sgd or indirectly via streams and rivers aquifers q1 and q2 are the main source of water supply in the region szymkiewicz et al 2020 there are seven streams flowing through the area of puck commune reda river zagórksa struga mrzezino canal gizdepka bładzikowski stream and płutnica river together with its inflow darżlubie stream the streams discharge directly to the bay of puck all stream catchments are covered with a dense hydrographic network drainage ditches canals as well as tiles serving regulation of water level for agriculture average concentrations of nutrients in the analysed streams flowing through the puck commune area zagórska struga reda mrzezino canal gizdepka bładzikowski stream płutnica and darżlubie stream generally fulfilled the requirements for the i or the ii class of quality according to the regulation of the ministry of marine management and inland navigation of 11th october 2019 concerning classification of ecological status of surface waters and environmental quality classes for priority pollutants dz u 2019 poz 2149 the worst quality status was observed in the case of bładzikowski stream and gizdepka which flow through intensively used agricultural terrain the episodes with elevated nutrients concentrations especially during summer months the catchment of bładzikowski stream is characterized by predominating agricultural land use with almost 90 share of agricultural land in the total land area the relationship between n surplus in the agricultural farms in the bładzikowski stream catchment and the elevated concentrations of total nitrogen was proved wojciechowska et al 2019b also for płutnica river and its tributary darżlubie stream the incidental situations when nutrient concentrations exceeded the requirements of the ii class were observed mostly in summer months or after intensive rainfalls on the other hand reda river and zagórska struga were characterized by very good status regarding nutrient concentrations average flows in the analysed watercourses are gizdepka 0 178 m3s 1 bładzikowski stream 0 035 m3s 1 płutnica river 0 718 m3s 1 bogdanowicz and cysewski 2008 water quality in individual rivers varies depending on the season vegetation intensity and stage of agricultural practices wojciechowska et al 2019a despite intensive agriculture in the catchment area soils are characterised by low ph this results in the conversion of phosphate fertilisers into insoluble compounds unavailable to plants and forces the use of increased doses of nitrogen fertilisers the climate of this region is temperate maritime in the period 2011 2020 the annual average temperature was about 7 5 c and the average annual precipitation was 712 mm the highest precipitation during summer wielgat et al 2021 the southern part of the baltic sea enclosing the puck commune is a popular tourist region that is also heavily influenced by an anthropogenic activity of local residents and farming this makes the bay of puck a natural reservoir for waste deposition of fertilisers and other inputs delivered through the soil groundwater rivers or direct deposition this region is massively shaped and influenced by several factors that can pressure the state of physical and biochemical parameters one of the most important factors influencing the region s unique ecosystem is topography the average depth of the gulf of gdańsk is about 50 m with a maximum depth gdańsk deep of 118 m from the northeast it is surrounded by hel peninsula which serves as a natural barrier for mixing with the open waters of the baltic sea keeping the salinity ranging mostly within the range of 7 8 with a deviation of around 1 bay of puck is also heavily influenced by the river discharge from land resulting in lowered salinity especially in the coastal surface waters the largest river in the region is the vistula discharging an average of over 1000 m3s 1 of freshwater water temperature in the region ranges from over 20 c at the surface during summer with the maximum usually in august to around 2 c in february water stratification is frequent during the warmer months leading to the occurrence of seasonal thermoclines during winter thermocline declines and the water becomes well mixed dybowski et al 2020b the ecosystem of the bay of puck especially its inner part called puck lagoon due to the geomorphological separation from the rest of the bay marked with a dashed line in fig 3 is very prone to degradation from land based pollution the area of the bay of puck is equal to 356 km2 and maximal depth is 55 m the exchange of water between puck lagoon and outer bay of puck is very limited and therefore any contaminants getting directly into puck lagoon with watercourses from the puck commune pose a real threat to which special attention should be paid this applies especially to agriculture which is a dominant land use type in the puck commune 2 2 1 the ph of the soils and abundance of arable land in macro nutrients in the spring of 2018 soil samples from 61 agricultural plots on 22 farms with a total area of 171 05 ha were taken based on the guidelines included in the polish standard pn r 04031 1997 ph measurement of soil was conducted in suspension of 1 mol kcl l 1 solution by the potentiometric method

commune was composed of 9 parts with total of 64 questions entitled as follows 1 identification of the farm and farmer 2 farm type 3 crops 4 breeding 5 storage of natural fertilisers 6 fertilisation management 7 plant protection products 8 purchased sold and used products 9 comments and remarks the survey was carried out on a representative group of 31 farms with a diversified agricultural production profile and its aim was to determine in detail how farmers in puck commune manage their farms the questionnaires were conducted using a specially prepared online form which significantly improved the subsequent post processing and data analysis in the next step which was at the same time an element of research and resulted as a support tool for farmers we developed two interactive calculators to help farmers determine the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk balance on the farm called calcgospuck and the amount of nitrogen leaching from the field called calcnpuck the calculators were designed to directly use the data from the farmers surveys detailed information on the at the farm gate method and the leaching of n from the individual field have been described in detail in the following papers dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2019 and dybowski et al 2020a 2 3 2 swat surface run off model the swat model is a tool for complex agricultural catchment area analysis based on weather and spatial data such as digital elevation model land use and soil maps swat model calculates the hydrological response of the basin and water balance additionally based on information about plants method of cultivation doses and types of fertilisers and pesticides it calculates yields as well as water and soil chemical quality depending on meteorological information sources this model can be used for real time calculations forecasting or simulation of archival events the swat model in our configuration uses data from the institute of meteorology and water management station

neogene clay and silt 2 3 4 ecopuckbay ecosystem model of the coastal environment the marine environment specifically the coastal zone is represented by an ecohydrodynamic model of the bay of puck called ecopuckbay epb the epb is a high resolution three dimensional model that originates from the community earth system model cesm 2021 developed by national center for atmospheric research ncar the epb s ecosystem part is based on the nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd approach moore et al 2001 the model predicts nutrient distributions n si and p three phytoplankton functional types diatoms picophytoplankton nanophytoplankton and diazotrophs nitrogen fixing organisms chlorophyll a as separate variables zooplankton pelagic detritus dissolved oxygen and pesticides glyphosate diflufenican metazachlor chlorpyrifos and antrachinon sources of nutrients include atmospheric deposition and sedimentary sources sinking particles can be associated with ballast and the presence of ballast changes the remineralization length scale assumed for the model many though not all models can be cast in a general form as a coupled set of time dependent advection diffusion reaction equations dybowski et al 2020b 2 4 boundary conditions calibration and validation 2 4 1 swat the swat model was required to provide data on water balance water quality and infiltration dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2018 2019 due to the lack of sufficient data on water flows and water levels in watercourses it was decided to perform calibration using the manual trial and error procedure szymkiewicz et al 2020 the method of calibration was chosen not only because of the small amount and short time series of measurement data it also results from the purpose of the model it was created as part of the larger project the combination of the 3 models dependent on the same variable daily rainfall was a challenge from the point of view of calibration because each of the models processes the same parameters in a slightly different way the authors wanted to maintain consistency in defining the study area parameters of the basin soil watercourses etc thus it was necessary to calibrate 3 completely different models simultaneously additionally some of the calibrated parameters or their ranges were limited in this situation the simplest solution seemed to be to perform manual trial and error calibration meteorological data from 2000 to 2009 were used for the calibration the criteria for calibration and validation represented the components of hydrological budget and biomass for which reliable estimates were reported in earlier studies references available in szymkiewicz et al 2020 wielgat et al 2021 kalinowska et al 2020 specifically we aimed to obtain the average annual groundwater recharge in the range between 3 and 30 of the average annual precipitation depending on soil type and land use duda et al 2013 jaworska szulc 2015 moreover the average annual evaporation calculated by swat was required to be in the range 450 495 mm as measured for a location in poland with very similar climate and land use conditions czyżyk and steinhoff wrześniewska 2017 as the third calibration goal we used the average annual production of biomass in pine forests orzeł et al 2006 in the calibration process we modified i scs curve numbers which describe the partitioning between runoff and infiltration their values were increased to the range 80 94 ii maximum water storage in canopy canmx increased in forests from 0 to 2 mm iii fraction of water in the shallow aquifer returning to the root zone revap increased in forests from 0 to 0 06 and iv parameters describing growth of pine trees blai 4 50 frgrw1 0 01 laimx1 0 01 frgrw2 0 10 alai min 2 99 for a detailed description of these parameters see arnold et al 2011 validation of swat model was performed by comparing the observed and calculated average daily outflow from the gizdepka river marked in fig 5 the gizdepka river was chosen because it flows through all the land use types existing in the analysed basin especially through agricultural land used in different ways to validate the model monitoring in the years 2018 2019 was used the monitoring consisted of a water level measurement station then the water level was converted into the flow rate using a rating curve based on measurements carried out in the years 2017 2019 we used the following measures defined in appendix a to verify the model mean error me mean square error mse and root mean square error rmse additional validation criteria included the weight of the yield of the major crops in the area winter wheat rape canola and silage corn and hay production on grassland model predictions for the period 2000 2009 were compared to data obtained from local farmers szymkiewicz et al 2020 average crop yields from questionnaires conducted among farmers with crops in the study catchment were used as reference values dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2019 based on information from farmers and agricultural advisors we assumed that the fraction of dry mass in yield is 85 for winter wheat 90 for rape canola 35 for silage corn and 85 for hay dried 2 4 2 groundpuck the sea boundary was represented by a constant head boundary in the q1 aquifer direct hydraulic contact with water in the bay of puck and by a general head boundary ghb third type in the q2 aquifer which represented the outflow through a distant outcrop at the sea bottom the discharge zones are situated in the bottom of the bay of puck at a distance of 2 3 km from the coast the ghb boundary was also used to simulate the lateral flow across the land part of the boundary in q1 q2 and those perched aquifers q0 which were intersected by the model boundary wells were assumed to be constantly in operation and the pumping rates were identified based on the available reports from groundwater administration rivers were represented by the third type boundary conditions river package the results obtained from swat were processed by scripts written in the python language using the flopy library bakker et al 2016 in order to set the recharge values in the modflow model in steady state simulations we used the average values for each hru from the period of 2000 2009 for transient simulations monthly averages were calculated for each hru from swat daily results we followed the approach described by bailey et al 2016 to transfer hru based swat results to the grid based modflow input calibration of the groundwater flow model was based on the steady state solution representing the average conditions in the period of 2000 2009 we used groundwater head measurements from 95 points in the area as shown in fig 6 to estimate model accuracy we made calculation using standard measures such as mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse that we described in detail in the appendix a based on the groundwater flow model developed in modflow a simulation of n no 3 transport was carried out mt3dms numerical code was applied to solve the advection reaction dispersion equation transient calculations were performed with the third order total variational diminishing tvd numerical method for the advective term while for steady state solution the standard finite difference discretization was applied denitrification of nitrates was described with the first order kinetic reaction we used a constant reaction rate of biodegradation equal to 1 10 5 h 1 which was established by model calibration in the model we considered only diffuse sources of nitrates concentrations of n no 3 in water reaching the groundwater table were calculated from the results of swat simulation for the years of 2000 2009 for each hru as in the case of groundwater recharge the transfer of hru based swat data to grid based mt3dms data was carried out with the aid of python scripts making use of the flopy library the model of nitrate nitrogen transport was calibrated manually by adjusting the reaction rate in order to obtain a satisfactory agreement between range of the calculated n no 3 concentrations and the results of chemical analysis of the 60 samples taken from the aquifers calibration was based on a steady state flow and transport simulation using average values of recharge and n no 3 loads from the period 2000 2009 and the current land use and agricultural practices the land side pesticide propagation was modelled only in the swat surface run off but not in the modflow groundwater flow 2 4 3 ecopuckbay from the land side the ecopuckbay model is coupled with swat surface run off and modflow groundwater flow while from the open sea side forcing data from the 3d cembs dzierzbicka głowacka 2013a 2013b nowicki et al 2019 after the previous interpolation is delivered to the domain s borders the epb model has been validated and runs in operational mode producing a 60 h forecast for physicochemical conditions of the bay of puck s environment dybowski et al 2019 2020b we used the following standard measures described in detail in the appendix a to test the quality of the ecopuckbay model pearson s correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse standard deviation std and mean error me to evaluate ecopuckbay model we used several sources of in situ samples that includes measurements taken throughout the monitoring activities of the voivodship inspector of environmental protection viep in gdańsk and vertical profiles of temperature and salinity recorded in 2018 during one of the measurement campaigns of the s y oceania along the southern baltic coast fig 5 in addition we compared our results with the numerical data of hydrodynamic and biochemical parameters calculated with the ice ocean model nemo nordic nucleus for european modelling of the ocean coupled with the biogeochemical model scobi swedish coastal and ocean biogeochemical model acquired from the marine copernicus database the most commonly used pesticides in the studied area which are glyphosate diflufenican metazachlor chlorpyrifos and antrachinon are modelled in the ecopuckbay model 3 results 3 1 environmental studies the set of environmental measurement data was divided into two parts one part of the data was used as a set forcing numerical models directly but also for parameterization calibration the second part of the environmental data was used to verify and test the correctness of the developed methods implemented in numerical models 3 1 1 the ph of the soils and abundance of arable land in macro nutrients based on the results of the granulometric composition the analysed mineral soils were classified taking into account fraction content below 0 02 mm into agronomic categories of very light up to 10 of fraction content below 0 02 mm light 11 20 medium 21 35 and heavy 35 soil acidification was assessed according to the accepted standards and soils were also categorised by their reaction classes as very acidic measured ph was 4 5 acidic 4 5 5 5 slightly acidic 5 5 6 5 neutral 6 5 7 2 and alkaline 7 2 the studied soils in the 0 30 cm layer had a ph in the range of 4 2 7 2 average 5 4 the content of available p for plants in the 0 30 cm layer of studied soils ranged from 3 6 to 66 5 mg per kg 1 average 33 3 mg per kg 1 in mineral soils and from 171 0 to 707 0 mg phcl kg 1 average 340 6 phcl kg 1 in organic soils pietrzak et al 2020 the mineral soils were characterised by a good abundance of exchangeable potassium ions from 0 604 to 2 15 mg k kg 1 on average 1 19 mg k kg 1 over 96 of soil samples had at least an average or higher level of potassium content all organic soils were characterised by very low content of exchangeable potassium ions the content of exchangeable magnesium ions in mineral soils ranged from 0 305 to 1 92 mg mg kg 1 average 0 96 mg mg kg 1 and was high and very high in 92 of soil samples while the organic soils of the studied area in terms of exchangeable magnesium ions content were classified as low and very low at level 0 994 5 14 mg mg kg 1 average 2 04 mg mg kg 1 3 1 2 nutrients in stream water the concentrations of nutrients and chemical oxygen demand cod measured during the study period are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively the tn concentrations ranged from 0 50 mg n l 1 to 13 10 mg n l 1 the highest concentrations were measured in bładzikowski stream general observation for bładzikowski stream mrzezino canal gizdepka river płutnica river and reda river in and out showed lower tn concentrations in the summer and autumn months followed by a substantial increase in winter and spring from january to april or may exceeding the limits of first class or even second class according to polish standards regulation of the ministry of marine development and inland shipping the second class limits for tn occurred first of all in bładzikowski stream but also in gizdepka and on some occasions in płutnica river in comparison to two main rivers in poland vistula and oder the mean concentrations reported by pastuszak et al 2018 were in 2016 2 3 and 3 3 mg n l 1 respectively regarding many european countries the tn concentration of 3 6 mg n l 1 was normally noted in high proportion while in catchments intensively used for agricultural purposes the concentration over 5 6 mg n l 1 was frequently observed european environment agency 2018 on the other hand concentrations below 0 8 mg n l 1 are characteristic of unaffected rivers scandinavian rivers stålnacke et al 1999 analysis of n species shows that in the case of bładzikowski stream and gizdepka with catchments intensively used by agriculture n no 3 constituted the most abundant nitrogen species which indicates the input of surface run off from fertilised fields the adverse trend with a higher share of n nh 4 was observed in the case of płutnica river and its inflow darżlubie stream similar tendency was observed by baczkowska et al 2021 in karwianka river located in approx 20 km distance from the investigated area which was justified by discharges of untreated wastewater this could be explained by some manure spills domestic wastewater discharge or by the discharge of fish processing industrial plant located in this catchment which are frequently considered as a sources in polish rivers preisner et al 2021 the impact of an industrial plant can also explain the higher cod concentrations in płutnica river and darżlubie sream in comparison to other watercourses the lowest n concentrations were observed in zagórska struga and reda river which flow through meadows wetlands and natural reserve area regarding tp the concentrations were generally below 0 2 mg p l 1 the limit concentration of the first quality class according to polish regulations the worst situation was observed in darżlubie stream where not only the first class limit was regularly exceeded but also incidentally the second class limit 0 3 mg p l 1 was exceeded too according to european environment agency 2018 the concentrations above 0 1 mg p l 1 are considered as relatively high the elevated concentrations in the contributory darżlubie stream influenced also płutnica river in bładzikowski stream and gizdepka river the elevated tp concentrations reaching the maximum of 1 89 mg p l 1 in bładzikowski stream persisted during the first months of the study june september 2017 with only incidental elevations in the later period in mrzezino canal tp concentrations corresponded to the first class limit except for summer peak concentrations in summer 2018 in zagorska struga and reda river the elevated first class limit tp concentrations were observed only incidentally in water samples of piaśnica karwianka and czarna wda rivers located in the northern region of poland the po 4 3 ions were in the range of 0 11 0 62 mg p l 1 baczkowska et al 2021 3 1 3 nutrients in surface waters from drainage ditches the assessment of the state of water pollution was carried out in the scope of nitrate pollution and susceptibility to eutrophication the assessment of nitrate pollution was done based the population of results falling within the water quality classes 0 24 99 25 39 99 40 50 and 50 mg no 3 l 1 in accordance with the guidelines for preparing reports on the implementation of the nitrates directive by the member states the assessment of the susceptibility of waters to eutrophication was carried out based on a comparison of the obtained results nitrate nitrogen total nitrogen and total phosphorus with the limit values of the basic indicators of eutrophication of waters above which eutrophication occurs according to the regulation of the minister of the environment of december 23 2002 on the criteria for determining waters sensitive to nitrogen pollution from agricultural sources journal of laws 2002 241 2093 currently considered repealed the assessment of the state of water pollution with nutrients in drainage ditches in the puck commune showed in particular that only 5 2 of the samples tested had water contaminated with nitrates or threatened with nitrate contamination due to exceeding the limit values of eutrophication indicators nitrate total nitrogen and total phosphorus the share of the analysed water samples was relatively small one eutrophication indicator was exceeded at most in 29 of the samples as an annual average fig 9 in comparison at least one eutrophication rate was found to be exceeded at nearly 70 of the monitoring points located in drainage ditches in the whole country the limit value of the eutrophication rate in flowing waters annual average is as follows total phosphorus ptot 0 25 mg p l 1 total nitrogen ntot 5 0 mg n l 1 nitrate nitrogen 2 2 mg n no 3 l 1 however similar results from the other tests performed in the region are not available in literature the drainage ditches are located mainly in agricultural areas the obtained results of nutrient concentrations confirm the seasonal variability typical for agricultural areas matej lukowicz et al 2020 wojciechowska et al 2019a 3 1 4 nutrients distribution and flux via sgd details related to the groundwater sgd influence on pore water salinity and sgd rate in the bay of puck can be found in kłostowska et al 2020 generally the usual seawater salinity in the bay of puck oscillates around 7 0 and typically significantly lower surface water salinities indicate the freshwater source such as precipitation and or rivers within all collected samples the oxidation reduction potential eh ranged from 11 6 to 36 mv the dissolved oxygen concentrations ranged from 0 7 to 9 8 mg l 1 and the ph levels ranged from 4 9 to 8 3 the nutrients concentrations ranged from 0 2 to 45 1 mg n l 1 for po 4 3 from 3 1 to 488 9 mg n l 1 for nh 4 and from 0 0 to 506 6 mg n l 1 for no 3 in all collected samples szymczycha et al 2012 obtained similar results for po 4 3 and nh 4 apart from the nitrates concentrations observed in autumn that were significantly higher in this study szymczycha et al 2020 in order to estimate the nitrate ammonium and phosphate fluxes via sgd we used nutrients concentrations measured within the salinity gradients and depth profiles while the sgd was adopted from the previous study by kłostowska et al 2020 firstly we identified the minimum maximum average and median concentration for each measured nutrient and for each season the obtained data did not have a normal distribution therefore we calculated nutrients loads using median concentrations the seasonal fluxes of nutrients via sgd were calculated by multiplying median concentrations minimum and maximum rates finally the obtained nutrients loads corresponded to the average values standard deviation the estimated seasonal and annual loads of both dissolved inorganic nitrogen din 9303 t yr 1 and po 4 3 950 t yr 1 via sgd were the most significant source of nutrients to the bay of puck and remarkably higher than quantified before fresh sgd nutrients loads 50 t yr 1 and 56 t yr 1 for din and po 4 3 respectively the sgd fluxes reported here show some of the highest rates of sediment water fluxes reported in the baltic sea 3 1 5 nutrients in groundwater there were clear differences in nutrients concentration between shallow aquifers q0 and q1 and deeper aquifer q2 the concentrations of nutrients were higher in shallow wells fig 10 the nitrate no 3 concentrations in perched aquifer q0 ranged from 2 to 49 mg l 1 median 26 mg l 1 and in the upper quaternary aquifer q1 ranged from 0 1 92 mg l 1 median 10 mg l 1 while in contrast in the deeper quaternary aquifer q2 ranged from 0 1 1 mg l 1 median 0 3 mg l 1 the concentrations of ammonium nh 4 were similar in all aquifers but still slightly higher in shallow aquifers the obtained values in aquifers q0 q1 and q2 were respectively from 0 01 3 56 mg l 1 median 0 03 mg l 1 from 0 01 to 3 32 mg l 1 median 0 03 mg l 1 and from 0 01 0 37 mg l 1 median 0 14 mg l 1 the concentrations of phosphate po4 were clearly higher in the shallow wells the obtained values were in range from 0 16 to 6 38 mg l 1 median 0 5 mg l 1 in q0 aquifer from 0 1 3 06 mg l 1 median 0 37 mg l 1 in q1 aquifer and from 0 09 to 0 49 mg l 1 median 0 14 mg l 1 in q2 aquifer potrykus et al 2020 field and laboratory research of groundwater quality shows a local contamination caused by human activity the contamination is limited to shallow aquifers and has a local extent the analysis of groundwater samples indicates agricultural activity and municipal wastes as main reasons of groundwater contamination potrykus et al 2020 3 1 6 pesticides in waters and soils in all analysed water and soil samples the concentrations of organochlorine pesticides aldrin dieldrin endrin isodrine dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its isomers and alpha beta gamma and delta isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane were below the limit of detection of the used methodology pazikowska sapota et al 2020 however in soil samples surface waters from drainage ditches and watercourses as well as in groundwater samples out of 309 active substances examined the following pesticides have been detected organophosphatic insecticides chlorpyrifos ethyl fungicides boscalid epoxiconazole difenoconazole fluopicolide herbicides dimetachlor diflufenican metazachlor glyphosate and its metabolite ampa repellents anthraquinone the concentrations of detected pesticides in soil samples chlorpyrifos ethyl anthraquinone glyphosate and ampa ranged from 0 05 to 0 35 mg kg 1 the highest concentrations were obtained in august in water from drainage ditches for metazachlor 2 0 mg l 1 glyphosate 4 7 mg l 1 and ampa 2 0 mg l 1 in the surface water samples and sediment samples taken from the bay of puck none of the 309 substances from the pesticides group were found pazikowska sapota et al 2020 on the base of obtained results it can be concluded that the overall level of impact of farms from the puck commune on the environment including the quality of the waters of the bay of puck is relatively low it should be noted however that among the studied farms there were some whose environmental pressure determined by the surveys and specified pressure indicators had an unusually large dimension 3 2 calibration and validation results 3 2 1 swat swat calibration allowed to meet all 3 calibration criteria described earlier the annual groundwater recharge fluxes obtained from the model were 36 146 mm yr 1 vs the reference range of 19 186 mm yr 1 average annual evapotranspiration in the model was 459 mm yr 1 vs the reference range 450 495 mm yr 1 finally the average annual biomass dry mass production in the forest hru s was 6 1 8 5 t ha 1 yr 1 vs the reference range of 6 5 7 5 t ha 1 yr 1 validation was performed by comparing the daily simulated and observed flow rates for the period of operation of the monitoring network i e 01 06 2018 30 07 2019 the parameter me equals to 0 012 mse 0 032 and rmse 0 18 in the case of biomass crop yields obtained in the modelled basin are depending on hru parameters for example for winter wheat from 5 9 to 7 3 t ha 1 yr 1 average according to surveys 6 4 t ha 1 yr 1 for canola from 2 6 to 3 4 t ha 1 yr 1 surveys 3 8 t ha 1 yr 1 dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2019 overall the model performance was considered satisfactory and no further attempt was undertaken to improve biomass and yield predictions pesticide calibration was not included because in the watercourses modelled the presence of diflufenican was detected in only 1 sample pazikowska sapota et al 2020 3 2 2 groundpuck fig 10 and fig 11 shows that in most control points a satisfactory agreement between the measured and calculated groundwater heads was obtained the indicators of fit quality were as follows mean error 0 29 m mean absolute error 1 10 m root mean square error 1 79 m the lowest convergence is observed in the upper aquifer q1 mainly in the southwestern part of the model area it is a result of difficulties in the spatial projection of the aquifer layer variation of hydraulic conductivity values and probability of perched aquifer q0 occurrence which can be responsible for the increase of groundwater recharge taking into account the number of chemical analysis the distribution of sampling points and the mosaic variability of the nitrates concentrations in groundwater that may indicate the local influence of pollution source it would be difficult and less reliable to compare the results of simulations with use of reference points method therefore we approached the validation holistically and operated with the observed and simulated range values of n no 3 concentrations for the whole area of groundwater study table 1 shows a reasonable agreement between measurements and model in each aquifer in addition the calculated amount of water discharged from the upper q1 and lower q2 aquifers are in a good agreement with the results of previous studies related to groundwater outflow to the bay of puck piekarek jankowska 1994 kryza and kryza 2006 jaworska szulc 2009 lidzbarski 2015 in our model the total groundwater discharge to the sea from q1 and q2 is 1286 m3 h 1 which corresponds to 92 m3 h 1 per kilometer of the coastline the flow rate varies from 58 m3 h 1 km 1 in the upland areas to 152 m3 h 1 km 1 in the river valleys piekarek jankowska 1994 reported the rate of groundwater discharge to the bay of puck in the same area ranging from 21 to 165 m3 h 1 km 1 with an average of 98 m3 h 1 km 1 while jaworska szulc 2009 estimated the rate of groundwater discharge to the bay of puck in the reda river valley as 165 m3 h 1 km 1 3 2 3 ecopuckbay we validated the ecopuckbay model for two hydrodynamic parameters temperature and salinity and four biochemical parameters oxygen nitrates phosphates chlorophyll a detailed results for the hydrodynamic part of the epb model validation have been described in dybowski et al 2019 while biochemical part validation of the epb model has been extensively presented in dybowski et al 2020b in both cited studies we used modified taylor diagrams because in our opinion their use together with mean error is the best way to present the quality of model data in relation to environmental measurements the epb model simulation run has been performed for the time period from january 2011 to december 2018 the voivodship inspectorate of environmental protection viep in gdańsk provided monitoring data from january 2014 to decemver 2017 the nemo nordic model data covered 2014 2016 years and nemo scobi model data covered 2014 2017 measurement data from s y oceania was taken during the 2018 summer cruise table 2 summarizes the statistical comparison between the epb modelled results and reference data the correlation coefficients ranges from 0 92 to 0 98 for temperature from 0 17 to 0 90 for salinity where 0 17 is for comparison with the numerical model nemo scobi which horizontal resolution is about 40 times lower than epb and from 0 56 to 0 75 for biochemical variables o2 no 3 po 4 3 chlorophyll a correct stratification of temperature and salinity especially in vertical profiles using data from s y oceania indirectly also gives information about the correctness of vertical mixing in the model while the spatio temporal agreement with viep monitoring data allows us to state that the currents are also correctly represented in the model in the case of sea surface height ssh the resolution of the model data also the fact that the model produced mean values from the 6 hour time window and the lack of access to measurement data forced us to abandon direct validation of ssh it should be emphasized that the ssh is not of main interest in the presented tool but is only an additional variable that we have decided to show for ammonia and silicates we have compared for the purpose of this article our results from epb model to the international council for the exploration of the sea ices data https www ices dk data and summarized in table 3 comparing the mean values and their standard deviations we conclude that the range of variability of the concentration of ammonia and silicates is correct in the case of pesticides as a result of extensive monitoring in the waters of the bay of puck no pesticides were detected only 1 sample with diflufenican detected the epb model based on the inflow of pesticides from the swat model distributes the biochemical load including pesticides inside the bay of puck and these values are below the limit of quantification the last parameter group of epb labelled as nutrient spread nitrate phosphate ammonia max spread is described in the article by dybowski et al 2020b the nutrient spread module describes the diffusion and advection of nutrients under the influence of sea currents data on the flow and concentration of nutrients are provided once a day at the land water border from the swat model there are no references in the literature to studies using numerical models with such high resolution as the epb for the studied area however the concentration of nutrients in the gulf of gdańsk of which the bay of puck is a part is monitored and thoroughly investigated lysiak pastuszak 2000 kot wasik et al 2003 kruk dowgiałło 2008 and the use of the epb model should make it easier to assess the environmental state of the bay of puck 3 3 waterpuck toolkit s capabilities the real potential of the waterpuck toolkit lies in its practical implementation in the form of an online service that is easy to access and simple to use the whole set of developed tools is available through the website https waterpuck pl en products tab in the following subsections we are presenting the capabilities offered by key modules of the created toolkit 3 3 1 database the waterpuck database is a tool that connects and enables the communication between the individual elements of the solution it is operated from the map view level and allows the user to find the necessary data and meta information in a short time all measurement points collected in the database are visualised in the form of markers placed on the map the data can be downloaded directly to the local device and can also be presented in the form of a graph in a web browser table 4 shows the ranges of nitrate nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus measured concentrations for different environments in the studied area the maximum observed nitrate nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus concentrations decrease with the subsequent environments in which they are propagated an exception to this rule is the transition from surface water to groundwater here we observe higher concentrations in groundwater than in surface water for phosphates phosphorus data on nitrate and phosphate concentrations in surface run off for puck commune s watershed were published matej lukowicz et al 2020 wojciechowska et al 2019a 2019b and the range of variation of n no 3 and p po 4 3 presented in the table 4 is consistent with previous studies the concentration of orthophosphates for sgd is consistent with the szymczycha et al 2012 study while the maximum concentration of nitrates for sgd is significantly higher than in the quoted study measurements of nutrients concentrations with the highest possible spatial and temporal resolution while maintaining an accurate and high quality database allows for the highest quality studies in the field of water contamination from agricultural activity 3 3 2 surface water model the user can perform using a web interface a simulation of agricultural pollution entering the bay of puck with surface run off the quality and quantity of water inflow are calculated in the swat model two modes for visualising the results are available 1 general data where one can simulate and produce forecast for the concentrations of selected nutrients and pesticides in surface run off and rivers within the puck commune waterpuck swat 2021b 2 calculator allows the user to perform simulations after making changes regarding crops doses and types of fertilisers and plant protection products waterpuck swat 2021a in the general data view it is possible to select two parameters for presentation soil and channel assessment soil assessment shows the spatial variability of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus compounds present in surface run off channel assessment shows the time variability of flow rate and the amount of nutrients present in watercourses kg as well as pesticides as mg of active substance meteorological conditions have a significant impact on the amount of nutrients leached out by surface run off the optimal dose of the fertiliser should depend on the forecasted rainfall therefore through the online interface the user has to choose one of the following rainfall scenarios real rainfall dry year simulation 70 real rainfall and wet year 120 real rainfall general data mode allows presenting results in two ways graphical presentation of the entire analysed area with the option of choosing a displayed period the exact value for the selected place or section of the river in addition for watercourse results it is possible to present a time series of nutrient and or pesticide concentrations in the watercourses over a selected period of time in the calculator mode one should mark the field location for which the simulation will be carried out in the place indicated on the map a house symbol appears and at the same time a list of required inputs shows up the user should enter the size of the analysed field and the planned doses of fertiliser and pesticide from the drop down lists plant type fertiliser type and pesticide type can be chosen after selecting the plant based on the tested agricultural calendars input files for the swat model will be generated regarding the agricultural practices used e g date of sowing ploughing fertilising harvesting etc files are created for each agricultural hru after performing a full simulation for the changed land development and dosing of fertilisers and pesticides a preview known from the general view will be displayed enabling a thorough analysis of the results obtained in addition under the map a comment on the amount of nutrients leaching will appear 3 3 3 groundpuck the associated web interface service allows the user to visualise the results of simulations groundwater heads and concentrations of nitrogen in nitrate form n no 3 for a selected day from the simulation period visualisation is possible for one of the three layers of the model representing aquifers water bearing layer q0 layer 1 of the model q1 layer 3 of the model and q2 layer 5 of the model as shown in fig 4 the user has to choose the date using the calendar shown on the webpage from the dropdown lists below the calendar one can choose the type of data groundwater head or n no 3 concentration and the considered aquifer q0 q1 q2 next one has to click the generate map button to display the data of interest on the map the groundwater head values are given in m a s l the values can be higher than the ground surface elevation due to artesian pressures in some regions of the model the concentrations of n no 3 are given in mg l 1 the results of groundwater simulations are passed to the hydrodynamic and ecological models of the bay of puck the rate of groundwater discharge from q1 and q2 aquifers to the sea and the corresponding loads of n no 3 3 3 4 ecopuckbay another tool that is directly fed with data from both the swat and groundpuck models is the epb model for the convenience of presentation we have created separate entries for individual components of the model i e the hydrodynamic part of epb the biochemical part of epb and the nutrient spread model the presentation of data from the epb model is handled in a very intuitive way in each of the three presentation modes in the first step a day is selected from the calendar then for the hydrodynamic part one of the four physical parameters i e temperature salinity sea level or currents for the biochemical part one of the seven parameters i e nitrate phosphate ammonia silicate chlorophyll a oxygen or pesticide and for the nutrient spread model one of the four options i e nitrate phosphate ammonia or maximum spread range finally for the hydrodynamic and biochemical part one of the three available data presentation methods i e area maps time series or vertical section is selected using the nutrient spread model it is possible to model the expected distribution of agricultural substances in the waters of the bay in a short period of time 10 days which can be helpful when extreme events occur and in making decisions to mitigate the negative effects associated with them for example when the forecast predicts very intense rainfall regulations may be issued encouraging farmers to postpone fertilisation which will also be beneficial for them 3 3 5 use of the waterpuck toolkit by farmers according to the nitrates directive farmers have to calculate the doses of nitrogen fertiliser this ensures that fertilisation is appropriate to the plants nutritional requirements and is economical and sustainable the waterpuck product makes it possible to calculate the environmental impact of a selected fertilisation scheme it focuses on the nutrients that have the most destructive effect on the ecosystem nitrogen and phosphorus the farmer can estimate the fertiliser losses during the production cycle by selecting different available fertilizers and applying them at a chosen location the farmer using the waterpuck toolkit can also calculate nitrogen losses for different fertilisation plans for example on a field of 100 ha of winter wheat with expected yield of 5 tonnes ha 1 a pre sowing application of 75 kg ha 1 of urea then 218 kg ha 1 of nitrochalk calcium ammonium nitrate in the first dose and finally 130 kg ha 1 of urea in the second dose resulted in 2578 kg of nitrogen and 312 kg of phosphorus including mineral 77 kg n 9 kg p for entire year however when we increase the expected value of the yield to 7 tonnes ha 1 using 75 kg ha 1 of urea in pre sowing 316 kg ha 1 of nitrochalk in the first dose and 186 kg ha 1 in the second dose then we get 2647 kg of nitrogen and 314 kg of phosphorus including mineral 118 kg n 9 kg p for entire year the above example was presented for a field located close to the coastline not further than 2 km however if we apply the same data for a field located approximately three times further from the coastline the following results will be obtained 1128 kg of nitrogen and 130 kg of phosphorus including mineral 42 kg n 2 kg p for entire year expected yield of 5 tonnes ha 1 and 1140 kg of nitrogen and 136 kg of phosphorus including mineral 65 kg n 2 kg p for entire year expected yield of 7 tonnes ha 1 from the previous examples we know what nitrogen losses occur when using urea for pre sowing so let s replace it with polifoska 17 17 18 with a dose of 200 kg ha 1 in order to keep the amount of nitrogen similar to the amount used in the example using urea then we will get 2564 kg of nitrogen and 315 kg of phosphorus including mineral 64 kg n 12 kg p for entire year expected yield of 5 tonnes ha 1 from filed located near the coastline in the last example we will check what the result of nitrogen loss will be when replacing urea used in the second dose with ammonium sulfate with a dose of 176 kg ha which does not change the amount of nitrogen compared to the example with urea and then we will get 2568 kg of nitrogen and 312 kg of phosphorus including mineral 72 kg n 9 kg p for entire year expected yield of 5 tonnes ha 1 from filed located near the coastline 4 discussion the online waterpuck toolkit which is the result of both environmental research aimed at verifying the mathematical models and their correct parameterisation and numerical research gives a real advantage to several target groups the first group of recipients of the created toolkit are farmers using the tools available from waterpuck online interface they can calculate the nutrient balance nutrient efficiency and the amount of nitrogen that is leached out of the field when planning the fertilisation these tools allow farmers to make more efficient use of the means of production available on their farms while respecting the environment and as a result reduce the amount of substances that could potentially endanger them important information for the farmer is the amount of nutrient loss depending on the form of nitrogen in the fertiliser the user can compare possible fertilisation variants and thus evaluate their efficiency and reduce losses calculate what losses will occur when using different forms of nitrogen e g amides and nitrates the product takes into account the spatial variation of soil parameters so that each farmer has an individual view of fertiliser losses the diversity of soils and a large database of fertilisers makes it possible to analyse many variants of cultivation and fertilisation this makes the tool flexible and gives it potential in local agricultural advisory services the calculator makes it possible to visualise the spatial variation of nutrient losses over the whole municipality the swat model is a tool that also contributes to increasing knowledge on the optimal production means dosage the use of swat is very intuitive as the farmer indicates on the map the location of his farm and enters data on the planned crop fertilisation and protection plans for the next production period as a result receives feedback on the environmental impact of the changes for different assessments and rainfall scenarios another group are scientists for whom quick access to detailed data on the state of environmental pollution from the place of application through propagation to various places of its accumulation is essential it also creates the possibility of conducting research in a comprehensive manner without omitting the complexity of the issue in addition the knowledge gathered in such a comprehensive way makes it possible to develop predictions of possible long term environmental effects which is necessary to implement effective strategies to protect the environment quick access to very detailed phenomena taking place in the environment may be also extremely important for testing hypotheses about the dynamic of those processes for example using the data presentation interface for the epb model we can observe a very interesting phenomenon of anti cyclonal eddy and its impact on all monitored variables inside the bay this kind of knowledge is highly important for a short term assessment of the impact of various types of extreme pollution that may arise from water treatment system failures the interest group for which the use of our solution may be beneficial is the policymakers with the help of solutions developed and described in this study it is expected to benefit from provided expert knowledge and make responsible long term decisions respecting the assumptions of sustainable development of rural areas with particular attention to environmental protection it should be mentioned that there are currently solutions in use that partially overlap with the toolkit we proposed and were collected and briefly described in the table 5 although there are many common features among the solutions presented in the table 5 our solution is the only one that comprehensively addresses the environmental impact of agriculture from the production planning stage to the final propagation of pollution in the aquatic environment both land and marine for example a cool farm tool and comet farm vetter et al 2018 ziegler et al 2016 focuses mainly on the carbon cycle or for aquatic environment on water footprint caused by irrigation there is also an interesting study on so called healthy farm index by quinn et al 2013 but it is mainly focused on biodiversity 5 conclusions solutions that comprehensively connect the marine and land environment are essential for resource monitoring and management especially in the coastal zone which plays a beneficial role for humans moreover considering the individual elements of the solution as separate and unconnected may lead to an underestimation overestimation of the potential effects of planned regulation improved understanding of sea land interactions in the context of hazardous substances will contribute to achieving the goals set by european legislation which aims to improve the state of marine waters that is also the ultimate result of waterpuck project implementation the systematic use of the waterpuck toolkit by farmers particularly the farm balance calculator nitrogen leaching calculator and swat s calculator mode allows for more efficient management of production means while respecting the environment creation of environmental database and its availability for decision makers environmental ngos and other interested stakeholders is an additional indirect benefit for the society achieved from waterpuck toolkit implementation the environmental database gathers data from the literature monitoring and adds new data obtained within the project with the aim to inform management authorities of the bay of puck including public consultations this is especially important as publicly available data are still scarce and access to them is often restricted the waterpuck toolkit is designed so that it can be applied to other regions around the world a necessary condition for the success of its application is to carry out the calibration process described in this study the key was to set up the database in such a way that each of the system s component tools could easily use the necessary information for its correct operation which was ensured in our solution funding this research was funded by national centre for research and development of poland within the biostrateg
