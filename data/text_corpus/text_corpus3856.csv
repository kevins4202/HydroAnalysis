19280,dissolved organic carbon doc removal from a river water source was investigated using ion exchange iex coagulation and membrane filtration this research linked the variable charge characteristics of the organic compounds present in the source water with removal by iex and coagulation the raw water charge density fluctuated considerably between 5 4 and 10 7 meq mgdoc 1 and controlled removal of the charge loading importantly charge density was not correlated with the organic carbon concentration the combined iex and coagulation process reduced the specific dbp fp sdbp fp of the final water with values as low as 18 μg mgdoc 1 for both haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes iex removed a particular fraction of nom that 1 enhanced coagulation efficiency providing increased removal of overall doc and 2 enabled coagulation to subsequently remove higher levels of specific components of nom that have a high dbp fp the component of nom removed by iex that had a positive impact on coagulation was identified to be charged low molecular weight organic compounds of all hydrophobicity levels resulting in a reduced specific dbp fp compared to coagulation alone

dominant by mass and are used as indicators of a wide range of other dbps li and mitch 2018 therefore the concentration of these compounds in drinking water are regulated worldwide in the us thms are

1998 ion exchange iex is an increasingly applied process for the reduction of nom particularly in circumstances where coagulation alone is unable to achieve the required level of nom removal in this process an anionic exchange resin is used to remove negatively charged organic compounds by the exchange of a counter ion usually chloride from the resin surface a large proportion of nom carries a negative charge mostly attributed to acidic functional groups mainly present in an ionic form at ph 4 bolto et al 2004 iex resins can be used in fixed columns or mixed in the water in suspended reactors in commercial systems such as suspended ion exchange six and magnetic ion exchange miex processes cornelissen et al 2009 watson et al 2015 metcalfe et al 2015 for nom removal applications suspended systems have proven to be more effective as a pre treatment prior to coagulation this configuration allows treatment of waters containing suspended solids and shorter contact times through increased rates of mass transfer kishore and verma 2006 bazri and mohseni 2016 in the six process the resin is suspended in the raw water and is separated after a defined contact time in a plug flow contactor the used resin is regenerated before it is reinjected into the system shorney darby et al 2014 a reduction in dbp formation potential dbp fp in waters treated by iex has been observed and some studies have found a similar or even superior reduction of dbp fp compared to coagulation boyer and singer 2005 metcalfe et al 2015 however reduction in both overall dbp concentration and the specific thm fp mg of dbp per g of dissolved organic carbon doc by iex alone can be higher or lower than coagulation depending on the raw water composition metcalfe et al 2015 when iex processes are used in combination with coagulation higher removal of nom and reduced dbp fp compared to conventional coagulation has been consistently observed boyer and singer 2005 shorney darby et al 2014 watson et al 2015 this is because different groups of organic compound are being targeted by the two processes to provide higher combined removal of nom mergen et al 2009 several studies have also shown that iex combined with coagulation reduces the specific dbp fp and some have found a further reduction than that by optimised coagulation alone drikas et al 2011 in certain cases even when there was no reduction in the specific dbp fp after the iex stage metcalfe et al 2015 additionally the amount of coagulant used has been shown to be considerably reduced in a combined iex coagulation process crittenden et al 2012 and an increase in floc strength was found by jarvis et al 2008 this suggests selective removal of organic compounds by iex that improves coagulation performance however this may be occurring in a number of different ways and understanding these mechanisms is an important knowledge gap investigations on doc removal by iex often look at mw and hydrophobicity to understand removal behaviour grefte et al 2013 however information linking nom removal by iex the charge characteristics of the organic compounds present in real water sources is often overlooked this is important given that nom charge density is seasonally variable and can change rapidly and may not always be coincidental with a change in uv254 or doc concentration often the main way by which iex dosing is controlled in the current work the combined influence of nom hydrophobicity mw and charge were investigated to understand the selective removal of organics by iex to determine the importance of variable charge load and charge density on the removal process 2 materials and methods an iex pilot plant was used consisting of suspended ion exchange six process from pwn technology netherlands in line coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration ccmf supplementary information figure s1 this was compared with a full scale water treatment works wtw comprising coagulation and membrane ultrafiltration water feeding both plants was from a holding reservoir containing water from the river dee at invercannie wtws this study was carried out between may and october 2017 following a commissioning and optimisation stage fresh resin was added to the six at the start of the study to enable understanding of the change in treatment performance as the resin was used multiple times in this period the pilot plant was operated with both units six ccmf for a period of three weeks 14th august till 04th september no six pre treatment was used and raw water was directly coagulated and treated by the membrane ccmf 2 1 six and ccmf pilot plant the process was run with and without the six process enabling understanding of the influence of iex on nom removal by coagulation and membrane filtration the iex resin was a gel type strongly basic anion exchange resin with an acrylic quaternary amine backbone in the chloride form lewatit s5128 lanxess germany the resin was selected based on a previous pre screening process for the water source raw water contacted with the resin under plug flow conditions at a flow rate of 7 m3 h 1 a resin concentration of 25 ml l 1 was applied at a contact time of 30 min based on data from a preliminary study for the water the resin dose contact time and flow was kept constant for the duration of the study the resin was separated from the water by a lamella contactor and regenerated with sodium chloride 25 g l 1 cl following iex water was adjusted to ph 6 4 using caustic soda and sulphuric acid polyaluminium chloride pacl was added as a coagulant at a dose based on the uv transmittance uvt of the water from an online solids compensated uvt unit spectro lyser s can austria the pacl had a specific gravity of 1 22 a basicity of 37 9 and an aluminium content of 5 3 the coagulant dose was calculated from algorithms developed from jar testing of the water table s1 the average coagulant dose for six ccmf was 2 13 mg l 1 or 0 47 mgal3 mgdoc 1 range 0 19 6 04 mg l 1 or 0 07 0 82 mgal3 mgdoc 1 and for ccmf 3 73 mg l 1 or 0 75 mgal3 mgdoc 1 range 1 58 6 06 mg l 1 or 0 44 1 19 mgal3 mgdoc 1 after in line coagulation ilca the water was filtered through a ceramic membrane pore size 0 1 μm surface area 25 m2 at a flux of 150 250 l m 2 h 1 lmh the membrane was backwashed bw after loading between 50 and 167 l m 2 and underwent an enhanced bw ebw after 500 1500 l m 2 the ebw was carried out using naocl 100 mg l 1 free cl2 or h2o2 100 mg l 1 ph 2 details in table s1 samples were taken after treatment by iex and then following membrane treatment 2 2 wtw the wtws operated at an average of 39 ml day 1 raw water was adjusted to ph 6 9 using lime pacl was added as the coagulant and had the same properties as that used in the pilot plant pacl dose was automatically optimised based on raw water colour approximately 1 2 mg l 1 al3 per 20 hazen resulting in an average of 1 62 mg l 1 or 0 37 mgal3 mgdoc 1 range 0 35 3 34 mg l 1 0 22 to 0 70 mgal3 mgdoc 1 the coagulated water was filtered from out to in using polyvinylidene difluoride s10v evoqua membranes with a pore size of 0 04 μm a total membrane surface area of 11 048 m2 was available 6 cells containing 396 elements each allowing a flux of 21 4 30 2 lmh samples of raw water and permeate were taken for analyses 2 3 sample analysis samples for uva254 measurement were pre filtered with a 0 45 μm syringe filter and analysed using a hach dr6000 spectrophotometer hach lange germany 5 cm quartz cuvette cell doc was measured using a non purgable organic carbon method on a shimadzu toc l analyser eqs 24h or a skalar formacs ht toc analyser all samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter prior to analysis a series of xad7 and xad4 resin were used to separate the doc into hydrophobic hpo transphilic tpi and hydrophilic hpi fractions using adapted methods described in bond et al 2010 haa and thm fp were determined from pre filtered 0 45 μm samples diluted to 1 mg l 1 doc water was spiked with naocl to give 5 mg l 1 free chlorine and stored for 7 days in the dark at 25 c after quenching with thiosulfate the samples were analysed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd was carried out to determine the relative molecular weight distribution of organic compounds in water as it passed through various treatment stages samples were analysed by het water laboratorium haarlem netherlands according to the methods described in huber et al 2011 zeta potential and charge density experiments were determined using a zetasizer malvern nano series worcestershire uk for zeta potential measurements samples were filled in a polystyrene latex folded capillary cell equilibrated to 25 c and measured three times with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 100 runs charge determinations were carried out using an adapted method of kam and gregory 2001 polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride pdadmac was purchased from sigma aldrich dorset uk and diluted to obtain a concentration of 416 mg l 1 for six treated samples of doc 1 3 mg l 1 a further dilution to 8 32 or 41 6 mg l 1 was applied the solution was delivered stepwise to a stirred 15 ml sample adjusted to ph 7 by an autotitrator mpt 2 with a 3 ch degasser malvern resulting in pdadmac concentrations between 1 0 and 20 0 mg l 1 for raw water and 0 04 15 0 mg l 1 for six treated water after each addition the solution was pumped into a folded capillary cell and zeta potential was measured the point of zero charge pzc was determined by fitting a linear regression through the data points of at least three measurements and the pdadmac concentration was converted into charge load using a charge density of 6 2 meq g 1 for pdadmac charge density was calculated by normalising the meq l 1 concentration to the doc of the sample to give meq per g doc charge measurements of the final water were not performed because particulates were removed from the water through the micro and ultrafiltration processes used 3 results and discussion the raw water was of low turbidity 0 2 1 4 ntu and low alkalinity ranging between 10 and 29 mghco3 l 1 with nitrate and sulphate concentrations from 0 50 to 1 28 mgno3 l 1 and 1 9 4 5 mgso42 l 1 respectively table 1 the raw water entering the wtws and the pilot plant fluctuated between 1 5 and 10 1 mg l 1 for doc and 4 7 to 42 0 m 1 for uva fig 1 the six process removed an average of 1 5 mg l 1 of doc and 6 8 m 1 of uva with a maximum removal of 2 4 mg l 1 of doc and 12 1 m 1 uva the removal of nom generally tracked the pattern of the raw water indicating that under the operating conditions the doc concentration did not influence the removal capacity of the resin the doc concentration in the final water after six ccmf had a mean of 0 7 mg l 1 with values as low as 0 2 mg l 1 and a maximum of 1 4 mg l 1 uva 0 2 to 2 6 m 1 this was considerably lower than the concentrations found in the final water for both the ccmf and the wtws which had a mean doc concentration of 1 3 mg l 1 range 0 5 2 2 mg l 1 and 2 1 mg l 1 range 1 4 2 8 mg l 1 respectively a cumulative probability plot showed that 82 of all doc measurements were below 1 mg l 1 for six ccmf while only 17 of the doc measurements were below this value for ccmf and only 46 were below 2 mg l 1 for the wtw fig 2 robustness of doc removal was evaluated using an adjusted method described by jarvis et al 2008 the steepness of the slope in the linear region of the cumulative probability curve between 15 and 85 was used to evaluate robustness where a steeper slope indicates a more robust system fig 2 comparison of the slopes identified that six ccmf was 34 more robust than ccmf and 69 more robust than the wtw showing that the six ccmf process had a much narrower range around this lower mean value additionally the coagulant dose was 30 lower when six ccmf was used compared to ccmf this is in agreement with previous results where reductions of coagulant of up to 50 60 have been seen when iex was used upstream of coagulation grefte et al 2013 the reduction in doc in the treated water was generally concurrent with a decrease in the dbp fp while the proportion of the six removed nom decreased with increasing nom load due to limitations in the capacity of the resin for a consistent resin dose the overall improvements in doc and sdbp fp were still observed following subsequent coagulation there was a strong positive linear relationship between the raw and six treated water thm and haa fp fig 3 a and b for example raw water haa and thm fp of 260 and 196 μg l 1 were reduced to 30 and 32 μg l 1 while a raw water dbp fp of 2677 and 1525 μg l 1 for thms and haas were reduced to 2210 and 1366 μg l 1 this can be attributed to the lower relative nom removal at higher initial concentrations which were 2 4 and 8 6 mg l 1 doc for the described cases for the six ccmf a weaker but positive relationship was seen between the raw and treated water however overall the concentration of dbps was lower than for all of the other treatment processes regardless of the incoming dbp fp haa and thm fp were measured as low as 9 and 7 μg l 1 with an average of 30 and 33 μg l 1 respectively comparatively the dbp fps obtained in the final water for ccmf and wtw as a function of the raw water dbp fps were consistently higher than for the final water of six ccmf demonstrating the benefit of the pre treatment this was particularly evident since the downstream coagulant dose to doc ratio was much lower for the iex treatment compared to ccmf 0 47 and 0 75 mgal3 mgdoc 1 respectively the lowest haa and thm fp values observed for ccmf were 52 and 57 μg l 1 and for the wtw 347 and 269 μg l 1 respectively iex treatment alone was not shown to reduce the sdbp fp for variable incoming water quality with both the shaa fp and sthm fp being similar to the incoming water quality fig 3c and d however the final water from the six ccmf had much lower shaa and sthm fp than all treatments for example the treated water from six ccmf had shaa and sthm fp of 18 68 μg mgdoc 1 mean 39 μg mgdoc 1 and 18 65 μg mgdoc 1 42 μg mgdoc 1 respectively the mean shaa fp concentration was 41 and 79 lower compared to ccmf and six while the average sthm fp was 35 and 65 lower respectively comparatively the average permeate shaa fp and sthm fps from the wtws were 107 16 μg mgdoc 1 and 80 7 μg mgdoc 1 the results suggest that iex plays a number of roles in improving nom removal by eliminating a particular fraction of nom that 1 enhances coagulation efficiency providing increased removal of overall doc and 2 enables coagulation to subsequently remove higher levels of specific components of nom that have a high dbp fp the following section investigates the key features of nom that controls its removal and the dbp fp dealing in turn with nom hydrophobicity mw and charge with respect to hydrophobicity figs s2a and s2b the hydrophobic compounds hpo represented the largest fraction in the raw water 62 6 consistent with results reported in previous studies for similar types of nom dominated water sources boyer and singer 2005 sharp et al 2006 the transphilic tpi fraction accounted for 22 4 and the hydrophilic hpi fraction 16 3 of the overall doc after six treatment the proportions of nom fractions did not change considerably this was also found when other nom specific suspended iex resins have been investigated boyer and singer 2005 suggesting that no preferential removal of any of the fractions occurred when the six effluent was treated with ccmf the proportion of the hpi fraction increased to 43 6 while the hpo fraction was reduced to 35 4 this was a result consistent with other coagulation studies that have shown preferential removal of hydrophobic nom by coagulation watson et al 2015 similar results to the overall doc removal were seen for the dbps with no correlation between the removed doc of the different fraction and a reduction in the sdbp fp fig s3 this is in line with researchers who have reported that all fractions contribute to the dbp fp hua and reckhow 2007 removal of nom by iex is primarily driven by charge which is present to differing degrees in all of the hydrophobicity fractions sharp et al 2006 removal of these organic compounds or a fraction of may be important in reducing significant dbp precursors however these results show that fractionation does not have sufficient sensitivity to show the nom which is selectively removed by iex molecular size is important in controlling removal by iex due to size exclusion effects bazri and mohseni 2016 the importance of the relative mws of nom on removal across the six and ccmf processes was investigated using lc ocd the lc ocd chromatogram profiles for the different processes before and after treatment show 4 peaks fig 4 peak 1 represents molecules 10 kda and peak 2 3 and 4 are associated with molecular weights of 1 kda 0 3 0 5 kda and 0 35 kda respectively huber et al 2011 for all raw water samples peak 2 was dominant showing that the bulk of the doc to be of medium molecular weight around 1 kda the profile presented in figure a shows a raw water with a doc concentration of 6 5 mg l 1 while the profiles in figure b d were from samples ranging between 2 3 and 7 4 mg l 1 doc integration of the peaks enabled a comparison of the removal of nom by size to be made for the different treatment systems when the raw water doc concentration was low 2 3 mg l 1 all peaks were substantially reduced fig 4b in this case the area of peak 2 and 3 were reduced by 83 and 78 by six respectively while peak 1 showed a reduction of 19 removal of peak 2 and 3 was expected as these smaller molecules diffuse more easily into the pores of the resin and are not restricted to exchange sites on the outside whereas larger molecules are rejected due to size exclusion winter et al 2018 lower removal of organic compounds around peak 4 40 seems contradictory to this statement however as has been noted it is not only size that defines the removal but also charge is of importance huber et al 2011 reported elution of neutral lmw nom around peak 4 elution time of 60 min suggesting these organic compounds carry little charge however peaks 2 and 3 have been associated with charged organic compounds shorney darby et al 2014 for higher doc concentrations 6 5 mg l 1 fig 4a the removal for all peaks was much less pronounced the removal obtained for peaks 2 3 and 4 were 13 20 and 17 respectively this can be explained by the limited capacity of the resin and possible blockage of the resin surface by large molecules at high doc concentrations the water profile for six ccmf showed a reduction of peak 1 and 2 by 88 and 100 compared to the six effluent showing the preferential removal of hmw fractions by coagulation fig 4a these results are consistent with those seen in the literature metcalfe et al 2015 likewise permeate of the wtw fig 4d showed high removal of the hmw fraction shown in peak 1 74 and peak 2 72 overall organic compounds represented in peaks 3 and 4 were targeted more effectively by iex shown by their consistently lower combined doc values in six ccmf compared to ccmf treated water across a broad range of water qualities 2 3 7 4 mg l 1 fig s4 this was further evidenced by determining the proportion of removed doc for each of the different peaks from the chromatographed doc cdoc fig 5 organic compounds represented in peak 2 had the highest proportion of the removed cdoc for six 76 while peaks 3 and 4 accounted for 15 and 7 for ccmf following six pre treatment 91 of the removed cdoc was from peak 2 while the values for peak 3 and 4 were both only 3 this confirms that iex has more specific removal of these lmw compounds compared to coagulation the profiles for ccmf compared to the wtws were very similar this shows that although the combined process had higher overall removal the compounds being targeted by the coagulation membrane process was similar a result consistent with the fractionation data the relative mw analysis showed better removal of lower mw organic compounds compared to coagulation processes however iex was effective in removing some organic compounds from all mw fractions apart from peak 1 the highest mw nom as a result of size exclusion of these compounds the charge load cl of the raw water was between 15 6 and 82 7 μeq l 1 and the charge density cd ranged from 5 4 to 10 7 meq mgdoc 1 showing variable charge composition of the raw water over the duration of the trial fig 6 these values are in line with cds measured for other nom laden water sources ranging from 0 3 to 16 7 meq mgdoc 1 bazri and mohseni et al 2016 boyer et al 2008 mergen et al 2009 as the cl in the raw water increased the residual cl in the six increased in a linear fashion fig 6 this showed a limit to the amount of charge that could be removed by the resin less than 0 1 of the theoretical resin capacity 1 25 meq ml 1 similarly low removal was reported by mergen et al 2009 who investigated charge load removal from different waters using magnetic iex resin capacity 0 5 meq ml 1 and found charge load removals of up to 31 μeq l 1 utilising 0 6 of the resin capacity this low utilisation was explained by organic compounds blocking the surface and internal pores of the resin in addition some compounds may be missed by the charge density method for example small compounds such as glutamic acid have been shown to be difficult to detected using the described titration method additionally anions sulphate nitrate hydrogen carbonate compete with organic molecules boyer et al 2008 liu et al 2017 and the required charge to remove these in the water source investigated here was calculated to be up to 2 9 of the resin capacity there was a weak positive correlation between raw water charge load and the removed charge load r2 0 41 fig 6 this showed that when there was more charge in the water the six process was able to remove more of this charge load as such when a shift in the concentration of charged molecules and or charged functional groups on individual molecules occurs in the raw water this will influence the removal of nom even when the doc concentration of the raw water does not change it is therefore helpful to normalise the charge in the raw water to doc and compare this with the amount of charge removed fig 7 there was a stronger relationship between these parameters r2 0 67 with higher charge density showing higher charge removal for example when the cd in the raw water was 7 7 meq gdoc 1 the charge load removal was 13 0 μeq l 1 while for a cd of 10 4 meq gdoc 1 the charge load removed was 21 9 μeq l 1 in both cases the raw water doc was 7 5 mg l 1 this aligns with the fact that more highly charged molecules are preferentially removed due to the stronger affinity to the ion exchange resin studies investigating removal of model compounds by iex have shown strong relationships between high removal and high charge density for example small organic acids such as citric and benzoic acids show high levels of removal finkbeiner et al 2017 given that lmw organic compounds were preferentially removed by iex it is plausible to consider that carboxylic acid compounds with high cd are well represented in the lmw fraction the scatter around the relationship between cd and cl removal was attributed to the influence of the size of organic molecules large molecules with significant charge density will be less well removed due to size exclusion effects this shows the importance of considering both nom charge and molecular size when considering removal however these results show that measuring charge density in the raw water is a more suitable parameter that can be used to determine removal of nom by iex compared to measurements such as doc and uva where there was no correlation with removal fig 7 this was presumably due to the fact that different concentrations of uncharged nom was present in the water this is an important observation as many wtws use online instruments that measure uv or doc to control iex resin dose by using cd it would be possible to more effectively control the iex dose in response to the change in charge load from the raw water which as has been shown is not always commensurate with an increase in nom concentration there was no obvious relationship between the dbp fp and the charge density following the six process fig s4 this further supports the view that iex does not always directly reduce dbp reactivity but facilitates better removal of the dbp precursors by coagulation previous work has shown that small organic acids inhibit the hydrolysis of aluminium coagulants by creating a stable complex between the metal salt and the ligands particularly dicarboxylates such as citrate and oxalate violante and violante 1980 more recent work on the removal of humic acid by polyaluminium chloride has shown a detrimental effect when certain counter ions including oxylate citrate and malate were present lin and lee 2013 complexation of these anions with the coagulant was the mechanism proposed to explain a deterioration in the polyaluminium cluster structure reducing the removal of the humic acid jarvis et al 2015 showed that the presence of small acids such as aspartic and oxalic acid reduced coagulation efficiency and some compounds including aspartic acid restricted floc growth organic compounds such as these would be effectively removed by iex allowing the coagulant to work more effectively on other compounds such as larger humic acid compounds which also tend to have higher dbp fp therefore the removal or reduction of specific compounds by iex is believed to be responsible for improved coagulation of the remaining doc by enhancing the interactions of the coagulant with the remaining organic compounds improving floc formation and size and increasing the available surface for adsorption of organic compounds the present study has extended our understanding further by elucidating that these specific organics are charged compounds of lmw with hydrophilic transphilic and hydrophobic character for future investigation analysis of the charge of the different size fractions could give a more detailed view on the interaction between molecular weight and charge density of organic compounds on their removal and the influence on the dbp fp in the final water the cost of implementing six with in line coagulation and ccmf has been estimated to be equal or lower than that of building a conventional clarification water treatment system metcalfe et al 2015 additional operational cost required for chemicals in the regeneration of the resin is compensated by a reduction in the required coagulant dose before the membrane a smaller footprint is needed for the six ccmf process compared to conventional processes as a result the economical case for implementing ion exchange combined with membrane processes makes ion exchange an attractive option for enhanced removal of dbp precursors 4 conclusions doc and uva of a fluctuating water source were successfully reduced using a novel suspended ion exchange technology upstream of coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration the process gave improved performance compared to coagulation filtration in both a pilot plant and at full scale in terms of removal of sum parameters doc uva as well as the specific formation potential of dbps the following conclusions could be drawn about the selective removal of organic compounds by iex analysis of hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic fractions revealed that there was no considerable change in the distribution of the fractions after six treatment compared to the raw water hydrophobicity was not shown to be contributor to removal by ion exchange iex preferentially removed compounds with a molecular weight around 1 kda higher charge densities improved the removal of charge load the results showed that charge describes removal behaviour better than other more normally monitored parameters the results of the combined analyses indicate that iex removes specific charged organics of low molecular weight regardless of their hydrophobicity and this improves the coagulation process

19280,dissolved organic carbon doc removal from a river water source was investigated using ion exchange iex coagulation and membrane filtration this research linked the variable charge characteristics of the organic compounds present in the source water with removal by iex and coagulation the raw water charge density fluctuated considerably between 5 4 and 10 7 meq mgdoc 1 and

increased removal of overall doc and 2 enabled coagulation to subsequently remove higher levels of specific components of nom that have a high dbp fp the component of nom removed by iex that had a

contactor the used resin is regenerated before it is reinjected into the system shorney darby et al 2014 a reduction in dbp formation potential dbp fp in waters treated by iex has been observed and some studies have found a similar or even superior reduction of dbp fp compared to coagulation boyer and singer 2005 metcalfe et al 2015 however reduction in both overall dbp concentration and the specific thm fp mg of dbp per g of dissolved organic carbon doc by iex alone can be higher or lower than coagulation depending on the raw water composition metcalfe et al 2015 when iex processes are used in combination with coagulation higher removal of nom and reduced dbp fp compared to conventional coagulation has been consistently observed boyer and singer 2005 shorney darby et al 2014 watson et al 2015 this is because different groups of organic compound are being targeted by the two processes to provide higher combined removal of nom mergen et al 2009 several studies have also shown that iex combined with coagulation reduces the specific dbp fp and some have found a further reduction than that by optimised coagulation alone drikas et al 2011 in certain cases even when there was no reduction in the specific dbp fp after the iex stage metcalfe et al 2015 additionally the amount of coagulant used has been shown to be considerably reduced in a combined iex coagulation process crittenden et al 2012 and an increase in floc strength was found by jarvis et al 2008 this suggests selective removal of organic compounds by iex that improves coagulation performance however this may be occurring in a number of different ways and understanding these mechanisms is an important knowledge gap investigations on doc removal by iex often look at mw and hydrophobicity to understand removal behaviour grefte et al 2013 however information linking nom removal by iex the charge characteristics of the organic compounds present in real water sources is often overlooked this is important given that nom charge density is seasonally variable and can change rapidly and may not always be coincidental with a change in uv254 or doc concentration often the main way by which iex dosing is controlled in the current work the combined influence of nom hydrophobicity mw and charge were investigated to understand the selective removal of organics by iex to determine the importance of variable charge load and charge density on the removal process 2 materials and methods an iex pilot plant was used consisting of suspended ion exchange six process from pwn technology netherlands in line coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration ccmf supplementary information figure s1 this was compared with a full scale water treatment works wtw comprising coagulation and membrane ultrafiltration water feeding both plants was from a holding reservoir containing water from the river dee at invercannie wtws this study was carried out between may and october 2017 following a commissioning and optimisation stage fresh resin was added to the six at the start of the study to enable understanding of the change in treatment performance as the resin was used multiple times in this period the pilot plant was operated with both units six ccmf for a period of three weeks 14th august till 04th september no six pre treatment was used and raw water was directly coagulated and treated by the membrane ccmf 2 1 six and ccmf pilot plant the process was run with and without the six process enabling understanding of the influence of iex on nom removal by coagulation and membrane filtration the iex resin was a gel type strongly basic anion exchange resin with an acrylic quaternary amine backbone in the chloride form lewatit s5128 lanxess germany the resin was selected based on a previous pre screening process for the water source raw water contacted with the resin under plug flow conditions at a flow rate of 7 m3 h 1 a resin concentration of 25 ml l 1 was applied at a contact time of 30 min based on data from a preliminary study for the water the resin dose contact time and flow was kept constant for the duration of the study the resin was separated from the water by a lamella contactor and regenerated with sodium chloride 25 g l 1 cl following iex water was adjusted to ph 6 4 using caustic soda and sulphuric acid polyaluminium chloride pacl was added as a coagulant at a dose based on the uv transmittance uvt of the water from an online solids compensated uvt unit spectro lyser s can austria the pacl had a specific gravity of 1 22 a basicity of 37 9 and an aluminium content of 5 3 the coagulant dose was calculated from algorithms developed from jar testing of the water table s1 the average coagulant dose for six ccmf was 2 13 mg l 1 or 0 47 mgal3

filtered through a ceramic membrane pore size 0 1 μm surface area 25 m2 at a flux of 150 250 l m 2 h 1 lmh the membrane was backwashed bw after loading between 50 and 167 l m 2 and underwent an enhanced bw ebw after 500 1500 l m 2 the ebw was carried out using naocl 100 mg l 1 free cl2 or h2o2 100 mg l 1 ph 2 details in table s1 samples were taken after treatment by iex and then following membrane treatment 2 2 wtw the wtws operated at an average of 39 ml day 1 raw water was adjusted to ph 6 9 using lime pacl was added as the coagulant and had the same properties as that used in the

m2 was available 6 cells containing 396 elements each allowing a flux of 21 4 30 2 lmh samples of raw water and permeate were taken for analyses 2 3 sample analysis samples for uva254 measurement were pre filtered with a 0 45 μm syringe filter and analysed using a hach dr6000 spectrophotometer hach lange germany 5 cm quartz cuvette cell doc was measured using a non purgable organic carbon method on a shimadzu toc l analyser eqs 24h or a skalar formacs ht toc analyser all samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter prior to analysis a series of xad7 and xad4 resin were used to separate the doc into hydrophobic hpo transphilic tpi and hydrophilic hpi fractions using adapted methods described in bond et al 2010 haa and thm fp were determined from pre filtered 0 45 μm samples diluted to 1 mg l 1 doc water was spiked with naocl to give 5 mg l 1 free chlorine and stored for 7 days in the dark at 25 c after quenching with thiosulfate the samples were analysed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd was carried out to determine the relative molecular weight distribution of organic compounds in water as it passed through various treatment stages samples were analysed by het water laboratorium haarlem netherlands according to the methods described in huber et al 2011 zeta potential and charge density experiments were determined using a zetasizer malvern nano series worcestershire uk for zeta potential measurements samples were filled in a polystyrene latex folded capillary cell equilibrated to 25 c and measured three times with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 100 runs charge determinations were carried out using an adapted method of kam and gregory 2001 polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride pdadmac was purchased from sigma aldrich dorset uk and diluted to obtain a concentration of 416 mg l 1 for six treated samples of doc 1 3 mg l 1 a further dilution to 8 32 or 41 6 mg l 1 was applied the solution was delivered stepwise to a stirred 15 ml sample adjusted to ph 7 by an autotitrator mpt 2 with a 3 ch degasser malvern resulting in pdadmac concentrations between 1 0 and 20 0 mg l 1 for raw water and 0 04 15 0 mg l 1 for six treated water after each addition the solution was pumped into a folded capillary cell and zeta potential was measured the point of zero charge pzc was determined by fitting a linear regression through the data points of at least three measurements and the pdadmac concentration was converted into charge load using a charge density of 6 2 meq g 1 for pdadmac charge density was calculated by normalising the meq l 1 concentration to the doc of the sample to give meq per g doc charge measurements of the final water were not performed because particulates were removed from the water through the micro and ultrafiltration processes used 3 results and discussion the raw water was of low turbidity 0 2 1 4 ntu and low alkalinity ranging between 10 and 29 mghco3 l 1 with nitrate and sulphate concentrations from 0 50 to 1 28 mgno3 l 1 and 1 9 4 5 mgso42 l 1 respectively table 1 the raw water entering the wtws and the pilot plant fluctuated between 1 5 and 10 1 mg l 1 for doc and 4 7 to 42 0 m 1 for uva fig 1 the six process removed an average of 1 5 mg l 1 of doc and 6 8 m 1 of uva with a maximum removal of 2 4 mg l 1 of doc and 12 1 m 1 uva the removal of nom generally tracked the pattern of the raw water indicating that under the operating conditions the doc concentration did not influence the removal capacity of the resin the doc concentration in the final water after six ccmf had a mean of 0 7 mg l 1 with values as low as 0 2 mg l 1 and a maximum of 1 4 mg l 1 uva 0 2 to 2 6 m 1 this was considerably lower than the concentrations found in the final water for both the ccmf and the wtws which had a mean doc concentration of 1 3 mg l 1 range 0 5 2 2 mg l 1 and 2 1 mg l 1 range 1 4 2 8 mg l 1 respectively a cumulative probability plot showed that 82 of all doc measurements were below 1 mg l 1 for six ccmf while only 17 of the doc measurements were below this value for ccmf and only 46 were below 2 mg l 1 for the wtw fig 2 robustness of doc removal was evaluated using an adjusted method described by jarvis et al 2008 the steepness of the slope in the linear region of the cumulative probability curve between 15 and 85 was used to evaluate robustness where a steeper slope indicates a more robust system fig 2 comparison of the slopes identified that six ccmf was 34 more robust than ccmf and 69 more robust than the wtw showing that the six ccmf process had a much narrower range around this lower mean value additionally the coagulant dose was 30 lower when six ccmf was used compared to ccmf this is in agreement with previous results where reductions of coagulant of up to 50 60 have been seen when iex was used upstream of coagulation grefte et al 2013 the reduction in doc in the treated water was generally concurrent with a decrease in the dbp fp while the proportion of the six removed nom decreased with increasing nom load due to limitations in the capacity of the resin for a consistent resin dose the overall improvements in doc and sdbp fp were still observed following subsequent coagulation there was a strong positive linear relationship between the raw and six treated water thm and haa fp fig 3 a and b for example raw water haa and thm fp of 260 and 196 μg l 1 were reduced to 30 and 32 μg l 1 while a raw water dbp fp of 2677 and 1525 μg l 1 for thms and haas were reduced to 2210 and 1366 μg l 1 this can be attributed to the lower relative nom removal at higher initial concentrations which were 2 4 and 8 6 mg l 1 doc for the described cases for the six ccmf a weaker but positive relationship was seen between the raw and treated water however overall the concentration of dbps was lower than for all of the other treatment processes regardless of the incoming dbp fp haa and thm fp were measured as low as 9 and 7 μg l 1 with an average of 30 and 33 μg l 1 respectively comparatively the dbp fps obtained in the final water for ccmf and wtw as a function of the raw water dbp fps were consistently higher than for the final water of six ccmf demonstrating the benefit of the pre treatment this was particularly evident since the downstream coagulant dose to doc ratio was much lower for the iex treatment compared to ccmf 0 47 and 0 75 mgal3 mgdoc 1 respectively the lowest haa and thm fp values observed for ccmf were 52 and 57 μg l 1 and for the wtw 347 and 269 μg l 1 respectively iex treatment alone was not shown to reduce the sdbp fp for variable incoming water quality with both the shaa fp and sthm fp being similar to the incoming water quality fig 3c and d however the final water from the six ccmf had much lower shaa and sthm fp than all treatments for example the treated water from six ccmf had shaa and sthm fp of 18 68 μg mgdoc 1 mean 39 μg mgdoc 1 and 18 65 μg mgdoc 1 42 μg mgdoc 1 respectively the mean shaa fp concentration was 41 and 79 lower compared to ccmf and six while the average sthm fp was 35 and 65 lower respectively comparatively the average permeate shaa fp and sthm fps from the wtws were 107 16 μg mgdoc 1 and 80 7 μg mgdoc 1 the results suggest that iex plays a number of roles in improving nom removal by eliminating a particular fraction of nom that 1 enhances coagulation efficiency providing increased removal of overall doc and 2 enables coagulation to subsequently remove higher levels of specific components of nom that have a high dbp fp the following section investigates the key features of nom that controls its removal and the dbp fp dealing in turn with nom hydrophobicity mw and charge with respect to hydrophobicity figs s2a and s2b the hydrophobic compounds hpo represented the largest fraction in the raw water 62 6 consistent with results reported in previous studies for similar types of nom dominated water sources boyer and singer 2005 sharp et al 2006 the transphilic tpi fraction accounted for 22 4 and the hydrophilic hpi fraction 16 3 of the overall doc after six treatment the proportions of nom fractions did not change considerably this was also found when other nom specific suspended iex resins have been investigated boyer and singer 2005 suggesting that no preferential removal of any of the fractions occurred when the six effluent was treated with ccmf the proportion of the hpi fraction increased to 43 6 while the hpo fraction was reduced to 35 4 this was a result consistent with other coagulation studies that have shown preferential removal of hydrophobic nom by coagulation watson et al 2015 similar results to the overall doc removal were seen for the dbps with no correlation between the removed doc of the different fraction and a reduction in the sdbp fp fig s3 this is in line with researchers who have reported that all fractions contribute to the dbp fp hua and reckhow 2007 removal of nom by iex is primarily driven by charge which is present to differing degrees in all of the hydrophobicity fractions sharp et al 2006 removal of these organic compounds or a fraction of may be important in reducing significant dbp precursors however these results show that fractionation does not have sufficient sensitivity to show the nom which is selectively removed by iex molecular size is important in controlling removal by iex due to size exclusion effects bazri and mohseni 2016 the importance of the relative mws of nom on removal across the six and ccmf processes was investigated using lc ocd the lc ocd chromatogram profiles for the different processes before and after treatment show 4 peaks fig 4 peak 1 represents molecules 10 kda and peak 2 3 and 4 are associated with molecular weights of 1 kda 0 3 0 5 kda and 0 35 kda respectively huber et al 2011 for all raw water samples peak 2 was dominant showing that the bulk of the doc to be of medium molecular weight around 1 kda the profile presented in figure a shows a raw water with a doc concentration of 6 5 mg l 1 while the profiles in figure b d were from samples ranging between 2 3 and 7 4 mg l 1 doc integration of the peaks enabled a comparison of the removal of nom by size to be made for the different treatment systems when the raw water doc concentration was low 2 3 mg l 1 all peaks were substantially reduced fig 4b in this case the area of peak 2 and 3 were reduced by 83 and 78 by six respectively while peak 1 showed a reduction of 19 removal of peak 2 and 3 was expected as these smaller molecules diffuse more easily into the pores of the resin and are not restricted to exchange sites on the outside whereas larger molecules are rejected due to size exclusion winter et al 2018 lower removal of organic compounds around peak 4 40 seems contradictory to this statement however as has been noted it is not only size that defines the removal but also charge is of importance huber et al 2011 reported elution of neutral lmw nom around peak 4 elution time of 60 min suggesting these organic compounds carry little charge however peaks 2 and 3 have been associated with charged organic compounds shorney darby et al 2014 for higher doc concentrations 6 5 mg l 1 fig 4a the removal for all peaks was much less pronounced the removal obtained for peaks 2 3 and 4 were 13 20 and 17 respectively this can be explained by the limited capacity of the resin and possible blockage of the resin surface by large molecules at high doc concentrations the water profile for six ccmf showed a reduction of peak 1 and 2 by 88 and 100 compared to the six effluent showing the preferential removal of hmw fractions by coagulation fig 4a these results are consistent with those seen in the literature metcalfe et al 2015 likewise permeate of the wtw fig 4d showed high removal of the hmw fraction shown in peak 1 74 and peak 2 72 overall organic compounds represented in peaks 3 and 4 were targeted more effectively by iex shown by their consistently lower combined doc values in six ccmf compared to ccmf treated water across a broad range of water qualities 2 3 7 4 mg l 1 fig s4 this was further evidenced by determining the proportion of removed doc for each of the different peaks from the chromatographed doc cdoc fig 5 organic compounds represented in peak 2 had the highest proportion of the removed cdoc for six 76 while peaks 3 and 4 accounted for 15 and 7 for ccmf following six pre treatment 91 of the removed cdoc was from peak 2 while the values for peak 3 and 4 were both only 3 this confirms that iex has more specific removal of these lmw compounds compared to coagulation the profiles for ccmf compared to the wtws were very similar this shows that although the combined process had higher overall removal the compounds being targeted by the coagulation membrane process was similar a result consistent with the fractionation data the relative mw analysis showed better removal of lower mw organic compounds compared to coagulation processes however iex was effective in removing some organic compounds from all mw fractions apart from peak 1 the highest mw nom as a result of size exclusion of these compounds the charge load cl of the raw water was between 15 6 and 82 7 μeq l 1 and the charge density cd ranged from 5 4 to 10 7 meq mgdoc 1 showing variable charge composition of the raw water over the duration of the trial fig 6 these values are in line with cds measured for other nom laden water sources ranging from 0 3 to 16 7 meq mgdoc 1 bazri and mohseni et al 2016 boyer et al 2008 mergen et al 2009 as the cl in the raw water increased the residual cl in the six increased in a linear fashion fig 6 this showed a limit to the amount of charge that could be removed by the resin less than 0 1 of the theoretical resin capacity 1 25 meq ml 1 similarly low removal was reported by mergen et al 2009 who investigated charge load removal from different waters using magnetic iex resin capacity 0 5 meq ml 1 and found charge load removals of up to 31 μeq l 1 utilising 0 6 of the resin capacity this low utilisation was explained by organic compounds blocking the surface and internal pores of the resin in addition some compounds may be missed by the charge density method for example small compounds such as glutamic acid have been shown to be difficult to detected using the described titration method additionally anions sulphate nitrate hydrogen carbonate compete with organic molecules boyer et al 2008 liu et al 2017 and the required charge to remove these in the water source investigated here was calculated to be up to 2 9 of the resin capacity there was a weak positive correlation between raw water charge load and the removed charge load r2 0 41 fig 6 this showed that when there was more charge in the water the six process was able to remove more of this charge load as such when a shift in the concentration of charged molecules and or charged functional groups on individual molecules occurs in the raw water this will influence the removal of nom even when the doc concentration of the raw water does not change it is therefore helpful to normalise the charge in the raw water to doc and compare this with the amount of charge removed fig 7 there was a stronger relationship between these parameters r2 0 67 with higher charge density showing higher charge removal for example when the cd in the raw water was 7 7 meq gdoc 1 the charge load removal was 13 0 μeq l 1 while for a cd of 10 4 meq gdoc 1 the charge load removed was 21 9 μeq l 1 in both cases the raw water doc was 7 5 mg l 1 this aligns with the fact that more highly charged molecules are preferentially removed due to the stronger affinity to the ion exchange resin studies investigating removal of model compounds by iex have shown strong relationships between high removal and high charge density for example small organic acids such as citric and benzoic acids show high levels of removal finkbeiner et al 2017 given that lmw organic compounds were preferentially removed by iex it is plausible to consider that carboxylic acid compounds with high cd are well represented in the lmw fraction the scatter around the relationship between cd and cl removal was attributed to the influence of the size of organic molecules large molecules with significant charge density will be less well removed due to size exclusion effects this shows the importance of considering both nom charge and molecular size when considering removal however these results show that measuring charge density in the raw water is a more suitable parameter that can be used to determine removal of nom by iex compared to measurements such as doc and uva where there was no correlation with removal fig 7 this was presumably due to the fact that different concentrations of uncharged nom was present in the water this is an important observation as many wtws use online instruments that measure uv or doc to control iex resin dose by using cd it would be possible to more effectively control the iex dose in response to the change in charge load from the raw water which as has been shown is not always commensurate with an increase in nom concentration there was no obvious relationship between the dbp fp and the charge density following the six process fig s4 this further supports the view that iex does not always directly reduce dbp reactivity but facilitates better removal of the dbp precursors by coagulation previous work has shown that small organic acids inhibit the hydrolysis of aluminium coagulants by creating a stable complex between the metal salt and the ligands particularly dicarboxylates such as citrate and oxalate violante and violante 1980 more recent work on the removal of humic acid by polyaluminium chloride has shown a detrimental effect when certain counter ions including oxylate citrate and malate were present lin and lee 2013 complexation of these anions with the coagulant was the mechanism proposed to explain a deterioration in the polyaluminium cluster structure reducing the removal of the humic acid jarvis et al 2015 showed that the presence of small acids such as aspartic and oxalic acid reduced coagulation efficiency and some compounds including aspartic acid restricted floc growth organic compounds such as these would be effectively removed by iex allowing the coagulant to work more effectively on other compounds such as larger humic acid compounds which also tend to have higher dbp fp therefore the removal or reduction of specific compounds by iex is believed to be responsible for improved coagulation of the remaining doc by enhancing the interactions of the coagulant with the remaining organic compounds improving floc formation and size and increasing the available surface for adsorption of organic compounds the present study has extended our understanding further by elucidating that these specific organics are charged compounds of lmw with hydrophilic transphilic and hydrophobic character for future investigation analysis of the charge of the different size fractions could give a more detailed view on the interaction between molecular weight and charge density of organic compounds on their removal and the influence on the dbp fp in the final water the cost of implementing six with in line coagulation and ccmf has been estimated to be equal or lower than that of building a conventional clarification water treatment system metcalfe et al 2015 additional operational cost required for chemicals in the regeneration of the resin is compensated by a reduction in the required coagulant dose before the membrane a smaller footprint is needed for the six ccmf process compared to conventional processes as a result the economical case for implementing ion exchange combined with membrane processes makes ion exchange an attractive option for enhanced removal of dbp precursors 4 conclusions doc and uva of a fluctuating water source were successfully reduced using a novel suspended ion exchange technology upstream of coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration the process gave improved performance compared to coagulation filtration in both a pilot plant and at full scale in terms of removal of sum parameters doc uva as well as the specific formation potential of dbps the following conclusions could be drawn about the selective removal of organic compounds by iex analysis of hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic fractions revealed that there was no considerable change in the distribution of the fractions after six treatment compared to the raw water hydrophobicity was not shown to be contributor to removal by ion exchange iex preferentially removed compounds with a molecular weight around 1 kda higher charge densities improved the removal of charge load the results showed that charge describes removal behaviour better than other more normally monitored parameters the results of the combined analyses indicate that iex removes specific charged organics of low molecular weight regardless of their hydrophobicity and this improves the coagulation process

19281,transport behaviors of titanium dioxide nanoparticles ntio2 were examined in the individual and co presence escherichia e coli and phosphate in heterogeneous sand uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand columns the results showed that for the individual presence of phosphate the degree of ntio2 deposition was less in uncoated than in iron oxide coated sands in contrast an opposite trend that greater deposition of ntio2 in uncoated than in coated sands occurred in the individual presence of e coli these observations are due to the phosphate adsorption changing the charge of nps and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand or the preferential adhesion of bacterial to coated sand in the copresence of e coli and phosphate interestingly the phosphate level plays an important role in influencing ntio2 transport at a high phosphate concentration 1 0 mm the deposition of ntio2 with the individual presence of e coli was stronger than ntio2 in the copresence of both e coli and phosphate regardless of sand type the potential mechanism was that phosphate adsorption led to the formation of more negatively charged nps bacteria complexes that have higher mobility in sand columns at a low phosphate level 0 1 mm a similar observation occurred in uncoated sand nevertheless the deposition of ntio2 with copresence of e coli and phosphate was greater than ntio2 with e coli in oxyhydroxide coated sand it was attributed to the formation of large nps bacteria phosphate clusters less mobile and the preferential adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide coating

gaoquan chemical inc shanghai china with 99 purity physicochemical properties of the ntio2 were characterized in our previous study briefly ntio2 exists as large agglomerates with some fine particles and have a specific surface area of 103 47 m2 g 1 chen et al 2015 a gram negative strain escherichia coli e coli was used as a representative bacterial in this study e coli cicc 23 675 was obtained from the china center of industrial culture collection cicc the characteristics and procedures for culturing the e coli were given in supporting information si the phosphate solution was diluted from 1 0 m p stock solution which was prepared by dissolving nah2po4 analytical grade in deionized di water quartz sands 600 μm in average size were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china 2 1 preparation of ntio2 influent suspensions stable aqueous ntio2 suspension at environmentally relevant nano3 concentrations 0 1 10 mm was mixed with 0 1 10 mm phosphate solutions or e coli in single and binary systems of phosphate and e coli yielding final concentrations of ntio2 and e coli of 1 0 g l 1 and 2 108 cfu ml 1 respectively since the predominant species of phosphate are h2po4 and hpo4 2 at ph 6 0 and 9 0 respectively the ph of ntio2 suspension was adjusted to 6 0 and 9 0 using hcl or naoh solution the ntio2 suspension was stirred on a magnetic stir for 1 min and then sonicated in a water bath for 30 min kq2200b kunshan ultrasonic instrument co ltd china at room temperature to ensure a homogeneous suspension the detailed physicochemical conditions for column transport experiments were summarized in si table s1 please note that the used ntio2 concentration 1 0 g l 1 i e 0 1 is higher than those commonly encountered in the subsurface environments but it can occur in scenarios such as accidental spills or in situ nanoremediation of contaminated sites also the method for determining ntio2 concentration in column experiments diantipyryl methane photometric method requires an optimal concentration 0 1 for accurate quantification described below 2 2 adsorption isotherms of phosphate on e coli adsorption isotherms were determined to further understand the adsorption of phosphate on e coli by adding 2 108 cfu ml 1 e coli cells to series of phosphate solutions 0 600 μm in 50 ml vials at ph 6 0 the 0 600 μm phosphate solutions were obtained by diluting the phosphate stock solution the suspension ph was adjusted using hcl or naoh solution the vials were then placed on a rolling incubator shaking rpm of 30 when adsorption equilibrium is achieved 2 h the suspensions were centrifuged at 17 800 g for 90 min and then passed through 0 22 μm pore size filters soluble p concentration in the filtrates was analyzed using the molybdenum blue method via colorimetry xu et al 2014 the amount of phosphate adsorbed onto e coli cells was then determined by the difference between the initial and equilibrium phosphate concentration in filtrates triplicate experiments were performed for phosphate adsorption onto e coli 2 3 column transport experiments quartz sands were chosen as granular media in column studies prior to use the sand was cleaned thoroughly using a procedure described elsewhere chen et al 2015 iron oxide coated sand was prepared using a procedure described in stahl and james 1991 and the details are described in si transport experiments were conducted in 20 cm long and 2 6 cm inner diameter glass chromatography columns after dry packing with uncoated or 100 iron oxide coated quartz sands both ends of the column were covered with polytetrafluoroethene end caps and nylon net film 80 μm opening the porosity of the packed columns was 0 443 table s1 the columns were slowly saturated with di water using a peristaltic pump bt100 2j baoding longer precision pump co ltd china to remove remaining air bubbles during dry packing process after 24 h saturation the columns were then equilibrated by pumping 5 pore volumes pvs of background electrolyte solution nano3 precise peristaltic pump was used to control the flow rate at 1 0 cm3 min 1 during column transport experiments the flow rate of 1 0 cm3 min 1 was used to calculate the average pore water velocity in packed columns which is 25 52 cm h 1 a stable ntio2 suspension 1 0 g l 1 with the same background electrolyte solution was injected into the column for 5 pvs followed by elution the column with another 5 pvs of background electrolyte solution until no ntio2 was detected in the column effluent column effluent was collected using 10 ml glass tubes at an interval of 10 min on a fraction collector bs 100a huxi analytical instrument factory co ltd shanghai china after the completion of the transport experiment using uncoated quartz sand the sand grains were carefully excavated from the column into 7 layers of segments evenly the grains in each layer were treated with di water to release the retained ntio2 the collected effluent samples containing ntio2 were digested using sulphuric acid ammonium sulfate solution zhang et al 2007 the concentration of ti in the digested solution was then determined using the diantipyryl methane photometric method on a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan at a wavelength of 390 nm the detailed procedures and the equations for calculating the ntio2 mass recovered in the effluents were provided in si all experiments were conducted in triplicates at room temperature the concentrations of ntio2 in column influents c0 and effluents c were used to construct the breakthrough curves btcs of c c0 as a function of pv 2 4 zeta potential and average hydrodynamic radius measurements of ntio2 influent suspensions to better understand the mechanisms governing ntio2 transport in granular media the zeta potential and hydrodynamic radius of ntio2 and sand grains including the uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand were measured by using a zeta sizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk at room temperature 25 c a series of ntio2 phosphate ntio2 e coli ntio2 phosphate e coli and sand grain suspensions were prepared in 10 mm nano3 solutions at different ph conditions from 2 0 to 9 0 which was chosen as that used in previous studies kim et al 2009 schinner et al 2010 before measurements the suspensions were sealed with plastic wraps and homogeneously dispersed using ultrasonic treatment for 5 min each sample was run in triplicate and the average values of zeta potential and hydrodynamic radius were recorded 2 5 tem characterization of ntio2 with e coli in the presence of phosphate the morphology of suspensions containing ntio2 phosphate and e coli was investigated by using a fei tecnai g2 t20 twin analytical transmission electron microscopy tem one drop of well dispersed suspension was placed on a carbon support copper film substrate zhongjingkeyi technology co ltd beijing china followed by ambient drying for approximately 5 min before tem analyses 2 6 numerical modeling a two site kinetic attachment model tskam based upon the one dimensional convection dispersion equation cde was used to simulate the transport of ntio2 in porous media wang et al 2012a and 2014 the first order retention k1 and detachment rate k1d coefficients consider reversible time dependent retention on the first kinetic site 1 the first order retention rate coefficient k2 on the second kinetic site site 2 assumes an irreversible retention kinetics wang et al 2012a btcs were simulated using the hydrus 1d code simunek et al 2008 which allows fitting of ntio2 transport parameters k1 k1d and k2 using a nonlinear least square optimization routine based on the levenberg marquardt algorithm the detailed introductions of the model are described in si the pore water velocity v and dispersivity d were obtained by fitting the btcs of conservative tracer using stanmod simulation toride et al 1999 the values of v and d were 0 3228 cm min 1 and 0 1079 m2 s 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrokinetic properties of ntio2 and sand grains the zeta potentials zps of ntio2 and sand grains were investigated in the presence and absence of phosphate or and e coli as a function of solution phs and p concentrations fig 1 the surface charge of both nps and sand grains is ph dependent the point of zero charge phpzc refers to the ph at which the overall net charge of particles is zero erhayem and sohn 2014 regardless of particle type and solution chemistry both nps and sand grains became more negatively charged with increasing ph fig 1a due primarily to the enhanced degree of deprotonation effect the phpzc value of ntio2 was 6 3 consistent with previously reported phpzc value for ntio2 schmidt and vogelsberger 2009 the phpzc of ntio2 decreased from 6 3 down to 3 7 and the overall pattern of phpzc curve of ntio2 shifted left upon the addition of phosphate or and e coli this is largely because of phosphate po4 3 adsorption onto ntio2 resulting in a more negative charge on the surface of ntio2 chen et al 2015 the attachment of ntio2 aggregates onto e coli cells also contributes to the reduction in phpzc of ntio2 phpzc decreases from 6 3 to 3 0 to further verify the adhesion of ntio2 aggregates onto e coli cell surfaces the tem image of ntio2 in the presence of e coli in 10 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 was captured fig 2 a it was obvious that the cells were surrounded by a larger number of ntio2 particles interestingly there was a negligible change in zps of ntio2 with e coli after phosphate was added in suspension at varying phs this is likely because most ntio2 are attached onto e coli surfaces due to the higher affinity of ntio2 towards e coli lin et al 2014 however the ntio2 particles adhered to the surface of cells decreased upon adding phosphate and the decreased adhesion of ntio2 became more pronounced at higher phosphate concentration 0 1 vs 10 mm p fig 2b and d these findings indicated that the presence of phosphate weakens the adsorption of ntio2 particles onto e coli and thus enhances the dispersivity of ntio2 the zps of uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand were more negatively charged than ntio2 at a specified ph the surface charge of quartz sand became less negative after coated with iron oxyhydroxide consistent with the findings of elimelech et al 2000 and wang et al 2011c in fig 1b the zps of ntio2 with e coli became slightly negatively charged with increasing phosphate concentration a similar trend occurred for uncoated and coated sand as well moreover the surface of ntio2 with e coli was less negatively charged than uncoated and coated sands at various phosphate concentrations again the zp of coated sand was less negative than that of uncoated sand due to the presence of positively charged iron oxides on coated sands 3 2 colloidal stability of ntio2 with e coli and phosphate the colloidal stability of ntio2 suspensions with without e coli and or phosphate was studied by examining their average hydrodynamic radius hr in nano3 fig 3 generally the hr results of ntio2 showed the distinct trends under different experimental conditions during the early phase 0 10 min followed by a much slower aggregation during later phases until a plateau was achieved at 100 min in the single presence of phosphate 0 1 mm the hr of ntio2 stayed unchanged over the time frame of aggregation experiments fig 3 suggesting that phosphate can effectively stabilize ntio2 at relatively low is chen et al 2015 in contrast large hr of ntio2 aggregates occurred with the individual presence of e coli fig 3a the adsorption of ntio2 particles onto large sized e coli cells fig 2 well explains the observed results comparably in the binary system of 0 1 mm phosphate and e coli fig 3a the ntio2 aggregate was even larger compared to that in the single system ntio2 phosphate or ntio2 e coli thus the copresence of phosphate and e coli greatly destabilized the ntio2 aggregates due partly to phosphate adsorption onto both e coli fig s1 and ntio2 yielding the larger ntio2 e coli phosphate complexes versus smaller ntio2 e coli aggregates as anticipated higher is nano3 induced greater aggregation of ntio2 in the single or co presence of phosphate and e coli fig 3b for instance the hr of ntio2 with e coli alone was 360 nm vs 600 nm in 1 mm vs 10 mm nano3 fig 3a vs 3b a similar result was observed in the copresence of 0 1 mm phosphate and e coli in 1 mm vs 10 mm nano3 a higher degree in compression of electrostatic double layers of ntio2 at higher is accounts for the observed findings as shown in si fig s1 the phosphate adsorption onto e coli increased with increasing phosphate concentration to decipher the effect of phosphate concentration on ntio2 colloidal stability the hrs of ntio2 alone and with e coli were determined at a high p concentration 10 mm the hydrodynamic size of ntio2 remained unchanged at a high phosphate concentration of 10 mm fig 3a and c nevertheless in the presence of e coli hr of ntio2 was much smaller in 10 mm fig 3c vs 0 1 mm phosphate fig 3a in 1 mm nano3 this result agrees with the fact of more negatively charged ntio2 with e coli occur at a higher p concentration fig 1b consequently greater adsorption of phosphate onto e coli and ntio2 appreciably alleviates the aggregation of ntio2 in the copresence of e coli and phosphate 3 3 transport of ntio2 in the single presence of e coli the breakthrough curves btcs of ntio2 with presence of 2 108 cfu ml 1 e coli were obtained in uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sands at ph 6 0 and 9 0 respectively before discussing the results for ntio2 with e coli the transport of individual ntio2 was first explored under the same experimental condition the results showed that the column was blocked up when flushing ntio2 due to the favorable attachment of positively charged ntio2 at ph 6 0 onto negatively charged sand grains fig 1a comparably the e coli showed a greater transportability compared to ntio2 in porous sands due to the much stronger repulsive interaction energies between negatively charged bacterial cells and sand grains kim et al 2009 schinner et al 2010 although the size of bacteria cells was larger than that of nps when e coli was added at ph 6 0 a portion 3 3 12 5 of ntio2 in nano3 solution 0 1 10 mm successfully broke through the uncoated sand columns fig 4 a similar findings were observed for the reduced deposition of ntio2 in kcl and cacl2 solutions in sand column at ph 7 0 after addition of e coli chowdhury et al 2012 this is due to the enhanced repulsive interactions between ntio2 and sand grains after introducing e coli in the suspension ntio2 particles were more negatively charged after adding e coli fig 1a furthermore adding e coli likely reduce the nps aggregate size due to the decreased possibility of nps effective collision chowdhury et al 2012 meanwhile for iron oxyhydroxide coated sand e coli promoting ntio2 transport was also encountered fig 4a additionally high ph favors ntio2 transport with e coli in both uncoated and coated sands for example the mass recovery meff of ntio2 with e coli increased from 48 8 to 77 3 in fe oxide coated sand when ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 in 0 1 mm nano3 note that the c c0 values of ntio2 with e coli alone in iron oxyhydroxide coated sands fig 4a and b were significantly larger than those in uncoated sands fig 4a and b approximately 48 8 of ntio2 in the presence of e coli passed through the coated sand columns in 0 1 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 whereas only 12 5 broke through the uncoated sand table s2 exp 7 vs exp 1 the repulsive interaction energy between ntio2 and coated sand is expected to be higher compared to that of ntio2 uncoated sand system nevertheless this disagrees with the fact that the surface of coated sand was less negatively charged than that of uncoated sand when zp of ntio2 with e coli was negative fig 1 thus we argue that this is due to the preferential adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide coated sand compared to uncoated sand kim et al 2008 decreasing the overall favorable sites for ntio2 retention tem image in fig 2a clearly showed the presence of large aggregates of ntio2 e coli as expected e coli cells that are preferentially deposited onto the surfaces of iron oxyhydroxide coated sands mask the favorable retention sites furthermore the more pronounced blocking phenomenon of ntio2 in iron oxide coated sand fig 4a and 4b vs uncoated sand fig 4a and b supports our argument the degree of the blocking effect was sensitive to is in coated sand which was again attributed to the electrostatic double layer interactions between colloidal particles versus is as described above philip et al 1996 3 4 transport of ntio2 in the copresence of e coli and phosphate transport of ntio2 with copresence of e coli and 0 1 mm phosphate was investigated at ph 6 0 and ph 9 0 as expected the c c0 of ntio2 with both e coli and phosphate at ph 6 0 fig 5 a and a was much lower than that at ph 9 0 fig 5b and b regardless of the collector type furthermore tem images showed that the aggregation tendency of ntio2 onto e coli surface in the presence of phosphate was greater at ph 6 0 fig 2b vs ph 9 0 fig 2c which explains the greater deposition of ntio2 in columns at ph 6 0 vs ph 9 0 additionally the btcs with copresence of phosphate and e coli were obviously affected by is at ph 6 0 fig 5a and a while a negligible effect occurred at ph 9 0 fig 5b and b this is attributed to the increased deposition of e coli with increasing is 1 100 mm under low ph while high ph alleviates the is impact on ntio2 deposition regardless of p concentration kim et al 2009 in the uncoated sand the meff of ntio2 was 9 7 with e coli alone in 1 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 table s2 exp 2 whereas meff 14 0 with copresence of e coli and phosphate under the same experimental condition table s2 exp 14 indicating that addition of phosphate increased the transport of ntio2 with e coli in uncoated sand due to the simultaneous adsorption of phosphate onto e coli fig s1 and ntio2 the more negatively charged particles occurred in the binary system e coli p fig 1b although the larger aggregates were formed by ntio2 phosphate e coli as supported by tem observations fig 2b and aggregation measurements fig 3a thus increasing phosphate concentration 0 1 mm promotes the transport of e coli wang et al 2011b and ntio2 chen et al 2015 meanwhile the high mobile e coli was inclined to carry more attached ntio2 traveling through the uncoated sand to further verify our hypothesis the column effluent sample ntio2 with combined 0 1 mm phosphate and e coli was taken for tem observations at first hand the captured tem image fig 2e showed that the mobile e coli cells did pass through sand columns in the presence of phosphate and the cells were still surrounded by a large amount of agglomerates the edx analysis of different locations on the dark agglomerates in fig 2e showed that the peak of ti element appeared in the spectrum suggesting the ntio2 transported with mobile e coli cells through packed columns as well fig 2f noted that the nto2 aggregates in the column effluent fig 2e were dissimilar to those of concentrated ntio2 aggregates in the influents fig 2b implying that aggregation state morphology and fractal dimension of ntio2 likely change during porous media transport in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand fig 5a and b the transport of ntio2 with both presence of e coli and p was sensitive to is at phs of 6 0 and 9 0 different from the findings in uncoated sand the btcs showed a typical blocking pattern in coated sand moreover the deposition of ntio2 with combined phosphate and e coli in uncoated sand was obviously greater than that in coated sand at both phs for example in 0 1 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 33 7 and 48 2 of ntio2 broke through the uncoated and coated sands respectively table s2 exp 13 vs exp 19 these observations were similar to the trends of ntio2 transport with e coli alone further indicating that surface charge heterogeneity of sand and the presence of e coli significantly impact the transport of nps however it is interesting to note that the addition of 0 1 mm phosphate favored the deposition of ntio2 with combined e coli in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand fig 5a and b compared to that with e coli alone fig 4a and b this is due likely to the formation of larger ntio2 phosphate e coli cluster fig 3a while their zps remained similar within the tested ph range fig 1a the interplay between the adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide coating kim et al 2008 and the phosphate adsorption on tio2 e coli complexes weakens ntio2 transport in porous media clearly phosphate played a different role in influencing the transport ntio2 with e coli in uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sands to decipher the underlying mechanisms the transport of ntio2 with phosphate alone needs to be carefully identified generally transport feature of ntio2 with phosphate alone fig s2 was distinct from that of ntio2 with e coli alone fig 4 in the uncoated sand the mobility of ntio2 with adding phosphate 0 1 10 mm in 1 mm nano3 fig s2a was markedly higher than that with e coli alone at ph 9 0 fig 4b this is consistent with the results of zps and hr of ntio2 shown in figs 1 and 2 at ph 6 0 the surface charge of ntio2 with 0 1 mm phosphate alone was more negative than that with e coli alone fig 1 comparably the electrostatic repulsion among ntio2 aggregates in the presence of phosphate was relatively stronger than that with e coli the hr of ntio2 aggregates with phosphate was smaller than that with e coli in 1 mm nano3 solution fig 3 these results indicated that the stability of ntio2 was better in the presence of phosphate vs e coli however in the coated sand the meff of ntio2 with e coli alone in effluent fig 4b was higher than that with phosphate alone fig s2b at ph 9 0 for instance meff 54 5 for ntio2 with e coli in 1 mm nano3 while meff 26 9 with 0 1 mm phosphate under the same experimental condition table s2 exp 11 vs exp 39 for coated sand iron oxyhydroxides exhibit strong adsorption capacity towards phosphate kreller et al 2002 leading to the decrease in phosphate adsorption on the surface of ntio2 thus the increase in nps transportability by phosphate adsorption was then weakened as expected the deposition of ntio2 with phosphate alone to coated sand was much greater than that in uncoated sand fig s2 however the meff for ntio2 with e coli alone in effluent from iron oxyhydroxide coated sand was higher than that from uncoated sand fig 4 again this may be ascribed to the influence of surface charge heterogeneity of quartz sand kim et al 2008 and solution chemistry chowdhury et al 2012 our results indicate that phosphate alone showed an obviously different influence vs e coli on the transport of ntio2 in uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sands 3 5 phosphate concentration effect on transport of ntio2 with e coli the effect of p concentration 0 1 10 mm on ntio2 transport was further investigated with or without e coli as presented in fig 6 a in uncoated sand the increase in phosphate concentration increased c c0 of ntio2 with combined presence of phosphate and e coli for example the meff of ntio2 with both phosphate and e coli in uncoated sand was increased from 14 0 to 34 4 when the phosphate concentration was increased from 0 1 to 10 mm fig 6a and exp 14 and 25 26 table s2 this is attributed to the more negatively charged ntio2 with e coli as the phosphate concentration is increased fig 1b leading to less aggregates of ntio2 onto e coli as shown in tem images less ntio2 adhered onto the surface of cells in 10 mm phosphate fig 2d in comparison with that in 0 1 mm phosphate fig 2b so the hr of ntio2 with e coli in 10 mm phosphate fig 3c was smaller than that in 0 1 mm phosphate fig 3a similarly the increase in phosphate from 0 1 to 10 mm significantly enhanced the transportability of ntio2 with combined phosphate and e coli in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand fig 6a note that the deposition of ntio2 with both e coli and phosphate in uncoated sand fig 6a was higher than that in coated sand at the same concentration of phosphate fig 6a similarly the deposition of ntio2 with e coli alone was greater in uncoated sand than in coated sand however ntio2 with phosphate alone showed the opposite trend for ntio2 with phosphate alone the mobility of ntio2 was independent on phosphate level 0 1 10 mm in uncoated sand fig 6b conversely the retention of ntio2 with e coli was sensitive to phosphate level fig 6a according to the stability tests of ntio2 in 0 1 and 10 mm phosphate the hr of ntio2 aggregates was almost independent on the change of phosphate concentration fig 3a and c however hr of ntio2 with e coli was greatly decreased with the increase in phosphate concentration this contributed to the different transport behaviors of ntio2 with without e coli in uncoated sand under different phosphate concentrations in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand the increase in phosphate concentration significantly promoted the transportability of ntio2 as shown in fig 6b which is distinct from that observed in uncoated sand fig 6b for example meff of ntio2 dramatically increased from 3 3 up to 59 0 in coated sand with increasing the phosphate concentration from 0 1 to 10 mm table s2 exp 32 vs exp 34 note that the transportability of ntio2 with phosphate alone in uncoated sand fig 6b was much higher than that to coated sand fig 6b for example meff of ntio2 obtained from the uncoated sand column experiment was 53 9 in the presence of 1 mm individual phosphate while it was only 28 8 in coated sand table s2 exp 30 vs exp 33 these results were again different from that of ntio2 with copresence of e coli and phosphate that the mobility in uncoated sand was lower than that in coated sand fig 6a and a again the coupling between the adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide on sand grains kim et al 2008 and phosphate adsorption on iron oxyhydroxide ntio2 e coli accounts for the change of steric repulsion between ntio2 and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand one important point that needs to be emphasized was that the c c0 of ntio2 in the presence of both e coli and phosphate fig 6a and a was lower than that in phosphate alone without e coli irrespective of collector type fig 6b and b at ph 6 0 in 1 mm nano3 55 4 ntio2 with 10 mm phosphate alone and 34 4 with combined 10 mm phosphate and e coli were detected in effluents in uncoated sands respectively exp 31 vs 26 table s2 in the iron oxyhydroxide coated sand the mass effluent percentage of ntio2 with 10 mm phosphate alone was 59 0 table s2 exp 34 and 49 0 with both e coli and 10 mm phosphate table s2 exp 28 under the same conditions it was contributed to the less negatively charged surface fig 1a and the larger hr fig 3a for ntio2 with both e coli and phosphate than that with phosphate alone however with one exception at the lower p concentration 0 1 mm in coated sand the deposition of ntio2 with combined e coli and phosphate fig 6a was lower than that with p alone fig 6b for instance at ph 6 0 in 1 mm nano3 solution meff of ntio2 without and with e coli was 3 3 and 21 5 in the presence of 0 1 mm phosphate exp 32 and 20 table s2 respectively when the phosphate and e coli were coexisted in the influent the adsorption sites on iron oxyhydroxide coated sand were unsaturated by phosphate adsorption at low p concentration the competition between phosphate and e coli for adsorption onto iron oxides occurred and thus the available deposition sites for e coli decreased consequently the facilitated transport of e coli cells favors to carry more attached ntio2 to pass through coated sand columns therefore the transportability of ntio2 with both phosphate and e coli was relatively higher than ntio2 with phosphate alone at low p level 0 1 mm 3 6 numerical modeling the two site kinetic attachment model tskam was used to simulate the btcs of ntio2 and the fitted model parameters are summarized in table s2 high pearson s correlation coefficients were obtained among observed and simulated data for the ntio2 transport with r2 0 951 the model fitted parameters k1 k1d and k2 were compared and discussed to acquire additional insights on the ntio2 transport mechanisms as seen in table s2 the values of k1 and k1d on the first kinetic site site 1 generally increased with increasing is in the presence of p alone table s2 exp 35 to 37 the values of k1d were greater than k1 in uncoated sand indicating that the detachment of ntio2 from uncoated sand was stronger than attachment sun et al 2015 and the ntio2 adsorbed on site 1 approaching a linear equilibrium tended to release reversible attachment van genuchten and wagenet 1989 fang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 this was consistent with the high mobility of ntio2 with presence of phosphate alone however in coated sand the values of k1d k1 were less than 1 table s2 exp 38 40 suggesting that attachment dominated the interaction between ntio2 and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand this is because phosphate adsorption on iron oxides reduces the transport of ntio2 conversely in the presence of e coli alone the values of k1d k1 in coated sand was 1 and greater than that in uncoated sand correspondingly the mass recovery of ntio2 in coated sand was higher than that in uncoated one a similar observation was obtained in the copresence of phosphate and e coli in other words the mobility of ntio2 in uncoated sand was generally proportional to the values of k1d k1 the k1d k1 value of ntio2 in uncoated sand under various conditions was as follow with phosphate alone with combined presence of e coli and phosphate with e coli alone for instance the value of k1d k1 in 1 mm nano3 electrolyte at ph 6 0 was 0 974 for ntio2 with both e coli and 0 1 mm phosphate table s2 exp 14 while it was 1 016 and 0 768 for ntio2 with 0 1 mm phosphate and with e coli alone table s2 exp 29 and exp 2 respectively however in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand the k1d k1 of ntio2 in coated sand followed the order with e coli alone with combined presence of e coli and phosphate with phosphate alone at p level 0 1 mm for instance the k1d k1 value in 1 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 was 1 162 for ntio2 with e coli 0 1 mm phosphate table s2 exp 20 for comparison it was 0 493 and 1 301 for ntio2 with 0 1 mm phosphate and with e coli alone table s2 exp 32 and exp 8 respectively at high phosphate concentration 1 0 mm the transport of ntio2 in coated sand was proportional to k1d k1 value as the order of with phosphate alone with co presence e coli and phosphate with e coli alone in this study the values of k2 increasing with ic indicated that the greater degree of straining occurred at higher ics wang et al 2012b fang et al 2013 additionally phosphate adsorption on iron oxyhydroxide coated contributed to the stronger straining when low concentration of phosphate was existed in ntio2 system for instance the values of k2 with phosphate alone in uncoated sand table s2 exp 35 to 37 were less than those in coated sand table s2 exp 38 to 40 moreover the stronger straining effect was mainly induced by larger nps clusters cai et al have found that the straining of larger ntio2 kaolinite clusters yet contributed to the enhanced retention of ntio2 in divalent cacl2 solutions when kaolinite particles were co present in suspensions cai et al 2014 our results showed that the deposition of ntio2 with e coli alone was greater than with phosphate high level alone in uncoated and coated sand which was correspondingly associated with the stronger straining accounting for the higher value of k2 at ph 6 0 table s2 exp 2 vs 30 and exp 8 vs 34 a similar observation was found in the copresence of phosphate and e coli at high p concentrations table s2 exp 2 vs 26 and exp 8 vs 28 in addition the discrepancies in the fitting for ntio2 btcs with e coli in iron oxyhydroxide coated sands were observed in the presence and absence of phosphate at high ph fig 4b and fig 5b this is likely due to the preferable deposition of e coli cells to the surfaces of iron oxyhydroxide coated sands the accumulation of large e coli cells produced a decline in the deposition rate as the retained particles impeded the deposition process by blocking subsequent ntio2 attachment furthermore the high ph induced the pronounced blocking effect more specifically the blocking effect was stronger at higher is as shown in fig 4b and fig 5b philip et al 1996 4 conclusions transport of ntio2 was examined with presence of phosphate or and e coli in heterogeneous porous media in the single presence of e coli the mobility of ntio2 was significantly higher in iron oxyhydroxide coated than uncoated sands attributed to the preferential adhesion of bacterial to the coated sand that inhibits the subsequent retention of ntio2 although the mobility of ntio2 was increased appreciably in the presence of bacterial the addition of different concentrations of phosphate can lead to the distinct transport features of ntio2 at low phosphate concentration 0 1 mm the formation of large nps bacteria phosphate clusters and the preferential adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide coating occurred simultaneously thereby reducing the transport of nps via straining and or pore structure blocking at high phosphate concentration 1 0 mm ntio2 deposition was unfavorable due to the formation of more negatively charged nps bacteria complexes due to phosphate adsorption hence the alternations of porous media type or transport parameters are necessary for effectively removing nps in the presence of phosphate and bacterial these results suggest that the concentration of phosphate significantly influenced ntio2 transport in the presence of e coli considering that a high concentration of ntio2 was used in this study future research should focus on how different concentrations of ntio2 particles transport in the presence of environmentally relevant concentrations of e coli in the subsurface although the impact of particle concentration on ntio2 or e coli transport individually in porous media has been well examined while the findings of our study are insufficient to extrapolate the actual transport behaviors of ntio2 in the highly complicated and heterogeneous natural environments our results nevertheless provide in depth insights into understanding the mechanisms behind the transport and retention of engineered nanomaterials in complex soil or groundwater

19281,transport behaviors of titanium dioxide nanoparticles ntio2 were examined in the individual and co presence escherichia e coli and phosphate in heterogeneous sand uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand columns the results showed that for the individual presence of phosphate the degree of ntio2 deposition was less in uncoated than in iron oxide coated sands in contrast an opposite trend that greater deposition of ntio2 in uncoated than in coated sands occurred in the individual presence of e coli these observations are due to the phosphate adsorption changing the charge of nps and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand or the preferential adhesion of bacterial to coated sand in the copresence of e coli and phosphate interestingly the phosphate level plays an important role in influencing ntio2 transport at a high phosphate concentration 1 0 mm the deposition of ntio2 with the individual presence of e coli was stronger than ntio2 in the copresence of both e coli and phosphate regardless of sand type the potential mechanism was that phosphate adsorption led to the formation of more negatively charged nps bacteria complexes that have higher mobility in sand columns at a low phosphate level 0 1 mm a similar observation occurred in uncoated sand nevertheless the deposition of ntio2 with copresence of e coli and phosphate was greater than ntio2 with e coli in oxyhydroxide coated sand it was attributed to the formation of large nps bacteria phosphate clusters less mobile and the preferential adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide coating simultaneously taken together our findings provide crucial knowledge for better understanding the fate transport and potential risks of engineered nanoparticles in complicated environmental settings

al 2009 godinez and darnault 2011 wang et al 2011a for example surface charge heterogeneity on natural granular media could inhibit nanoparticles nps transport johnson et al 1996 the most common surface charge heterogeneities encountered in groundwater and soils are patches of iron and aluminum oxides that are normally positively charged at ambient ph conditions lin et al 2011 wang et al

park et al 2009 therefore their interlaced reactions and adsorption mechanisms might trigger complicated transport behaviors of nps when e coli and phosphate co present with the nps however till now very limited information is available regarding how and to what extent bacteria and phosphate influence the colloidal stability and transport of ntio2 in the presence of surface charge heterogeneity on collectors the overall objective of this study was therefore to systematically investigate the effects of individual and co presence of bacterial and phosphate on the colloidal stability and transport behavior of ntio2 in water saturated sands with different degrees of surface charge heterogeneity uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand numerical modeling based upon the two site kinetic attachment model tskam was employed to simulate the transport and unravel the mechanisms behind ntio2 transport in porous media 2 materials and methods anatase ntio2 20 nm were purchased from gaoquan chemical inc shanghai china with 99 purity physicochemical properties of the ntio2 were characterized in our previous study briefly ntio2 exists as large agglomerates with some fine particles and have a specific surface area of 103 47 m2 g 1 chen et al 2015 a gram negative strain escherichia coli e coli was used as a representative bacterial in this study e coli cicc 23 675 was obtained from the china center of industrial culture collection cicc the characteristics and procedures for culturing the e coli were given in supporting information si the phosphate solution was diluted from 1 0 m p stock solution which was prepared by dissolving nah2po4 analytical grade in deionized di water quartz sands 600 μm in average size were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china 2 1 preparation of ntio2 influent suspensions stable aqueous ntio2 suspension at environmentally relevant nano3 concentrations 0 1 10 mm was mixed with 0 1 10 mm phosphate solutions or e coli in single and binary systems of phosphate and e coli yielding final concentrations of ntio2 and e coli of 1 0 g l 1 and 2 108 cfu ml 1 respectively since the predominant species of phosphate are h2po4 and hpo4 2 at ph 6 0 and 9 0 respectively the ph of ntio2 suspension was adjusted to 6 0 and 9 0 using hcl or naoh solution the ntio2 suspension was stirred on a magnetic stir for 1 min and then sonicated in a water bath for 30 min kq2200b kunshan ultrasonic instrument co ltd china at room temperature to ensure a homogeneous suspension the detailed physicochemical conditions for column transport experiments were summarized in si table s1 please note that the used ntio2 concentration 1 0 g l 1 i e 0 1 is higher than those commonly encountered in the subsurface environments but it can occur in scenarios such as accidental spills or in situ nanoremediation of contaminated sites also the method for determining ntio2 concentration in column experiments diantipyryl methane photometric method requires an optimal concentration 0 1 for accurate quantification described below 2 2 adsorption isotherms of phosphate on e coli adsorption isotherms were determined to further understand the adsorption of phosphate on e coli by adding 2 108 cfu ml 1 e coli cells to series of phosphate solutions 0 600 μm in 50 ml vials at ph 6 0 the 0 600 μm phosphate solutions were obtained by diluting the phosphate stock solution the suspension ph was adjusted using hcl or naoh solution the vials were then placed on a rolling incubator shaking rpm of 30 when adsorption equilibrium is achieved 2 h the suspensions were centrifuged at 17 800 g for 90 min and then passed through 0 22 μm pore size filters soluble p concentration in the filtrates was analyzed using the molybdenum blue method via colorimetry xu et al 2014 the amount of phosphate adsorbed onto e coli cells was then determined by the difference between the initial and equilibrium phosphate concentration in filtrates triplicate experiments were performed for phosphate adsorption onto e coli 2 3 column transport experiments quartz sands were chosen as granular media in column studies prior to use the sand was cleaned thoroughly using a procedure described elsewhere chen et al 2015 iron oxide coated sand was prepared using a procedure described in stahl and james 1991 and the details are described in si transport experiments were conducted in 20 cm long and 2 6 cm inner diameter glass chromatography columns after dry packing with uncoated or 100 iron oxide coated quartz sands both ends of the column were covered with polytetrafluoroethene end caps and nylon net film 80 μm opening the porosity of the packed columns was 0 443 table s1 the columns were slowly saturated with di water using a peristaltic pump bt100 2j baoding longer precision pump co ltd china to remove remaining air bubbles during dry packing process after 24 h saturation the columns were then equilibrated by pumping 5 pore volumes pvs of background electrolyte solution nano3 precise peristaltic pump was used to control the flow rate at 1 0 cm3 min 1 during column transport experiments the flow rate of 1 0 cm3 min 1 was used to calculate the average pore water velocity in packed columns which is 25 52 cm h 1 a stable ntio2 suspension 1 0 g l 1 with the same background electrolyte solution was injected into the column for 5 pvs followed by elution the column with another 5 pvs of background electrolyte solution until no ntio2 was detected in the column effluent column effluent was collected using 10 ml glass tubes at an interval of 10 min on a fraction collector bs 100a huxi analytical instrument factory co ltd shanghai china after the completion of the transport experiment using uncoated quartz sand the sand grains were carefully excavated from the column into 7 layers of segments evenly the grains in each layer were treated with di water to release the retained ntio2 the collected effluent samples containing ntio2 were digested using sulphuric acid ammonium sulfate solution zhang et al 2007 the concentration of ti in the digested solution was then determined using the diantipyryl methane photometric method on a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan at a wavelength of 390 nm the detailed procedures and the equations for calculating the ntio2 mass recovered in the effluents were provided in si all experiments were conducted in triplicates at room temperature the concentrations of ntio2 in column influents c0 and effluents c were used to construct the breakthrough curves btcs of c c0 as a function of pv 2 4 zeta potential and average hydrodynamic radius measurements of ntio2 influent suspensions to better understand the mechanisms governing ntio2 transport in granular media the zeta potential and hydrodynamic radius of ntio2 and sand grains including the uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand were measured by using a zeta sizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk at room temperature 25 c a series of ntio2 phosphate ntio2 e coli ntio2 phosphate e coli and sand grain suspensions were prepared in 10 mm nano3 solutions at different ph conditions from 2 0 to 9 0 which was chosen as that used in previous studies kim et al 2009 schinner et al 2010 before measurements the suspensions were sealed with plastic wraps and homogeneously dispersed using ultrasonic treatment for 5 min each sample was run in triplicate and the average values of zeta potential and hydrodynamic radius were recorded 2 5 tem characterization of ntio2 with e coli in the presence of phosphate the morphology of suspensions containing ntio2 phosphate and e coli was investigated by using a fei tecnai g2 t20 twin analytical transmission electron microscopy tem one drop of well dispersed suspension was placed on a carbon support copper film substrate zhongjingkeyi technology co ltd beijing china followed by ambient drying for approximately 5 min before tem analyses 2 6 numerical modeling a two site kinetic attachment model tskam based upon the one dimensional convection dispersion equation cde was used to simulate the transport of ntio2 in porous media wang et al 2012a and 2014 the first order retention k1 and detachment rate k1d coefficients consider reversible time dependent retention on the first kinetic site 1 the first order retention rate coefficient k2 on the second kinetic site site 2 assumes an irreversible retention kinetics wang et al 2012a btcs were simulated using the hydrus 1d code simunek et al 2008 which allows fitting of ntio2 transport parameters k1 k1d and k2 using a nonlinear least square optimization routine based on the levenberg marquardt algorithm the detailed introductions of the model are described in si the pore water velocity v and dispersivity d were obtained by fitting the btcs of conservative tracer using stanmod simulation toride et al 1999 the values of v and d were 0 3228 cm min 1 and 0 1079 m2 s 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrokinetic properties of ntio2 and sand grains the zeta potentials zps of ntio2 and sand grains were investigated in the presence and absence of phosphate or and e coli as a function of solution phs and p concentrations fig 1 the surface charge of both nps and sand grains is ph dependent the point of zero charge phpzc refers to the ph at which the overall net charge of particles is zero erhayem and sohn 2014 regardless of particle type and solution chemistry both nps and sand grains became more negatively charged with increasing ph fig 1a due primarily to the enhanced degree of deprotonation effect the phpzc value of ntio2 was 6 3 consistent with previously reported phpzc value for ntio2 schmidt and vogelsberger 2009 the phpzc of ntio2 decreased from 6 3 down to 3 7 and the overall pattern of phpzc curve of ntio2 shifted left upon the addition of phosphate or and e coli this is largely because of phosphate po4 3 adsorption onto ntio2 resulting in a more negative charge on the surface of ntio2 chen et al 2015 the attachment of ntio2 aggregates onto e coli cells also contributes to the reduction in phpzc of ntio2 phpzc decreases from 6 3 to 3 0 to further verify the adhesion of ntio2 aggregates onto e coli cell surfaces the tem image of ntio2 in the presence of e coli in 10 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 was captured fig 2 a it was obvious that the cells were surrounded by a larger number of ntio2 particles interestingly there was a negligible change in zps of ntio2 with e coli after phosphate was added in suspension at varying phs this is likely because most ntio2 are attached onto e coli surfaces due to the higher affinity of ntio2 towards e coli lin et al 2014 however the ntio2 particles adhered to the surface of cells decreased upon adding phosphate and the decreased adhesion of ntio2 became more pronounced at higher phosphate concentration 0 1 vs 10 mm p fig 2b and d these findings indicated that the presence of phosphate weakens the adsorption of ntio2 particles onto e coli and thus enhances the dispersivity of ntio2 the zps of uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand were more negatively charged than ntio2 at a specified ph the surface charge of quartz sand became less negative after coated with iron oxyhydroxide consistent with the findings of elimelech et al 2000 and wang et al 2011c in fig 1b the zps of ntio2 with e coli became slightly negatively charged with increasing phosphate concentration a similar trend occurred for uncoated and coated sand as well moreover the surface of ntio2 with e coli was less negatively charged than uncoated and coated sands at various phosphate concentrations again the zp of coated sand was less negative than that of uncoated sand due to the presence of positively charged iron oxides on coated sands 3 2 colloidal stability of ntio2 with e coli and phosphate the colloidal stability of ntio2 suspensions with without e coli and or phosphate was studied by examining their average hydrodynamic radius hr in nano3 fig 3 generally the hr results of ntio2 showed the distinct trends under different experimental conditions during the early phase 0 10 min followed by a much slower aggregation during later phases until a plateau was achieved at 100 min in the single presence of phosphate 0 1 mm the hr of ntio2 stayed unchanged over the time frame of aggregation experiments fig 3 suggesting that phosphate can effectively stabilize ntio2 at relatively low is chen et al 2015 in contrast large hr of ntio2 aggregates occurred with the individual presence of e coli fig 3a the adsorption of ntio2 particles onto large sized e coli cells fig 2 well explains the observed results comparably in the binary system of 0 1 mm phosphate and e coli fig 3a the ntio2 aggregate was even larger compared to that in the single system ntio2 phosphate or ntio2 e coli thus the copresence of phosphate and e coli greatly destabilized the ntio2 aggregates due partly to phosphate adsorption onto both e coli fig s1 and ntio2 yielding the larger ntio2 e coli phosphate complexes versus smaller ntio2 e coli aggregates as anticipated higher is nano3 induced greater aggregation of ntio2 in the single or co presence of phosphate and e coli fig 3b for instance the hr of ntio2 with e coli alone was 360 nm vs 600 nm in 1 mm vs 10 mm nano3 fig 3a vs 3b a similar result was observed in the copresence of 0 1 mm phosphate and e coli in 1 mm vs 10 mm nano3 a higher degree in compression of electrostatic double layers of ntio2 at higher is accounts for the observed findings as shown in si fig s1 the phosphate adsorption onto e coli increased with increasing phosphate concentration to decipher the effect of phosphate concentration on ntio2 colloidal stability the hrs of ntio2 alone and with e coli were determined at a high p concentration 10 mm the hydrodynamic size of ntio2 remained unchanged at a high phosphate concentration of 10 mm fig 3a and c nevertheless in the presence of e coli hr of ntio2 was much smaller in 10 mm fig 3c vs 0 1 mm phosphate fig 3a in 1 mm nano3 this result agrees with the fact of more negatively charged ntio2 with e coli occur at a higher p concentration fig 1b consequently greater adsorption of phosphate onto e coli and ntio2 appreciably alleviates the aggregation of ntio2 in the copresence of e coli and phosphate 3 3 transport of ntio2 in the single presence of e coli the breakthrough curves btcs of ntio2 with presence of 2 108 cfu ml 1 e coli were obtained in uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sands at ph 6 0 and 9 0 respectively before discussing the results for ntio2 with e coli the transport of individual ntio2 was first explored under the same experimental condition the results showed that the column was blocked up when flushing ntio2 due to the favorable attachment of positively charged ntio2 at ph 6 0 onto negatively charged sand grains fig 1a comparably the e coli showed a greater transportability compared to ntio2 in porous sands due to the much stronger repulsive interaction energies between negatively charged bacterial cells and sand grains kim et al 2009 schinner et al 2010 although the size of bacteria cells was larger than that of nps when e coli was added at ph 6 0 a portion 3 3 12 5 of ntio2 in nano3 solution 0 1 10 mm successfully broke through the uncoated sand columns fig 4 a similar findings were observed for the reduced deposition of ntio2 in kcl and cacl2 solutions in sand column at ph 7 0 after addition of e coli chowdhury et al 2012 this is due to the enhanced repulsive interactions between ntio2 and sand grains after introducing e coli in the suspension ntio2 particles were more negatively charged after adding e coli fig 1a furthermore adding e coli likely reduce the nps aggregate size due to the decreased possibility of nps effective collision chowdhury et al 2012 meanwhile for iron oxyhydroxide coated sand e coli promoting ntio2 transport was also encountered fig 4a additionally high ph favors ntio2 transport with e coli in both uncoated and coated sands for example the mass recovery meff of ntio2 with e coli increased from 48 8 to 77 3 in fe oxide coated sand when ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 in 0 1 mm nano3 note that the c c0 values of ntio2 with e coli alone in iron oxyhydroxide coated sands fig 4a and b were significantly larger than those in uncoated sands fig 4a and b approximately 48 8 of ntio2 in the presence of e coli passed through the coated sand columns in 0 1 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 whereas only 12 5 broke through the uncoated sand table s2 exp 7 vs exp 1 the repulsive interaction energy between ntio2 and coated sand is expected to be higher compared to that of ntio2 uncoated sand system nevertheless this disagrees with the fact that the surface of coated sand was less negatively charged than that of uncoated sand when zp of ntio2 with e coli was negative fig 1 thus we argue that this is due to the preferential adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide coated sand compared to uncoated sand kim et al 2008 decreasing the overall favorable sites for ntio2 retention tem image in fig 2a clearly showed the presence of large aggregates of ntio2 e coli as expected e coli cells that are preferentially deposited onto the surfaces of iron oxyhydroxide coated sands mask the favorable retention sites furthermore the more pronounced blocking phenomenon of ntio2 in iron oxide coated sand fig 4a and 4b vs uncoated sand fig 4a and b supports our argument the degree of the blocking effect was sensitive to is in coated sand which was again attributed to the electrostatic double layer interactions between colloidal particles versus is as described above philip et al 1996 3 4 transport of ntio2 in the copresence of e coli and phosphate transport of ntio2 with copresence of e coli and 0 1 mm phosphate was investigated at ph 6 0 and ph 9 0 as expected the c c0 of ntio2 with both e coli and phosphate at ph 6 0 fig 5 a and a was much lower than that at ph 9 0 fig 5b and b regardless of the collector type furthermore tem images showed that the aggregation tendency of ntio2 onto e coli surface in the presence of phosphate was greater at ph 6 0 fig 2b vs ph 9 0 fig 2c which explains the greater deposition of ntio2 in columns at ph 6 0 vs ph 9 0 additionally the btcs with copresence of phosphate and e coli were obviously affected by is at ph 6 0 fig 5a and a while a negligible effect occurred at ph 9 0 fig 5b and b this is attributed to the increased deposition of e coli with increasing is 1 100 mm under low ph while high ph alleviates the is impact on ntio2 deposition regardless of p concentration kim et al 2009 in the uncoated sand the meff of ntio2 was 9 7 with e coli alone in 1 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 table s2 exp 2 whereas meff 14 0 with copresence of e coli and phosphate under the same experimental condition table s2 exp 14 indicating that addition of phosphate increased the transport of ntio2 with e coli in uncoated sand due to the simultaneous adsorption of phosphate onto e coli fig s1 and ntio2 the more negatively charged particles occurred in the binary system e coli p fig 1b although the larger aggregates were formed by ntio2 phosphate e coli as supported by tem observations fig 2b and aggregation measurements fig 3a thus increasing phosphate concentration 0 1 mm promotes the transport of e coli wang et al 2011b and ntio2 chen et al 2015 meanwhile the high mobile e coli was inclined to carry more attached ntio2 traveling through the uncoated sand to further verify our hypothesis the column effluent sample ntio2 with combined 0 1 mm phosphate and e coli was taken for tem observations at first hand the captured tem image fig 2e showed that the mobile e coli cells did pass through sand columns in the presence of phosphate and the cells were still surrounded by a large amount of agglomerates the edx analysis of different locations on the dark agglomerates in fig 2e showed that the peak of ti element appeared in the spectrum suggesting the ntio2 transported with mobile e coli cells through packed columns as well fig 2f noted that the nto2 aggregates in the column effluent fig 2e were dissimilar to those of concentrated ntio2 aggregates in the influents fig 2b implying that aggregation state morphology and fractal dimension of ntio2 likely change during porous media transport in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand fig 5a and b the transport of ntio2 with both presence of e coli and p was sensitive to is at phs of 6 0 and 9 0 different from the findings in uncoated sand the btcs showed a typical blocking pattern in coated sand moreover the deposition of ntio2 with combined phosphate and e coli in uncoated sand was obviously greater than that in coated sand at both phs for example in 0 1 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 33 7 and 48 2 of ntio2 broke through the uncoated and coated sands respectively table s2 exp 13 vs exp 19 these observations were similar to the trends of ntio2 transport with e coli alone further indicating that surface charge heterogeneity of sand and the presence of e coli significantly impact the transport of nps however it is interesting to note that the addition of 0 1 mm phosphate favored the deposition of ntio2 with combined e coli in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand fig 5a and b compared to that with e coli alone fig 4a and b this is due likely to the formation of larger ntio2 phosphate e coli cluster fig 3a while their zps remained similar within the tested ph range fig 1a the interplay between the adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide coating kim et al 2008 and the phosphate adsorption on tio2 e coli complexes weakens ntio2 transport in porous media clearly phosphate played a different role in influencing the transport ntio2 with e coli in uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sands to decipher the underlying mechanisms the transport of ntio2 with phosphate alone needs to be carefully identified generally transport feature of ntio2 with phosphate alone fig s2 was distinct from that of ntio2 with e coli alone fig 4 in the uncoated sand the mobility of ntio2 with adding phosphate 0 1 10 mm in 1 mm nano3 fig s2a was markedly higher than that with e coli alone at ph 9 0 fig 4b this is consistent with the results of zps and hr of ntio2 shown in figs 1 and 2 at ph 6 0 the surface charge of ntio2 with 0 1 mm phosphate alone was more negative than that with e coli alone fig 1 comparably the electrostatic repulsion among ntio2 aggregates in the presence of phosphate was relatively stronger than that with e coli the hr of ntio2 aggregates with phosphate was smaller than that with e coli in 1 mm nano3 solution fig 3 these results indicated that the stability of ntio2 was better in the presence of phosphate vs e coli however in the coated sand the meff of ntio2 with e coli alone in effluent fig 4b was higher than that with phosphate alone fig s2b at ph 9 0 for instance meff 54 5 for ntio2 with e coli in 1 mm nano3 while meff 26 9 with 0 1 mm phosphate under the same experimental condition table s2 exp 11 vs exp 39 for coated sand iron oxyhydroxides exhibit strong adsorption capacity towards phosphate kreller et al 2002 leading to the decrease in phosphate adsorption on the surface of ntio2 thus the increase in nps transportability by phosphate adsorption was then weakened as expected the deposition of ntio2 with phosphate alone to coated sand was much greater than that in uncoated sand fig s2 however the meff for ntio2 with e coli alone in effluent from iron oxyhydroxide coated sand was higher than that from uncoated sand fig 4 again this may be ascribed to the influence of surface charge heterogeneity of quartz sand kim et al 2008 and solution chemistry chowdhury et al 2012 our results indicate that phosphate alone showed an obviously different influence vs e coli on the transport of ntio2 in uncoated and iron oxyhydroxide coated sands 3 5 phosphate concentration effect on transport of ntio2 with e coli the effect of p concentration 0 1 10 mm on ntio2 transport was further investigated with or without e coli as presented in fig 6 a in uncoated sand the increase in phosphate concentration increased c c0 of ntio2 with combined presence of phosphate and e coli for example the meff of ntio2 with both phosphate and e coli in uncoated sand was increased from 14 0 to 34 4 when the phosphate concentration was increased from 0 1 to 10 mm fig 6a and exp 14 and 25 26 table s2 this is attributed to the more negatively charged ntio2 with e coli as the phosphate concentration is increased fig 1b leading to less aggregates of ntio2 onto e coli as shown in tem images less ntio2 adhered onto the surface of cells in 10 mm phosphate fig 2d in comparison with that in 0 1 mm phosphate fig 2b so the hr of ntio2 with e coli in 10 mm phosphate fig 3c was smaller than that in 0 1 mm phosphate fig 3a similarly the increase in phosphate from 0 1 to 10 mm significantly enhanced the transportability of ntio2 with combined phosphate and e coli in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand fig 6a note that the deposition of ntio2 with both e coli and phosphate in uncoated sand fig 6a was higher than that in coated sand at the same concentration of phosphate fig 6a similarly the deposition of ntio2 with e coli alone was greater in uncoated sand than in coated sand however ntio2 with phosphate alone showed the opposite trend for ntio2 with phosphate alone the mobility of ntio2 was independent on phosphate level 0 1 10 mm in uncoated sand fig 6b conversely the retention of ntio2 with e coli was sensitive to phosphate level fig 6a according to the stability tests of ntio2 in 0 1 and 10 mm phosphate the hr of ntio2 aggregates was almost independent on the change of phosphate concentration fig 3a and c however hr of ntio2 with e coli was greatly decreased with the increase in phosphate concentration this contributed to the different transport behaviors of ntio2 with without e coli in uncoated sand under different phosphate concentrations in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand the increase in phosphate concentration significantly promoted the transportability of ntio2 as shown in fig 6b which is distinct from that observed in uncoated sand fig 6b for example meff of ntio2 dramatically increased from 3 3 up to 59 0 in coated sand with increasing the phosphate concentration from 0 1 to 10 mm table s2 exp 32 vs exp 34 note that the transportability of ntio2 with phosphate alone in uncoated sand fig 6b was much higher than that to coated sand fig 6b for example meff of ntio2 obtained from the uncoated sand column experiment was 53 9 in the presence of 1 mm individual phosphate while it was only 28 8 in coated sand table s2 exp 30 vs exp 33 these results were again different from that of ntio2 with copresence of e coli and phosphate that the mobility in uncoated sand was lower than that in coated sand fig 6a and a again the coupling between the adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide on sand grains kim et al 2008 and phosphate adsorption on iron oxyhydroxide ntio2 e coli accounts for the change of steric repulsion between ntio2 and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand one important point that needs to be emphasized was that the c c0 of ntio2 in the presence of both e coli and phosphate fig 6a and a was lower than that in phosphate alone without e coli irrespective of collector type fig 6b and b at ph 6 0 in 1 mm nano3 55 4 ntio2 with 10 mm phosphate alone and 34 4 with combined 10 mm phosphate and e coli were detected in effluents in uncoated sands respectively exp 31 vs 26 table s2 in the iron oxyhydroxide coated sand the mass effluent percentage of ntio2 with 10 mm phosphate alone was 59 0 table s2 exp 34 and 49 0 with both e coli and 10 mm phosphate table s2 exp 28 under the same conditions it was contributed to the less negatively charged surface fig 1a and the larger hr fig 3a for ntio2 with both e coli and phosphate than that with phosphate alone however with one exception at the lower p concentration 0 1 mm in coated sand the deposition of ntio2 with combined e coli and phosphate fig 6a was lower than that with p alone fig 6b for instance at ph 6 0 in 1 mm nano3 solution meff of ntio2 without and with e coli was 3 3 and 21 5 in the presence of 0 1 mm phosphate exp 32 and 20 table s2 respectively when the phosphate and e coli were coexisted in the influent the adsorption sites on iron oxyhydroxide coated sand were unsaturated by phosphate adsorption at low p concentration the competition between phosphate and e coli for adsorption onto iron oxides occurred and thus the available deposition sites for e coli decreased consequently the facilitated transport of e coli cells favors to carry more attached ntio2 to pass through coated sand columns therefore the transportability of ntio2 with both phosphate and e coli was relatively higher than ntio2 with phosphate alone at low p level 0 1 mm 3 6 numerical modeling the two site kinetic attachment model tskam was used to simulate the btcs of ntio2 and the fitted model parameters are summarized in table s2 high pearson s correlation coefficients were obtained among observed and simulated data for the ntio2 transport with r2 0 951 the model fitted parameters k1 k1d and k2 were compared and discussed to acquire additional insights on the ntio2 transport mechanisms as seen in table s2 the values of k1 and k1d on the first kinetic site site 1 generally increased with increasing is in the presence of p alone table s2 exp 35 to 37 the values of k1d were greater than k1 in uncoated sand indicating that the detachment of ntio2 from uncoated sand was stronger than attachment sun et al 2015 and the ntio2 adsorbed on site 1 approaching a linear equilibrium tended to release reversible attachment van genuchten and wagenet 1989 fang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 this was consistent with the high mobility of ntio2 with presence of phosphate alone however in coated sand the values of k1d k1 were less than 1 table s2 exp 38 40 suggesting that attachment dominated the interaction between ntio2 and iron oxyhydroxide coated sand this is because phosphate adsorption on iron oxides reduces the transport of ntio2 conversely in the presence of e coli alone the values of k1d k1 in coated sand was 1 and greater than that in uncoated sand correspondingly the mass recovery of ntio2 in coated sand was higher than that in uncoated one a similar observation was obtained in the copresence of phosphate and e coli in other words the mobility of ntio2 in uncoated sand was generally proportional to the values of k1d k1 the k1d k1 value of ntio2 in uncoated sand under various conditions was as follow with phosphate alone with combined presence of e coli and phosphate with e coli alone for instance the value of k1d k1 in 1 mm nano3 electrolyte at ph 6 0 was 0 974 for ntio2 with both e coli and 0 1 mm phosphate table s2 exp 14 while it was 1 016 and 0 768 for ntio2 with 0 1 mm phosphate and with e coli alone table s2 exp 29 and exp 2 respectively however in iron oxyhydroxide coated sand the k1d k1 of ntio2 in coated sand followed the order with e coli alone with combined presence of e coli and phosphate with phosphate alone at p level 0 1 mm for instance the k1d k1 value in 1 mm nano3 at ph 6 0 was 1 162 for ntio2 with e coli 0 1 mm phosphate table s2 exp 20 for comparison it was 0 493 and 1 301 for ntio2 with 0 1 mm phosphate and with e coli alone table s2 exp 32 and exp 8 respectively at high phosphate concentration 1 0 mm the transport of ntio2 in coated sand was proportional to k1d k1 value as the order of with phosphate alone with co presence e coli and phosphate with e coli alone in this study the values of k2 increasing with ic indicated that the greater degree of straining occurred at higher ics wang et al 2012b fang et al 2013 additionally phosphate adsorption on iron oxyhydroxide coated contributed to the stronger straining when low concentration of phosphate was existed in ntio2 system for instance the values of k2 with phosphate alone in uncoated sand table s2 exp 35 to 37 were less than those in coated sand table s2 exp 38 to 40 moreover the stronger straining effect was mainly induced by larger nps clusters cai et al have found that the straining of larger ntio2 kaolinite clusters yet contributed to the enhanced retention of ntio2 in divalent cacl2 solutions when kaolinite particles were co present in suspensions cai et al 2014 our results showed that the deposition of ntio2 with e coli alone was greater than with phosphate high level alone in uncoated and coated sand which was correspondingly associated with the stronger straining accounting for the higher value of k2 at ph 6 0 table s2 exp 2 vs 30 and exp 8 vs 34 a similar observation was found in the copresence of phosphate and e coli at high p concentrations table s2 exp 2 vs 26 and exp 8 vs 28 in addition the discrepancies in the fitting for ntio2 btcs with e coli in iron oxyhydroxide coated sands were observed in the presence and absence of phosphate at high ph fig 4b and fig 5b this is likely due to the preferable deposition of e coli cells to the surfaces of iron oxyhydroxide coated sands the accumulation of large e coli cells produced a decline in the deposition rate as the retained particles impeded the deposition process by blocking subsequent ntio2 attachment furthermore the high ph induced the pronounced blocking effect more specifically the blocking effect was stronger at higher is as shown in fig 4b and fig 5b philip et al 1996 4 conclusions transport of ntio2 was examined with presence of phosphate or and e coli in heterogeneous porous media in the single presence of e coli the mobility of ntio2 was significantly higher in iron oxyhydroxide coated than uncoated sands attributed to the preferential adhesion of bacterial to the coated sand that inhibits the subsequent retention of ntio2 although the mobility of ntio2 was increased appreciably in the presence of bacterial the addition of different concentrations of phosphate can lead to the distinct transport features of ntio2 at low phosphate concentration 0 1 mm the formation of large nps bacteria phosphate clusters and the preferential adhesion of e coli cells to iron oxyhydroxide coating occurred simultaneously thereby reducing the transport of nps via straining and or pore structure blocking at high phosphate concentration 1 0 mm ntio2 deposition was unfavorable due to the formation of more negatively charged nps bacteria complexes due to phosphate adsorption hence the alternations of porous media type or transport parameters are necessary for effectively removing nps in the presence of phosphate and bacterial these results suggest that the concentration of phosphate significantly influenced ntio2 transport in the presence of e coli considering that a high concentration of ntio2 was used in this study future research should focus on how different concentrations of ntio2 particles transport in the presence of environmentally relevant concentrations of e coli in the subsurface although the impact of particle concentration on ntio2 or e coli transport individually in porous media has been well examined while the findings of our study are insufficient to extrapolate the actual transport behaviors of ntio2 in the highly complicated and heterogeneous natural environments our results nevertheless provide in depth insights into understanding the mechanisms behind the transport and retention of engineered nanomaterials in complex soil or groundwater

19282,syntrophic propionate oxidation spo coupled with methanogenesis is often inhibited under high ammonium concentrations in anaerobic digesters however the inhibitory mechanism remains poorly understood we conducted two independent laboratory experiments with a swine manure digester sludge in experiment i rna based stable isotope probing sip was applied to determine the active players of both bacteria and methanogens involved in spo under different ammonium concentrations 0 3 and 7 g nh4 n l 1 in experiment ii the dynamics of the bacterial community under ammonia stress was monitored using the 16s rrna pyrosequencing and quantitative pcr under similar conditions as in experiment i but without the addition of external propionate an additional higher ammonium treatment 10 g nh4 n l 1 was applied in experiment ii to maximize the ammonia stress we identified that the smithella bacteria and the methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae archaea were the most active players involved in spo and methanogenesis we revealed that smithella methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae were moderately and severely inhibited at 3 and 7 10 g nh4 n l 1 respectively however the fermentative bacteria appeared to be more tolerant to ammonia stress the microbial responses were corroborated with the accumulation of vfas and the repression of methanogenesis under high ammonium conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords syntrophic propionate oxidation methanogenesis ammonia stress anaerobic digester stable isotope probe 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is widely used to degrade organic waste to biogas which helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels mitigate emission of greenhouse gases and lower environmental pollution mckendry 2002 in methanogenic ad systems complex organic matter is ultimately converted to methane and carbon dioxide by an orchestration of fermentation acetogenesis and methanogenesis schink 1997 the acetogenesis step is catalyzed by bacteria that convert substrates such as fatty acids and alcohols into simple compounds such as h2 co2 formate and acetate this step is endergonic under standard conditions and can process only if the simple compounds produced are consumed by methanogens through a syntrophic association therefore the acetogenesis is regarded to be critical in the ad processes junicke et al 2016 schink 1997 propionate a key product during anaerobic decomposition is degraded via the syntrophic propionate oxidation spo which operates at near thermodynamic equilibrium stams and plugge 2009 several syntrophic propionate oxidation bacteria spob that grow in syntrophy with methanogens have been described including the gram negative syntrophobacter and smithella and gram positive bacteria pelotomaculum and desulfotomaculum isolated from anaerobic digesters mcinerney et al 2008 these spob have been found widespread in anoxic environments such as peats wetlands rice paddy soils sediments and subsurface petroleum reservoirs gan et al 2012 gray et al 2011 schmidt et al 2016 many environmental factors such as temperature gan et al 2012 hydraulic retention time hrt zamanzadeh et al 2013 and levels of propionate ariesyady et al 2007 and trace elements molybdenum tungsten and selenium capson tojo et al 2018 worm et al 2009 have been found to influence the spob communities stable isotope probing sip allows the identification of microbial species that incorporate 13c substrates into their dna or rna radajewski et al 2000 this powerful technique has been used to investigate the active populations responsible for spo in rice field soils gan et al 2012 lueders et al 2004b however a direct identification of the microbial populations responsible for spo in anaerobic digester sludge still remains unavailable this limitation of energy conservation predicts that any subtle disturbances to the ad system could affect the functioning of the spo community and propionate degrading accumulation of ammonium produced from the degradation of protein rich materials is known to inhibits spo and methanogenesis in the anaerobic digesters that treat livestock manure chen et al 2008 montag and schink 2016 wherein free ammonia is considered to be the main source of ammonium stress rajagopal et al 2013 under methanogenic conditions spo involves at least three different groups of microbes namely spob hydrogenotrophic methanogens and aceticlastic methanogens presumably inhibition of any individual group would result in an inhibition of the whole spo process capson tojo et al 2017 stams and plugge 2009 van velsen 1979 a consensus seems to have suggested that syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea have different levels of sensitivity to ammonia but the details appear contradictory calli et al 2005 indicated that spob were more sensitive than methanogenic archaea to free ammonia in anaerobic reactors while other studies suggested just the opposite müller et al 2006 weaterholm et al 2011 wiegant and zeeman 1986 proposed that it was the inhibition of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens that resulted in an accumulation of propionate which further inhibited the aceticlastic methanogens likewise the exact responses of either aceticlastic or hydrogenotrophic methanogens to ammonia varied across a few studies jarrell et al 1987 kato et al 2014 westerholm et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 to gain more insight into the effects of ammonium on microbes involved in spo and methanogenesis we conducted two independent laboratory experiments in the experiment i rna sip technique was applied to identify the active organisms involved in spo in a sludge sample collected from a full scale swine manure digester zhang et al 2014 and in the experiment ii a batch experiment with a wide range of ammonium concentrations was conducted to determine the responses of the entire microbial community in fermentation and methanogenesis to ammonia stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic incubation

supplemental fig s1a the ph values for the 0 and 3 g nh4 n l 1 0 n and 3 n treatments were around 7 1 and 7 0 respectively in the 7 g nh4 n l 1 7 n treatment the ph decreased slightly from 7 0 to 6 9 during the incubation the lower ph in the 7 n treatment was in accordance with the accumulation of fatty acids the nh4 n concentrations for all the treatments remained stable through most of the experimental period supplemental fig s1b in the later stage however nh3 n concentration decreased because of the decreasing ph supplemental fig s1c and d propionate produced from the organic compounds in the swine manure sludge was exhausted in the 0 and 3 n treatments after a pre incubation period of 30 days but about 4 mm of propionate still remained in the 7 n treatment fig 1 c indicating a substantial inhibition of spo at the level of 7 n nevertheless all pre incubated sludge was further incubated with addition of 0 35 mmol 12c or u 13c propionate fig 1c in the 0 and 3 n treatments depletion of propionate occurred at a rate of 3 29 and 1 83 μmol h 1 respectively by 82 h 89 and 49 of the added propionate had been depleted in the 0 and 3 n treatments respectively at this time the identical amount of propionate 0 35 mmol was added again to both treatments to bringing the total addition of 12c or u 13c propionate to 0 7 mmol between 82 and 133 h the rate of propionate degradation was faster in the 0 n 6 52 μmol h 1 than the 3 n 3 09 μmol h 1 treatments in contrast propionate degradation in 7 n treatment was completely inhibited where the total propionate concentration remained unchanged at about 10 mm in slurries the analysis of isotopic carbon ratios revealed that 13c atom of acetate fig 1e increased immediately after addition of u 13c propionate fig 1f and peaked at 89 and 68 at 133 h in the 0 and 3 n treatments respectively meanwhile the total amounts of acetate and formate varied between 0 02 and 0 32 mm and between 0 01 and 0 03 mm respectively while the concentration of butyrate was below the detection limit fig 1a b and d in contrast acetate and butyrate accumulated in the 7 n treatment fig 1b d while the 13c atom of acetate and butyrate remained below 2 throughout the incubation fig 1e and g apparently acetate and butyrate in this treatment were resulted from the degradation of complex organic compounds in swine manure sludge rather than the u 13c propionate added in correspondence with u 13c propionate consumption 13c labeled ch4 was produced in the 0 and 3 n treatments the rate of ch4 production was faster in the 0 n 6 17 μmol h 1 than 3 n treatment 3 89 μmol h 1 after the first addition of propionate fig 2 a the rates further increased after the second addition of propionate at 82 h but it was faster again in the 0 n treatment 9 67 μmol h 1 than in the 3 n treatment 4 60 μmol h 1 the accumulative amount of ch4 eventually reached to about 1 mmol in both treatments theoretically 0 7 mmol propionate could produce 1 23 mmol ch4 suggesting that up to 80 of the propionate had be stoichiometrically converted to ch4 in contrast ch4 production was completely inhibited in the 7 n treatment likewise much less co2 production was produced in the 7 n than the 0 n and 3 n treatments fig 2b the analysis of isotopic carbon ratios revealed that the 13c content of ch4 and co2 increased with the degradation of u 13c propionate in the 0 and 3 n treatments and reached the maximum about 30 after 133 and 81 h respectively fig 2c and d in contrast the 13c atom of ch4 and co2 in the 7 n treatment remained below 2 throughout the incubation 3 1 2 sip targeting bacterial 16s rrna rna sip was applied only for the 0 and 3 n treatments but with multiple times for each treatment fig 3 shows a time course analysis of relative abundance of bacterial individual terminal restriction fragments t rfs across the density gradient with either 12c or 13c labeled propionate in the 0 and 3 n treatments in both the labeled and unlabeled treatments for most of the time points the 195 bp and 520 bp t rfs were the dominant fragments with a combined relative abundance exceeding 50 across the density gradient fig 3 there was only one obvious t rf namely the 509 bp that became more abundant at higher density gradients over time in the 13c labeled treatments fig 3e g for the 0 n and fig 3d e for the 3 n its relative abundance exceeded 20 at the highest density gradient by the end of the samplings fig 3h for the 0 n and fig 3f for the 3 n in contrast in the unlabeled control the relative abundance of the 509 bp t rf remained below 5 across the rna buoyant density gradients fig 3a d for the 0 n and fig 3a c for the 3 n in order to assign the characteristic t rfs to phylogenetic groups four clone libraries were constructed from the samples of different buoyant densities at 133 h for the 0 n treatment and 201 h for the 3 n treatment respectively two of the clone libraries were constructed using light templates of rrna as controls and two retrieved from the heavy templates phylogenetic analysis of 358 sequences indicated that the bacterial community in the sludge comprised mainly firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi supplemental table s2 and fig 4 s2 and s3 actinobacteria spirochaetes synergistetes and unclassified lineages had lower abundances in silico t rf comparisons between heavy and light clone libraries indicated that the light rrna was dominated by the sequences related to clostridia 520 bp t rf for clostridium spp supplemental fig s2 peptostreptococcaceae 195 bp t rf supplemental fig s2 bacilli 152 and 533 bp t rfs supplemental fig s2 and dethiosulfovibrionaceae 140 bp t rf supplemental fig s3 whereas the clone sequences affiliated with smithella 509 bp t rf fig 4 syntrophorhabdaceae 162 bp t rf fig 4 bacteroidales 93 bp t rf supplemental fig s3 and pelotomaculum 142 bp t rf supplemental fig s2 were enriched in the heavy rrna in the 0 and 3 n treatments 3 1 3 sip targeting archaeal 16s rrna rna sip was also done to identify the archaeal members that assimilated the intermediate metabolites of u 13c propionate during the degradation over time the t rflp analysis of archaeal community showed three major t rfs of 84 284 and 393 bp occurring in both the 0 and 3 n treatments and a 186 bp t rf appeared additionally in the 3 n treatment fig 5 in both the 12c and 13c treatments and regardless of density gradient the 284 bp tr f always predominated with a relative abundance of 60 compared with the 12c controls in the 0 n treatment fig 5a d the 393 bp but not the 84 bp t rf became substantially enriched in the heavy rrna fractions at 91 h of the 13c treated slurries fig 5e g however this enrichment of the 393 bp t rf declined subsequently at 133 h fig 5h instead the 84 bp t rf became slightly enriched herein in the 3 n treatment a different pattern emerged it was the 84 bp t rf that became substantially enriched in the heavy rrna fractions at both 91 h and 201 h of the 13c treated slurries fig 5e f four archaeal 16s rrna clone libraries were constructed from the light and heavy fractions at 91 h and 201 h in the 0 and 3 n treatments respectively supplemental table s3 sequencing analysis of 204 clones indicated that the archaeal community in the sludge consisted of methanosaetaceae methanospirillaceae methanomicrobiales methanosarcinaceae and thermoprotei supplemental fig s4 based on in silico analysis of these archaeal sequences the major t rfs were assigned to methanosaetaceae 284 bp methanospirillaceae 393 bp methanomicrobiales 84 bp and methanosarcinaceae 186 bp respectively 3 2 experiment ⅱ nh4 stress on bacterial communities 3 2 1 dynamics of acetate and propionate in experiment ii acetate accumulated and then decomposed rapidly in the 0 and 3 n treatments with the concentration decreasing to a level near to the detection limit about 40 μm in three days fig 6 a in the 7 n treatment acetate increased to 12 mm on day 6 and remained steady within the next month then decreased below 0 3 mm at the end of incubation in the 10 n treatment acetate kept accumulating and reaching 25 mm at the end of incubation a similar acetate dynamic has been shown previously zhang et al 2014 propionate also showed a rapid accumulation in the 0 n treatment but decreased to the level of the detection limit about 40 μm in six days fig 6b in the 3 n treatment propionate increased to 3 5 mm on day 15 and then decreased rapidly to below 0 4 mm after day 22 in the 7 and 10 n treatments the propionate kept increasing and reached 6 0 and 4 2 mm respectively at day 86 3 2 2 bacterial community dynamics bacterial 16s rrna genes and their transcripts were extracted from the sludge samples in different ammonia treatments and analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing phylogenetic analysis indicated that the bacterial community at the phylum level consisted of proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria spirochaetes and synergistetes fig 7 the structure of bacterial community remained relatively stable throughout the incubations fig 7a the firmicutes predominated in all samples accounting for 60 of total bacterial abundance the next major bacterial phyla included bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi accounted for about 10 of total bacterial abundance across treatments along with the elevation of the n level the relative abundance of proteobacteria gradually decreased from about 10 in the 0 n treatment to below 1 in the 10 n treatment the relative abundances of bacterial 16s rrna transcripts revealed some differences from the community composition at the dna level fig 7b the firmicutes still predominated in all samples accounting for over 70 of the total bacterial transcripts in the 0 n treatment however it increased along with the elevation of the n level and peaked at 92 in the 10 n treatment the relative abundance of the bacteroidetes and chloroflexi was lower at the rna level than at the dna level and decreased in response to the increasing n concentration the relative abundance of the proteobacteria was moderately higher at the rna level in the 0 n and 3 n treatments making it the second group of transcriptionally most active organisms after the firmicutes however it decreased below 1 in the 7 and 10 n treatments notably smithella was the dominant genus in the proteobacteria at the lower taxonomic levels family or genus the 16s rrna sequences closely related to smithella and syntrophorhabdaceae were dominant in the clone libraries the relative abundances of their 16s rrna genes and transcripts were calculated and compared among different n levels fig 8 and supplemental fig s5 in general the relative abundances of smithella and syntrophorhabdaceae were highest in the 0 n treatment reaching to 3 9 and 5 0 for the 16s rrna genes and transcripts of smithella and 1 8 and 2 2 for those of syntrophorhabdaceae respectively furthermore the relative abundances of two groups at both gene and transcript levels increased with the time of incubation in this treatment the relative abundances at the gene level however decreased with the increase of ammonium concentration fig 8a and c and did not show a clear tendency over the incubation time for the 3 7 and 10 n treatments the decline tendency with the increase of nh4 n was more substantial at the transcript level notably while smithella and syntrophorhabdaceae kept a moderate abundances of their 16s rrna genes their transcript abundances were close to zero at the 7 n and 10 n levels 3 2 3 dynamics of total bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers the total bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers estimated by quantitative pcr ranged from 3 2 1011 to 1 9 1012 copies g 1 sludge dw fig 9 a within the low n treatments the copy number increased over time at the early stage then decreased after day 10 the total 16s rrna gene copy numbers exhibited the significant difference between the low n and high n treatments fig 9b but there was no significant difference either between the 0 and 3 n treatments or between the 7 and 10 n treatments fig 9b 4 discussions 4 1 impacts of ammonia on propionate oxidation and methanogenesis in the present study we showed that the average rates of propionate consumption and methane production decreased from 4 9 to 7 52 μmol h 1 in the 0 n treatment to 2 36 and 4 75 μmol h 1 in the 3 n treatment or reduced by 52 and 37 respectively in the 7 n treatment 7 g nh4 n l 1 corresponding to 69 mg nh3 n l 1 both propionate degradation and methane production were completely inhibited these results are in line with a previous study that reported 48 reduction in ch4 production rate when the total ammonia ammonium nitrogen tan concentration increased from 3 to 5 8 g l 1 in a continuously stirrer tank reactor sung and liu 2003 on the other hand the existence of propionate degraders resistant to the extremely high ammonium concentration 6 g nh4 n l 1 in anaerobic bioreactors has been reported calli et al 2005 however such resistance was not observed in our study fig 8 propionate and acetate transiently accumulated and were depleted thereafter in the 0 and 3 n treatments fig 1b and c in the 10 n treatment however propionate and acetate accumulated throughout the incubation fig 6a b suggesting a strong inhibition on the degradation of propionate and acetate the 7 n treatment exhibited an interesting pattern in experiment ii where acetate fig 6a decreased gradually in the later stage of incubation while propionate kept accumulating this suggests that consumption of acetate alone would not be sufficient for the resumption of propionate degradation in a previous study we showed that hydrogen accumulated to a significant extent in high nh4 treatments zhang et al 2014 the h2 accumulation may build a stronger thermodynamic barrier for the degradation of propionate 4 2 spob and their responses to ammonia stress in soil and sediment samples biomass usually can be sufficiently labeled after the incorporation of 5 500 μmol 13c per g whiteley et al 2007 since microbial biomass in anaerobic sludge is often richer a13c amount in the higher range would probably be needed in our experiment i the concentration of 13c labeled propionate was about 8 mm about 400 μmol 13c per g dw sludge this not only ensured sufficient labeling but also was within the 6 8 mm range commonly reached in anaerobic digesters van velsen 1979 rna sip revealed that smithella pelotomaculum syntrophorhabdaceae and bacteroidales incorporated the propionate derived 13c into their rrna in the 0 and 3 n treatments among these smithella were 13c labeled more quickly and to a significantly higher extent indicating the significance of smithella as the key spob in the swine manure sludge two probable reasons may explain why the smithella had a selective advantage over other spob such as pelotomaculum and syntrophobacter de bok et al 2005 imachi et al 2007 first members of smithella may adapt well to a wide range of environmental conditions this is supported by their distribution in very different habitats including rice field soils gan et al 2012 lueders et al 2004b wetland chauhan and ogram 2006 anaerobic digester sludge ariesyady et al 2007 and hydrocarbon contaminated aquifer or oil sands embree et al 2014 gray et al 2011 they may also play important roles in the metabolism of compounds other than propionate ariesyady et al 2007 including butyrate liu et al 1999 crotonic acid liu et al 1999 naphtha siddique et al 2012 n alkane gray et al 2011 wawrik et al 2016 btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes siddique et al 2012 and oil gray et al 2011 in addition in a long term absence of trace metals mo w and se smithella propionica outcompeted syntrophobacter spp for propionate consumption in a uasb reactor worm et al 2009 second it has been shown that smithella spp oxidize propionate to acetate and butyrate via the six carbon dismutation pathway de bok et al 2001 this pathway has the thermodynamic and energetic advantages over the classical methylmalonyl coenzyme a or the mma pathway operating in syntrophobacter and pelotomaculum the gibbs free energy change of the mma pathway eq 1 is more positive 71 7 kj mol propionate stams and plugge 2009 than the dismutation pathway eq 2 δg 0 12 kj mol liu et al 1999 and the further oxidation of the butyrate intermediate eq 3 is less endergonic δg 48 3 kj mol compared with the mma pathway consequently a low thermodynamic sensitivity toward h2 of the dismutation pathway has been indicated that is believed to improve the precarious stability of propionate degradation in methanogenic waste treatment systems dolfing 2013 1 ch3ch2coo 2h2o ch3coo co2 3h2 2 2ch3ch2coo ch3coo ch3ch2ch2coo 3 ch3ch2ch2coo 2h2o 2ch3coo h 2h2 several other t rfs that also increased in the heavy rrna fractions belonged to syntrophorhabdaceae in the 0 n treatment and bacteroidales in the 3 n treatment respectively supplemental table s2 as a representative of the syntrophorhabdaceae syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans strain ui was isolated from a mesophilic digester treating aromatic compound containing wastewater and the strain was known to syntrophically oxidize aromatic compounds p cresol 4 hydroxybenzoate isophthalate and benzoate with a hydrogenotrophic methanogen qiu et al 2008 phylogenetic analysis indicated that syntrophorhabdaceae was closely related to the syntrophaceae family comprised of smithella and syntrophus fig 4 bacteroidales are widespread in ad systems and are possibly involved in various fermentations na et al 2009 in a dna sip experiment labeled with 13c glucose sequences related to the family porphyromonadaceae of bacteroidetes were retrieved in a large number from the heavy dna library suggesting the involvement of bacteroidetes in saccharide fermentation li et al 2009 whether the 13c labeling of syntrophorhabdaceae and bacteroidales in the present study was due to cross feeding or their direct functioning in spo deserves further examinations 4 3 response of methanogens to ammonia stress theoretically the spo and methanogenesis processes would be inhibited if any functional group of the microbial consortia involved namely spob hydrogenotrophic methanogens aceticlastic methanogens was inhibited by ammonia stams and plugge 2009 in our study not only the activity of the main spob smithella fig 8a and b but also those of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were suppressed at high nh4 concentrations the predominance of methanosaetaceae in our incubations fig 5 is consistent with previous studies showing that these aceticlastic methanogens are prevalent in anaerobic wastes digesters and play an important role in methanogenesis and spo ariesyady et al 2007 methanosaetaceae spp can consume acetate down to a concentration of 5 20 μm creating a thermodynamic favorable condition for the spo dong et al 1994 it has been reported that spo was suppressed by 50 if acetate accumulated to a concentration of 20 mm felchner zwirello et al 2013 the filamentous morphology of methanosaeta spp can facilitate the formation of microbial aggregates granular sludge which has been considered to be critical for the success of anaerobic treatment of waste waters de vrieze et al 2013 lettinga 1995 lyu and liu 2018 sieber et al 2014 furthermore methanosaetaceae might be more metabolically and functionally diverse than previously thought smith and ingram smith 2007 apart from acetate the consumption of hydrogen or formate is critical to allow the degradation of propionate to be thermodynamically feasible stams and plugge 2009 we found that the hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum spp possibly play the key role in the methanogenesis from spo the suppression of ammonia on methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae can be the main reason for the dysfunction of methanogenesis and spo in the swine manure digester sludge 4 4 effects on other fermenting bacteria studies conducted with both pure cultures and in situ anaerobic digesters have shown that the bacterial communities have a higher tolerance to ammonia toxicity than methanogenic archaea müller et al 2006 2016 westerholm et al 2012 it has been demonstrated that ammonium is not detrimental to at least three model bacterial species corynebacterium glutamicum escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis even at the level of molar concentrations 1m 28 g nh4 n l 1 müller et al 2006 in a previous study on methanogenic anaerobic digesters the copy numbers of archaeal 16s rrna genes started to decrease at 3 g of nh4 n l 1 but the bacterial 16s rrna copy numbers still remained steady even if the ammonium reached up to 9 g nh4 n l 1 sawayama et al 2004 in our study the similar results were observed the fermentative firmicutes such as clostridium spp and peptostreptococcaceae showed an increase of their 16s rdna and rrna relative abundances in the high n treatments and their activities were evidenced with the continuous production of short chain fatty acids figs 7 and 9 these results suggest that these fermentative bacteria are relatively tolerant to ammonia toxicity in contrast to spob and methanogens i e smithella methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae 5 conclusions the conclusions drawn from the present work are summarized as follows the rate of propionate degradation and ch4 production substantially reduced with the increase of ammonium addition and was completely inhibited if the concentration increased to 7 g nh4 n l 1 the smithella bacteria and methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae archaea were the key players that participated in spo and methanogenesis in the swine manure sludges the suppression of ammonia on methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae might significantly affect methanogenesis that in turn inhibited the spo resulting in the accumulation of propionate taken together out results would help to understand the inhibitory effects of ammonia on

19282,syntrophic propionate oxidation spo coupled with methanogenesis is often inhibited under high ammonium concentrations in anaerobic digesters however the inhibitory mechanism remains poorly understood we conducted two independent laboratory experiments with a swine manure digester sludge in experiment i rna based stable isotope probing sip was applied to determine the active players of both bacteria and methanogens involved in spo under different ammonium concentrations 0 3 and 7 g nh4 n l 1 in experiment ii the dynamics of the bacterial community under ammonia stress was monitored using the 16s rrna pyrosequencing and quantitative pcr under similar conditions as in experiment i but without the addition of external propionate an additional higher ammonium treatment 10 g nh4 n l 1 was applied in experiment ii to maximize the ammonia stress we identified that the smithella bacteria and the methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae archaea were the most active players involved in spo and methanogenesis we revealed that smithella methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae were moderately and severely inhibited at 3 and 7 10 g nh4 n l 1 respectively however the fermentative bacteria appeared to be more tolerant to ammonia stress the microbial responses were corroborated with the accumulation of vfas and the repression of methanogenesis under high ammonium conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords syntrophic propionate oxidation methanogenesis ammonia stress anaerobic digester stable isotope probe 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is widely used to degrade organic waste to biogas which helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels mitigate emission of greenhouse gases and lower environmental pollution mckendry 2002 in methanogenic ad systems complex organic matter is ultimately converted to methane and carbon dioxide by an orchestration of fermentation acetogenesis and methanogenesis schink 1997 the acetogenesis step is catalyzed by bacteria that convert substrates such as fatty acids and alcohols into simple compounds such as h2 co2 formate and acetate this step is endergonic under standard conditions and can process only if the simple compounds produced are consumed by methanogens through a syntrophic association therefore the acetogenesis is regarded to be critical in the ad processes junicke et al 2016 schink 1997 propionate a key product during anaerobic decomposition is degraded via the syntrophic propionate oxidation spo which operates at near thermodynamic equilibrium stams and plugge 2009 several syntrophic propionate oxidation bacteria spob that grow in syntrophy with methanogens have been described including the gram negative syntrophobacter and smithella and gram positive bacteria pelotomaculum and desulfotomaculum isolated from anaerobic digesters mcinerney et al 2008 these spob have been found widespread in anoxic environments such as peats wetlands rice paddy soils sediments and subsurface petroleum reservoirs gan et al 2012 gray et al 2011 schmidt et al 2016 many environmental factors such as temperature gan et al 2012 hydraulic retention time hrt zamanzadeh et al 2013 and levels of propionate ariesyady et al 2007 and trace elements molybdenum tungsten and selenium capson tojo et al 2018 worm et al 2009 have been found to influence the spob communities stable isotope probing sip allows the identification of microbial species that incorporate 13c substrates into their dna or rna radajewski et al 2000 this powerful technique has been used to investigate the active populations responsible for spo in rice field soils gan et al 2012 lueders et al 2004b however a direct identification of the microbial populations responsible for spo in anaerobic digester sludge still remains unavailable this limitation of energy conservation predicts that any subtle disturbances to the ad system could affect the functioning of the spo community and propionate degrading accumulation of ammonium produced from the degradation of protein rich materials is known to inhibits spo and methanogenesis in the anaerobic digesters that treat livestock manure chen et al 2008 montag and schink 2016 wherein free ammonia is considered to be the main source of ammonium stress rajagopal et al 2013 under methanogenic conditions spo involves at least three different groups of microbes namely spob hydrogenotrophic methanogens and aceticlastic methanogens presumably inhibition of any individual group would result in an inhibition of the whole spo process capson tojo et al 2017 stams and plugge 2009 van velsen 1979 a consensus seems to have suggested that syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea have different levels of sensitivity to ammonia but the details appear contradictory calli et al 2005 indicated that spob were more sensitive than methanogenic archaea to free ammonia in anaerobic reactors while other studies suggested just the opposite müller et al 2006 weaterholm et al 2011 wiegant and zeeman 1986 proposed that it was the inhibition of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens that resulted in an accumulation of propionate which further inhibited the aceticlastic methanogens likewise the exact responses of either aceticlastic or hydrogenotrophic methanogens to ammonia varied across a few studies jarrell et al 1987 kato et al 2014 westerholm et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 to gain more insight into the effects of ammonium on microbes involved in spo and methanogenesis we conducted two independent laboratory experiments in the experiment i rna sip technique was applied to identify the active organisms involved in spo in a sludge sample collected from a full scale swine manure digester zhang et al 2014 and in the experiment ii a batch experiment with a wide range of ammonium concentrations was conducted to determine the responses of the entire microbial community in fermentation and methanogenesis to ammonia stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic incubation

amount of propionate for 0 n and 3 n treatments was 8 mm which was segmented into two doses with equal quantity applied at 0 and 82 h respectively for strengthening the 13c labeling for the 7 n treatment the addition of 4 mm propionate occurred only once at 0 h in experiment ii the slurries were incubated for 86 days without preincubation and without addition of propionate swine manure added

supplemental fig s1a the ph values for the 0 and 3 g nh4 n l 1 0 n and 3 n treatments were around 7 1 and 7 0 respectively in the 7 g nh4 n l 1 7 n treatment the ph decreased slightly from 7 0 to 6 9 during the incubation the lower ph in the 7 n treatment was in accordance with the accumulation of fatty acids the nh4 n concentrations for all the treatments remained stable through most of the experimental period supplemental fig s1b in the later stage however nh3 n concentration decreased because of the decreasing ph supplemental fig s1c and d propionate produced from the organic compounds in the swine manure sludge was exhausted in the 0 and 3 n treatments after a pre incubation period of 30 days but about 4 mm of propionate still remained in the 7 n treatment fig 1 c indicating a substantial inhibition of spo at the level of 7 n nevertheless all pre incubated sludge was further incubated with addition of 0 35 mmol 12c or u 13c propionate fig 1c in the 0 and 3 n treatments depletion of propionate occurred at a rate of 3 29 and 1 83 μmol h 1 respectively by 82 h 89 and 49 of the added propionate had been depleted in the 0 and 3 n treatments respectively at this time the identical amount of propionate 0 35 mmol was added again to both treatments to bringing the total addition of 12c or u 13c propionate to 0 7 mmol between 82 and 133 h the rate of propionate degradation was faster in the 0 n 6 52 μmol h 1 than the 3 n 3 09 μmol h 1 treatments in contrast propionate degradation in 7 n treatment was completely inhibited where the total propionate concentration remained unchanged at about 10 mm in slurries the analysis of isotopic carbon ratios revealed that 13c atom of acetate fig 1e increased immediately after addition of u 13c propionate fig 1f and peaked at 89 and 68 at 133 h in the 0 and 3 n treatments respectively meanwhile the total amounts of acetate and formate varied between 0 02 and 0 32 mm and between 0 01 and 0 03 mm respectively while the concentration of butyrate was below the detection limit fig 1a b and d in contrast acetate and butyrate accumulated in the 7 n treatment fig 1b d while the 13c atom of acetate and butyrate remained below 2 throughout the incubation fig 1e and g apparently acetate and butyrate in this treatment were resulted from the degradation of complex organic compounds in swine manure sludge rather than the u 13c propionate added in correspondence with u 13c propionate consumption 13c labeled ch4 was produced in the 0 and 3 n treatments the rate of ch4 production was faster in the 0 n 6 17 μmol h 1 than 3 n treatment 3 89 μmol h 1 after the first addition of propionate fig 2 a the rates further increased after the second addition of propionate at 82 h but it was faster again in the 0 n treatment 9 67 μmol h 1 than in the 3 n treatment 4 60 μmol h 1 the accumulative amount of ch4 eventually reached to about 1 mmol in both treatments theoretically 0 7 mmol propionate could produce 1 23 mmol ch4 suggesting that up to 80 of the propionate had be stoichiometrically converted to ch4 in contrast ch4 production was completely inhibited in the 7 n treatment likewise much less co2 production was produced in the 7 n than the 0 n and 3 n treatments fig 2b the analysis of isotopic carbon ratios revealed that the 13c content of ch4 and co2 increased with the degradation of u 13c propionate in the 0 and 3 n treatments and reached the maximum about 30 after 133 and 81 h respectively fig 2c and d in contrast the 13c atom of ch4 and co2 in the 7 n treatment remained below 2 throughout the incubation 3 1 2 sip targeting bacterial 16s rrna rna sip was applied only for the 0 and 3 n treatments but with multiple times for each treatment fig 3 shows a time course analysis of relative abundance of bacterial individual terminal restriction fragments t rfs across the density gradient with either 12c or 13c labeled propionate in the 0 and 3 n treatments in both the labeled and unlabeled treatments for most of the time points the 195 bp and 520 bp t rfs were the dominant fragments with a combined relative abundance exceeding 50 across the density gradient fig 3 there was only one obvious t rf namely the 509 bp that became more abundant at higher density gradients over time in the 13c labeled treatments fig 3e g for the 0 n and fig 3d e for the 3 n its relative abundance exceeded 20 at the highest density gradient by the end of the samplings fig 3h for the 0 n and fig 3f for the 3 n in contrast in the unlabeled control the relative abundance of the 509 bp t rf remained below 5 across the rna buoyant density gradients fig 3a d for the 0 n and fig 3a c for the 3 n in order to assign the characteristic t rfs to phylogenetic groups four clone libraries were constructed from the samples of different buoyant densities at 133 h for the 0 n treatment and 201 h for the 3 n treatment respectively two of the clone libraries were constructed using light templates of rrna as controls and two retrieved from the heavy templates phylogenetic analysis of 358 sequences indicated that the bacterial community in the sludge comprised mainly firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi supplemental table s2 and fig 4 s2 and s3 actinobacteria spirochaetes synergistetes and unclassified lineages had lower abundances in silico t rf comparisons between heavy and light clone libraries indicated that the light rrna was dominated by the sequences related to clostridia 520 bp t rf for clostridium spp supplemental fig s2 peptostreptococcaceae 195 bp t rf supplemental fig s2 bacilli 152 and 533 bp t rfs supplemental fig s2 and dethiosulfovibrionaceae 140 bp t rf supplemental fig s3 whereas the clone sequences affiliated with smithella 509 bp t rf fig 4 syntrophorhabdaceae 162 bp t rf fig 4 bacteroidales 93 bp t rf supplemental fig s3 and pelotomaculum 142 bp t rf supplemental fig s2 were enriched in the heavy rrna in the 0 and 3 n treatments 3 1 3 sip targeting archaeal 16s rrna rna sip was also done to identify the archaeal members that assimilated the intermediate metabolites of u 13c propionate during the degradation over time the t rflp analysis of archaeal community showed three major t rfs of 84 284 and 393 bp occurring in both the 0 and 3 n treatments and a 186 bp t rf appeared additionally in the 3 n treatment fig 5 in both the 12c and 13c treatments and regardless of density gradient the 284 bp tr f always predominated with a relative abundance of 60 compared with the 12c controls in the 0 n treatment fig 5a d the 393 bp but not the 84 bp t rf became substantially enriched in the heavy rrna fractions at 91 h of the 13c treated slurries fig 5e g however this enrichment of the 393 bp t rf declined subsequently at 133 h fig 5h instead the 84 bp t rf became slightly enriched herein in the 3 n treatment a different pattern emerged it was the 84 bp t rf that became substantially enriched in the heavy rrna fractions at both 91 h and 201 h of the 13c treated slurries fig 5e f four archaeal 16s rrna clone libraries were constructed from the light and heavy fractions at 91 h and 201 h in the 0 and 3 n treatments respectively supplemental table s3 sequencing analysis of 204 clones indicated that the archaeal community in the sludge consisted of methanosaetaceae methanospirillaceae methanomicrobiales methanosarcinaceae and thermoprotei supplemental fig s4 based on in silico analysis of these archaeal sequences the major t rfs were assigned to methanosaetaceae 284 bp methanospirillaceae 393 bp methanomicrobiales 84 bp and methanosarcinaceae 186 bp respectively 3 2 experiment ⅱ nh4 stress on bacterial communities 3 2 1 dynamics of acetate and propionate in experiment ii acetate accumulated and then decomposed rapidly in the 0 and 3 n treatments with the concentration decreasing to a level near to the detection limit about 40 μm in three days fig 6 a in the 7 n treatment acetate increased to 12 mm on day 6 and remained steady within the next month then decreased below 0 3 mm at the end of incubation in the 10 n treatment acetate kept accumulating and reaching 25 mm at the end of incubation a similar acetate dynamic has been shown previously zhang et al 2014 propionate also showed a rapid accumulation in the 0 n treatment but decreased to the level of the detection limit about 40 μm in six days fig 6b in the 3 n treatment propionate increased to 3 5 mm on day 15 and then decreased rapidly to below 0 4 mm after day 22 in the 7 and 10 n treatments the propionate kept increasing and reached 6 0 and 4 2 mm respectively at day 86 3 2 2 bacterial community dynamics bacterial 16s rrna genes and their transcripts were extracted from the sludge samples in different ammonia treatments and analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing phylogenetic analysis indicated that the bacterial community at the phylum level consisted of proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria spirochaetes and synergistetes fig 7 the structure of bacterial community remained relatively stable throughout the incubations fig 7a the firmicutes predominated in all samples accounting for 60 of total bacterial abundance the next major bacterial phyla included bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi accounted for about 10 of total bacterial abundance across treatments along with the elevation of the n level the relative abundance of proteobacteria gradually decreased from about 10 in the 0 n treatment to below 1 in the 10 n treatment the relative abundances of bacterial 16s rrna transcripts revealed some differences from the community composition at the dna level fig 7b the firmicutes still predominated in all samples accounting for over 70 of the total bacterial transcripts in the 0 n treatment however it increased along with the elevation of the n level and peaked at 92 in the 10 n treatment the relative abundance of the bacteroidetes and chloroflexi was lower at the rna level than at the dna level and decreased in response to the increasing n concentration the relative abundance of the proteobacteria was moderately higher at the rna level in the 0 n and 3 n treatments making it the second group of transcriptionally most active organisms after the firmicutes however it decreased below 1 in the 7 and 10 n treatments notably smithella was the dominant genus in the proteobacteria at the lower taxonomic levels family or genus the 16s rrna sequences closely related to smithella and syntrophorhabdaceae were dominant in the clone libraries the relative abundances of their 16s rrna genes and transcripts were calculated and compared among different n levels fig 8 and supplemental fig s5 in general the relative abundances of smithella and syntrophorhabdaceae were highest in the 0 n treatment reaching to 3 9 and 5 0 for the 16s rrna genes and transcripts of smithella and 1 8 and 2 2 for those of syntrophorhabdaceae respectively furthermore the relative abundances of two groups at both gene and transcript levels increased with the time of incubation in this treatment the relative abundances at the gene level however decreased with the increase of ammonium concentration fig 8a and c and did not show a clear tendency over the incubation time for the 3 7 and 10 n treatments the decline tendency with the increase of nh4 n was more substantial at the transcript level notably while smithella and syntrophorhabdaceae kept a moderate abundances of their 16s rrna genes their transcript abundances were close to zero at the 7 n and 10 n levels 3 2 3 dynamics of total bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers the total bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers estimated by quantitative pcr ranged from 3 2 1011 to 1 9 1012 copies g 1 sludge dw fig 9 a within the low n treatments the copy number increased over time at the early stage then decreased after day 10 the total 16s rrna gene copy numbers exhibited the significant difference between the low n and high n treatments fig 9b but there was no significant difference either between the 0 and 3 n treatments or between the 7 and 10 n treatments fig 9b 4 discussions 4 1 impacts of ammonia on propionate oxidation and methanogenesis in the present study we showed that the average rates of propionate consumption and methane production decreased from 4 9 to 7 52 μmol h 1 in the 0 n treatment to 2 36 and 4 75 μmol h 1 in the 3 n treatment or reduced by 52 and 37 respectively in the 7 n treatment 7 g nh4 n l 1 corresponding to 69 mg nh3 n l 1 both propionate degradation and methane production were completely inhibited these results are in line with a previous study that reported 48 reduction in ch4 production rate when the total ammonia ammonium nitrogen tan concentration increased from 3 to 5 8 g l 1 in a continuously stirrer tank reactor sung and liu 2003 on the other hand the existence of propionate degraders resistant to the extremely high ammonium concentration 6 g nh4 n l 1 in anaerobic bioreactors has been reported calli et al 2005 however such resistance was not observed in our study fig 8 propionate and acetate transiently accumulated and were depleted thereafter in the 0 and 3 n treatments fig 1b and c in the 10 n treatment however propionate and acetate accumulated throughout the incubation fig 6a b suggesting a strong inhibition on the degradation of propionate and acetate the 7 n treatment exhibited an interesting pattern in experiment ii where acetate fig 6a decreased gradually in the later stage of incubation while propionate kept accumulating this suggests that consumption of acetate alone would not be sufficient for the resumption of propionate degradation in a previous study we showed that hydrogen accumulated to a significant extent in high nh4 treatments zhang et al 2014 the h2 accumulation may build a stronger thermodynamic barrier for the degradation of propionate 4 2 spob and their responses to ammonia stress in soil and sediment samples biomass usually can be sufficiently labeled after the incorporation of 5 500 μmol 13c per g whiteley et al 2007 since microbial biomass in anaerobic sludge is often richer a13c amount in the higher range would probably be needed in our experiment i the concentration of 13c labeled propionate was about 8 mm about 400 μmol 13c per g dw sludge this not only ensured sufficient labeling but also was within the 6 8 mm range commonly reached in anaerobic digesters van velsen 1979 rna sip revealed that smithella pelotomaculum syntrophorhabdaceae and bacteroidales incorporated the propionate derived 13c into their rrna in the 0 and 3 n treatments among these smithella were 13c labeled more quickly and to a significantly higher extent indicating the significance of smithella as the key spob in the swine manure sludge two probable reasons may explain why the smithella had a selective advantage over other spob such as pelotomaculum and syntrophobacter de bok et al 2005 imachi et al 2007 first members of smithella may adapt well to a wide range of environmental conditions this is supported by their distribution in very different habitats including rice field soils gan et al 2012 lueders et al 2004b wetland chauhan and ogram 2006 anaerobic digester sludge ariesyady et al 2007 and hydrocarbon contaminated aquifer or oil sands embree et al 2014 gray et al 2011 they may also play important roles in the metabolism of compounds other than propionate ariesyady et al 2007 including butyrate liu et al 1999 crotonic acid liu et al 1999 naphtha siddique et al 2012 n alkane gray et al 2011 wawrik et al 2016 btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes siddique et al 2012 and oil gray et al 2011 in addition in a long term absence of trace metals mo w and se smithella propionica outcompeted syntrophobacter spp for propionate consumption in a uasb reactor worm et al 2009 second it has been shown that smithella spp oxidize propionate to acetate and butyrate via the six carbon dismutation pathway de bok et al 2001 this pathway has the thermodynamic and energetic advantages over the classical methylmalonyl coenzyme a or the mma pathway operating in syntrophobacter and pelotomaculum the gibbs free energy change of the mma pathway eq 1 is more positive 71 7 kj mol propionate stams and plugge 2009 than the dismutation pathway eq 2 δg 0 12 kj mol liu et al 1999 and the further oxidation of the butyrate intermediate eq 3 is less endergonic δg 48 3 kj mol compared with the mma pathway consequently a low thermodynamic sensitivity toward h2 of the dismutation pathway has been indicated that is believed to improve the precarious stability of propionate degradation in methanogenic waste treatment systems dolfing 2013 1 ch3ch2coo 2h2o ch3coo co2 3h2 2 2ch3ch2coo ch3coo ch3ch2ch2coo 3 ch3ch2ch2coo 2h2o 2ch3coo h 2h2 several other t rfs that also increased in the heavy rrna fractions belonged to syntrophorhabdaceae in the 0 n treatment and bacteroidales in the 3 n treatment respectively supplemental table s2 as a representative of the syntrophorhabdaceae syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans strain ui was isolated from a mesophilic digester treating aromatic compound containing wastewater and the strain was known to syntrophically oxidize aromatic compounds p cresol 4 hydroxybenzoate isophthalate and benzoate with a hydrogenotrophic methanogen qiu et al 2008 phylogenetic analysis indicated that syntrophorhabdaceae was closely related to the syntrophaceae family comprised of smithella and syntrophus fig 4 bacteroidales are widespread in ad systems and are possibly involved in various fermentations na et al 2009 in a dna sip experiment labeled with 13c glucose sequences related to the family porphyromonadaceae of bacteroidetes were retrieved in a large number from the heavy dna library suggesting the involvement of bacteroidetes in saccharide fermentation li et al 2009 whether the 13c labeling of syntrophorhabdaceae and bacteroidales in the present study was due to cross feeding or their direct functioning in spo deserves further examinations 4 3 response of methanogens to ammonia stress theoretically the spo and methanogenesis processes would be inhibited if any functional group of the microbial consortia involved namely spob hydrogenotrophic methanogens aceticlastic methanogens was inhibited by ammonia stams and plugge 2009 in our study not only the activity of the main spob smithella fig 8a and b but also those of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were suppressed at high nh4 concentrations the predominance of methanosaetaceae in our incubations fig 5 is consistent with previous studies showing that these aceticlastic methanogens are prevalent in anaerobic wastes digesters and play an important role in methanogenesis and spo ariesyady et al 2007 methanosaetaceae spp can consume acetate down to a concentration of 5 20 μm creating a thermodynamic favorable condition for the spo dong et al 1994 it has been reported that spo was suppressed by 50 if acetate accumulated to a concentration of 20 mm felchner zwirello et al 2013 the filamentous morphology of methanosaeta spp can facilitate the formation of microbial aggregates granular sludge which has been considered to be critical for the success of anaerobic treatment of waste waters de vrieze et al 2013 lettinga 1995 lyu and liu 2018 sieber et al 2014 furthermore methanosaetaceae might be more metabolically and functionally diverse than previously thought smith and ingram smith 2007 apart from acetate the consumption of hydrogen or formate is critical to allow the degradation of propionate to be thermodynamically feasible stams and plugge 2009 we found that the hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum spp possibly play the key role in the methanogenesis from spo the suppression of ammonia on methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae can be the main reason for the dysfunction of methanogenesis and spo in the swine manure digester sludge 4 4 effects on other fermenting bacteria studies conducted with both pure cultures and in situ anaerobic digesters have shown that the bacterial communities have a higher tolerance to ammonia toxicity than methanogenic archaea müller et al 2006 2016 westerholm et al 2012 it has been demonstrated that ammonium is not detrimental to at least three model bacterial species corynebacterium glutamicum escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis even at the level of molar concentrations 1m 28 g nh4 n l 1 müller et al 2006 in a previous study on methanogenic anaerobic digesters the copy numbers of archaeal 16s rrna genes started to decrease at 3 g of nh4 n l 1 but the bacterial 16s rrna copy numbers still remained steady even if the ammonium reached up to 9 g nh4 n l 1 sawayama et al 2004 in our study the similar results were observed the fermentative firmicutes such as clostridium spp and peptostreptococcaceae showed an increase of their 16s rdna and rrna relative abundances in the high n treatments and their activities were evidenced with the continuous production of short chain fatty acids figs 7 and 9 these results suggest that these fermentative bacteria are relatively tolerant to ammonia toxicity in contrast to spob and methanogens i e smithella methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae 5 conclusions the conclusions drawn from the present work are summarized as follows the rate of propionate degradation and ch4 production substantially reduced with the increase of ammonium addition and was completely inhibited if the concentration increased to 7 g nh4 n l 1 the smithella bacteria and methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae archaea were the key players that participated in spo and methanogenesis in the swine manure sludges the suppression of ammonia on methanosaetaceae and methanospirillaceae might significantly affect methanogenesis that in turn inhibited the spo resulting in the accumulation of propionate taken together out results would help to understand the inhibitory effects of ammonia on

19283,uv monochloramine nh2cl process has attracted some attention for the elimination of contaminants of emerging concern as a novel advanced oxidation process however there is still much uncertainty on the performance and mechanisms of uv nh2cl process because of its complexity and generation of various species of radicals including nh2 ho cl and other reactive chlorine species rcs the mechanism and influence factors of degradation of carbamazepine cbz in the uv nh2cl process were investigated and a synergistic effect was observed degradation of cbz under all investigated conditions followed pseudo first order kinetics the corresponding rate constant increased along with the dosage of nh2cl and was affected significantly by the presence of bicarbonate and natural organic matter the process has little ph dependency while the specific contribution of rcs and ho changed with solution ph and rcs always act as a major contributor to the degradation of cbz eleven byproducts of cbz were identified and their respective evolution profiles were determined the participation of uv in chloramination can reduce the formation of nitrogenous dbps but promote the formation of carbonaceous dbps furthermore when influent sand filtered and granular activated carbon filtered water was respectively used as background degradation of cbz was inhibited to different degree and more disinfection byproducts dbps were generated compared to deionized water the electrical energy per order for degradation of cbz in the uv nh2cl process was also calculated to obtain some preliminary cost information graphical abstract image 1 keywords reactive species degradation pathway disinfection byproducts application potential water treatment 1 introduction chlorination is the most commonly utilized technology for disinfection of drinking water deborde and von gunten 2008 and recreational water li and blatchley iii 2008 however since trichloromethane tcm was identified as a disinfection byproduct dbp of chlorination in 1974 bellar et al 1974 countless kinds of dbps generated from chlorination have been found and identified chu et al 2016 richardson et al 2007 due to the regulatory limitation and increasing concern of chlorinated dbps many other alternative disinfectants were researched and used to replace chlorine to reduce the formation potential of dbps sedlak and von gunten 2011 among these disinfectants monochloramine nh2cl which can be readily generated through the reaction between ammonia and chlorine has attracted significant interest nh2cl shows superiority in reducing formation potential of dbps owing to its relatively low reactivity with organics hua and reckhow 2007 li and blatchley iii 2008 shah et al 2012 additionally nh2cl is an ideal agent to provide long lasting residual chlorine in distribution system because of its stability he et al 2016 sakai et al 2016 however for the same reasons stability and low reactivity the disinfection time of nh2cl is usually much longer than that of chlorine cl2 and degradation of emerging contaminants by chloramines is not efficient he et al 2016 therefore for drinking water treatment plants dwtps that apply nh2cl as disinfectant how to improve the use efficiency of nh2cl is still an issue for practitioners and researchers uv based treatment of contaminated water has been a topic of high interest and several new applications have been demonstrated during the last few decades bu et al 2016 duan et al 2017 he et al 2012 khan et al 2013 especially the combination of chlorine and uv duan et al 2018 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 huang et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 recent enhanced activity in uv cl2 process brought much convenience to upgrade dwtps because of the common existence of chlorination and it implies the possibility of coupling uv with other disinfectants such as nh2cl some researchers de laat et al 2010 li and blatchley iii 2008 investigated decomposition fate of inorganic chloramines nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 by uv irradiation it was reported that chlorine atom cl and amino radical nh2 were yielded when inorganic chloramines were exposed to uv and the cumulative concentration of cl formed from uv nh2cl was 2 4 times higher than that from uv cl2 chuang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 consequently uv nh2cl process as an advanced oxidation process aop began to receive attention in the last few years chuang et al 2017 li et al 2018 patton et al 2016 although little research specifically studied uv nh2cl process the related reactions usually occur in other commonly researched processes examples include the following 1 the presence of ammonia affects performance of chlorination because chlorine species are dependent on the ratio of cl n which is known as breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1992 wang et al 2017 the concentration of residual chlorine equals that of chloramines when cl n ranges from 0 to 1 thereby uv cl2 process would become the combination of uv cl2 nh2cl process when ammonia exists in the contaminated water zhang et al 2015 2018 2 some uv h2o2 processes are also in fact the combination of uv nh2cl h2o2 process when membrane filtration is set in advance because nh2cl is a commonly used reagent to control the membrane biological fouling and it can pass through the membranes to reach the uv h2o2 reactor da silva et al 2006 xu et al 2010 up to date much attention has been paid to uv cl2 and uv h2o2 processes but it is equally important for us to deepen the understanding for the uv nh2cl process however little study has been dedicated so far to the degradation mechanism of contaminants the subsequent formation of dbps in the uv nh2cl process and its performance in actual waters nh2cl exposed to uv was proposed to produce cl and nh2 with a quantum yield of 0 50 mol es 1 as shown in table 1 reaction 1 soltermann et al 2014 then cl could be transformed to hydroxyl radical ho dichloride radical anion cl2 and chloramine radical nhcl via its reaction with hydroxide chloride and nh2cl respectively reactions 2 5 besides nh2cl would be converted to dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 when the solution ph changes which can also be decomposed to reactive species by uv irradiation with quantum yields of 1 06 and 2 11 mol es 1 soltermann et al 2014 hence degradation of organic contaminants in the uv nh2cl process is rather complex in this study carbamazepine cbz was selected as the target pollutant because it is a commonly detected organic contaminant usually with detected concentrations of ng l 1 μg l 1 deng et al 2013 as documented the average annual consumption of cbz all over the world is 1014 tons zhang et al 2008 and large portion of the consumed cbz is discharged to the natural water bodies cbz in natural waters is persistent and biorefractory and pose an ecological risk potential to the environment furthermore because of the poor removal efficiency of cbz by conventional water treatment processes several aops were studied to efficiently remove cbz including uv h2o2 vogna et al 2004 uv cl2 zhou et al 2016 etc however the use of uv nh2cl as an aop to degrade cbz has not been reported overall the objectives of the present work were to 1 evaluate the effect of typical parameters including nh2cl dosage ph alkalinity and nom on degradation of cbz in the uv nh2cl process 2 differentiate individual contributions of each reactive species in the uv nh2cl process 3 identify and track transformation products of cbz and propose a degradation pathway and 4 investigate the efficiency of the uv nh2cl process in influent sand filtered and granular activated carbon gac filtered water from dwtps and compare the formation of carbonaceous c and nitrogenous n dbps in deionized water and aforementioned three actual waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all purchased chemicals are listed in si text s1 nh2cl solution was freshly prepared every single day following the method reported by xia et al 2017 naocl solution was added dropwise into the nh4cl solution under stirring with a chlorine to nitrogen molar ratio of 0 8 at ph 8 5 for 0 5 h the influent sand filtered and gac filtered water were sampled from a dwtp in hunan province china 2 2 experimental procedures the uv irradiation experiments were conducted in a submerged photochemical reactor with a low pressure mercury lamp philips emission at 253 7 nm 1 85 mw cm 2 the experiments were performed with 5 μm cbz and 70 μm nh2cl based on cl2 solution ph 6 0 8 0 was controlled by 2 mm phosphate buffer different dosages of hco3 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mm and nom 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg c l 1 were added to the reactor when the effect of hco3 and nom were evaluated at each predetermined time interval 1 ml solution was sampled and quenched immediately with 50 μl solution with 0 5 m na2s2o3 all the experiments were replicated three times statistically significant differences among experiments were tested by analysis of variance anova using spss and the probability p value was set at 0 05 for all analyses 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of cbz in solutions was measured using an hplc 1260 agilent usa transformation products of cbz were identified using a positive esi hplc 1290 triple quadrupole ms 6460 agilent detailed conditions are described in si text s2 the concentrations of total chlorine free chlorine and monochloramine were determined by a multifunctional water quality parameter analyzer dr3900 hach usa revised from the traditional dpd method chlorinated dbps were monitored as the method documented in our previous research zhou et al 2016 acute and chronic toxicity of cbz and its transformation products was theoretically estimated by ecosar si text s3 the cytotoxicity of generated dbps was assessed using the method reported by liu et al 2018 which is based on lc50 value chinese hamster ovary cells of each dbp and the assumption that toxicity of dbps is additive the values of lc50 of detected dbps are listed in si table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of cbz by the uv nh2cl process the degradation of cbz by chloramination uv photolysis and uv nh2cl process were investigated and compared different from chlorination chloramination is rarely used to remove organic contaminants because of its low reactivity with organics similar to the results reported by other researchers wang et al 2017 negligible amount of cbz was degraded by chloramination less than 5 si fig s1 meanwhile though cbz has a molar extinction coefficient of 6072 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm kim et al 2009 it is still hard to be degraded under direct photolysis by uv at a uv fluence of 445 mj cm 2 roughly 10 si fig s1 because of its structural stability in contrast cbz was eliminated efficiently at 445 mj cm 2 of the uv nh2cl exposure with a removal of 35 75 when the dosage of nh2cl ranged from 20 to 100 μm as shown in fig 1 a following pseudo first order kinetics si fig s2 the corresponding pseudo first order rate constant significantly increased from 0 0011 to 0 0031 cm2 mj 1 anova p 0 05 the observed synergistic degradation of cbz may stem from the efficient generation of ho and rcs and the formation of these species was promoted with the increasing of nh2cl dosage however the rate of increment slowed down when nh2cl dosage increased from 50 to 100 μm which can be attributed to reaction 2 5 and 10 in table 1 excess nh2cl can transform reactive radicals into radicals of low oxidation ability experiments were also performed with solution ph of 6 0 8 0 because nh2cl would be the main species of chloramines under these conditions soulard et al 1981 and all chloramine species including nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 are relatively stable in the dark at these ph values li and blatchley iii 2008 meanwhile these values of ph are also most likely to exist in dwtps where uv and chloramination may be combined together as presented the performance of uv nh2cl process for degradation of cbz had little ph dependence fig 1 b and the rate constant decreased slightly from 0 0025 to 0 0022 cm2 mj 1 when solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 si fig s3 notably all the p values between different ph calculated via anova were above 0 05 indicating that the effect of ph on degradation of cbz was insignificant under the investigated range the little ph dependence for degradation of cbz was likely attributed to the fact that photolytic degradation of nh2cl does not depend on ph li and blatchley iii 2008 furthermore bicarbonate hco3 is the major inorganic carbon species 83 3 under neutral conditions which reacts with the radicals generated in the uv nh2cl process with high second order rate constants to produce carbonate radical co3 reactions 11 14 in table 1 as reported the concentration of hco3 ranges from dozens to hundreds mg l 1 in natural water bodies xie et al 2015 so the role of hco3 at concentrations varying from 0 to 8 0 mm 0 488 mg l 1 was investigated in this work when the concentration of hco3 was fixed at 4 0 and 8 0 mm solution ph cannot be buffered with 2 0 mm phosphate buffer which increased to around 8 0 8 5 the according ph had no influence on degradation of cbz in uv nh2cl process as discussed in last paragraph as presented in fig 1 c the presence of hco3 appreciably suppressed degradation of cbz and the corresponding rate constant decreased from 0 0026 to 0 0005 cm2 mj 1 when concentration of hco3 increased from 0 to 8 0 mm anova p 0 05 si fig s4 the observed inhibitory effect was probably caused by the selectivity and relatively low oxidation ability of co3 for cbz of note nom remaining in sand filtered water in dwtps brings many problems to subsequent disinfection and aops because it is a major precursor of dbps and can compete for oxidants therefore nom of different dosages 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg c l 1 were added to the system to assess its impact on efficiency of the uv nhcl2 process uv fluence would be different with the presence of nom considering its uv absorption so the degradation kinetic of cbz was expressed as a function of time as shown in fig 1 d only 45 8 cbz was removed by the uv nhcl2 process at reaction time of 4 min with the presence of 8 mg c l 1 nom meanwhile the degradation rate constant of cbz gradually decreased from 0 2934 to 0 1526 min 1 when the concentration of nom increased from 0 to 8 0 mg c l 1 anova p 0 05 si fig s5 this phenomenon resulted from the competitive role of nom reactions 15 and 16 in table 1 and its uv absorption effect which lead to the decrease in steady state concentrations of ho nh2 and rcs temperature is also a common factor influencing treatment efficiency in dwtp experiments with temperatures at 15 25 35 and 45 c were performed to determine its effect on degradation of cbz in uv nhcl2 process and the results were presented in fig 1 e as expected heating significantly accelerated the degradation of cbz according to arrhenius equation with the rate constant increasing from 0 0020 to 0 0040 cm2 mj 1 anova p 0 05 si fig s6 3 2 contributions of hydroxyl radical and reactive chlorine species to determine the individual contributions of uv rcs and ho to the degradation of cbz by the uv nh2cl process the kinetic expression of cbz degradation is given as follows 1 d cbz dt k uv cbz cbz k nh 2 cl cbz nh 2 cl cbz k ho cbz ho cbz k nh 2 cbz nh 2 cbz k cl cbz cl cbz k cl 2 cbz cl 2 cbz k cloh cbz cloh cbz k nhcl cbz nhcl cbz where k uv cbz is the degradation rate constant of cbz by uv irradiation and other kspecies cbz represent second order rate constants of oxidants with cbz as most rate constants of cbz with rcs are not available a total contribution to the degradation of cbz made by rcs is proposed according to the method of wu et al 2016 eq 1 can be rearranged into 2 d cbz dt k uv cbz cbz k nh 2 cl cbz nh 2 cl cbz k ho cbz ho cbz k nh 2 cbz nh 2 cbz k rcs cbz cbz where k rcs cbz is the degradation rate constant pseudo first order of cbz by rcs degradation of cbz by chloramination can be ignored according to the results shown in si fig s1 besides since nh2 is a much weaker oxidant with a standard redox potential of 0 6 v than ho and rcs neta et al 1988 cbz degraded by nh2 can also be neglected therefore eq 2 can be integrated by time as 3 0 t d cbz 0 t k uv cbz cbz dt 0 t k ho cbz ho cbz dt 0 t k rcs cbz cbz dt as shown the contribution of rcs could be calculated through total degradation rate minus those degraded by uv shown in si fig s7 and ho eq 3 0 t k ho cbz ho cbz dt can be turned into 4 0 t k ho cbz ho cbz dt k ho cbz cbz 0 t 1 0 t 1 ho dt cbz t n 1 t n t n 1 t n ho dt cbz t n t t n t ho dt where cbz t n 1 t n is the average concentration of cbz during the period from tn 1 to tn and the value of k ho cbz was reported to be 2 05 109 m 1 s 1 vogna et al 2004 the concentration of ho cannot be directly determined so an indirect method reported by other researchers was used to measure the profile of ho wu et al 2016 where nitrobenzene nb was used as the probe because of its low reactivity with all kinds of radicals except ho k ho nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 the details of the method are described in si si text s4 according to the aforementioned equations and si text s4 the contributions to the degradation of cbz made by ho and rcs were calculated as shown in si table s2 then degradation of cbz which was mainly due to uv rcs and ho at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 was illustrated in fig 2 as a function of uv fluence as shown though the total removals of cbz were nearly identical the respective contribution of ho and rcs differed from each other under these three ph values specifically at uv fluence of 445 mj cm 2 the contributions of uv ho and rcs to degradation of cbz were 7 1 32 3 and 60 6 at ph 6 0 10 0 23 4 and 66 6 at ph 7 0 9 4 38 7 and 51 9 at ph 8 0 note that degradation rate of cbz by rcs at ph 8 0 was lower than those at other two ph values the phenomenon is consistent with the results predicted from a model in another publication chuang et al 2017 it was calculated by a mathematical model that the steady state concentration of rcs at ph 8 1 was less than those at ph 5 5 and 7 0 on the other hand degradation of cbz by ho showed the lowest efficiency at ph 7 0 which can be explained by the fact that the oxidation potential of ho is 1 8 v in neutral solution which is lower than its standard potential 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 overall no matter how their contributions changed rcs were always the dominant contributors to the degradation of cbz in the uv nh2cl process compared with ho 3 3 identification of transformation products of cbz in the uv nh2cl process the molecular weight and structures for transformation products of cbz in the uv nh2cl process were proposed according to the obtained accurate mass to charge ratio m z and spectra because of the unavailability of their standards a total of eleven byproducts of cbz in the uv nh2cl process were identified and some of them were isomers which could be distinguished by their different retention times si fig s8 and table s3 based on the identification and evolution profiles of the proposed byproducts a preliminary degradation pathway of cbz in the present system was proposed and exhibited in fig 3 because of the simultaneous involvement of uv ho and rcs different reactions including hydroxylation chlorine or amine substitution electron transfer etc can take place in this system as shown aromatic ring and heterocyclic ring of cbz molecule are two reactive sites in the uv nh2cl process for the benzene ring substitution reaction occurred under the attack of rcs as illustrated in si scheme s1 duan et al 2018 an aromatic radical was generated as an intermediate after attacking by rcs then peroxyl radical was produced with the presence of dissolved oxygen in solution after that the yield of cl substituted p4 were observed a nitro substituted compound p5 also appeared probably because of the presence of nh2 of note the most susceptible site of cbz molecule is the double bond located at heterocyclic ring marked in red in fig 3 which can be easily attacked by reactive species to yield p1 kosjek et al 2009 afterward p1 can be transformed into a heterocyclic radical and subsequent electron transfer lead to the generation of p2 scheme 1 in fig 3 furthermore under the continuous attack of ho and the break of heterocyclic ring another peroxyl radical can be generated and p3 can be formed scheme 1 li et al 2011 on the other hand the double bond marked in red can undergo a classic hydroxylation to yield p6 as proposed in si scheme s2 he et al 2014 and following substitution reaction can occur to generate p11 then under the attack of ho hydroxylation can take place on heterocyclic ring of p2 and p3 to produce p8 and p9 respectively with the loss of conh2 kosjek et al 2009 li et al 2011 both p8 and p9 can form p10 from different ways as presented in fig 3 further oxidation including ring open reactions on aforementioned byproducts may occur to generate compounds with smaller molecular weight not detected moreover though the peak areas cannot be directly expressed as the corresponding concentrations general trends of evolution profiles of transformation products versus uv fluence can be presented fig 4 among aforementioned byproducts compound with m z of 252 0899 p1 has the highest abundance in addition cl and no2 substituted compounds with m z of 286 0509 p11 270 1004 p4 and 281 08 p5 initially increased with uv fluence and then decreased in residuals besides the abundance of primary byproducts see fig 3 with m z of 252 0899 p6 and 270 065 p2 reached peak value early on and decreased with uv fluence afterward other byproducts kept increasing over investigated uv fluence as the incomplete mineralization of cbz the byproducts generated during uv nh2cl may have an adverse effect on human health therefore the acute and chronic toxicity of cbz and its transformation products was calculated si table s4 except p4 p8 and p10 si fig s9 all other transformation products presented lower acute and chronic toxicity than cbz nonetheless p10 was the last byproduct detected in the degradation pathway leaving a potential risk toxicological interactions of cbz and its transformation products are also unknown so further research and ameliorations are needed for uv nh2cl process to reduce the toxicity of contaminants 3 4 formation of dbps during chloramination and uv chloramine of cbz cbz and its transformation products are potential precursors for chlorinated dbps thereby commonly detected dbps were determined after treatment by chloramination and uv nh2cl process respectively as cbz was the only carbon source in this system dbp yield can be used to show the formation of dbps which is the ratio of total concentration of generated dbps μm to degraded concentration of cbz μm as shown in fig 5 formation of tcm trichloroacetonitrile tcan trichloronitromethane tcnm was observed in both processes in specific tcm tcan and tcnm yields of cbz were 0 36 2 08 and 1 29 during chloramination 1 33 2 04 and 0 77 during uv nh2cl process respectively the participation of uv led to a slight decrease in generation of tcan and tcnm but increase in tcm formation the decreased formation of tcan and tcnm in uv nh2cl process was possibly resulted from the reduced level of organic nitrogen and photolysis of nh2cl while the increased formation of tcm in presence of uv indicated that transformation products of cbz are more readily to provide carbon source than cbz to generate tcm the results also demonstrated that degradation of targeted contaminant did not necessarily mean decreased formation of dbps besides theoretical cytotoxicity of generated dbps during the aforementioned two processes was also evaluated the lc50 listed in si table s1 implied that tcan and tcnm made the major contribution to total cytotoxicity as shown the theoretical cytotoxicity of dbps decreased slightly when uv was involved in the reactions which was mainly caused by the reduced formation of n dbps 3 5 degradation of cbz and subsequent formation of dbp in actual waters as discussed in section 3 1 efficiency of the uv nh2cl process can be appreciably influenced by the presence of hco3 and nom therefore to evaluate the potential of uv nh2cl process in practical application influent sand filtered and gac filtered waters from dwtp were applied as background to test the degradation of cbz basic parameters of these waters were presented in si table s5 similar to solutions with nom uv absorption of water matrices in actual waters also influences uv fluence so degradation of cbz in actual waters was expressed as a function of time si fig s10 and fig 6 a as shown in fig 6 a the degradation rate constants in influent sand filtered gac filtered and di waters were 0 0622 0 0753 0 1830 and 0 3386 min 1 respectively degradation of cbz in influent water was inhibited significantly due to the presence of nom and other water components after traditional treatment in dwtp degradation efficiency was enhanced slightly in sand filtered water further confirming the limit of traditional processes for removing contaminants of emerging concern best performance among actual water samples was observed in gac filtered water indicating that gac filter can be an ideal process between traditional process and aops to remove extra water matrices the results were consistent with duan et al 2018 who did similar investigation using uv chlorine process of note even in influent water the degradation efficiency of uv nh2cl process was much better than that of chloramination in di water si fig s10 moreover enhanced formation of aforementioned three dbps was observed during both chloramination and uv nh2cl process in actual waters because of complex water matrices fig 6 b as depicted presence of uv changed concentration of individual dbp to different degree but substantially has no influence on the total level of generated dbps 3 6 engineering implications for uv chloramine process the discussion above indicates that combination of uv and nh2cl is a promising technology for degradation of emerging organic pollutants and control of dbps in dwtps therefore the ee o value for degradation of cbz by uv nh2cl process was calculated to obtain some preliminary cost information detailed method and procedure were summarized from some previous research studies wu et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 see si text s5 as illustrated in si fig s11 the required electrical energy of uv source ee ouv decreased with the increasing of nh2cl dosage in general when the dosage of nh2cl was below 70 μm ee ouv made a dominant contribution to the total ee o then ee ouv and ee onh2cl became similar contributors to ee ototal when the dosage of nh2cl kept increasing from 70 to 100 μm therefore the total ee o decreased first and increased with the rise of nh2cl dosage afterward and an optimal dosage of nh2cl was observed around 70 μm furthermore the corresponding value of ee o was 11 times lower than that consumed by uv photolysis process however the economic evaluation in this section can only provide some theoretical basis instead of complete economic cost of the process further detailed calculation would be performed in some scale up fields in the future studies moreover as presented in si fig s12 compared with most widely implemented oxidants h2o2 and s2o8 2 in uv homogeneous system the combination of nh2cl and uv has no obvious inferiority for dwtps the residual h2o2 or s2o8 2 still need to be quenched while residual nh2cl can be directly used as a secondary disinfectant in distribution system therefore for dwtps applying nh2cl for disinfection the most convenient way to improve the quality of effluent water is to install uv lamps in disinfection stage without adding other chemicals 4 conclusion this study reveals that the synergistic effect between uv and monochloramine can degrade contaminants of emerging concern such as cbz and control formation of dbps efficiently and the following conclusions can be obtained a participation of uv can significantly improve the oxidation ability of nh2cl because of the generation of ho nh2 and rcs the degradation of contaminant is accelarated with the increasing of nh2cl dose while the presence of bicarbonate and nom inhibits its degradation b the overall degradation rate by the uv nh2cl process has no ph dependency but the specific contribution to degradation of cbz by ho and rcs varies depending on ph the relatively low efficiency was observed at ph 8 0 and 7 0 for rcs and ho respectively rcs is always the predominant contributor to the degradation of cbz under all three investigated ph values c eleven transformation products of cbz resulted from electron transfer hydrogen atom abstraction hydroxylation and heterocyclic ring oxidation are identified most of them have lower theoretical toxicity than cbz dbps including tcm tcan and tcnm were detected during chloramination and uv chloramine of cbz addition of uv increases the formation potential of tcm but decreases that of tcan and tcnm d despite that degradation of cbz is inhibited and formation of dbps is enhanced in actual field waters relatively satisfactory degradation of the uv nh2cl process can be achieved in gac filtered water acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the national natural science

19283,uv monochloramine nh2cl process has attracted some attention for the elimination of contaminants of emerging concern as a novel advanced oxidation process however there is still much uncertainty on the performance and mechanisms of uv nh2cl process because of its complexity and generation of various species of radicals including nh2 ho cl and other reactive chlorine species rcs the mechanism and influence factors of degradation of carbamazepine cbz in the uv nh2cl process were investigated and a synergistic effect was observed degradation of cbz under all investigated conditions followed pseudo first order kinetics the corresponding rate constant increased along with the dosage of nh2cl and was affected significantly by the presence of bicarbonate and natural organic matter the process has little ph dependency while the specific contribution of rcs and ho changed with solution ph and rcs always act as a major contributor to the degradation of cbz eleven byproducts of cbz were identified and their respective evolution profiles were determined the participation of uv in chloramination can reduce the formation of nitrogenous dbps but promote the formation of carbonaceous dbps furthermore when influent sand filtered and granular activated carbon filtered water was respectively used as background degradation of cbz was inhibited to different degree and more disinfection byproducts dbps were generated compared to deionized water the electrical energy per order for degradation of cbz in the uv nh2cl process was also calculated to obtain some preliminary cost information graphical abstract image 1 keywords reactive species degradation pathway disinfection byproducts application potential water treatment 1 introduction chlorination is the most commonly utilized technology for disinfection of drinking water deborde and von gunten 2008 and recreational water li and blatchley iii 2008 however since trichloromethane tcm was identified as a disinfection byproduct dbp of chlorination in 1974 bellar et al 1974 countless kinds of dbps generated from chlorination have been found and identified chu et al 2016 richardson et al 2007 due to the regulatory limitation and increasing concern of chlorinated dbps many other alternative disinfectants were researched and used to replace chlorine to reduce the formation potential of dbps sedlak and von gunten 2011 among these disinfectants monochloramine nh2cl which can be readily generated through the reaction between ammonia and chlorine has attracted significant interest nh2cl shows superiority in reducing formation potential of dbps owing to its relatively low reactivity with organics hua and reckhow 2007 li and blatchley iii 2008 shah et al 2012 additionally nh2cl is an ideal agent to provide long lasting residual chlorine in distribution system because of its stability he et al 2016 sakai et al 2016 however for the same reasons stability and low reactivity the disinfection time of nh2cl is usually much longer than that of chlorine cl2 and degradation of emerging contaminants by chloramines is not efficient he et al 2016 therefore for drinking water treatment plants dwtps that apply nh2cl as disinfectant how to improve the use efficiency of nh2cl is still an issue for practitioners and researchers uv based treatment of contaminated water has been a topic of high interest and several new applications have been demonstrated during the last few decades bu et al 2016 duan et al 2017 he et al 2012 khan et al 2013 especially the combination of chlorine and uv duan et al 2018 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 huang et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 recent enhanced activity in uv cl2 process brought much convenience to upgrade dwtps because of the common existence of chlorination and it implies the possibility of coupling uv with other disinfectants such as nh2cl some researchers de laat et al 2010 li and blatchley iii 2008 investigated decomposition fate of inorganic chloramines nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 by uv irradiation it was reported that chlorine atom cl and amino radical nh2 were yielded when inorganic chloramines were exposed to uv and the cumulative concentration of cl formed from uv nh2cl was 2 4 times higher than that from uv cl2 chuang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 consequently uv nh2cl process as an advanced oxidation process aop began to receive attention in the last few years chuang et al 2017 li et al 2018 patton et al 2016 although little research specifically studied uv nh2cl process the related reactions usually occur in other commonly researched processes examples include the following 1 the presence of ammonia affects performance of chlorination because chlorine species are dependent on the ratio of cl n which is known as breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1992 wang et al 2017 the concentration of residual chlorine equals that of chloramines when cl n ranges from 0 to 1 thereby uv cl2 process would become the combination of uv cl2 nh2cl process when ammonia exists in the contaminated water zhang et al 2015 2018 2 some uv h2o2 processes are also in fact the combination of uv nh2cl h2o2 process when membrane filtration is set in advance because nh2cl is a commonly used reagent to control the membrane biological fouling and it can pass through the membranes to reach the uv h2o2 reactor da silva et al 2006 xu et al 2010 up to date much attention has been paid to uv cl2 and uv h2o2 processes but it is equally important for us to deepen the understanding for the uv nh2cl process however little study has been dedicated so far to the degradation mechanism of contaminants the subsequent formation of dbps in the uv nh2cl process and its performance in actual waters nh2cl exposed to uv was proposed to produce cl and nh2 with a quantum yield of 0 50 mol es 1 as shown in table 1 reaction 1 soltermann et al 2014 then cl could be transformed to hydroxyl radical ho dichloride radical anion cl2 and chloramine radical nhcl via its reaction with hydroxide chloride and nh2cl respectively reactions 2 5 besides nh2cl would be converted to dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 when the solution ph changes which can also be decomposed to reactive species by uv irradiation with quantum yields of 1 06 and 2 11 mol es 1 soltermann et al 2014 hence degradation of organic contaminants in the uv nh2cl process is rather complex in this study carbamazepine cbz was selected as the target pollutant because it is a commonly detected organic contaminant usually with detected concentrations of ng l 1 μg l 1 deng et al 2013 as documented the average annual consumption of cbz all over the world is 1014 tons zhang et al 2008 and large portion of the consumed cbz is discharged to the natural water bodies cbz in natural waters is persistent and biorefractory and pose an ecological risk potential to the environment furthermore because of the poor removal efficiency of cbz by conventional water treatment processes several aops were studied to efficiently remove cbz including uv h2o2 vogna et al 2004 uv cl2 zhou et al 2016 etc however the use of uv nh2cl as an aop to degrade cbz has not been reported overall the objectives of the present work were to 1 evaluate the effect of typical parameters including nh2cl dosage ph alkalinity and nom on degradation of cbz in the uv nh2cl process 2 differentiate individual contributions of each reactive species in the uv nh2cl process 3 identify and track transformation products of cbz and propose a degradation pathway and 4 investigate the efficiency of the uv nh2cl process in influent sand filtered and granular activated carbon gac filtered water from dwtps and compare the formation of carbonaceous c and nitrogenous n dbps in deionized water and aforementioned three actual waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all purchased chemicals are listed in si text s1 nh2cl solution was freshly prepared every single day following the method reported by xia et al 2017 naocl solution was added dropwise into the nh4cl solution under stirring with a chlorine to nitrogen molar ratio of 0 8 at ph 8 5 for 0 5 h the influent sand filtered and gac filtered water were sampled from a dwtp in hunan province china 2 2 experimental procedures the uv irradiation experiments were conducted in a submerged photochemical reactor with a low pressure mercury lamp philips emission at 253 7 nm 1 85 mw cm 2 the experiments were performed with 5 μm cbz and 70 μm nh2cl based on cl2 solution ph 6 0 8 0 was controlled by 2 mm phosphate buffer different dosages of hco3 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mm and nom 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg c l 1 were added to the reactor when the effect of hco3 and nom were evaluated at each predetermined time interval 1 ml solution was sampled and quenched immediately with 50 μl solution with 0 5 m na2s2o3 all the experiments were replicated three times statistically significant differences among experiments were tested by analysis of variance anova using spss and the probability p value was set at 0 05 for all analyses 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of cbz in solutions was measured using an hplc 1260 agilent usa transformation products of cbz were identified using a positive esi hplc 1290 triple quadrupole ms 6460 agilent detailed conditions are described in si text s2 the concentrations of total chlorine free chlorine and monochloramine were determined by a multifunctional water quality parameter analyzer dr3900 hach usa revised from the traditional dpd method chlorinated dbps were monitored as the method documented in our previous research zhou et al 2016 acute and chronic toxicity of cbz and its transformation products was theoretically estimated by ecosar si text s3 the cytotoxicity of generated dbps was assessed using the method reported by liu et al 2018 which is based on lc50 value chinese hamster ovary cells of each dbp and the assumption that toxicity of dbps is additive the values of lc50 of detected dbps are listed in si table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of cbz by the uv nh2cl process the degradation of cbz by chloramination uv photolysis and uv nh2cl process were investigated and compared different from chlorination chloramination is rarely used to remove organic contaminants because of its low reactivity with organics similar to the results reported by other researchers wang et al 2017 negligible amount of cbz was degraded by chloramination less than 5 si fig s1 meanwhile though cbz has a molar extinction coefficient of 6072 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm kim et al 2009 it is still hard to be degraded under direct photolysis by uv at a uv fluence of 445 mj cm 2 roughly 10 si fig s1 because of its structural stability in contrast cbz was eliminated efficiently at 445 mj cm 2 of the uv nh2cl exposure with a removal of 35 75 when the dosage of nh2cl ranged from 20 to 100 μm as shown in fig 1 a following pseudo first order kinetics si fig s2 the corresponding pseudo first order rate constant significantly increased from 0 0011 to 0 0031 cm2 mj 1 anova p 0 05 the observed synergistic degradation of cbz may stem from the efficient generation of ho and rcs and the formation of these species was promoted with the increasing of nh2cl dosage however the rate of increment slowed down when nh2cl dosage increased from 50 to 100 μm which can be attributed to reaction 2 5 and 10 in table 1 excess nh2cl can transform reactive radicals into radicals of low oxidation ability experiments were also performed with solution ph of 6 0 8 0 because nh2cl would be the main species of chloramines under these conditions soulard et al 1981 and all chloramine species including nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 are relatively stable in the dark at these ph values li and blatchley iii 2008 meanwhile these values of ph are also most likely to exist in dwtps where uv and chloramination may be combined together as presented the performance of uv nh2cl process for degradation of cbz had little ph dependence fig 1 b and the rate constant decreased slightly from 0 0025 to 0 0022 cm2 mj 1 when solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 si fig s3 notably all the p values between different ph calculated via anova were above 0 05 indicating that the effect of ph on degradation of cbz was insignificant under the investigated range the little ph dependence for degradation of cbz was likely attributed to the fact that photolytic degradation of nh2cl does not depend on ph li and blatchley iii 2008 furthermore bicarbonate hco3 is the major inorganic carbon species 83 3 under neutral conditions which reacts with the radicals generated in the uv nh2cl process with high second order rate constants to produce carbonate radical co3 reactions 11 14 in table 1 as reported the concentration of hco3 ranges from dozens to hundreds mg l 1 in natural water bodies xie et al 2015 so the role of hco3 at concentrations varying from 0 to 8 0 mm 0 488 mg l 1 was investigated in this work when the concentration of hco3 was fixed at 4 0 and 8 0 mm solution ph cannot be buffered with 2 0 mm phosphate buffer which increased to around 8 0 8 5 the according ph had no influence on degradation of cbz in uv nh2cl process as discussed in last paragraph as presented in fig 1 c the presence of hco3 appreciably suppressed degradation of cbz and the corresponding rate constant decreased from 0 0026 to 0 0005 cm2 mj 1 when concentration of hco3 increased from 0 to 8 0 mm anova p 0 05 si fig s4 the observed inhibitory effect was probably caused by the selectivity and relatively low oxidation ability of co3 for cbz of note nom remaining in sand filtered water in dwtps brings many problems to subsequent disinfection and aops because it is a major precursor of dbps and can compete for oxidants therefore nom of different dosages 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg c l 1 were added to the system to assess its impact on efficiency of the uv nhcl2 process uv fluence would be different with the presence of nom considering its uv absorption so the degradation kinetic of cbz was expressed as a function of time as shown in fig 1 d only 45 8 cbz was removed by the uv nhcl2 process at reaction time of 4 min with the presence of 8 mg c l 1 nom meanwhile the degradation rate constant of cbz gradually decreased from 0 2934 to 0 1526 min 1 when the concentration of nom increased from 0 to 8 0 mg c l 1 anova p 0 05 si fig s5 this phenomenon resulted from the competitive role of nom reactions 15 and 16 in table 1 and its uv absorption effect which lead to the decrease in steady state concentrations of ho nh2 and rcs temperature is also a common factor influencing treatment efficiency in dwtp experiments with temperatures at 15 25 35 and 45 c were performed to determine its effect on degradation of cbz in uv nhcl2 process and the results were presented in fig 1 e as expected heating significantly accelerated the degradation of cbz according to arrhenius equation with the rate constant increasing from 0 0020 to 0 0040 cm2 mj 1 anova p 0 05 si fig s6 3 2 contributions of hydroxyl radical and reactive chlorine species to determine the individual contributions of uv rcs and ho to the degradation of cbz by the uv nh2cl process the kinetic expression of cbz degradation is given as follows 1 d cbz dt k uv cbz cbz k nh 2 cl cbz nh 2 cl cbz k ho cbz ho cbz k nh 2 cbz nh 2 cbz k cl cbz cl cbz k cl 2 cbz cl 2 cbz k cloh cbz cloh cbz k nhcl cbz nhcl cbz where k uv cbz is the degradation rate constant of cbz by uv irradiation and other kspecies cbz represent second order rate constants of oxidants with cbz as most rate constants of cbz with rcs are not available a total contribution to the degradation of cbz made by rcs is proposed according to the method of wu et al 2016 eq 1 can be rearranged into 2 d cbz dt k uv cbz cbz k nh 2 cl cbz nh 2 cl cbz k ho cbz ho cbz k nh 2 cbz nh 2 cbz k rcs cbz cbz where k rcs cbz is the degradation rate constant pseudo first order of cbz by rcs degradation of cbz by chloramination can be ignored according to the results shown in si fig s1 besides since nh2 is a much weaker oxidant with a standard redox potential of 0 6 v than ho and rcs neta et al 1988 cbz degraded by nh2 can also be neglected therefore eq 2 can be integrated by time as 3 0 t d cbz 0 t k uv cbz cbz dt 0 t k ho cbz ho cbz dt 0 t k rcs cbz cbz dt as shown the contribution of rcs could be calculated through total degradation rate minus those degraded by uv shown in si fig s7 and ho eq 3 0 t k ho cbz ho cbz dt can be turned into 4 0 t k ho cbz ho cbz dt k ho cbz cbz 0 t 1 0 t 1 ho dt cbz t n 1 t n t n 1 t n ho dt cbz t n t t n t ho dt where cbz t n 1 t n is the average concentration of cbz during the period from tn 1 to tn and the value of k ho cbz was reported to be 2 05 109 m 1 s 1 vogna et al 2004 the concentration of ho cannot be directly determined so an indirect method reported by other researchers was used to measure the profile of ho wu et al 2016 where nitrobenzene nb was used as the probe because of its low reactivity with all kinds of radicals except ho k ho nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 the details of the method are described in si si text s4 according to the aforementioned equations and si text s4 the contributions to the degradation of cbz made by ho and rcs were calculated as shown in si table s2 then degradation of cbz which was mainly due to uv rcs and ho at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 was illustrated in fig 2 as a function of uv fluence as shown though the total removals of cbz were nearly identical the respective contribution of ho and rcs differed from each other under these three ph values specifically at uv fluence of 445 mj cm 2 the contributions of uv ho and rcs to degradation of cbz were 7 1 32 3 and 60 6 at ph 6 0 10 0 23 4 and 66 6 at ph 7 0 9 4 38 7 and 51 9 at ph 8 0 note that degradation rate of cbz by rcs at ph 8 0 was lower than those at other two ph values the phenomenon is consistent with the results predicted from a model in another publication chuang et al 2017 it was calculated by a mathematical model that the steady state concentration of rcs at ph 8 1 was less than those at ph 5 5 and 7 0 on the other hand degradation of cbz by ho showed the lowest efficiency at ph 7 0 which can be explained by the fact that the oxidation potential of ho is 1 8 v in neutral solution which is lower than its standard potential 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 overall no matter how their contributions changed rcs were always the dominant contributors to the degradation of cbz in the uv nh2cl process compared with ho 3 3 identification of transformation products of cbz in the uv nh2cl process the molecular weight and structures for transformation products of cbz in the uv nh2cl process were proposed according to the obtained accurate mass to charge ratio m z and spectra because of the unavailability of their standards a total of eleven byproducts of cbz in the uv nh2cl process were identified and some of them were isomers which could be distinguished by their different retention times si fig s8 and table s3 based on the identification and evolution profiles of the proposed byproducts a preliminary degradation pathway of cbz in the present system was proposed and exhibited in fig 3 because of the simultaneous involvement of uv ho and rcs different reactions including hydroxylation chlorine or amine substitution electron transfer etc can take place in this system as shown aromatic ring and heterocyclic ring of cbz molecule are two reactive sites in the uv nh2cl process for the benzene ring substitution reaction occurred under the attack of rcs as illustrated in si scheme s1 duan et al 2018 an aromatic radical was generated as an intermediate after attacking by rcs then peroxyl radical was produced with the presence of dissolved oxygen in solution after that the yield of cl substituted p4 were observed a nitro substituted compound p5 also appeared probably because of the presence of nh2 of note the most susceptible site of cbz molecule is the double bond located at heterocyclic ring marked in red in fig 3 which can be easily attacked by reactive species to yield p1 kosjek et al 2009 afterward p1 can be transformed into a heterocyclic radical and subsequent electron transfer lead to the generation of p2 scheme 1 in fig 3 furthermore under the continuous attack of ho and the break of heterocyclic ring another peroxyl radical can be generated and p3 can be formed scheme 1 li et al 2011 on the other hand the double bond marked in red can undergo a classic hydroxylation to yield p6 as proposed in si scheme s2 he et al 2014 and following substitution reaction can occur to generate p11 then under the attack of ho hydroxylation can take place on heterocyclic ring of p2 and p3 to produce p8 and p9 respectively with the loss of conh2 kosjek et al 2009 li et al 2011 both p8 and p9 can form p10 from different ways as presented in fig 3 further oxidation including ring open reactions on aforementioned byproducts may occur to generate compounds with smaller molecular weight not detected moreover though the peak areas cannot be directly expressed as the corresponding concentrations general trends of evolution profiles of transformation products versus uv fluence can be presented fig 4 among aforementioned byproducts compound with m z of 252 0899 p1 has the highest abundance in addition cl and no2 substituted compounds with m z of 286 0509 p11 270 1004 p4 and 281 08 p5 initially increased with uv fluence and then decreased in residuals besides the abundance of primary byproducts see fig 3 with m z of 252 0899 p6 and 270 065 p2 reached peak value early on and decreased with uv fluence afterward other byproducts kept increasing over investigated uv fluence as the incomplete mineralization of cbz the byproducts generated during uv nh2cl may have an adverse effect on human health therefore the acute and chronic toxicity of cbz and its transformation products was calculated si table s4 except p4 p8 and p10 si fig s9 all other transformation products presented lower acute and chronic toxicity than cbz nonetheless p10 was the last byproduct detected in the degradation pathway leaving a potential risk toxicological interactions of cbz and its transformation products are also unknown so further research and ameliorations are needed for uv nh2cl process to reduce the toxicity of contaminants 3 4 formation of dbps during chloramination and uv chloramine of cbz cbz and its transformation products are potential precursors for chlorinated dbps thereby commonly detected dbps were determined after treatment by chloramination and uv nh2cl process respectively as cbz was the only carbon source in this system dbp yield can be used to show the formation of dbps which is the ratio of total concentration of generated dbps μm to degraded concentration of cbz μm as shown in fig 5 formation of tcm trichloroacetonitrile tcan trichloronitromethane tcnm was observed in both processes in specific tcm tcan and tcnm yields of cbz were 0 36 2 08 and 1 29 during chloramination 1 33 2 04 and 0 77 during uv nh2cl process respectively the participation of uv led to a slight decrease in generation of tcan and tcnm but increase in tcm formation the decreased formation of tcan and tcnm in uv nh2cl process was possibly resulted from the reduced level of organic nitrogen and photolysis of nh2cl while the increased formation of tcm in presence of uv indicated that transformation products of cbz are more readily to provide carbon source than cbz to generate tcm the results also demonstrated that degradation of targeted contaminant did not necessarily mean decreased formation of dbps besides theoretical cytotoxicity of generated dbps during the aforementioned two processes was also evaluated the lc50 listed in si table s1 implied that tcan and tcnm made the major contribution to total cytotoxicity as shown the theoretical cytotoxicity of dbps decreased slightly when uv was involved in the reactions which was mainly caused by the reduced formation of n dbps 3 5 degradation of cbz and subsequent formation of dbp in actual waters as discussed in section 3 1 efficiency of the uv nh2cl process can be appreciably influenced by the presence of hco3 and nom therefore to evaluate the potential of uv nh2cl process in practical application influent sand filtered and gac filtered waters from dwtp were applied as background to test the degradation of cbz basic parameters of these waters were presented in si table s5 similar to solutions with nom uv absorption of water matrices in actual waters also influences uv fluence so degradation of cbz in actual waters was expressed as a function of time si fig s10 and fig 6 a as shown in fig 6 a the degradation rate constants in influent sand filtered gac filtered and di waters were 0 0622 0 0753 0 1830 and 0 3386 min 1 respectively degradation of cbz in influent water was inhibited significantly due to the presence of nom and other water components after traditional treatment in dwtp degradation efficiency was enhanced slightly in sand filtered water further confirming the limit of traditional processes for removing contaminants of emerging concern best performance among actual water samples was observed in gac filtered water indicating that gac filter can be an ideal process between traditional process and aops to remove extra water matrices the results were consistent with duan et al 2018 who did similar investigation using uv chlorine process of note even in influent water the degradation efficiency of uv nh2cl process was much better than that of chloramination in di water si fig s10 moreover enhanced formation of aforementioned three dbps was observed during both chloramination and uv nh2cl process in actual waters because of complex water matrices fig 6 b as depicted presence of uv changed concentration of individual dbp to different degree but substantially has no influence on the total level of generated dbps 3 6 engineering implications for uv chloramine process the discussion above indicates that combination of uv and nh2cl is a promising technology for degradation of emerging organic pollutants and control of dbps in dwtps therefore the ee o value for degradation of cbz by uv nh2cl process was calculated to obtain some preliminary cost information detailed method and procedure were summarized from some previous research studies wu et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 see si text s5 as illustrated in si fig s11 the required electrical energy of uv source ee ouv decreased with the increasing of nh2cl dosage in general when the dosage of nh2cl was below 70 μm ee ouv made a dominant contribution to the total ee o then ee ouv and ee onh2cl became similar contributors to ee ototal when the dosage of nh2cl kept increasing from 70 to 100 μm therefore the total ee o decreased first and increased with the rise of nh2cl dosage afterward and an optimal dosage of nh2cl was observed around 70 μm furthermore the corresponding value of ee o was 11 times lower than that consumed by uv photolysis process however the economic evaluation in this section can only provide some theoretical basis instead of complete economic cost of the process further detailed calculation would be performed in some scale up fields in the future studies moreover as presented in si fig s12 compared with most widely implemented oxidants h2o2 and s2o8 2 in uv homogeneous system the combination of nh2cl and uv has no obvious inferiority for dwtps the residual h2o2 or s2o8 2 still need to be quenched while residual nh2cl can be directly used as a secondary disinfectant in distribution system therefore for dwtps applying nh2cl for disinfection the most convenient way to improve the quality of effluent water is to install uv lamps in disinfection stage without adding other chemicals 4 conclusion this study reveals that the synergistic effect between uv and monochloramine can degrade contaminants of emerging concern such as cbz and control formation of dbps efficiently and the following conclusions can be obtained a participation of uv can significantly improve the oxidation ability of nh2cl because of the generation of ho nh2 and rcs the degradation of contaminant is accelarated with the increasing of nh2cl dose while the presence of bicarbonate and nom inhibits its degradation b the overall degradation rate by the uv nh2cl process has no ph dependency but the specific contribution to degradation of cbz by ho and rcs varies depending on ph the relatively low efficiency was observed at ph 8 0 and 7 0 for rcs and ho respectively rcs is always the predominant contributor to the degradation of cbz under all three investigated ph values c eleven transformation products of cbz resulted from electron transfer hydrogen atom abstraction hydroxylation and heterocyclic ring oxidation are identified most of them have lower theoretical toxicity than cbz dbps including tcm tcan and tcnm were detected during chloramination and uv chloramine of cbz addition of uv increases the formation potential of tcm but decreases that of tcan and tcnm d despite that degradation of cbz is inhibited and formation of dbps is enhanced in actual field waters relatively satisfactory degradation of the uv nh2cl process can be achieved in gac filtered water acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the national natural science

reactive species during photolysis of free available chlorine fac at uvb uva wavelengths of solar light 290 400 nm however corresponding effects on regulated disinfection byproduct dbp formation and associated dissolved organic matter dom properties remain unclear in this work when compared to dark chlorination sunlight driven fac photolysis over a range of conditions was found to yield higher dbp levels depletion of dom chromophores and fluorophores preferential removal of phenolic groups versus carboxylic acid groups and degradation of larger humic substances to smaller molecular weight compounds control experiments showed that increased dbp levels were not due to direct dom photolysis and subsequent dark reactions with fac but to co exposure of dom to fac and reactive species e g o3 ho cl cl2 clo generated by fac photolysis because solar chlorine photolysis can enable inactivation of chlorine resistant pathogens at far lower ct fac values than chlorination alone the increases in dbp formation inherent to this approach can likely be offset to some extent by the ability to operate at significantly decreased ct fac nonetheless these findings demonstrate that applications of solar chlorine photolysis will require careful attention to potential impacts on dbp formation graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorine solar irradiation ozone hydroxyl radical disinfection byproducts dissolved organic matter 1 introduction free available chlorine fac is the most commonly applied chemical disinfectant worldwide who 2017 however some important waterborne microorganisms are chlorine resistant and persist after disinfection with fac for instance highly chlorine resistant oocysts of the protozoan parasites cryptosporidium hominis and cryptosporidium parvum are a frequent cause of waterborne illness in the united states and worldwide medema et al 2009 painter et al 2015 ultraviolet uv irradiation and ozonation are both recognized alternative disinfection strategies that can be applied to achieve inactivation of protozoan oo cysts and other chlorine resistant microorganisms nevertheless monetary and energy expenses may prevent their use in small scale

practical application fac and the various oxidants generated during fac photolysis also react with inorganic and organic water constituents such as bromide and dissolved organic matter dom that can serve as disinfection byproduct dbp precursors an abundance of investigations have evaluated dbp formation in dom containing waters during uvc driven 200 280 nm fac photolysis in which hocl and ocl undergo primarily homolytic cleavage to form ho and cl eq 1a b however conflicting results have been reported regarding whether fac uvc treatment leads to increased dbp formation e g due to precursor formation via hydroxylation and aromatic ring opening by hydroxyl radical or other radical species pisarenko et al 2013 wang et al 2015 xiang et al 2016 or decreased dbp formation due to precursor

potential impacts of sunlight driven fac photolysis on dbp formation nowell and hoigne 1992b oliver and carey 1977 pisarenko et al 2013 simard et al 2013 in comparison to uvc driven fac photolysis solar fac photolysis λ 290 nm proceeds to a much greater extent through ocl heterolysis particularly at ph above the pk a of hocl eq 3 yielding ground state atomic oxygen eq 2 in addition to o3 under oxic conditions eq 4 buxton and subhani 1972 previous work investigating sequential exposure of dom to o3 and chlorine has shown that high o3 doses can decrease dbp formation by degrading dbp precursors whereas low o3 doses can actually result in increased dbp formation especially under conditions favoring ho formation de vera et al 2015 mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 the impacts of simultaneous dom exposure to fac o3 and ho or other radicals during solar fac photolysis are less clear and to the authors knowledge a comprehensive evaluation of this reaction chemistry has yet to be undertaken several groups have noted decreases in total organic halogens tox within reclaimed water lv et al 2017 and degradation of naphthenic acids within oil sand process water shu et al 2014 after sunlight driven fac photolysis others have reported increasing formation of organochlorine trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acid haas coupled with significant degradation of chromophores and fluorophores during treatment of organic precursors with fac and artificial uva light sources λpeak 350 365 nm when compared to dark chlorination oliver and carey 1977 pisarenko et al 2013 however there is limited data available on formation of specific classes of dbpsassociated modifications to dom and dbp precursors during broadband simulated or natural solar irradiation of chlorinated water furthermore available data on dbp formation during uv or sunlight driven fac photolysis have generally been reported only for conditions in which water samples were subjected to either i varying initial fac concentrations for fixed irradiation times or ii fixed initial fac concentrations for variable irradiation times without accounting for variations in fac concentration and consequent effects on cumulative fac exposure ct fac 0 t fac d t during irradiated and dark treatment this is an important limitation as dbp formation is dependent on both fac concentration and reaction time and is expected to be strongly influenced by variations in fac concentrations during irradiation without the availability of measurements of ct fac which normalizes for variations in fac concentration and reaction time from the prior studies it remains unclear how ct fac specific dbp formation potentials are affected by sunlight driven fac photolysis in turn hindering direct comparison of dbp formation under dark and light conditions the principal objectives of this work were to a quantify formation of regulated organic dbps thms and haas during sunlight driven fac photolysis and b correlate dbp formation with characteristic changes to dom during dark chlorination solar irradiation and sunlight driven fac photolysis dbp formation was investigated under a variety of conditions e g varying ph temperature bromide concentration or o2 concentration w and w o added oxidant scavengers the effects of variations in fac exposure were normalized to ct fac to enable comparison of ct fac specific dbp formation under the range of conditions investigated corresponding changes in dom character were investigated by monitoring changes in doc fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems uv absorbance uv254 specifically differential absorbance spectra and size exclusion chromatographs of the dom present in treated solutions an overarching objective of this work was to utilize these analyses to provide an improved understanding of how dom modifications resulting from solar irradiation in the presence of fac influence dbp yields and how this knowledge may be applied to mitigate such impacts

trichloroacetic acids and mono and dibromoacetic acids and tthm chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform formed during exposure of phosphate buffered solutions containing 2 mg l of srnom and 8 mg l as cl2 of fac to varying irradiation times 0 15 30 and 45 min of simulated sunlight equal to 0 6 2 12 4 and 18 6 j cm2 fluence coupled with post irradiation dark fac exposure up to a cumulative ct fac of 400 mg l min as shown in fig 1 there is a clear increase in dbp formation during fac light fac only treatment when compared to fac only treatment for all conditions elevated temperature resulted in further increases in dbp formation at each condition fig 1 which appears to be due primarily to increased rates of dark dom chlorination text s8 direct dom photolysis did not appear to be an important contributor to dbp formation even at the highest fluence investigated 18 6 j cm2 haa5 and tthm yields after light only fac only treatment were similar to those measured following fac only treatment table s3 similar trends were also observed when using natural sunlight to photolyze fac fig s3 as discussed in more detail below the increases in thm and haa formation during solar fac photolysis may result from dom modifications predisposing certain dbp precursor constituents to increased halogenation during co exposure to fac o3 and various reactive oxygen or halogen species ros or rhs generated by fac photolysis while prior work has shown that pre ozonation of dom at 0 4 1 mg o3 mg c and circumneutral ph can decrease thm formation during chlorination gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2013 pre oxidative treatment at lower o3 exposures and or elevated ho exposures e g during o3 treatment at high ph or aops such as uv h2o2 similar to the conditions of solar fac photolysis has actually been shown to increase thm formation during chlorination de vera et al 2015 dotson et al 2010 mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 this is thought to be due to degradation of higher molecular weight humic like substances to smaller chlorine reactive alcohol or ketone containing aromatic or aliphatic groups de vera et al 2015 dotson et al 2010 mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 in additional experiments bromide was added to reaction solutions at concentrations of 40 or 200 μg l in order to evaluate formation of brominated dbps under conditions representative of relatively pristine or human influenced surface waters respectively flury and papritz 1993 soltermann et al 2016 addition of bromide led to suppression of haa5 and tthm yields during both fac only and fac light fac only treatments fig 1 in contrast haa9 which includes additional mixed cl and br containing haas not captured by haa5 remained relatively constant at elevated bromide levels during fac only treatment fig s6a consistent with prior observations chellam and krasner 2001 cowman and singer 1996 and increased at elevated bromide levels during fac light fac only treatment fig s6a in addition bromine substitution factor bsf a measure of the fraction of total dbp halogen content attributable to bromine text s9 increased for tthm and haa9 during fac only and fac light fac only treatments at elevated bromide levels with a relatively larger increase in bsf observed during fac light fac only treatment fig s6 this suggests increased bromination during fac light fac only treatment compared to fac only treatment potentially due to modifications to dom during fac photolysis leading to greater susceptibility of dbp precursors to bromination or direct bromination of dbp precursors by photochemically generated reactive bromine species such as br or brcl ph effects on fac speciation or photolysis pathway eqs 1 3 did not seem to have a clear influence on haa formation as variation of ph did not have a strong effect on haa5 fig 1a and b or haa9 fig s6a yields during either fac only or fac light fac only treatment prior investigations have also reported variability in the ph dependence of overall haa formation during dark chlorination and fac photolysis processes though trihaloacetic acid formation generally appears to correlate inversely with ph during dark chlorination korshin et al 2002 liang and singer 2003 remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2015 in contrast tthm yields in the present work increased with increasing ph for both fac only and fac light fac only treatment fig 1c and d consistent with prior observations gallard and von gunten 2002 pisarenko et al 2013 rook 1977 in addition to an increased importance of oh in the haloform reaction at higher ph increased tthm yields during fac light fac only treatment may be in part related to solar fac photolysis kinetics as the rate of fac photolysis increases with ph at wavelengths above 260 nm due to increased uv absorbance by fac with the shift in speciation from hocl to ocl eqs 1 3 fig s2a nowell and hoigne 1992a b 3 1 2 effects of dissolved o2 removal and radical scavenger addition in order to evaluate the relative importance of o3 and radical species in driving dbp formation during fac light fac only treatment concentrations of o2 were varied from 0 to 1 6 mmol l and the radical scavengers t buoh or carbonate as nahco3 were added separately at concentrations of 50 mm to selected reaction solutions fig 2 initially anoxic conditions are expected to limit formation of o3 by preventing the reaction of photochemically generated o 3p with o2 whereas saturation with o2 is anticipated to increase o3 formation relative to ambient conditions as per eq 4 addition of 50 mm concentrations of t buoh or carbonate is anticipated to lead to 97 or 41 scavenging of ho 95 or 88 scavenging of cl and 53 or 4 scavenging of o 3p under the experimental conditions investigated here text s10 and table s4 the absence of o2 did not appear to lead to significant differences in haa5 yields whereas o2 saturation led to moderate decreases in haa5 yields indicating that o3 may contribute to destruction of haa precursors during fac photolysis fig 2a fig 2b shows that the absence of o2 resulted in a small increase in tthm yields during fac light fac only treatment possibly due to decreased destruction of thm precursors e g dihydroxybenzenes by o3 gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2013 o2 saturation had no clear effect on thm yields during fac light fac only treatment addition of t buoh and carbonate each appeared to result in modest decreases in haa5 yields fig 2a during fac light fac only treatment due in large part to decreases in di and trichloroacetic acid formation fig 2a and fig s6a this indicates that radical reactions with dom may contribute to haa precursor formation carbonate and t buoh addition did not have a clear effect on tthm yields during fac light fac only treatment fig 2b overall variations in dissolved o2 concentrations and addition of radical scavengers resulted in at most modest changes to organic dbp formation making it difficult to distinguish direct effects of o3 and radical species e g ho cl cl2 clo o 3p on dbp precursors 3 1 3 importance of photochemical versus dark reactions in driving dbp formation fig 3 compares dbp formation versus ct fac during fac only treatment and fac light treatment labeled 15 30 and 45 min without and with post irradiation dark fac treatment compared to fac only treatment fac light treatment resulted in substantially greater yields of tthm and haa5 at a given ct fac value confirming that yields of dbps are elevated during sunlight driven fac photolysis fig 3 also highlights the change in dbp formation resulting from continued fac only treatment after sunlight driven fac photolysis by comparing the results for fac light treatment open symbols with those for fac light fac only treatment half filled symbols with the same irradiation times used in each case it appears that the ct fac normalized rate of haa5 formation during dark chlorination fig 3 solid lines increases modestly after fac light treatment regression slopes increase by factors of 2 and 3 for ph 8 and 6 respectively whereas the rate of tthm formation during dark chlorination fig 3 dashed lines is similar after fac light and fac only pretreatment when normalized by ct fac taken together these data indicate that most if not all of the relative increases in dbp yields observed during fac light fac only experiments are due to dbp formation during fac photolysis rather than to post irradiation reactions in the dark this in turn suggests that increases in dbp formation during sunlight driven fac photolysis are driven primarily by halogenation reactions during irradiation consistent with oliver and carey 1977 though it is unclear if this is due to i direct halogenation of dom by rhs e g cl br brcl cl2 clo ii oxidative modifications to dom resulting in generation of precursor moieties with higher susceptibility toward halogenation by fac or rhs or iii a combination of both 3 1 4 dbp formation during treatment of natural waters fig 4 shows haa5 and tthm yields in two natural freshwaters lake washington and a local reservoir with and without addition of 200 μg l of bromide subjected to i fac only ii light only fac only and iii fac light fac only treatment fac only and light only fac only treatment at fluences up to 18 6 j cm2 resulted in similar dbp yields indicating that direct photolysis of the dom does not impact dbp formation during chlorination haa5 concentrations associated with lake washington remained well below the epa mcl of 60 μg l and were not detected within the local reservoir water tthm formation was compliant with the epa mcl of 80 μg l at natural bromide concentrations for each water though at higher bromide concentrations formation of bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane increased during solar fac photolysis and tthm levels exceeded the mcl these results indicate that sunlight driven fac photolysis can likely be applied for disinfection of natural waters with relatively low dom and bromide concentrations though further work is needed to evaluate its applicability over a wider range of water qualities 3 2 analyses of changes to dissolved organic matter 3 2 1 uv visible absorbance and fluorescence the results summarized in fig 5 a fig s7a and table s5 show that srnom after fac light treatment has substantially lower 254 nm uv absorbance than after fac only treatment addition of t buoh results in preservation of chromophores during solar fac photolysis 31 and 51 losses in 254 nm absorbance with and without t buoh respectively after 45 min of fac light anoxic conditions also result in preservation of chromophores during solar fac photolysis treatment but to a lesser extent than t buoh addition 40 loss after 45 min of fac light indicating that radical species and o3 contribute to decreases in absorbance and destruction of associated aromatic compounds untreated srnom has characteristic fluorescence features including two peaks located near 250 nmex 450 nmem and 330 nmex 450 nmem that are typically associated with terrestrial humic constituents hua et al 2010 ishii and boyer 2012 dom with high fluorescence intensity in these regions has been positively correlated to thm formation during chlorination hua et al 2010 li et al 2016 fig s8 depicts the change to fluorescence eems after fac only light only light only fac only fac light and fac light fac only treatment fac light and fac light fac only treatments resulted in significantly greater losses in the fluorescence signals associated with humic constituents when compared to fac only light only or light only fac only treatments figs 5a and s7a previous research has also demonstrated greater fluorophore destruction during fac uva treatment when compared to fac uvc aop treatment pisarenko et al 2013 and fac only treatment shu et al 2014 introducing t buoh as a radical scavenger during solar chlorine photolysis significantly inhibited degradation of humic like fluorophores to an extent greater than observed by limiting o3 formation under anoxic conditions figs 5a and s7a and table s5 these trends indicate that photochemically generated ho cl or other ros rhs and to a lesser degree o3 all play important roles in the degradation of fluorophores during fac light treatment 3 2 2 uv visible differential absorbance spectra das the ph titration das analysis method provides an in situ approach to quantifying behavior of ionizable chromophores which reflects contributions of carboxylic and phenolic functional groups in dom dryer et al 2008 gao and korshin 2013 a monotonic increase in uv absorbance 240 450 nm of dom is typically observed with increasing ph which is primarily associated with deprotonation of aromatic dom chromophores korshin et al 1997 from the das results of raw srnom fig 6 a there are two prominent feature bands a narrow band centered at 280 nm da280 associated with carboxylic acid groups and a broad band centered at 340 nm da340 associated with phenolic groups dryer et al 2008 gao and korshin 2013 fac only treatment of srnom containing solutions at ph 8 and 6 resulted in moderate decreases in sample absorbance figs 6b s9a b indicating that fac reacted directly with chromophores within the dom the da340 da280 ratio for samples subjected to fac only treatment at ph 8 and 6 did not change during titration from ph 6 to 10 indicating suppression of the phenol deprotonation feature compared to the untreated sample fig s9a b light only treatment had no significant impact on das spectra fig s9a b exposing srnom containing solutions to fac light treatment using natural fac lightns or simulated sunlight fac lightss at ph 6 and 8 resulted in substantially greater bleaching of uv absorbance compared to fac only treatment and particularly enhanced removal at 340 nm indicating preferential modification of phenolic groups figs 6c s9a b fac light treatment at ph 8 resulted in a lower average da340 da280 ratio than at ph 6 likely due to increased deprotonation of phenolic groups to more reactive phenolate forms and higher fac photolysis rates at ph 8 fig s9a b the addition of bromide was found to have no significant effect on changes to the da340 da280 ratio before or after treatment fig s9b c changes in das spectra observed during fac light treatment at ph 8 were similar to those observed during treatment of samples with increasing o3 doses o3 doc 0 75 fig 6c f where addition of t buoh had little effect on das changes during direct o3 treatment fig s9e this is consistent with the proposed role of o3 in contributing to direct degradation of phenolic groups in dom during fac light treatment however purging o2 from solution to limit the formation of o3 during fac light treatment at ph 8 did not have a significant effect on da340 da280 ratios in comparison to fac lightss treatment at ambient o2 levels figs 6d and s9d suggesting either that o3 plays a significantly less important role in driving phenol degradation compared to o 3p ho cl and other radical species or that increased degradation of phenols by o 3p which would be elevated in the absence of o2 as per eq 4 compensates for the absence of o3 adding t buoh as a radical scavenger limited decreases in da340 da280 ratios during fac light treatment to a moderate extent figs 6e and s9d indicating some preservation of phenol groups due to suppression of ros rhs and or o3 via scavenging of o 3p zhou et al 2014 3 2 3 size exclusion chromatography with uv fluorescence doc detection sec uv fld doc size exclusion chromatography enables fractionation of dom by size and or molecular weight mw resulting in discrimination of two major peaks in the srnom comprising 1 a larger peak peak 1 here assigned to higher mw humic substances and 2 a second smaller peak peak 2 here generally assigned to lower mw acidic compounds her et al 2003 huber et al 2011 see fig s10 for example chromatograms fig 5b d and s7b d summarize results from chromatographic analyses of treated samples including normalized total chromatogram area peak 1 peak 2 area peak 1 peak 2 area untreated and average dom mw estimates each obtained using uv fluorescence and doc detection see text s7 for analytical details and mw calculations and fig s11 for plots of fractional peak areas fac only treatment generally resulted in a decrease of 20 for uv chromatogram areas and 5 10 for total doc areas while a slight 5 increase in total fluorescence was visible an effect associated with halogenation of dom korshin et al 1999 increasing periods of irradiation during fac light treatment resulted in decreases in overall mw as measured by uv and doc detection as well as 40 60 decreases in total uv chromatogram areas and up to 25 decreases in doc chromatogram areas fig 5b c s7b d by comparison fluorescence peak area decreased 20 80 with minimal changes to overall mw as measured by fluorescence figs 5d and s7d these observations for fac light treatment are likely attributable to degradation of higher mw humic substances comprising peak 1 to lower mw byproducts comprising peak 2 with little corresponding mineralization of doc to co2 coupled with degradation of chromophores associated primarily with higher mw humic substances and degradation of fluorophores associated with both higher and lower mw organics low mw byproducts that contribute to peak 2 in doc chromatograms after treatment appear to have a modest uv signal and very little fluorescence character fig s10 changes observable by doc and uv detection were similar for each treatment at ph 8 and 6 figs 5b c s7b c similar to bulk sample fluorescence and uv absorbance measurements addition of t buoh resulted in preservation of chromophores and fluorophores and appeared to hinder degradation of larger mw compounds to lower mw compounds this implies that ho cl and other rhs species likely play an important role in breaking down aromatic molecules contained within larger dom size fractions though it should be noted that t buoh also scavenges o 3p to a limited extent zhou et al 2014 so some of the decreases in chromophore and fluorophore destruction may also have been due to blockage of reactions between o 3p or o3 and dom suppressing o3 formation by deoxygenation of reaction solutions prior to fac light treatment also resulted in decreased destruction of chromophores and fluorophores but not to the same extent as t buoh addition this suggests that o3 may target a subset of primarily electron rich aromatic functional groups such as phenols and activated aromatic rings whereas ho cl and other radical species may less selectively attack a larger pool of aromatic components within the dom 3 3 linkages between observed dom modifications and increased dbp formation during sunlight driven fac photolysis decreases in fluorescence and uv absorbance of srnom exhibited clear correlations with tthm and haa9 yields during fac light treatment fig s12 whereas correlations for haa5 yields were weaker likely due to the smaller group of haas encompassed by haa5 relative to haa9 there were no clear trends between dbp formation and fluorescence or absorbance changes during fac only treatment providing additional evidence that modifications of dom by ros rhs and or o3 produced during fac photolysis are associated with the observed increases thm and haa yields the findings discussed to this point suggest that o3 generated during solar fac photolysis contributes to preferential elimination of srnom s humic like fluorescence properties which are likely attributable in part to activated electron rich aromatic rings e g phenolic groups cory and mcknight 2005 sharpless and blough 2014 similarities in da340 da280 losses during fac light treatment and o3 only treatment also indicate a role for o3 in preferential phenolic degradation during fac photolysis previous work has shown that treatment of dom by o3 results in degradation of aromatics within the dom e g ring cleavage of dihydroxybenzenes and phenolic like compounds and to decreased dbp formation during subsequent chlorination highlighting the role of phenolic moieties in dom as dbp precursors gallard and von gunten 2002 li et al 2016 however it is possible that under the conditions of fac light treatment o3 levels are low enough relative to dom concentrations that activated aromatic dbp precursors are generated by oxygenation and or hydroxylation reactions to a greater extent than they are destroyed mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 in this work haa and thm formation during fac light fac only treatment seemed to correlate negatively with conditions favoring higher in situ o3 levels supporting the hypothesis that increasing o3 exposure contributes to the net degradation of organic dbp precursors experiments undertaken here with added radical scavengers indicate that ros and rhs contribute to both chromophore and fluorophore destruction and non selective attack and degradation of high molecular weight humic like substances to form lower molecular weight organic acids ho has been found to react rapidly via hydroxylation of olefins and aromatic compounds and hydrogen abstraction from aliphatic compounds dotson et al 2010 mvula and von sonntag 2003 pan et al 1993 varanasi et al 2018 cl may also react with a variety of aliphatic aromatic and olefinic moieties as well as alcohol groups in dom via addition electron transfer and or h abstraction alegre et al 2000 martire et al 2001 varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 overall ros and or rhs reactions appear to contribute to the generation of additional dbp precursors it is hypothesized that ho in particular activates aromatic groups by hydroxylation and generates lower mw aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids as transformation products after reacting with higher mw fractions of dom varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 haa formation increases moderately during fac only treatment after fac light pretreatment when compared to fac only treatment at equivalent ct fac supporting the hypothesis that molecules generated via ros and rhs reactions with dom act as haa precursors specifically for dcaa and tcaa during the residual dark chlorination period of fac light fac only experiments increased thm and haa formation during fac light treatment may also be due to direct attack of dom by radical species such as ho cl br brcl cl2 or clo initiating radical chain reactions leading to cl addition or c centered radical recombination with cl or other halogen radicals alegre et al 2000 li et al 2016 martire et al 2001 wang et al 2015 one possible explanation for the increases in dbp yields observed during fac light treatment even in the presence of added radical scavengers or under anoxic conditions is that o3 and radical species contribute to varying degrees to both degradation and generation of dbp precursors de vera et al 2015 mao et al 2014 with precursor generation generally outweighing precursor degradation consequently limiting o3 formation does not prevent increases in dbp formation due to radical reactions li et al 2016 and limiting ho and cl levels does not prevent increases in dbp formation due to o 3p and or o3 reactions mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 4 conclusions application of simulated and natural sunlight driven fac photolysis in srnom solutions and natural waters resulted in increased yields of regulated organic dbps thms and haas degradation of dom chromophores and fluorophores and decreases in average dom mw due to degradation of higher mw humic substances to lower mw organic acids with minimal mineralization of doc subjecting dom containing solutions to fac light treatment resulted in substantial changes in the ratios of differential absorbances at 280 and 340 nm corresponding to carboxylic and phenolic dom moieties with preferential removal of the 340 nm band indicating depletion of phenol groups relative to carboxylic groups in the bulk dom taken together these results indicate that fac light treatment results in enhanced degradation of uv absorbing and fluorescent aromatic constituents phenolic moieties in particular of higher mw humic substances by photochemically generated oxidants including o3 ho and possibly cl clo cl2 and o 3p oxidants are expected to participate in aromatic and aliphatic electron transfer addition and h abstraction reactions in addition to aromatic ring cleavage resulting in formation of lower mw organic acid byproducts this process likely results in enhanced formation of dbps through a increased dark halogenation of dbp precursors derived from aromatic ring cleavage and other dom degradation pathways b direct halogenation of dbp precursors by rhs such as cl br brcl cl2 or clo or c a combination of the two the fact that dbp formation during fac only treatment subsequent to fac light treatment was only moderately higher for haas than during fac only treatment suggests that direct halogenation by photochemically generated rhs may contribute substantially to the enhanced dbp yields observed during sunlight driven fac photolysis it is recommended that future investigations expand on these findings by utilizing model compounds representing various types of dom constituent groups to evaluate the relative importance of reaction pathways involving ros rhs and o3 in driving dbp formation during solar fac photolysis and uv driven fac photolysis in general application of sunlight driven fac photolysis for disinfection is anticipated to lead to increased dbp formation and will require careful attention to potential impacts on thm and haa levels however because this process can enable inactivation of chlorine resistant pathogens e g cryptosporidium oocysts at far lower ct fac values than chlorination alone the increases in dbp formation inherent to fac light treatment may be offset by the ability to operate at significantly decreased ct fac in addition risks of increased dbp formation could be mitigated by limiting applications of sunlight driven fac photolysis to short term e g emergency use and or to appropriate source waters e g those with low dom and bromide levels as observed here for treatment of two

solar chlorine photolysis will require careful attention to potential impacts on dbp formation graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorine solar irradiation ozone hydroxyl radical disinfection byproducts dissolved organic matter 1 introduction free available chlorine fac is the most commonly applied chemical disinfectant worldwide who 2017 however some important waterborne microorganisms are chlorine resistant and persist after disinfection with fac for instance highly chlorine resistant oocysts of the protozoan parasites cryptosporidium hominis and cryptosporidium parvum are a frequent cause of waterborne illness in the united states and worldwide medema et al 2009 painter et al 2015 ultraviolet uv irradiation and ozonation are both recognized alternative disinfection strategies that can be applied to achieve inactivation of protozoan oo cysts and other chlorine resistant microorganisms nevertheless monetary and energy expenses may prevent their use in small scale

practical application fac and the various oxidants generated during fac photolysis also react with inorganic and organic water constituents such as bromide and dissolved organic matter dom that can

undergo primarily homolytic cleavage to form ho and cl eq 1a b however conflicting results have been reported regarding whether fac uvc treatment leads to increased dbp formation e g due to precursor formation via hydroxylation and aromatic ring opening by hydroxyl radical or other radical species pisarenko et al 2013 wang et al 2015 xiang et al 2016 or decreased dbp formation due to precursor degradation li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 when compared to chlorination alone liu et al 2012 remucal and manley 2016 yang et al 2016 comparatively little information is available regarding the potential impacts of sunlight driven fac photolysis on dbp formation nowell and hoigne 1992b oliver and carey 1977 pisarenko et al 2013 simard et al 2013 in comparison to uvc driven fac photolysis solar fac photolysis λ 290 nm proceeds to a much greater extent through ocl heterolysis particularly at ph above the pk a of hocl eq 3 yielding ground state atomic oxygen eq 2 in addition to o3 under oxic conditions eq 4 buxton and subhani 1972 previous work investigating sequential exposure of dom to o3 and chlorine has shown that high o3 doses can decrease dbp formation by degrading dbp precursors whereas low o3 doses can actually result in increased dbp formation especially under conditions favoring ho formation de vera et al 2015 mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 the impacts of simultaneous dom exposure to fac o3 and ho or other radicals during solar fac photolysis are less clear and to the authors knowledge a comprehensive evaluation of this reaction chemistry has yet to be undertaken several groups have noted decreases in total organic halogens tox within reclaimed water lv et al 2017 and degradation of naphthenic acids within oil sand process water shu et al 2014 after sunlight driven fac photolysis others have reported increasing formation of organochlorine trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acid haas coupled with significant degradation of chromophores and fluorophores during treatment of organic precursors with fac and artificial uva light sources λpeak 350 365 nm when compared to dark chlorination oliver and carey 1977 pisarenko et al 2013 however there is limited data available on formation of specific classes of dbpsassociated modifications to dom and dbp precursors during broadband simulated or natural solar irradiation of chlorinated water furthermore available data on dbp formation during uv or sunlight driven fac photolysis have generally been reported only for conditions in which water samples were subjected to either i varying initial fac concentrations for fixed irradiation times or ii fixed initial fac concentrations for variable irradiation times without accounting for variations in fac concentration and consequent effects on cumulative fac exposure ct fac 0 t fac d t during irradiated and dark treatment this is an important limitation as dbp formation is dependent on both fac concentration and reaction time and is expected to be strongly influenced by variations in fac concentrations during irradiation without the availability of measurements of ct fac which normalizes for variations in fac concentration and reaction time from the prior studies it remains unclear how ct fac specific dbp formation potentials are affected by sunlight driven fac photolysis in turn hindering direct comparison of dbp formation under dark and light conditions the principal objectives of this work were to a quantify formation of regulated organic dbps thms and haas during sunlight driven fac photolysis and b correlate dbp formation with characteristic changes to dom during dark chlorination solar irradiation and sunlight driven fac photolysis dbp formation was investigated under a variety of conditions e g varying ph temperature bromide concentration or o2 concentration w and w o added oxidant scavengers the effects of variations in fac exposure were normalized to ct fac to enable comparison of ct fac specific dbp formation under the range of conditions investigated corresponding changes in dom character were investigated by monitoring changes in doc fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems uv absorbance uv254 specifically differential absorbance spectra and size exclusion chromatographs of the dom present in treated solutions an overarching objective of this work was to utilize these analyses to provide an improved understanding of how dom modifications resulting from solar irradiation in the presence of fac influence dbp yields and how this knowledge may be applied to mitigate such impacts

up to a cumulative ct fac of 400 mg l min as shown in fig 1 there is a clear increase in dbp formation during fac light fac only treatment when compared to fac only treatment for all conditions elevated temperature resulted in further increases in dbp formation at each condition fig 1 which appears to be due primarily to increased rates of dark dom chlorination text s8 direct dom photolysis did not appear to be an important contributor to dbp formation even at the highest fluence investigated 18 6 j cm2 haa5 and tthm yields after light only fac only treatment were similar to those measured following fac only treatment table s3 similar trends were also observed when using natural sunlight to photolyze fac fig s3 as discussed in more detail below the increases in thm and haa formation during solar fac photolysis may result from dom modifications predisposing certain dbp precursor constituents to increased halogenation during co exposure to fac o3 and various reactive oxygen or halogen species ros or rhs generated by fac photolysis while prior work has shown that pre ozonation of dom at 0 4 1 mg o3 mg c and circumneutral ph can decrease thm formation during chlorination gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2013 pre oxidative treatment at lower o3 exposures and or elevated ho exposures e g during o3 treatment at high ph or aops such as uv h2o2 similar to the conditions of solar fac photolysis has actually been shown to increase thm formation during chlorination de vera et al 2015 dotson et al 2010 mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 this is thought to be due to degradation of higher molecular weight humic like substances to smaller chlorine reactive alcohol or ketone containing aromatic or aliphatic groups de vera et al 2015 dotson et al 2010 mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 in additional experiments bromide was added to reaction solutions at concentrations of 40 or 200 μg l in order to evaluate formation of brominated dbps under conditions representative of relatively pristine or human influenced surface waters respectively flury and papritz 1993 soltermann et al 2016 addition of bromide led to suppression of haa5 and tthm yields during both fac only and fac light fac only treatments fig 1 in contrast haa9 which includes additional mixed cl and br containing haas not captured by haa5 remained relatively constant at elevated bromide levels during fac only treatment fig s6a consistent with prior observations chellam and krasner 2001 cowman and singer 1996 and increased at elevated bromide levels during fac light

only and fac light fac only treatments at elevated bromide levels with a relatively larger increase in bsf observed during fac light fac only treatment fig s6 this suggests increased bromination during fac light fac only treatment compared to fac only treatment potentially due to modifications to dom during fac photolysis leading to greater susceptibility of dbp precursors to bromination or direct bromination of dbp precursors by photochemically generated reactive bromine species such as br or brcl ph effects on fac speciation or photolysis pathway eqs 1 3 did not seem to have a clear influence on haa formation as variation of ph did not have a strong effect on haa5 fig 1a and b or haa9 fig s6a yields during either fac only or fac light fac only treatment prior investigations have also reported variability in the ph dependence of overall haa formation during dark chlorination and fac photolysis processes though trihaloacetic acid formation generally appears to correlate inversely with ph during dark chlorination korshin et al 2002 liang and singer 2003 remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2015 in contrast tthm yields in the present work increased with increasing ph for both fac only and fac light fac only treatment fig 1c and d consistent with prior observations gallard and von gunten 2002 pisarenko et al 2013 rook 1977 in addition to an increased importance of oh in the haloform reaction at higher ph increased tthm yields during fac light fac only treatment may be in part related to solar fac photolysis kinetics as the rate of fac photolysis increases with ph at wavelengths above 260 nm due to increased uv absorbance by fac with the shift in speciation from hocl to ocl eqs 1 3 fig s2a nowell and hoigne 1992a b 3 1 2 effects of dissolved o2 removal and radical scavenger addition in order to evaluate the relative importance of o3 and radical species in driving dbp formation during fac light fac only treatment concentrations of o2 were varied from 0 to 1 6 mmol l and the radical scavengers t buoh or carbonate as nahco3 were added separately at concentrations of 50 mm to selected reaction solutions fig 2 initially anoxic conditions are expected to limit formation of o3 by preventing the reaction of photochemically generated o 3p with o2 whereas saturation with o2 is anticipated to increase o3 formation relative to ambient conditions as per eq 4 addition of 50 mm concentrations of t buoh or carbonate is anticipated to lead to 97 or 41 scavenging of ho 95 or 88 scavenging of cl and 53 or 4 scavenging of o 3p under the experimental conditions investigated here text s10 and table s4 the absence of o2 did not appear to lead to significant differences in haa5 yields whereas o2 saturation led to moderate decreases in haa5 yields indicating that o3 may contribute to destruction of haa precursors during fac photolysis fig 2a fig 2b shows that the absence of o2 resulted in a small increase in tthm yields during fac light fac only treatment possibly due to decreased destruction of thm precursors e g dihydroxybenzenes by o3 gallard and von gunten 2002 hua and reckhow 2013 o2 saturation had no clear effect on thm yields during fac light fac only treatment addition of t buoh and carbonate each appeared to result in modest decreases in haa5 yields fig 2a during fac light fac only treatment due in large part to decreases in di and trichloroacetic acid formation fig 2a and fig s6a this indicates that radical reactions with dom may contribute to haa precursor formation carbonate and t buoh addition did not have a clear effect on tthm yields during fac light fac only treatment fig 2b overall variations in dissolved o2 concentrations and addition of radical scavengers resulted in at most modest changes to organic dbp formation making it difficult to distinguish direct effects of o3 and radical species e g ho cl cl2 clo o 3p on dbp precursors 3 1 3 importance of photochemical versus dark reactions in driving dbp formation fig 3 compares dbp formation versus ct fac during fac only treatment and fac light treatment labeled 15 30 and 45 min without and with post irradiation dark fac treatment compared to fac only treatment fac light treatment resulted in substantially greater yields of tthm and haa5 at a given ct fac value confirming that yields of dbps are elevated during sunlight driven fac photolysis fig 3 also highlights the change in dbp formation resulting from continued fac only treatment after sunlight driven fac photolysis by comparing the results for fac light treatment open symbols with those for fac light fac only treatment half filled symbols with the same irradiation times used in each case it appears that the ct fac normalized rate of haa5 formation during dark chlorination fig 3 solid lines increases modestly after fac light treatment regression slopes increase by factors of 2 and 3 for ph 8 and 6 respectively whereas the rate of tthm formation during dark chlorination fig 3 dashed lines is similar after fac light and fac only pretreatment when normalized by ct fac taken together these data indicate that most if not all of the relative increases in dbp yields observed during fac light fac only experiments are due to dbp formation during fac photolysis rather than to post irradiation reactions in the dark this in turn suggests that increases in dbp formation during sunlight driven fac photolysis are driven primarily by halogenation reactions during irradiation consistent with oliver and carey 1977 though it is unclear if this is due to i direct halogenation of dom by rhs e g cl br brcl cl2 clo ii oxidative modifications to dom resulting in generation of precursor moieties with higher susceptibility toward halogenation by fac or rhs or iii a combination of both 3 1 4 dbp formation during treatment of natural waters fig 4 shows haa5 and tthm yields in two natural freshwaters lake washington and a local reservoir with and without addition of 200 μg l of bromide subjected to i fac only ii light only fac only and iii fac light fac only treatment fac only and light only fac only treatment at fluences up to 18 6 j cm2 resulted in similar dbp yields indicating that direct photolysis of the dom does not impact dbp formation during chlorination haa5 concentrations associated with lake washington remained well below the epa mcl of 60 μg l and were not detected within the local reservoir water tthm formation was compliant with the epa mcl of 80 μg l at natural bromide concentrations for each water though at higher bromide concentrations formation of bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane increased during solar fac photolysis and tthm levels exceeded the mcl these results indicate that sunlight driven fac photolysis can likely be applied for disinfection of natural waters with relatively low dom and bromide concentrations though further work is needed to evaluate its applicability over a wider range of water qualities 3 2 analyses of changes to dissolved organic matter 3 2 1 uv visible absorbance and fluorescence the results summarized in fig 5 a fig s7a and table s5 show that srnom after fac light treatment has substantially lower 254 nm uv absorbance than after fac only treatment addition of t buoh results in preservation of chromophores during solar fac photolysis 31 and 51 losses in 254 nm absorbance with and without t buoh respectively after 45 min of fac light anoxic conditions also result in preservation of chromophores during solar fac photolysis treatment but to a lesser extent than t buoh addition 40 loss after 45 min of fac light indicating that radical species and o3 contribute to decreases in absorbance and destruction of associated aromatic compounds untreated srnom has characteristic fluorescence features including two peaks located near 250 nmex 450 nmem and 330 nmex 450 nmem that are typically associated with terrestrial humic constituents hua et al 2010 ishii and boyer 2012 dom with high fluorescence intensity in these regions has been positively correlated to thm formation during chlorination hua et al 2010 li et al 2016 fig s8 depicts the change to fluorescence eems after fac only light only light only fac only fac light and fac light fac only treatment fac light and fac light fac only treatments resulted in significantly greater losses in the fluorescence signals associated with humic constituents when compared to fac only light only or light only fac only treatments figs 5a and s7a previous research has also demonstrated greater fluorophore destruction during fac uva treatment when compared to fac uvc aop treatment pisarenko et al 2013 and fac only treatment shu et al 2014 introducing t buoh as a radical scavenger during solar chlorine photolysis significantly inhibited degradation of humic like fluorophores to an extent greater than observed by limiting o3 formation under anoxic conditions figs 5a and s7a and table s5 these trends indicate that photochemically generated ho cl or other ros rhs and to a lesser degree o3 all play important roles in the degradation of fluorophores during fac light treatment 3 2 2 uv visible differential absorbance spectra das the ph titration das analysis method provides an in situ approach to quantifying behavior of ionizable chromophores which reflects contributions of carboxylic and phenolic functional groups in dom dryer et al 2008 gao and korshin 2013 a monotonic increase in uv absorbance 240 450 nm of dom is typically observed with increasing ph which is primarily associated with deprotonation of aromatic dom chromophores korshin et al 1997 from the das results of raw srnom fig 6 a there are two prominent feature bands a narrow band centered at 280 nm da280 associated with carboxylic acid groups and a broad band centered at 340 nm da340 associated with phenolic groups dryer et al 2008 gao and korshin 2013 fac only treatment of srnom containing solutions at ph 8 and 6 resulted in moderate decreases in sample absorbance figs 6b s9a b indicating that fac reacted directly with chromophores within the dom the da340 da280 ratio for samples subjected to fac only treatment at ph 8 and 6 did not change during titration from ph 6 to 10 indicating suppression of the phenol deprotonation feature compared to the untreated sample fig s9a b light only treatment had no significant impact on das spectra fig s9a b exposing srnom containing solutions to fac light treatment using natural fac lightns or simulated sunlight fac lightss at ph 6 and 8 resulted in substantially greater bleaching of uv absorbance compared to fac only treatment and particularly enhanced removal at 340 nm indicating preferential modification of phenolic groups figs 6c s9a b fac light treatment at ph 8 resulted in a lower average da340 da280 ratio than at ph 6 likely due to increased deprotonation of phenolic groups to more reactive phenolate forms and higher fac photolysis rates at ph 8 fig s9a b the addition of bromide was found to have no significant effect on changes to the da340 da280 ratio before or after treatment fig s9b c changes in das spectra observed during fac light treatment at ph 8 were similar to those observed during treatment of samples with increasing o3 doses o3 doc 0 75 fig 6c f where addition of t buoh had little effect on das changes during direct o3 treatment fig s9e this is consistent with the proposed role of o3 in contributing to direct degradation of phenolic groups in dom during fac light treatment however purging o2 from solution to limit the formation of o3 during fac light treatment at ph 8 did not have a significant effect on da340 da280 ratios in comparison to fac lightss treatment at ambient o2 levels figs 6d and s9d suggesting either that o3 plays a significantly less important role in driving phenol degradation compared to o 3p ho cl and other radical species or that increased degradation of phenols by o 3p which would be elevated in the absence of o2 as per eq 4 compensates for the absence of o3 adding t buoh as a radical scavenger limited decreases in da340 da280 ratios during fac light treatment to a moderate extent figs 6e and s9d indicating some preservation of phenol groups due to suppression of ros rhs and or o3 via scavenging of o 3p zhou et al 2014 3 2 3 size exclusion chromatography with uv fluorescence doc detection sec uv fld doc size exclusion chromatography enables fractionation of dom by size and or molecular weight mw resulting in discrimination of two major peaks in the srnom comprising 1 a larger peak peak 1 here assigned to higher mw humic substances and 2 a second smaller peak peak 2 here generally assigned to lower mw acidic compounds her et al 2003 huber et al 2011 see fig s10 for example chromatograms fig 5b d and s7b d summarize results from chromatographic analyses of treated samples including normalized total chromatogram area peak 1 peak 2 area peak 1 peak 2 area untreated and average dom mw estimates each obtained using uv fluorescence and doc detection see text s7 for analytical details and mw calculations and fig s11 for plots of fractional peak areas fac only treatment generally resulted in a decrease of 20 for uv chromatogram areas and 5 10 for total doc areas while a slight 5 increase in total fluorescence was visible an effect associated with halogenation of dom korshin et al 1999 increasing periods of irradiation during fac light treatment resulted in decreases in overall mw as measured by uv and doc detection as well as 40 60 decreases in total uv chromatogram areas and up to 25 decreases in doc chromatogram areas fig 5b c s7b d by comparison fluorescence peak area decreased 20 80 with minimal changes to overall mw as measured by fluorescence figs 5d and s7d these observations for fac light treatment are likely attributable to degradation of higher mw humic substances comprising peak 1 to lower mw byproducts comprising peak 2 with little corresponding mineralization of doc to co2 coupled with degradation of chromophores associated primarily with higher mw humic substances and degradation of fluorophores associated with both higher and lower mw organics low mw byproducts that contribute to peak 2 in doc chromatograms after treatment appear to have a modest uv signal and very little fluorescence character fig s10 changes observable by doc and uv detection were similar for each treatment at ph 8 and 6 figs 5b c s7b c similar to bulk sample fluorescence and uv absorbance measurements addition of t buoh resulted in preservation of chromophores and fluorophores and appeared to hinder degradation of larger mw compounds to lower mw compounds this implies that ho cl and other rhs species likely play an important role in breaking down aromatic molecules contained within larger dom size fractions though it should be noted that t buoh also scavenges o 3p to a limited extent zhou et al 2014 so some of the decreases in chromophore and fluorophore destruction may also have been due to blockage of reactions between o 3p or o3 and dom suppressing o3 formation by deoxygenation of reaction solutions prior to fac light treatment also resulted in decreased destruction of chromophores and fluorophores but not to the same extent as t buoh addition this suggests that o3 may target a subset of primarily electron rich aromatic functional groups such as phenols and activated aromatic rings whereas ho cl and other radical species may less selectively attack a larger pool of aromatic components within the dom 3 3 linkages between observed dom modifications and increased dbp formation during sunlight driven fac photolysis decreases in fluorescence and uv absorbance of srnom exhibited clear correlations with tthm and haa9 yields during fac light treatment fig s12 whereas correlations for haa5 yields were weaker likely due to the smaller group of haas encompassed by haa5 relative to haa9 there were no clear trends between dbp formation and fluorescence or absorbance changes during fac only treatment providing additional evidence that modifications of dom by ros rhs and or o3 produced during fac photolysis are associated with the observed increases thm and haa yields the findings discussed to this point suggest that o3 generated during solar fac photolysis contributes to preferential elimination of srnom s humic like fluorescence properties which are likely attributable in part to activated electron rich aromatic rings e g phenolic groups cory and mcknight 2005 sharpless and blough 2014 similarities in da340 da280 losses during fac light treatment and o3 only treatment also indicate a role for o3 in preferential phenolic degradation during fac photolysis previous work has shown that treatment of dom by o3 results in degradation of aromatics within the dom e g ring cleavage of dihydroxybenzenes and phenolic like compounds and to decreased dbp formation during subsequent chlorination highlighting the role of phenolic moieties in dom as dbp precursors gallard and von gunten 2002 li et al 2016 however it is possible that under the conditions of fac light treatment o3 levels are low enough relative to dom concentrations that activated aromatic dbp precursors are generated by oxygenation and or hydroxylation reactions to a greater extent than they are destroyed mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 in this work haa and thm formation during fac light fac only treatment seemed to correlate negatively with conditions favoring higher in situ o3 levels supporting the hypothesis that increasing o3 exposure contributes to the net degradation of organic dbp precursors experiments undertaken here with added radical scavengers indicate that ros and rhs contribute to both chromophore and fluorophore destruction and non selective attack and degradation of high molecular weight humic like substances to form lower molecular weight organic acids ho has been found to react rapidly via hydroxylation of olefins and aromatic compounds and hydrogen abstraction from aliphatic compounds dotson et al 2010 mvula and von sonntag 2003 pan et al 1993 varanasi et al 2018 cl may also react with a variety of aliphatic aromatic and olefinic moieties as well as alcohol groups in dom via addition electron transfer and or h abstraction alegre et al 2000 martire et al 2001 varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 overall ros and or rhs reactions appear to contribute to the generation of additional dbp precursors it is hypothesized that ho in particular activates aromatic groups by hydroxylation and generates lower mw aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids as transformation products after reacting with higher mw fractions of dom varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 haa formation increases moderately during fac only treatment after fac light pretreatment when compared to fac only treatment at equivalent ct fac supporting the hypothesis that molecules generated via ros and rhs reactions with dom act as haa precursors specifically for dcaa and tcaa during the residual dark chlorination period of fac light fac only experiments increased thm and haa formation during fac light treatment may also be due to direct attack of dom by radical species such as ho cl br brcl cl2 or clo initiating radical chain reactions leading to cl addition or c centered radical recombination with cl or other halogen radicals alegre et al 2000 li et al 2016 martire et al 2001 wang et al 2015 one possible explanation for the increases in dbp yields observed during fac light treatment even in the presence of added radical scavengers or under anoxic conditions is that o3 and radical species contribute to varying degrees to both degradation and generation of dbp precursors de vera et al 2015 mao et al 2014 with precursor generation generally outweighing precursor degradation consequently limiting o3 formation does not prevent increases in dbp formation due to radical reactions li et al 2016 and limiting ho and cl levels does not prevent increases in dbp formation due to o 3p and or o3 reactions mao et al 2014 riley and mancy 1978 4 conclusions application of simulated and natural sunlight driven fac photolysis in srnom solutions and natural waters resulted in increased yields of regulated organic dbps thms and haas degradation of dom chromophores and fluorophores and decreases in average dom mw due to degradation of higher mw humic substances to lower mw organic acids with minimal mineralization of doc subjecting dom containing solutions to fac light treatment resulted in substantial changes in the ratios of differential absorbances at 280 and 340 nm corresponding to carboxylic and phenolic dom moieties with preferential removal of the 340 nm band indicating depletion of phenol groups relative to carboxylic groups in the bulk dom taken together these results indicate that fac light treatment results in enhanced degradation of uv absorbing and fluorescent aromatic constituents phenolic moieties in particular of higher mw humic substances by photochemically generated oxidants including o3 ho and possibly cl clo cl2 and o 3p oxidants are expected to participate in aromatic and aliphatic electron transfer addition and h abstraction reactions in addition to aromatic ring cleavage resulting in formation of lower mw organic acid byproducts this process likely results in enhanced formation of dbps through a increased dark halogenation of dbp precursors derived from aromatic ring cleavage and other dom degradation pathways b direct halogenation of dbp precursors by rhs such as cl br brcl cl2 or clo or c a combination of the two the fact that dbp formation during fac only treatment subsequent to fac light treatment was only moderately higher for haas than during fac only treatment suggests that direct halogenation by photochemically generated rhs may contribute substantially to the enhanced dbp yields observed during sunlight driven fac photolysis it is recommended that future investigations expand on these findings by utilizing model compounds representing various types of dom constituent groups to evaluate the relative importance of reaction pathways involving ros rhs and o3 in driving dbp formation during solar fac photolysis and uv driven fac photolysis in general application of sunlight driven fac photolysis for disinfection is anticipated to lead to increased dbp formation and will require careful attention to potential impacts on thm and haa levels however because this process can enable inactivation of chlorine resistant pathogens e g cryptosporidium oocysts at far lower ct fac values than chlorination alone the increases in dbp formation inherent to fac light treatment may be offset by the ability to operate at significantly decreased ct fac in addition risks of increased dbp formation could be mitigated by limiting applications of sunlight driven fac photolysis to short term e g emergency use and or to appropriate source waters e g those with low dom and bromide levels as observed here for treatment of two
