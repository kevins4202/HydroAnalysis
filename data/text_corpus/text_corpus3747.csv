18735,although photochemical transformation is a major degradation pathway for antibiotics in surface freshwaters the photodegradation of antibiotics from freshwaters downstream into seawater is largely unknown herein sulfadiazine was adopted as a representative antibiotic to probe the alteration of photolytic kinetics along freshwater to seawater sampled from qinzhou bay china the results showed that the photodegradation rate constants of sulfadiazine significantly increased in estuarine waters along freshwaters to seawaters experiments in synthetic water samples with isolated local dissolved organic matter il dom indicated that the increased photodegradation of sulfadiazine is attributed to the integrative effect of both il dom and halide ions radical quenching experiments with tert butanol quenching of oh and isopropanol quenching of both oh and reactive halogen species rhs demonstrated that rhs are largely responsible for the halide specific enhancement in the photodegradation of sulfadiazine rather than other reactive species such as triplet excited il dom and oh however triplet excited il dom was involved in the production of rhs by the oxidation of halide ions by the triplet excited states experiments conducted with dom analogues verified dom sensitized rhs formation and the degradation induced by rhs is positively correlated with the triplet excited reduction potentials of dom analogues these findings are helpful in deeply understanding the transformation of antibiotics and demonstrate the importance of rhs induced degradation in antibiotics fate models in estuarine water systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords reactive halogen species dissolved organic matter triplet excited dom halide ions sulfonamides estuarine waters 1 introduction estuaries are critical ecosystems as they provide spawning and nursery grounds for many aquatic organisms that maintain coastal ecosystem health and serve as the base for offshore fisheries barbier et al 2011 due to riverine transport discharge from land based sources and mariculture activities a mass of micropollutants has been released into estuarine waters among these pollutants antibiotics are of acute concern because they can induce bacteria resistance and resistant genes even at environmental concentrations martínez 2008 zhu et al 2017 it was reported that in 2013 china consumed 53800 tons of antibiotics and most of them finally flowed into estuarine waters zhang et al 2015 antibiotics were frequently detected in estuarine and coastal waters kümmerer 2009 wang et al 2014 xue et al 2013 for example the detection frequencies of 5 sulfonamides were as high as 100 and the total concentrations of 5 sulfonamides ranged from 2 0 to 20 ng l in estuarine and coastal waters of the china qinzhou bay xue et al 2013 assessing the potential risks displayed by these pollutants needs an understanding of the processes that impact their transformation and fate photochemical transformation has been proved to be a central factor in governing the fate of antibiotics in surface waters vione et al 2014 yan and song 2014 in addition to direct photolysis most antibiotics can also be degraded by reactive oxygen species ros e g hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and excited triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3dom in natural waters boreen et al 2005 chen et al 2009 guerard et al 2009 yan and song 2014 wang et al 2018 these photochemical processes can be substantially impacted by the dissolved constituents of natural waters parker et al 2016 parker and mitch 2016 vione et al 2014 especially in estuarine waters the ionic strength halide concentrations and dom characteristics are strongly modified from freshwaters downstream into the seawaters grebel et al 2012 thus it deserves attention to explore the photochemical transformation of antibiotics in estuarine waters so far there have been few studies on the photochemical processes of antibiotics in estuarine waters especially the effects of main dissolved constituents e g cl br and estuarine dom and ionic strength some previous studies have found that photochemical transformation of some organic pollutants was significantly altered in seawaters as compared with freshwaters li et al 2016 parker et al 2013 2016 parker and mitch 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 investigated the effects of dom extracted from coastal waters and found that this dom significantly promoted the photodegradation of sulfonamides compared to freshwater dom parker and co workers 2016a and 2016b observed 3dom can oxidize halide ions to produce reactive halogen species rhs cl br cl2 br2 clbr which increases the indirect photodegradation rates of microcystins domoic acid and dimethyl sulfide in seawaters relative to freshwaters recently we demonstrated that rhs formation by triplet excited micropollutants can also be a possible rhs generation pathway in estuarine waters li et al 2016 however for a huge number of antibiotics the effects of gradient alteration of ionic constituents in estuarine waters on their photodegradation are seldom investigated and the role and contribution of rhs on photodegradation are largely unknown all things taken together we hypothesized that the photodegradation of antibiotics in estuarine waters may be affected by the elevated ionic strength halide concentrations and dom levels and it may be enhanced by the produced rhs therefore the main goal of this study was to investigate the photodegradation of antibiotics in estuarine waters sampled along freshwaters to seawaters and to explore the role of rhs on the degradation herein we adopted sulfadiazine fig s1 as a representative of antibiotics to test our basic hypothesis sulfadiazine was selected as model compound due to its wide use in mariculture and widespread occurrence in estuarine waters wang et al 2014 xue et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 moreover it was detected in estuarine water sampled from china qinzhou bay in this study table s1 to probe the effect of the main dissolved constituents e g cl br and estuarine dom and the role of rhs for modeling antibiotic photodegradation along estuarine water gradients authentic samples were collected along a freshwater to estuarine gradient in qinzhou bay china the photolytic kinetics of sulfonamides in estuarine samples was examined and the contribution of rhs to the photodegradation was evaluated by radical scavenging experiments aromatic ketones as dom analogues were adopted to further probe the role of rhs in the degradation of antibiotics in synthetic water solutions containing halide ions and the relationship of rhs formation with reduction potentials of excited state aromatic ketones was probed the photolytic products were identified by the use of q tof mass spectrometry 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals sulfadiazine sulfamonomethoxine and sulfamethoxazole with 99 purities were purchased from

scientific sodium chloride sodium bromide and sodium perchlorate were of analytical grade from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent china 2 2 estuarine water sample collection and analysis estuarine waters 1 with low salinity 6 with high salinity were sampled at a depth of around 20 cm beneath the water surface from the upper to the lower reaches of the tai lam river estuary located in qinzhou china fig s2 for each of sampling sites except for 1 8 l water samples were collected for the photolytic experiment 100 l water sampled from 1 was collected so as to isolate estuarine water dom these water samples collected in brown glass bottles 4 l for each of the bottles were temporarily stored in a portable refrigerator until transfer to the laboratory where they were filtered through 0 45 μm glass filters and stored at 20 c until use all the sample pretreatments were carried out within one week after the collection concentrations of inorganic ions dissolved organic carbon doc ph and salinity were measured and the relevant results are listed in table s2 the detailed analytical processes are described in the text s1 of supplementary material the treatment procedures of water samples for the actual concentration measurement of tested sulfonamides in estuarine water are detailed in text s2 of supplementary material a reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis system was adopted to isolate local dom il dom from 90 l filtered estuarine water sample 1 as reported by previous studies huguet et al 2009 vetter et al 2007 wang et al 2018 to test whether the il dom extracted from estuarine water sample 1 can represent the actual structures of dom in this estuarine water uv visible absorption spectrum ratio between the absorbance values at 250 and 365 nm e2 e3 and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 for il dom and estuarine water sample 1 were measured previous studies also employed these parameters to track the relative size of dom molecules and to get a proxy for aromaticity of dom bodhipaksha et al 2015 de laurentiis et al 2013 helms et al 2008 2 3 photodegradation experiments an ocrs px32t merry go round photoreactor kaifeng hxsei science instrument factory china containing reaction solutions in quartz tubes 1 7 cm inner diameter 16 cm height 35 ml volume was applied in the photochemical experiments a 500 w hg lamp with 290 nm cut off filters was used as the light source the light intensity λ 290 500 nm in the center of the tubes was 3 2 10 5 ein l 1 s 1 determined by chemical actinometry method dulin and mill 1982 and the detailed processes are provided in text s3 of supplementary material the light source was surrounded by a water refrigerated quartz jacket maintaining a temperature of around 25 c for the irradiation solutions this temperature was slightly higher 1 2 c than that of dark control tubes wrapped with aluminium foil in the photoreactor both synthetic water solutions and estuarine water samples were used in the photolytic experiments phosphate buffer 10 mm was used to control the ph of synthetic water solutions and their ph agreed with the ph of estuarine water samples phosphate buffer was usually used as ph control reagent in seawater photochemical experiments parker et al 2016 parker and mitch 2016 for all photodegradation kinetic experiments photolytic solution volume in a quartz tube was 25 ml the initial concentrations of each target compound were 5 μm 62 5 μl from respective 2 0 mm stock solutions unless otherwise mentioned aliquots 0 5 ml were periodically sampled from the test tubes all the experiments were performed in triplicate to probe the effects of halide ions on the direct photodegradation of sulfadiazine experiments were carried out by spiking halides with various concentrations 0 05 m cl 0 08 mm br 0 1 m cl 0 15 mm br 0 2 m cl 0 3 mm br 0 4 m cl 0 6 mm br 0 54 m cl 0 8 mm br to pure water for a total volume of 25 ml cl concentrations were obtained by addition of various amounts of solid nacl and various br concentrations were obtained by addition of various volumes of nabr from a stock solution 0 2 m these salts were also added into the estuarine water sample 1 freshwater sample to examine the effects of halide ions on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in real water moreover il dom was applied to probe the effect of estuarine water dom on photodegradation in synthetic water solutions with halide ions which was performed by spiking 20 mg c l il dom 1 8 ml from a 278 mg c l concentrated solution from estuarine water sample 1 to synthetic water solutions meanwhile sodium perchlorate with various concentrations corresponding to those of cl was used to explore the effect of ionic strength on the photodegradation to investigate the role of rhs in the degradation of sulfadiazine rhs quenchers isopropanol and tert butanol were employed due to their different reactivity for rhs quenching was carried out by addition of 477 μl pure isopropanol 250 mm or 59 μl pure tert butanol 25 mm to synthetic water solutions it has been reported that tert butanol is a poor rhs quencher but a good oh quencher while isopropanol can effectively quench both oh and rhs parker et al 2016 thereby the difference for the quenching by the two alcohols can be used to single out the contribution of rhs five aromatic ketones i e 4 carboxybenzophenone 2 acetonaphthone 4 methoxyacetophenone benzophenone and acetophenone as dom analogues were used to probe the role of dom in the formation of rhs in the synthetic water solutions containing halides each ketone compound at 20 mg c l 30 35 46 32 and 52 μl from respective 100 mm stock solutions of 4 carboxybenzophenone 2 acetonaphthone 4 methoxyacetophenone benzophenone and acetophenone corresponding to the estuarine water dom level was spiked into synthetic water solutions for a total volume of 25 ml 2 4 analytical methods the target compounds with their initial concentrations of 5 1 and 0 2 μm under different degradation times were determined by an agilent 1260 hplc with diode array detector and zorbax eclipse xdb c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm the mobile phase composition detection wavelength and flow rate for these compounds are listed in table s3 for 5 nm initial concentration of sulfonamides the concentrations under different irradiation times were measured by a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a 6410b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer a waters c18 column 2 1 100 mm 3 5 μm was employed the mobile phase consists of 95 a 0 1 formic acid solution v v with 1 g l ammonium formate and 5 b acetonitrile the elution program was as follows 0 3 min 5 b 15 min 88 b analysis was operated with an electrospray ionization esi source in multiple reaction monitoring mode the precursor ions quantification ions and mass spectrometry conditions are listed in table s1 the real concentrations of the tested sulfonamides in estuarine waters were also measured with a 6410b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and the analytical conditions were the same as those of the method mentioned above to probe the role of rhs in the degradation of sulfonamides based on their photolytic products a 340 nm cut off filter was employed to prevent the direct photodegradation of sulfonamides photolytic products of the tested sulfonamides were identified by an agilent 1290 uhplc with an ab sciex 6600 q tof mass spectrometer and the detailed analytical method is provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolytic kinetics of sulfadiazine in estuarine waters in the dark controls no obvious loss of sulfadiazine was observed in pure water synthetic water solutions containing the main water constituents and estuarine water samples implying that removal from other pathways such as adsorption or biodegradation hydrolysis was negligible in our experimental processes linear regression of ln c t c 0 vs time t showed that the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in these solutions followed pseudo first order kinetics r 0 97 p 0 05 as can be seen from fig 1 the k values for sulfadiazine at an initial concentration of 5 μm in waters with relatively high salinities e g estuarine water 6 were generally higher p 0 05 than those in waters with low salinities photodegradation of sulfadiazine as a function of its initial concentration was also investigated although relatively low concentration was in favor of photodegradation for all concentrations the phenomenon that photodegradation was enhanced in estuarine water along freshwater to seawater was consistent as shown in fig s3a even at estuarine relevant concentration of sulfadiazine 5 nm the enhancement of photodegradation in estuarine water samples from 1 to 6 was still observed to test whether other antibiotics have a similar photodegradation result as sulfadiazine sulfamonomethoxine and sulfamethoxazole that were frequently detected in estuarine waters were selected figs s3b and 3c showed that for the two antibiotics relatively high salinity was also beneficial for photodegradation in estuarine water samples these results indicate that the effects of the different water matrices on the k values agree for the different antibiotics and general rules can be potentially derived with respect to the variation of k values in different water matrices for different antibiotics to our knowledge this is the first report of the photodegradation kinetics of antibiotics in different estuarine waters in the following section 5 μm sulfadiazine was employed to isolate the importance of dissolved components for the photodegradation in estuarine waters 3 2 isolation of the effect of dissolved components on sulfadiazine photodegradation it was reported that many dissolved components such as dom halide ions no3 and fe3 can influence the photodegradation of organic pollutants vione et al 2014 parker et al 2016 to isolate the effect of water matrices on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine the main dissolved components of estuarine samples were measured and the results are listed in table s1 we employed isolated local dom il dom from estuarine water sample 1 to investigate the effect of estuarine water dom on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine as shown in fig s4 the uv visible absorption spectrums of il dom and estuarine water sample 1 were similar moreover the determined values of e2 e3 5 23 and 5 09 and suva254 0 71 and 0 70 l mgc 1 m 1 for il dom and estuarine water sample 1 were comparable respectively these results imply that il dom can represent the actual estuarine water dom fig 2 shows that the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was obviously enhanced in the presence of il dom as compared to pure water moreover the role of estuarine dom on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was also explored by diluting the estuarine water sample 1 and amending the sample with salts detected in estuarine waters to their initial concentration levels our results showed that the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was gradually enhanced when increasing the concentrations of estuarine water dom fig s5 these results are in agreement with the study by wang et al 2018 who examined the effect of dom extracted from bohai bay of china on sulfonamides photodegradation and observed an enhancement effect of dom on photodegradation these results indicate that the dom in estuarine waters plays an important role in the photodegradation of sulfonamides the effect of halide ions alone on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was evaluated by spiking halides and or sodium perchlorate into pure water compared to the photodegradation rates of sulfadiazine in pure water the addition of halides increased the photodegradation rate constants table 1 it has been reported that the effects of halide ions alone on the photodegradation of organic pollutants contain ionic strength effects and specific halide ion effects li et al 2016 parker et al 2013 naclo4 was adopted to study the effects of ionic strength on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine because clo4 is inert in photochemical processes under circumneutral conditions it can be seen from table 1 that in synthetic water samples containing various salts alone the k values of sulfadiazine slightly increased from 3 25 0 12 10 2 to 4 60 0 04 10 2 h 1 when increasing naclo4 concentrations from 0 to 0 54 m under a certain ionic strength condition the k values in pure water containing naclo4 were comparable to those in the presence of halides for example at 0 4 m ionic strength the values of k were 4 47 0 30 10 2 4 59 0 04 10 2 4 69 0 05 10 2 and 4 54 0 09 10 2 h 1 in synthetic water solutions containing 0 4 m cl 0 4 m clo4 0 4 m cl 0 6 mm br or 0 4 m clo4 0 6 mm br respectively these results suggest that the ionic strength plays a predominant role to enhance the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in the presence of halides a similar phenomenon was also observed by li et al 2016 who investigated the effect of ionic strength on the photodegradation of some sulfonamides i e sulfapyridine sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole and found that the steady state concentration of triplet excited sulfonamides increased in synthetic naclo4 water solutions without dom and promoted their photodegradation this mostly explains the enhancing effect of ionic strength for sulfadiazine photodegradation because the triplet excited state is also involved in the direct photodegradation of sulfadiazine boreen et al 2005 li et al 2015 the synthetic water containing il dom and halides was employed to investigate the influence of halide ions on sulfadiazine photodegradation fig 2 shows that in the presence of il dom the photodegradation rates increased from 4 40 0 18 10 2 to 15 61 0 16 10 2 h 1 when the concentration of halides was increased from 0 to seawater relevant concentrations 0 54 m nacl 0 8 mm nabr this increase of k values was much higher than that of the solutions only containing halides as indicated by table 1 in estuarine water sample 1 the k value also significantly increased with addition of halides at seawater relevant concentrations of halides the k value of sulfadiazine was 1 6 fold higher than in estuarine water sample 1 without addition of halides fig 3 as stated previously the relatively high ionic strength is propitious to slow down the decay of 3dom and to increase its steady state concentration parker et al 2013 however a comparable value of k was observed in estuarine water sample 1 with or without addition of naclo4 fig 3 indicating that the ionic strength effect does not explain the increased photodegradation from these observations it can be inferred that specific halide ion effects most likely explain the enhancement of sulfadiazine photodegradation in dom containing estuarine waters from freshwaters to seawaters to probe the role of other seawater ionic components estuarine water sample 1 with addition of major seawater ions 400 mm nacl 0 8 mm nabr 54 mm mgcl2 29 mm na2so4 11 mm cacl2 10 mm kcl 0 35 mm h3bo3 1 8 mm naco3 and 0 26 mm naco3 was used in comparison to photodegradation by amending the estuarine water sample 1 with halides the addition of major seawater ions did not further influence the photodegadation which indicates that among seawater ions halide ions play a crucial role in the increased photodegradation of sulfadiazine since the estuarine water samples used in this study contain the sensitizer no3 that produces oh under irradiation the effect of no3 on sulfadiazine photodegradation was evaluated by spiking no3 into estuarine water samples in particular no3 was adopted at concentrations relevant to those analyzed in the estuarine waters as shown in fig 3 the addition of no3 into the estuarine water sample 1 did not obviously alter the k values in the absence presence of halides the effect of fe3 oh sensitizer on the photodegradation in estuarine water was also examined although fe3 was not detected in these water samples similar results as those with no3 were observed by adding fe3 into the estuarine water sample 1 fig 3 previous studies reported that many dissolved components such as dom cl br and hco3 can effectively quench oh grebel et al 2010 li et al 2018 vione et al 2013 2014 and this may be the cause of the negligible role of no3 parker et al 2016 similarly observed that no3 in saline water did not notably impact the photodegradation of microcystins therefore the enhanced photodegradation of sulfadiazine from freshwaters to saline waters can be mainly ascribed to the effect of estuarine water dom and halide ions 3 3 mechanism for 3dom mediated rhs formation as indicated by table s2 the concentrations of dom in the estuarine waters from 1 to 6 were comparable which indicates that estuarine water dom alone cannot account for the observed enhancement of the photodegradation of sulfadiazine under the studied experimental conditions it has been reported that in saline waters 3dom direct oxidation of halide ions may be an important route for the formation of rhs that impacts the indirect photodegradation of many micropollutants jammoul et al 2009 parker and mitch 2016 zhang and parker 2018 therefore we postulated that rhs may also be produced in our estuarine water samples and dominate the halide specific enhancement of il dom sensitized photodegradation of sulfadiazine to test this hypothesis radical scavenging experiments by spiking isopropanol and tert butanol into synthetic and estuarine water samples were carried out these scavengers can react with oh rapidly with second order rate constants of 2 3 109 m 1 s 1 for isopropanol and 6 108 m 1 s 1 for tert butanol whereas their second order rate constants with rhs span 2 3 orders of magnitude 1 2 105 and 7 0 102 m 1 s 1 for reaction of isopropanol and tert butanol with cl2 respectively 6 6 106 and 1 4 104 m 1 s 1 for reaction of isopropanol and tert butanol with br respectively buxton et al 1988 hasegawa and neta 1978 merenyi and lind 1994 zhang and parker 2018 hence the role of rhs can be distinguished from that of oh by comparison of the reduction of sulfadiazine photodegradation rates in the presence of isopropanol vs tert butanol fig 4 shows that in estuarine water sample 1 lowest salinity the addition of tert butanol and isopropanol reduced the values of k by 12 and 16 respectively whereas 13 and 38 respective reductions in photodegradation rates were observed in estuarine water sample 6 highest salinity this indicates that by comparing the overall photodegradation in estuarine waters the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was partially retarded in the presence of alcohols especially in estuarine water sample 1 freshwater only around 10 depression of photodegradation was observed previous studies reported that in surface waters 3dom plays a crucial role in the photodegradation of sulfonamides boreen et al 2005 li et al 2015 and 2018 which suggests that 3dom was also involved in the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in estuarine waters this was supported by the sorbic acid a quencher of triplet excited states quenching experiment in which the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was almost completely inhibited in estuarine waters fig 4 although 3dom alone is an important participant in estuarine water photodegradation rhs may play a pivotal role in the enhancement of sulfadiazine photodegradation along freshwaters to seawaters it can be seen from fig 4 that the difference in the k values for the estuarine water sample 6 with addition of tert butanol and isopropanol k tert butanol k isopropanol was approximately 7 fold higher than that of estuarine water sample 1 under ionic strength control by adding naclo4 into estuarine water sample 1 there was no obvious variation in the k values with addition of tert butanol and isopropanol respectively these results demonstrate the importance of rhs in the halide specific enhancement of photodegradation in saline waters in synthetic seawater containing both il dom and halides quenching by isopropanol and tert butanol resulted in a decrease of k values by 47 and 7 respectively fig 2 which agrees with the alcohols scavenging experiment conducted in estuarine water sample 6 as shown in fig 4 this implies that il dom sensitized rhs formation may be responsible for the increased photodegradation of sulfadiazine in addition the photodegradation rate in estuarine water sample 6 containing isopropanol was comparable with that of pristine estuarine water sample 1 fig 4 as listed in table s2 il dom and no3 are the main photosensitizers in estuarine waters and il dom concentrations in estuarine water samples 1 and 6 were comparable in water sample 1 degradation of sulfadiazine consists of direct photodegradation and 3dom sensitized indirect photodegradation and in water sample 6 the degradation is via direct photodegradation and indirect photodegradation induced by both 3dom and rhs in sample 6 containing isopropanol the degradation involves direct photodegradation and 3dom sensitized indirect photodegradation because rhs are scavenged by isopropanol thereby the degradation rate is similar to that observed with sample 1 according to previous studies 3dom plays a significant role in dom sensitized rhs formation jammoul et al 2009 méndez díaz et al 2014 thereby the importance of 3dom was investigated quenching experiments conducted by addition of sorbic acid a scavenger of triplet excited states showed that sorbic acid strongly depressed the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in estuarine water and ionic strength control samples fig 4 this result suggests that triplet excited estuarine water dom is an important reactive species involved in the photodegradation as o2 is a quencher of 3dom n2 sparging deoxygenation experiments were carried out the results showed that the k values notably increased in n2 saturated estuarine water and synthetic seawater samples figs 2 and 4 combined with the scavenging experimental results upon addition of alcohols it can be concluded that triplet excited estuarine water dom plays a key role both in directly degrading sulfadiazine and in the formation of rhs that further degrade the antibiotic the role of 3dom in the formation of rhs was probed by adopting 4 carboxybenzophenone as dom structure analogue due to its high triplet excited quantum yield li et al 2015 fig s6 shows that in the presence of 4 carboxybenzophenone the k values of sulfadiazine increased when increasing the halides levels from 0 to seawater relevant concentrations quenching experiments conducted with isopropanol and tert butanol indicated that the values for k tert butanol k isopropanol increased when increasing the concentrations of halide ions fig 5 a these results elucidate the importance of rhs for sulfadiazine degradation in the photolytic systems containing 4 carboxybenzophenone and halides to study the importance of triplet excited 4 carboxybenzophenone in the formation of rhs a scavenging experiment with sorbic acid was performed the results showed that the addition of sorbic acid almost completely inhibited the photodegradation in the mixed system containing 4 carboxybenzophenone and halides fig s6 in addition the change of halide concentrations did not obviously affect the reduction in k values in the presence of sorbic acid fig s6 these results indicate that triplet excited 4 carboxybenzophenone was involved in the reaction and played a major role in the formation of rhs a n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment further verified the role of triplet excited 4 carboxybenzophenone in the formation of rhs due to the increasing photodegradation in the absence of o2 a quencher of triplet excited states to see whether other dom analogues show a similar phenomenon of halide specific enhancement of sulfadiazine photodegradation as 4 carboxybenzophenone we further studied the role of four aromatic ketone compounds 2 acetonaphthone acetophenone 3 methoxyacetophenone and benzophenone as representative dom analogues these compounds are usually adopted as excited triplet state precursors to investigate the reactivity of 3dom li et al 2015 wenk et al 2013 in the presence of halide ions obvious variations of photodegradation rates were observed with addition of isopropanol and tert butanol into the solutions of all ketone compounds fig 5b these experiments combined with alcohol quenching experiments conducted in estuarine and synthetic water samples provide strong evidence that triplet excited dom dominates the formation of rhs in estuarine waters as stated previously a charge transfer exciplex of 3dom with halide ions can be generated resulting in the charge separation of 3dom to produce rhs loeff et al 1993 parker and mitch 2016 zhang and parker 2018 1 d o m 3 b r d o m b r 3 b r d o m b r 2 2 d o m 3 c l d o m c l 3 c l d o m c l c l 3 d o m c l 2 3 d o m 3 b r d o m b r 3 c l d o m b r c l 3 d o m b r c l as the exciplex activation free energy of br is lower than that of cl br exciplex is favored as expressed by equation 1 loeff et al 1993 rhs formation by equation 2 may also be an available pathway because of the higher cl concentrations in seawater 675 fold compared to br parker and mitch 2016 it was reported that ternary exciplexes produced by equation 3 are beneficial for the formation of rhs due to the lack of spin orbit coupling for the nascent dihalide radicals resulting in the inhibition of intersystem crossing parker and mitch 2016 in addition these rhs e g cl2 br2 and brcl may also be formed by reaction between halide ions and cl br and cl br can be produced through direct oxidation of halide ions by 3dom 3dom cl br dom cl br cl br cl br cl2 br2 brcl grebel et al 2012 zhang and parker 2018 in comparison to the reaction between 3dom and cl the oxidation of br by 3dom may be favorable due to the relative low reduction potential of br e br br 1 93 as compared to that of cl e cl cl 2 6 hurley et al 1988 therefore in relatively high halide cl br conditions br generated by 3dom oxidation may rapidly react with cl leading to the formation of brcl due to a 675 fold higher cl concentrations in seawater compared to br these results most likely explain the phenomenon that the values for k tert butanol k isopropanol were higher in dom analogue solution containing sea salts compared to photolytic systems containing individual halide ion cl or br as shown in fig 5a as rhs formation should be related to the reduction potentials of 3dom the relationship of the values for k tert butanol k isopropanol with the reduction potentials of the five 3dom sensitizers used in this study was investigated in synthetic water solutions containing individual ketone compound and halides 0 4 m nacl and 0 6 mm nabr as shown in fig 6 there is a good linear correlation r 2 0 75 p 0 05 of lg k tert butanol k isopropanol as a function of the reduction potential of the 3dom sensitizers at estuarine relevant halide concentrations this indicates that relatively high triplet excited reduction potential is in favor of the formation of rhs and provides new insight into the photodegradation of antibiotics in estuarine waters to better understand the role of rhs in the enhanced photodegradation photolytic products of sulfadiazine with an initial concentration of 5 nm in estuarine water were identified by the use of q tof mass spectrometry chlorinated intermediates were not observed in the photolytic system in agreement with previous studies that the reactions of cl2 with many pollutants e g microcystins dienes and thioethers is dominated by oxidation rather than halogen addition grebel et al 2010 hasegawa and neta 1978 parker and mitch 2016 sulfadiazine can be directly oxidized by chlorine radicals leading to the formation of various oxidation products table s4 and fig s7 which are produced by the attack of chlorine radicals towards sulfadiazine s amine and sulfonyl moieties that are easily oxidized e g by 3dom oh and mno2 due to their strong electron donating effect gao et al 2012 li et al 2015 and 2018 however brominated products of sulfadiazine were detected in the estuarine water under irradiation table s4 and fig s7 indicating that the addition reaction of bromine radicals may be enabled by their relatively low oxidation ability li et al 2016 which is supported by vione et al 2005 and 2008 who investigated the photochlorination and photobromination of phenol in the presence of halide ions and fe3 and observed that compared to chlorine radicals brominate radicals are more apt to be addition reaction similar results as those with sulfadiazine were observed by identifying the degradation products of sulfamonomethoxine and sulfamethoxazole in estuarine water samples table s4 figs s8 and s9 these results further demonstrate the importance of rhs in the enhancement of photodegradation from freshwaters to seawaters in this study we unveil that the increased photodegradation of sulfonamides along freshwater to seawater depends on both dom and halide ions in estuarine waters rather than on other seawater salts and photosensitizers e g fe3 and no3 it was reported that rhs produced by the reaction of halide ions with oh may be important in seawater however an oh independent pathway where rhs are generated predominantly via the direct oxidation of halide ions by qinzhou bay estuarine water 3dom was found in this work and this pathway is largely responsible for the halide specific increase in the photodegradation of sulfonamides in estuarine waters these findings indicate that relative to freshwater the seawater estuarine environment is beneficial to the photodegradation of antibiotics which is of importance to the fate assessment of these pollutants in saline waters considering that mariculture activities and river inputs result in estuarine and coastal waters with dom levels that are comparable to or even higher than those in terrestrial water bodies rhs mediated photooxidation may play a key role in the degradation of antibiotics in more saline waters the contribution of rhs in future fate models of antibiotics should be taken into account in estuarine water and coastal water systems 4 conclusion this study found that the photodegradation of sulfonamides was enhanced from the upper to lower reaches of estuarine waters the combined effect of estuarine water dom and halide ions is responsible for the increased photodegradation rather than other seawater salts and photosensitizers e g no3 and fe3 radical quenching experiments conducted by adding alcohols demonstrate that reactive halogen species rhs play a predominant role in the halide specific enhancement of photodegradation kinetic experiments with structural analogues of dom revealed that the formation of rhs can be attributed to the interaction of triplet excited dom 3dom with halide ions and rhs

18735,although photochemical transformation is a major degradation pathway for antibiotics in surface freshwaters the photodegradation of antibiotics from freshwaters downstream into seawater is largely unknown herein sulfadiazine was adopted as a representative antibiotic to probe the alteration of photolytic kinetics along freshwater to seawater sampled from qinzhou bay china the results showed that the photodegradation rate constants of sulfadiazine significantly increased in estuarine waters along freshwaters to seawaters experiments in synthetic water samples with isolated local dissolved organic matter il dom indicated that the increased photodegradation of sulfadiazine is attributed to the integrative effect of both il dom and halide ions radical quenching experiments with tert butanol quenching of oh and isopropanol quenching of both oh and reactive halogen species rhs demonstrated that rhs are largely responsible for the halide specific enhancement in the photodegradation of sulfadiazine rather than other reactive species such as triplet excited il dom and oh however triplet excited il dom was involved in the production of rhs by the oxidation of halide ions by the triplet excited states experiments conducted with dom analogues verified dom sensitized rhs formation and the degradation induced by rhs is positively correlated with the triplet excited reduction potentials of dom analogues these findings are helpful in deeply understanding the transformation of antibiotics and demonstrate the importance of rhs induced degradation in antibiotics fate models in estuarine water systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords reactive halogen species dissolved organic matter triplet excited dom halide ions sulfonamides estuarine waters 1 introduction estuaries are critical ecosystems as they provide spawning and nursery grounds for many aquatic organisms that maintain coastal ecosystem health and serve as the base for offshore fisheries barbier et al 2011 due to riverine transport discharge from land based sources and mariculture activities a mass of micropollutants has been released into estuarine waters among these pollutants antibiotics are of acute concern because they can induce bacteria resistance and resistant genes even at environmental concentrations martínez 2008 zhu et al 2017 it was reported that in 2013 china consumed 53800 tons of antibiotics and most of them finally flowed into estuarine waters zhang et al 2015 antibiotics were frequently detected in estuarine and coastal waters kümmerer 2009 wang et al 2014 xue et al 2013 for example the detection frequencies of 5 sulfonamides were as high as 100 and the total concentrations of 5 sulfonamides ranged from 2 0 to 20 ng l in estuarine and coastal waters of the china qinzhou bay xue et al 2013 assessing the potential risks displayed by these pollutants needs an understanding of the processes that impact their transformation and fate photochemical transformation has been proved to be a central factor in governing the fate of antibiotics in surface waters vione et al 2014 yan and song 2014 in addition to direct photolysis most antibiotics can also be degraded by reactive oxygen species ros e g hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and excited triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3dom in natural waters boreen et al 2005 chen et al 2009 guerard et al 2009 yan and song 2014 wang et al 2018 these photochemical processes can be substantially impacted by the dissolved constituents of natural waters parker et al 2016 parker and mitch 2016 vione et al 2014 especially in estuarine waters the ionic strength halide concentrations and dom characteristics are strongly modified from freshwaters downstream into the seawaters grebel et al 2012 thus it deserves attention to explore the photochemical transformation of antibiotics in estuarine waters so far there have been few studies on the photochemical processes of antibiotics in estuarine waters especially the effects of main dissolved constituents e g cl br and estuarine dom and ionic strength some previous studies have found that photochemical transformation of some organic pollutants was significantly altered in seawaters as compared with freshwaters li et al 2016 parker et al 2013 2016 parker and mitch 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 investigated the effects of dom extracted from coastal waters and found that this dom significantly promoted the photodegradation of sulfonamides compared to freshwater dom parker and co workers 2016a and 2016b observed 3dom can oxidize halide ions to produce reactive halogen species rhs cl br cl2 br2 clbr which increases the indirect photodegradation rates of microcystins domoic acid and dimethyl sulfide in seawaters relative to freshwaters recently we demonstrated that rhs formation by triplet excited micropollutants can also be a possible rhs generation pathway in estuarine waters li et al 2016 however for a huge number of antibiotics the effects of gradient alteration of ionic constituents in estuarine waters on their photodegradation are seldom investigated and the role and contribution of rhs on photodegradation are largely unknown all things taken together we hypothesized that the photodegradation of antibiotics in estuarine waters may be affected by the elevated ionic strength halide concentrations and dom levels and it may be enhanced by the produced rhs therefore the main goal of this study was to investigate the photodegradation of antibiotics in estuarine waters sampled along freshwaters to seawaters and to explore the role of rhs on the degradation herein we adopted sulfadiazine fig s1 as a representative of antibiotics to test our basic hypothesis sulfadiazine was selected as model compound due to its wide use in mariculture and widespread occurrence in estuarine waters wang et al 2014 xue et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 moreover it was detected in estuarine water sampled from china qinzhou bay in this study table s1 to probe the effect of the main dissolved constituents e g cl br and estuarine dom and the role of rhs for modeling antibiotic photodegradation along estuarine water gradients authentic samples were collected along a freshwater to estuarine gradient in qinzhou bay china the photolytic kinetics of sulfonamides in estuarine samples was examined and the contribution of rhs to the photodegradation was evaluated by radical scavenging experiments aromatic ketones as dom analogues were adopted to further probe the role of rhs in the degradation of antibiotics in synthetic water solutions containing halide ions and the relationship of rhs formation with reduction potentials of excited state aromatic ketones was probed the

s2 for each of sampling sites except for 1 8 l water samples were collected for the photolytic experiment 100 l water sampled from 1 was collected so as to isolate estuarine water dom these water samples collected in brown glass bottles 4 l for each of the bottles were temporarily stored in a portable refrigerator until transfer to the laboratory where they were filtered through 0 45 μm glass filters and stored at 20 c until use all the sample pretreatments were carried out within one week after the collection concentrations of inorganic ions dissolved organic carbon doc ph and salinity were measured and the relevant results are listed in table s2 the detailed analytical processes are described in the text s1 of supplementary material the treatment procedures of water samples for the actual concentration measurement of tested sulfonamides in estuarine water are detailed in text s2 of supplementary material a reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis system was adopted to isolate local dom il dom from 90 l filtered estuarine water sample 1 as reported by previous studies huguet et al 2009 vetter et al 2007 wang et al 2018 to test whether the il dom extracted from estuarine water sample 1 can represent the actual structures of dom in this estuarine water uv visible absorption spectrum ratio between the absorbance values at 250 and 365 nm e2 e3 and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 for il dom and estuarine water sample 1 were measured previous studies also employed these parameters to track the relative size of dom molecules and to get a proxy for aromaticity of dom bodhipaksha et al 2015 de laurentiis et al 2013 helms et al 2008 2 3 photodegradation experiments an ocrs px32t merry go round photoreactor kaifeng hxsei science instrument factory china containing reaction solutions in quartz tubes 1 7 cm inner diameter 16 cm height 35 ml volume was applied in the photochemical experiments a 500 w hg lamp with 290 nm cut off filters was used as the light source the light intensity λ 290 500 nm in the center of the tubes was 3 2 10 5 ein l 1 s 1 determined by chemical actinometry method dulin and mill 1982 and the detailed processes are provided in text s3 of supplementary material the light source was surrounded by a water refrigerated quartz jacket maintaining a temperature of around 25 c for the irradiation solutions this temperature was slightly higher 1 2 c than that of dark control tubes wrapped with aluminium foil in the photoreactor both synthetic water solutions and estuarine water samples were used in the photolytic experiments phosphate buffer 10 mm was used to control the ph of synthetic water solutions and their ph agreed with the ph of estuarine water samples phosphate buffer was usually used as ph control reagent in seawater photochemical experiments parker et al 2016 parker and mitch 2016 for all photodegradation kinetic experiments photolytic solution volume in a quartz tube was 25 ml the initial concentrations of each target compound were 5 μm 62 5 μl from respective 2 0 mm stock solutions unless otherwise mentioned aliquots 0 5 ml were periodically sampled from the test tubes all the experiments were performed in triplicate to probe the effects of halide ions on the direct photodegradation of sulfadiazine experiments were carried out by spiking halides with various concentrations 0 05 m cl 0 08 mm br 0 1 m cl 0 15 mm br 0 2 m cl 0 3 mm br 0 4 m cl 0 6 mm br 0 54 m cl 0 8 mm br to pure water for a total volume of 25 ml cl concentrations were obtained by addition of various amounts of solid nacl and various br concentrations were obtained by addition of various volumes of nabr from a stock solution 0 2 m these salts were also added into the estuarine water sample 1 freshwater sample to examine the effects of halide ions on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in real water moreover il dom was applied to probe the effect of estuarine water dom on photodegradation in synthetic water solutions with halide ions which was performed by spiking 20 mg c l il dom 1 8 ml from a 278 mg c l concentrated solution from estuarine water sample 1 to synthetic water solutions meanwhile sodium perchlorate with various concentrations corresponding to those of cl was used to explore the effect of ionic strength on the photodegradation to investigate the role of rhs in the degradation of sulfadiazine rhs quenchers isopropanol and tert butanol were employed due to their different reactivity for rhs quenching was carried out by addition of 477 μl pure isopropanol 250 mm or 59 μl pure tert butanol 25 mm to synthetic water solutions it has been reported that tert butanol is a poor rhs quencher but a good oh quencher while isopropanol can effectively quench both oh and rhs parker et al 2016 thereby the difference for the quenching by the two alcohols can be used to single out the contribution of rhs five aromatic ketones i e 4 carboxybenzophenone 2 acetonaphthone 4 methoxyacetophenone benzophenone and acetophenone as dom analogues were used to probe the role of dom in the formation of rhs in the synthetic water solutions containing halides each ketone compound at 20 mg c l 30 35 46 32 and 52 μl from respective 100 mm stock solutions of 4 carboxybenzophenone 2 acetonaphthone 4 methoxyacetophenone benzophenone and acetophenone corresponding to the estuarine water dom level was spiked into synthetic water solutions for a total volume of 25 ml 2 4 analytical methods the target compounds with their initial concentrations of 5 1 and 0 2 μm under different degradation times were determined by an agilent 1260 hplc with diode array detector and zorbax eclipse xdb c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm the mobile phase composition detection wavelength and flow rate for these compounds are listed in table s3 for 5 nm initial concentration of sulfonamides the concentrations under different irradiation times were measured by a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a 6410b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer a waters c18 column 2 1 100 mm 3 5 μm was employed the mobile phase consists of 95 a 0 1 formic acid solution v v with 1 g l ammonium formate and 5 b acetonitrile the elution program was as follows 0 3 min 5 b 15 min 88 b analysis was operated with an electrospray ionization esi source in multiple reaction monitoring mode the precursor ions quantification ions and mass spectrometry conditions are listed in table s1 the real concentrations of the tested sulfonamides in estuarine waters were also measured with a 6410b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and the analytical conditions were the same as those of the method mentioned above to probe the role of rhs in the degradation of sulfonamides based on their photolytic products a 340 nm cut off filter was employed to prevent the direct photodegradation of sulfonamides photolytic products of the tested sulfonamides were identified by an agilent 1290 uhplc with an ab sciex 6600 q tof mass spectrometer and the detailed analytical method is provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolytic kinetics of sulfadiazine in estuarine waters in the dark controls no obvious loss of sulfadiazine was observed in pure water synthetic water solutions containing the main water constituents and estuarine water samples implying that removal from other pathways such as adsorption or biodegradation hydrolysis was negligible in our experimental processes linear regression of ln c t c 0 vs time t showed that the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in these solutions followed pseudo first order kinetics r 0 97 p 0 05 as can be seen from fig 1 the k values for sulfadiazine at an initial concentration of 5 μm in waters with relatively high salinities e g estuarine water 6 were generally higher p 0 05 than those in waters with low salinities photodegradation of sulfadiazine as a function of its initial concentration was also investigated although relatively low concentration was in favor of photodegradation for all concentrations the phenomenon that photodegradation was enhanced in estuarine water along freshwater to seawater was consistent as shown in fig s3a even at estuarine relevant concentration of sulfadiazine 5 nm the enhancement of photodegradation in estuarine water samples from 1 to 6 was still observed to test whether other antibiotics have a similar photodegradation result as sulfadiazine sulfamonomethoxine and sulfamethoxazole that were frequently detected in estuarine waters were selected figs s3b and 3c showed that for the two antibiotics relatively high salinity was also beneficial for photodegradation in estuarine water samples these results indicate that the effects of the different water matrices on the k values agree for the different antibiotics and general rules can be potentially derived with respect to the variation of k values in different water matrices for different antibiotics to our knowledge this is the first report of the photodegradation kinetics of antibiotics in different estuarine waters in the following section 5 μm sulfadiazine was employed to isolate the importance of dissolved components for the photodegradation in estuarine waters 3 2 isolation of the effect of dissolved components on sulfadiazine photodegradation it was reported that many dissolved components such as dom halide ions no3 and fe3 can influence the photodegradation of organic pollutants vione et al 2014 parker et al 2016 to isolate the effect of water matrices on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine the main dissolved components of estuarine samples were measured and the results are listed in table s1 we employed isolated local dom il dom from estuarine water sample 1 to investigate the effect of estuarine water dom on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine as shown in fig s4 the uv visible absorption spectrums of il dom and estuarine water sample 1 were similar moreover the determined values of e2 e3 5 23 and 5 09 and suva254 0 71 and 0 70 l mgc 1 m 1 for il dom and estuarine water sample 1 were comparable respectively these results imply that il dom can represent the actual estuarine water dom fig 2 shows that the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was obviously enhanced in the presence of il dom as compared to pure water moreover the role of estuarine dom on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was also explored by diluting the estuarine water sample 1 and amending the sample with salts detected in estuarine waters to their initial concentration levels our results showed that the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was gradually enhanced when increasing the concentrations of estuarine water dom fig s5 these results are in agreement with the study by wang et al 2018 who examined the effect of dom extracted from bohai bay of china on sulfonamides photodegradation and observed an enhancement effect of dom on photodegradation these results indicate that the dom in estuarine waters plays an important role in the photodegradation of sulfonamides the effect of halide ions alone on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was evaluated by spiking halides and or sodium perchlorate into pure water compared to the photodegradation rates of sulfadiazine in pure water the addition of halides increased the photodegradation rate constants table 1 it has been reported that the effects of halide ions alone on the photodegradation of organic pollutants contain ionic strength effects and specific halide ion effects li et al 2016 parker et al 2013 naclo4 was adopted to study the effects of ionic strength on the photodegradation of sulfadiazine because clo4 is inert in photochemical processes under circumneutral conditions it can be seen from table 1 that in synthetic water samples containing various salts alone the k values of sulfadiazine slightly increased from 3 25 0 12 10 2 to 4 60 0 04 10 2 h 1 when increasing naclo4 concentrations from 0 to 0 54 m under a certain ionic strength condition the k values in pure water containing naclo4 were comparable to those in the presence of halides for example at 0 4 m ionic strength the values of k were 4 47 0 30 10 2 4 59 0 04 10 2 4 69 0 05 10 2 and 4 54 0 09 10 2 h 1 in synthetic water solutions containing 0 4 m cl 0 4 m clo4 0 4 m cl 0 6 mm br or 0 4 m clo4 0 6 mm br respectively these results suggest that the ionic strength plays a predominant role to enhance the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in the presence of halides a similar phenomenon was also observed by li et al 2016 who investigated the effect of ionic strength on the photodegradation of some sulfonamides i e sulfapyridine sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole and found that the steady state concentration of triplet excited sulfonamides increased in synthetic naclo4 water solutions without dom and promoted their photodegradation this mostly explains the enhancing effect of ionic strength for sulfadiazine photodegradation because the triplet excited state is also involved in the direct photodegradation of sulfadiazine boreen et al 2005 li et al 2015 the synthetic water containing il dom and halides was employed to investigate the influence of halide ions on sulfadiazine photodegradation fig 2 shows that in the presence of il dom the photodegradation rates increased from 4 40 0 18 10 2 to 15 61 0 16 10 2 h 1 when the concentration of halides was increased from 0 to seawater relevant concentrations 0 54 m nacl 0 8 mm nabr this increase of k values was much higher than that of the solutions only containing halides as indicated by table 1 in estuarine water sample 1 the k value also significantly increased with addition of halides at seawater relevant concentrations of halides the k value of sulfadiazine was 1 6 fold higher than in estuarine water sample 1 without addition of halides fig 3 as stated previously the relatively high ionic strength is propitious to slow down the decay of 3dom and to increase its steady state concentration parker et al 2013 however a comparable value of k was observed in estuarine water sample 1 with or without addition of naclo4 fig 3 indicating that the ionic strength effect does not explain the increased photodegradation from these observations it can be inferred that specific halide ion effects most likely explain the enhancement of sulfadiazine photodegradation in dom containing estuarine waters from freshwaters to seawaters to probe the role of other seawater ionic components estuarine water sample 1 with addition of major seawater ions 400 mm nacl 0 8 mm nabr 54 mm mgcl2 29 mm na2so4 11 mm cacl2 10 mm kcl 0 35 mm h3bo3 1 8 mm naco3 and 0 26 mm naco3 was used in comparison to photodegradation by amending the estuarine water sample 1 with halides the addition of major seawater ions did not further influence the photodegadation which indicates that among seawater ions halide ions play a crucial role in the increased photodegradation of sulfadiazine since the estuarine water samples used in this study contain the sensitizer no3 that produces oh under irradiation the effect of no3 on sulfadiazine photodegradation was evaluated by spiking no3 into estuarine water samples in particular no3 was adopted at concentrations relevant to those analyzed in the estuarine waters as shown in fig 3 the addition of no3 into the estuarine water sample 1 did not obviously alter the k values in the absence presence of halides the effect of fe3 oh sensitizer on the photodegradation in estuarine water was also examined although fe3 was not detected in these water samples similar results as those with no3 were observed by adding fe3 into the estuarine water sample 1 fig 3 previous studies reported that many dissolved components such as dom cl br and hco3 can effectively quench oh grebel et al 2010 li et al 2018 vione et al 2013 2014 and this may be the cause of the negligible role of no3 parker et al 2016 similarly observed that no3 in saline water did not notably impact the photodegradation of microcystins therefore the enhanced photodegradation of sulfadiazine from freshwaters to saline waters can be mainly ascribed to the effect of estuarine water dom and halide ions 3 3 mechanism for 3dom mediated rhs formation as indicated by table s2 the concentrations of dom in the estuarine waters from 1 to 6 were comparable which indicates that estuarine water dom alone cannot account for the observed enhancement of the photodegradation of sulfadiazine under the studied experimental conditions it has been reported that in saline waters 3dom direct oxidation of halide ions may be an important route for the formation of rhs that impacts the indirect photodegradation of many micropollutants jammoul et al 2009 parker and mitch 2016 zhang and parker 2018 therefore we postulated that rhs may also be produced in our estuarine water samples and dominate the halide specific enhancement of il dom sensitized photodegradation of sulfadiazine to test this hypothesis radical scavenging experiments by spiking isopropanol and tert butanol into synthetic and estuarine water samples were carried out these scavengers can react with oh rapidly with second order rate constants of 2 3 109 m 1 s 1 for isopropanol and 6 108 m 1 s 1 for tert butanol whereas their second order rate constants with rhs span 2 3 orders of magnitude 1 2 105 and 7 0 102 m 1 s 1 for reaction of isopropanol and tert butanol with cl2 respectively 6 6 106 and 1 4 104 m 1 s 1 for reaction of isopropanol and tert butanol with br respectively buxton et al 1988 hasegawa and neta 1978 merenyi and lind 1994 zhang and parker 2018 hence the role of rhs can be distinguished from that of oh by comparison of the reduction of sulfadiazine photodegradation rates in the presence of isopropanol vs tert butanol fig 4 shows that in estuarine water sample 1 lowest salinity the addition of tert butanol and isopropanol reduced the values of k by 12 and 16 respectively whereas 13 and 38 respective reductions in photodegradation rates were observed in estuarine water sample 6 highest salinity this indicates that by comparing the overall photodegradation in estuarine waters the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was partially retarded in the presence of alcohols especially in estuarine water sample 1 freshwater only around 10 depression of photodegradation was observed previous studies reported that in surface waters 3dom plays a crucial role in the photodegradation of sulfonamides boreen et al 2005 li et al 2015 and 2018 which suggests that 3dom was also involved in the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in estuarine waters this was supported by the sorbic acid a quencher of triplet excited states quenching experiment in which the photodegradation of sulfadiazine was almost completely inhibited in estuarine waters fig 4 although 3dom alone is an important participant in estuarine water photodegradation rhs may play a pivotal role in the enhancement of sulfadiazine photodegradation along freshwaters to seawaters it can be seen from fig 4 that the difference in the k values for the estuarine water sample 6 with addition of tert butanol and isopropanol k tert butanol k isopropanol was approximately 7 fold higher than that of estuarine water sample 1 under ionic strength control by adding naclo4 into estuarine water sample 1 there was no obvious variation in the k values with addition of tert butanol and isopropanol respectively these results demonstrate the importance of rhs in the halide specific enhancement of photodegradation in saline waters in synthetic seawater containing both il dom and halides quenching by isopropanol and tert butanol resulted in a decrease of k values by 47 and 7 respectively fig 2 which agrees with the alcohols scavenging experiment conducted in estuarine water sample 6 as shown in fig 4 this implies that il dom sensitized rhs formation may be responsible for the increased photodegradation of sulfadiazine in addition the photodegradation rate in estuarine water sample 6 containing isopropanol was comparable with that of pristine estuarine water sample 1 fig 4 as listed in table s2 il dom and no3 are the main photosensitizers in estuarine waters and il dom concentrations in estuarine water samples 1 and 6 were comparable in water sample 1 degradation of sulfadiazine consists of direct photodegradation and 3dom sensitized indirect photodegradation and in water sample 6 the degradation is via direct photodegradation and indirect photodegradation induced by both 3dom and rhs in sample 6 containing isopropanol the degradation involves direct photodegradation and 3dom sensitized indirect photodegradation because rhs are scavenged by isopropanol thereby the degradation rate is similar to that observed with sample 1 according to previous studies 3dom plays a significant role in dom sensitized rhs formation jammoul et al 2009 méndez díaz et al 2014 thereby the importance of 3dom was investigated quenching experiments conducted by addition of sorbic acid a scavenger of triplet excited states showed that sorbic acid strongly depressed the photodegradation of sulfadiazine in estuarine water and ionic strength control samples fig 4 this result suggests that triplet excited estuarine water dom is an important reactive species involved in the photodegradation as o2 is a quencher of 3dom n2 sparging deoxygenation experiments were carried out the results showed that the k values notably increased in n2 saturated estuarine water and synthetic seawater samples figs 2 and 4 combined with the scavenging experimental results upon addition of alcohols it can be concluded that triplet excited estuarine water dom plays a key role both in directly degrading sulfadiazine and in the formation of rhs that further degrade the antibiotic the role of 3dom in the formation of rhs was probed by adopting 4 carboxybenzophenone as dom structure analogue due to its high triplet excited quantum yield li et al 2015 fig s6 shows that in the presence of 4 carboxybenzophenone the k values of sulfadiazine increased when increasing the halides levels from 0 to seawater relevant concentrations quenching experiments conducted with isopropanol and tert butanol indicated that the values for k tert butanol k isopropanol increased when increasing the concentrations of halide ions fig 5 a these results elucidate the importance of rhs for sulfadiazine degradation in the photolytic systems containing 4 carboxybenzophenone and halides to study the importance of triplet excited 4 carboxybenzophenone in the formation of rhs a scavenging experiment with sorbic acid was performed the results showed that the addition of sorbic acid almost completely inhibited the photodegradation in the mixed system containing 4 carboxybenzophenone and halides fig s6 in addition the change of halide concentrations did not obviously affect the reduction in k values in the presence of sorbic acid fig s6 these results indicate that triplet excited 4 carboxybenzophenone was involved in the reaction and played a major role in the formation of rhs a n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment further verified the role of triplet excited 4 carboxybenzophenone in the formation of rhs due to the increasing photodegradation in the absence of o2 a quencher of triplet excited states to see whether other dom analogues show a similar phenomenon of halide specific enhancement of sulfadiazine photodegradation as 4 carboxybenzophenone we further studied the role of four aromatic ketone compounds 2 acetonaphthone acetophenone 3 methoxyacetophenone and benzophenone as representative dom analogues these compounds are usually adopted as excited triplet state precursors to investigate the reactivity of 3dom li et al 2015 wenk et al 2013 in the presence of halide ions obvious variations of photodegradation rates were observed with addition of isopropanol and tert butanol into the solutions of all ketone compounds fig 5b these experiments combined with alcohol quenching experiments conducted in estuarine and synthetic water samples provide strong evidence that triplet excited dom dominates the formation of rhs in estuarine waters as stated previously a charge transfer exciplex of 3dom with halide ions can be generated resulting in the charge separation of 3dom to produce rhs loeff et al 1993 parker and mitch 2016 zhang and parker 2018 1 d o m 3 b r d o m b r 3 b r d o m b r 2 2 d o m 3 c l d o m c l 3 c l d o m c l c l 3 d o m c l 2 3 d o m 3 b r d o m b r 3 c l d o m

an available pathway because of the higher cl concentrations in seawater 675 fold compared to br parker and mitch 2016 it was reported that ternary exciplexes produced by equation 3 are beneficial for the formation of rhs due to the lack of spin orbit coupling for the nascent dihalide radicals resulting in the inhibition of intersystem crossing parker and mitch 2016 in addition these rhs e g cl2 br2 and brcl may also be formed by reaction between halide ions and cl br and cl br can be produced through direct oxidation of halide ions by 3dom 3dom cl br dom cl br cl br cl br cl2 br2 brcl grebel et al 2012 zhang and parker 2018 in comparison to the reaction between 3dom and cl the oxidation of br by 3dom may be favorable due to the relative low reduction potential of br e br br 1 93 as compared to that of cl e cl cl 2 6 hurley et al 1988 therefore in relatively high halide cl br conditions br generated by 3dom oxidation may rapidly react with cl leading to the formation of brcl due to a 675 fold higher cl concentrations in seawater compared to br these results most likely explain the phenomenon that the values for k tert butanol k isopropanol were higher in dom analogue solution containing sea salts compared to photolytic systems containing individual halide ion cl or br as shown in fig 5a as rhs formation should be related to the reduction potentials of 3dom the relationship of the values for k tert butanol k isopropanol with the reduction potentials of the five 3dom sensitizers used in this study was investigated in synthetic water solutions containing individual ketone compound and halides 0 4 m nacl and 0 6 mm nabr as shown in fig 6 there is a good linear correlation r 2 0 75 p 0 05 of lg k tert butanol k isopropanol as a function of the reduction potential of the 3dom sensitizers at estuarine relevant halide concentrations this indicates that relatively high triplet excited reduction potential is in favor of the formation of rhs and provides new insight into the photodegradation of antibiotics in estuarine waters to better understand the role of rhs in the enhanced photodegradation photolytic products of sulfadiazine with an initial concentration of 5 nm in estuarine water were identified by the use of q tof mass spectrometry chlorinated intermediates were not observed in the photolytic system in agreement with previous studies that the reactions of cl2 with many pollutants e g microcystins dienes and thioethers is dominated by oxidation rather than halogen addition grebel et al 2010 hasegawa and neta 1978 parker and mitch 2016 sulfadiazine can be directly oxidized by chlorine radicals leading to the formation of various oxidation products table s4 and fig s7 which are produced by the attack of chlorine radicals towards sulfadiazine s amine and sulfonyl moieties that are easily oxidized e g by 3dom oh and mno2 due to their strong electron donating effect gao et al 2012 li et al 2015 and 2018 however brominated products of sulfadiazine were detected in the estuarine water under irradiation table s4 and fig s7 indicating that the addition reaction of bromine radicals may be enabled by their relatively low oxidation ability li et al 2016 which is supported by vione et al 2005 and 2008 who investigated the photochlorination and photobromination of phenol in the presence of halide ions and fe3 and observed that compared to chlorine radicals brominate radicals are more apt to be addition reaction similar results as those with sulfadiazine were observed by identifying the degradation products of sulfamonomethoxine and sulfamethoxazole in estuarine water samples table s4 figs s8 and s9 these results further demonstrate the importance of rhs in the enhancement of photodegradation from freshwaters to seawaters in this study we unveil that the increased photodegradation of sulfonamides along freshwater to seawater depends on both dom and halide ions in estuarine waters rather than on other seawater salts and photosensitizers e g fe3 and no3 it was reported that rhs produced by the reaction of halide ions with oh may be important in seawater however an oh independent pathway where rhs are generated predominantly via the direct oxidation of halide ions by qinzhou bay estuarine water 3dom was found in this work and this pathway is largely responsible for the halide specific increase in the photodegradation of sulfonamides in estuarine waters these findings indicate that relative to freshwater the seawater estuarine environment is beneficial to the photodegradation of antibiotics which is of importance to the fate assessment of these pollutants in saline waters considering that mariculture activities and river inputs result in estuarine and coastal waters with dom levels that are comparable to or even higher than those in terrestrial water bodies rhs mediated photooxidation may play a key role in the degradation of antibiotics in more saline waters the contribution of rhs in future fate models of antibiotics should be taken into account in estuarine water and coastal water systems 4 conclusion this study found that the photodegradation of sulfonamides was enhanced from the upper to lower reaches of estuarine waters the combined effect of estuarine water dom and halide ions is responsible for the increased photodegradation rather than other seawater salts and photosensitizers e g no3 and fe3 radical quenching experiments conducted by adding alcohols demonstrate that reactive halogen species rhs play a predominant role in the halide specific enhancement of photodegradation kinetic experiments with structural analogues of dom revealed that the formation of rhs can be attributed to the interaction of triplet excited dom 3dom with halide ions and rhs formation is positively correlated with the reduction potentials of 3dom declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18736,forward osmosis fo has been adopted to treat complex wastewater such as landfill leachate due to its high rejection of organics in this study the in line adsorptive process using biochar bc or powdered activated carbon pac was applied to a cross flow fo system to enhance the mitigation of the fo membrane fouling from landfill leachate the changes in the leachate composition along the treatments were tracked by excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac to identify tryptophan like c1 fulvic like c2 and humic like c3 components after a single operation of fo the c1 was found to be the main constituent responsible for membrane fouling irrespective of varying operation conditions regarding draw solute concentrations and flow rates both sorbents i e bc and pac exhibited the preferential removal behavior towards c1 c2 c3 which was well supported by their individual adsorption isotherm model parameters the addition of in line adsorption treatment to fo resulted in substantial improvements in the filtered volume 57 and the flux recovery 80 compared to the single fo operation without chemical cleaning of membrane the flux was fully recovered at a dose of 10 g l bc or 0 3 g l of pac a significant and negative correlation was found between the flux recovery and the c1 of the feed leachate or the corresponding spectral peak intensity p 0 05 for the integrated fo system suggesting the potential of using on line fluorescence monitoring for the performance of the integrated system in terms of fouling mitigation this study provided a new insight into the effectiveness of bc or pac adsorption as the in line integration with an fo system for the targeted removal of fo membrane foulants in landfill leachate graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis biochar membrane fouling eem parafac adsorption 1 introduction cumulative disposal of municipal solid wastes into landfills is accompanied by the unavoidable production of tremendous amounts of undesirable landfill leachate encompassing a range of persistent contaminants jovanov et al 2018 kjeldsen et al 2002 untreated leachate may pose serious hazards to the surrounding environment requiring prompt and efficient action with suitable treatments silva et al 2004 with the growing age of landfills leachate tends to be enriched with non biodegradable organics such as humic substances which deteriorate the performance of the low cost biological treatments da costa et al 2018 kulikowska and klimiuk 2008 in this regard many physio chemical treatments including coagulation adsorption and advanced oxidation processes have been proposed and studied for the effective removal liu et al 2015 renou et al 2008 however these physiochemical treatments alone are insufficient for complete removal of diverse organics from leachate deng et al 2018 silva et al 2004 to overcome such limitations the integration of these treatments has been proposed in many previous studies aftab and hur 2018 li et al 2010 oloibiri et al 2017 2015 although membrane filtration processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been successfully employed as the substitutes to produce high quality effluent chaudhari and murthy 2010 di palma et al 2002 their operation under high trans membrane pressure eventually raises the operational cost and is accompanied by severe organic membrane fouling these issues may require more frequent maintenance or even the replacement of the whole membrane assemblies šír et al 2012 zularisam et al 2006 from an economic point of view the forward osmosis fo process is superior to nf or the ro treatments owing to its numerous advantages which include the high rejection for organic and inorganic pollutants no requirement for externally aided hydraulic pressure and a lower extent of membrane fouling with good reversibility iskander et al 2017 lee et al 2010 the fo process is based on the principle of the water permeation across a semi permeable membrane driven by the difference in the osmotic potential gradient between feed water and draw solution cath et al 2006 recently fo has been successfully applied in the direct concentration of the complex and high strength wastewater streams such as textile wastewater han et al 2016 drilling mud from oil refining hickenbottom et al 2013 landfill leachate iskander et al 2017 qin et al 2016 and domestic wastewater aftab et al 2017 2015 fo has also proved its excellent applicability in treating landfill leachate for the recovery of inorganics the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons and the water recovery from high saline and biologically treated leachates dong et al 2014 iskander et al 2017 li et al 2017 qin et al 2016 wu et al 2018 however despite a number of such practical applications no attention has been paid to the organic fouling potential of landfill leachate in fo which serves as a critical factor to determine the operational cost and water recovery a great deal of effort has gone to mitigate the conventional pressure driven i e uf and nf membrane fouling of landfill leachate the most common practice for the effort has been the integration of physio chemical pretreatments with membrane operation which have been based on coagulation flocculation dolar et al 2016 mariam and nghiem 2010 magnetic ion exchange resins miex singh et al 2012 and powdered activated carbon pac dolar et al 2016 ince et al 2010 among these common pretreatment options pac has received the most attention due to several advantages of its in line use with membrane filtration campinas and rosa 2010 the improved scouring of the membrane cake layer the enhanced mitigation of irreversible fouling huang et al 2017 and the removal of viruses oh et al 2007 recently biochars bcs have emerged as a promising substitute for pac with the additional benefits of their environmental sustainability ahmad et al 2013 2012 low production cost equivalent to one tenth of the pac s and improvement in agricultural land fertility and carbon sequestration upon the disposal furthermore bcs comprise additional cationic functional groups in their structures which makes it easy to modify the surface properties to improve the functions rajapaksha et al 2016 yang et al 2019 although there were several previous examples using pac or bcs for the pretreatments to the conventional membrane filtration shankar et al 2017 kim et al 2019 no effort has gone to date to explore their viability for the in line applications to fo system which warrants further investigations to prove enhanced performance of fo with the additional treatment size exclusion chromatography sec and excitation emission matrix in tandem with the parallel factor analysis eem parafac are the two renowned tools for dissolved organic matter dom analyses in tracking organic foulants in various membrane filtration systems ly et al 2018a c fan et al 2017 kennedy et al 2005 fan et al 2017 however to the best of the authors knowledge there is no study employing such advanced tools to examine the organic foulants of landfill leachate in fo systems in this study a lab scale cross flow fo system was optimized for the treatment of stabilized landfill leachate using nacl as a draw solute at varying cross flow velocities and draw solute concentrations and the in line applicability of pac or bc for the fo system was further explored this study specifically aimed to a track the behaviors of different constituents of landfill leachate in the fo system using sec and eem parafac b examine the pretreatment performances of bc and pac for targeted removal of main membrane foulants and c evaluate the feasibility of the bc or pac adsorption as the in line treatments to fo in terms of membrane fouling mitigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of landfill leachate and its basic characteristics a landfill leachate sample 40 l was collected from sudokwon municipal landfill site located in the vicinity of incheon city south korea with the covered area of 19 km2 after 8 years of operation this landfill was discontinued in 2000 the sample was collected in june 2018 in acid cleaned 20 l plastic containers from an onsite stabilizing tank it was immediately filtered through pre ashed whatman gf f glass fiber filter 0 7 μm and stored in the dark at 4 c the basic water quality of the leachate is shown in table s1 2 2 fo system setup and the configuration a lab scale fo system was set up in cross flow mode for the treatment of stabilized landfill leachate the fo system has an effective membrane area of 22 cm2 with a configuration of the active membrane layer facing the feed solution al fs fig s1 a cellulose triacetate cta membrane purchased from fluid technology solution inc ftsh2o albany usa was used for the setup sodium chloride solution 99 0 nacl sigma aldrich was used as a draw solute ds with the initial volume of 300 ml to maintain the initial ds concentration concentrated draw solute cds 5 m nacl was dosed into the draw tank using an online ec controller jishen china connected to a peristaltic pump ems tech korea fig s1 the feed and the draw solutions were circulated in the external fo membrane module by using separate peristaltic pumps ems tech korea the flow rate was adjusted and measured by a flow meter dwyer usa all experiments were performed at room temperature 25 c 2 3 batch adsorption experiments using pac and bc adsorption experiments using bc or pac were conducted in 50 ml vials with a working volume of 30 ml the pac a mesh size of 100 and the granular bc feedstock southern pine soft wood were purchased from sigma aldrich and wakefield columbia respectively the bc was heated in oven at 120 c for 6 h ground into powder sieved to obtain the similar size to pac and stored in a closed bottle for adsorption isotherm experiments different amounts of bc 0 50 g l or pac 0 3 5 g l or were added into the vials containing a constant concentration 180 mg c l of landfill leachate the vials were then set for agitation on a horizontal shaker at 150 rpm for 24 h the ph of each sample was kept at ph 7 during the experiments by adding 5 n hcl or 5 n naoh every 4 h the neutral ph was preferred because the results could be comparable with those in the other literature iskander et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 xu et al 2018 after adsorption the samples were filtered with 0 45 μm pre rinsed cta filter 47 mm advantac and stored for further analyses adsorption kinetics experiments were also performed following the same procedure above except for using a fixed dose of bc or pac bc dose 30 g l pac dose 2 g l adsorption parameters were estimated based on the freundlich isotherm model q e k f c e 1 n where qe mg c g and ce mg l are the adsorbed amount of landfill leachate per dosed grams of bc or pac and the leachate concentration in solution respectively at equilibrium the parameters kf and 1 n represent the adsorption capacity and site heterogeneity factor respectively 2 4 forward osmosis experiments a series of filtration runs were performed to optimize the fo system at varying ds concentrations and cross flow velocities or flow rates the concentration 180 mg c l and the ph of feed solution ph 7 were kept constant for each operation after the end of each run 12 h the treated and the concentrated samples from the ds and the feed tank respectively were collected and passed through the 0 45 μm pre rinsed cta filter the addition of the concentrated draw solution into the draw tank was taken into account to calculate the final filtered volume the conductivity of the final concentrate was measured using a conductivity meter sc 82 yokogawa membrane flux jw was calculated as follows j w 1 a m δ v t δ t where am is the effective membrane area and δvt is the changes in the weight reading at the time interval δt the integrated fo system with bc or pac was operated at an optimized condition of flow rate and ds concentration required amounts of pac or bc were dosed into the feed tank and the tank was continuously agitated with a magnetic stirrer to achieve an adequate adsorption of landfill leachate on bc or pac the same fo setup but without the addition of bc or pac was also run for the reference all the experiments were conducted in duplicate i e two repeated filtration before each run the whole fo system was flushed with distilled and deionized water ddw 2 5 membrane resistance analysis and flux recovery experiments after each filtration run 12 h the feed tank was filled with ddw and the membrane flux jo was calculated for 60 min using the same draw solution i e 0 5 m nacl the ddw was circulated with an elevated speed of 600 ml min for 30 min on the side of the feed solution to physically clean the membrane which by the loose cake layer was extracted from the membrane surface the extracted solution 50 ml was denoted as reversible re foulant after the filtration with 0 45 μm cta filter im et al 2018 the recovered flux jp after physical cleaning i e jp was calculated again for another 60 min run next the fo membrane was detached from the module and soaked in 50 ml of 0 1 m naoh solution for 30 min to chemically clean the membrane the extracted solution was then neutralized by adding 5 m hcl solution to obtain the irreversible ir foulants the membrane was rinsed with ddw and placed back into the cell to calculate the membrane flux with ddw for 60 min which was equivalent to the recovered flux jc after chemical cleaning more information for fo membrane flux recovery experiments is available in the literature gao et al 2018 resistance analysis of the fo membrane was performed based on poiseulle s law using the following equations siddiqui et al 2018 f l u

flux jc after chemically cleaning the membrane using 0 1 m naoh 2 6 bulk parameters and spectroscopic analyses for leachate bulk leachate samples were quantified in terms of dissolved organic carbon

results and discussion 3 1 identification of different fluorescent components from landfill leachate three different fluorescent components were confirmed by the parafac modeling on the entire eem dataset of this study fig 1 component 1 c1 showed the primary and the secondary peaks at 230 nm and 280 nm ex respectively and at 335 nm em while the peaks of component 2 c2 were positioned at 240 nm and 310 nm ex and at 410 nm em component 3 c3 displayed three peaks at 250 nm 305 nm and 365 nm ex and at 458 nm em the loading plots of the three identified components are shown in fig s3 these three were comparable to those previously reported for landfill leachate aftab et al 2018 aftab and hur 2018 jung et al 2017 oloibiri et al 2017 based on the previous literature c1 can be associated with tryptophan like component which consists of hydrolyzed aromatic amino acids oloibiri et al 2017 renou et al 2008 or xenobiotic organics in landfill leachate baker and curry 2004 c2 and c3 presented the similar features to fulvic like and humic like components respectively ballesteros et al 2017 jung et al 2017 based on the location ex em of each primary peak the amw of the individual fluorescent components were estimated using the sec analysis and the value was higher in the order of c1 c2 c3 fig 1 this trend was consistent with the previous studies reporting that the fluorescence peaks of dom at longer em were closely linked with larger molecular size hur and kim 2009 lee et al 2015 and or with more hydrophobic nature ishii and boyer 2012 wu et al 2003 from the current results the components of c1 c2 and c3 can be assigned as low molecular weight lmw intermediate mw imw and high mw hmw fluorescent components respectively fig 1 3 2 fo operation at different conditions and the corresponding membrane fouling 3 2 1 membrane permeability and flux recovery at different conditions varying ds concentrations alter its osmotic pressure or driving force while recirculation flow rates affect the membrane permeability in fo systems johnson et al 2018 in this study increasing trends were observed for both the initial flux and the total water recovered from leachate with a higher ds concentration fig 2 a which suggested the development of the higher osmotic potential difference at elevated ds levels for example the initial flux was 4 lmh 8 lmh and 10 lmh and the recovered water volume reached 92 ml 116 ml and 140 ml at the ds concentration of 0 5 m 1 5 m and 3 0 m respectively fig 2a the results agreed with a recent study of gao et al 2018 reporting a good linear relationship r2 0 96 between ds concentrations and the initial flux for a fo system treating sewage sludge in the current study with increasing recirculation flow rates of the fs and ds the total filtered volume was also elevated with the recovered water volume of 10 2 ml 116 4 ml and 153 7 ml at 50 ml min 150 ml min and 300 ml min flow rate respectively these results signified the importance of the contact time for the ds or the feed solution fs with fo membrane in the process fig 2b irrespective of the different conditions the membrane flux tended to decline with operation time this observation has been attributed to either the increase in osmotic pressure or the feed leachate concentrations followed by the development of fouling cake layer on membrane surface li et al 2017 in the present work the former explanation can be excluded because a large difference in the conductivity was maintained between the ds and the fs even after the fs was fully concentrated thus the decline in the flux is more likely to result from membrane fouling gao et al 2018 meanwhile the membrane flux was more stable and the flux recovery was greater with a lower ds concentration fig 2a and c which can be explained by the lower permeation drag of the solutes in landfill leachate toward membrane as a result of its lower initial membrane flux ang and elimelech 2008 zhao et al 2016 in contrast the leachate treated at the higher ds concentration seems to be more prone to organic fouling as shown by the lower flux recovery at a higher ds concentration fig 2c such a trend i e more membrane fouling at a higher ds level has also been reported for other types of fss boo et al 2013 sardari et al 2018 the flux recovery after physical cleaning was lower at a higher ds concentration with the recovery percentages of 93 8 90 7 and 88 6 at 0 5 m 1 5 m and 3 0 m respectively the flux was fully recovered i e 100 after the final chemical cleaning for all the ds concentrations on the other hand the fo membrane tended to be less vulnerable to membrane fouling with a higher flow rate fig 2d as the flux recovery was improved with a higher flow rate i e 76 4 82 1 and 93 2 at 50 ml min 150 ml min and 300 ml min respectively it was previously reported that an increased flow rate might induce a stronger shear force on membrane which likely reduced the affinity of organics to attach on membrane surface iskander et al 2017 zou and he 2016 the changes in the treated water quality and feed leachate with varying ds concentrations and flowrates are shown in fig s4 3 2 2 identification of fo membrane foulants the amount of both reversible and irreversible fouling in terms of doc mg c l showed increasing trends with a higher ds concentration and a lower flow rate fig 3 which was consistent with the previous results of flux declines these fouling behaviors imply that the fo membrane fouling could be mitigated by lowering ds concentrations and or by increasing flow rates however the former action i e decreasing ds levels would operate to weaken the osmotic pressure or the driving force of the osmosis leading to a lower permeability flux of fo membrane on the other hand the latter i e increasing flow rates may elevate the operation cost of the system recently a pressure assisted fo system kook et al 2018 or a fo system using ultrasound choi et al 2018 was proposed as a measure to cope with elevated membrane fouling however these methods involve additional energy costs challenging the inherent cost effective advantage of fo system to reconcile the conflicting problems arising from energy cost and membrane fouling the selective removal of organic foulants from fs using adsorbents e g bc or pac can be a promising and cost effective method as the complementary treatment to fo operation for a successful integrated operation the adsorptive behaviors of different organic constituents in landfill leachate should be examined beforehand for this study the organic foulants in landfill leachate were identified based on the eem parafac results all three individual fluorescent components i e c1 c2 and c3 of the extracted foulants followed the similar trends with those of doc at the different conditions as shown in fig 3 however the relative abundance of each component was different by the fouling types the c1 was found to be the most responsible component for both re and ir fouling irrespective of the different operating conditions i e ds concentrations and flow rates which can be ascribed to its relatively hydrophilic nature that is attractive to the membrane via dipole dipole interactions and or hydrogen bonding i e hydrophilic cta zularisam et al 2006 the sec results of the inlet sample also supported the relative differences in the three fluorescent components with respect to the fouling behaviors the lmw characteristic of c1 amw 537 da fig 1 which is closely associated with pore blockage explained its major contribution to both re and ir fouling the c3 which is likely to have hydrophobic nature was the second most dominant component of the re foulants fig 3 the adsorption of hydrophobic organic matter onto fo membrane has been explained by the reduction of fo membrane surface charge as a result from the initial deposition of hydrophilic fractions followed by weakened repulsion between the organics and the membrane im et al 2018 due to the hmw characteristic c3 is not likely to play a major role in pore blockage of the membrane furthermore it is inferred that the weak bonding between c3 and hydrophilic membrane could make it easy to detach the c3 component from membrane surface upon simple physical cleaning meanwhile the c2 component was more responsible for the ir fouling than for the re fouling probably because of its relatively lmw and more hydrophilic characteristics compared to those of c3 fig 3 there is also a possibility that the initial deposition of the component i e c1 on membrane would contribute to the additional adsorption of relative hydrophobic fractions i e c2 and c3 onto the fo membrane therefore the targeted removal of this problematic organic component i e c1 from fluorescent components from landfill leachate or fs in fo operation should be an effective measure in terms of membrane fouling mitigation 3 3 adsorption behaviors of three fluorescent components on bc or pac numerous previous studies have demonstrated great performance of pac or commercialized bc as an effective adsorbent in the removal of lmw fractions from bulk dom huang et al 2017 marais et al 2018 shimizu et al 2018 szlachta and adamski 2009 in the present study the adsorptive removal behavior of landfill leachate was examined using bc and pac with different doses fig s5 with increasing doses of bc from 1 to 30 g l the doc and uva254 of the leachate decreased to the normalized values of 0 2 and 0 3 respectively meanwhile increased doses of pac from 0 1 to 2 g l resulted in the declines of the normalized values to 0 2 for doc and 0 3 for uva254 no substantial removal of doc or uva254 seems to occur at the doses of bc and pac above 30 g l and 2 g l respectively fig s5 although the optimized dose was much higher for bc 30 g l than for pac 2 g l it can be argued that bc is a favorable adsorbent competitive enough with pac because of its extra benefits for environmental sustainability e g low cost alternative fertilizer carbon sequestering function and so on jayawardhana et al 2016 the eem parafac results from the separate batch tests revealed that the adsorption of each fluorescent component was more pronounced with a higher dose of each adsorbent as expected the lmw c1 component was removed to the greatest extent followed by the c2 amw 673 da and c3 amw 945 da at the optimized doses the normalized values c co of c1 c2 and c3 were 0 03 0 06 and 0 32 respectively for bc and 0 01 0 08 and 0 07 for pac the preferential removal for c1 over the other components was fully supported by the comparison of the adsorption isotherm model parameters for the different components table 1 the freundlich adsorption affinity kf values r u g 1 l mg 1 1 n of the three fluorescent components corresponded to 2 3 0 2 c1 1 3 0 03 c2 and 0 02 0 02 c3 for bc respectively and 10 2 4 9 c1 4 6 2 0 c2 and 2 6 1 2 c3 for pac table 1 and fig s6 these results suggest that the adsorption using bc or pac could be the preferred treatment option to control the fouling precursors for both adsorbents a higher adsorption nonlinearity i e a lower 1 n was consistently observed for c1 compared to the other components which implies that the adsorption of c1 might be governed to a greater extent by site limiting adsorption processes than those of other components again these results revealed the high potential of the inline applications of bc or pac to the fo systems for the targeted removal of the most dominant fouling precursor in landfill leachate i e c1 in this study 3 4 integration of adsorption process with fo system for membrane fouling mitigation three different doses of bc 1 5 and 10 g l and pac 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g l which resulted in the removal of c1 by approximately 20 40 and 60 respectively fig s5 were selected to test the feasibility of their in line application to the fo system the higher doses of the adsorbents were not considered here because this investigation focused on the assessment of membrane fouling rather than on the maximum removal the fo system without the adsorbent s addition under the optimum condition i e ds concentration 1 5 m and flow rates 150 ml min was taken into account as a reference for this study which allowed the comparison of the membrane flux fig 4 a and b and membrane fouling potentials fig 4c and d between the single and the integrated fo systems the addition of the adsorbents resulted in great enhancement in the filtered volume of the leachate fig 4d with the improvements of 56 8 for bc and 82 3 for pac at each lowest dose with compared to the reference however there were no significant differences in the increased filtered volumes among the different doses used for each adsorbent anova p 0 1 there were initial increases of the flux up to 10 3 lmh irrespective of the adsorbent s doses fig 4 probably due to the high adsorption affinity of the fouling precursor i e c1 figs s5 s6 and table 1 however after 200 min of the filtration the flux started to substantially decline with more pronounced changes shown at the lower dose of bc or pac implying that the adsorption effects were overshadowed by membrane fouling at the later phase nevertheless the observed flux for each run maintained sufficiently higher levels than the reference throughout the filtration time fig 4a and b furthermore the addition of the adsorbents led to substantial enhancement of the flux recovery and the notable decline of the total membrane resistance after concentration of the leachate fig 4c and d for example the membrane flux recovery showed an increasing trend with the addition of adsorbents changing from 82 1 to 95 8 for bc and from 86 2 to 96 9 for pac correspondingly the total membrane resistances were on downward trend with the addition of adsorbents fig 4d confirming that using the adsorbents mitigated the membrane fouling meanwhile the action i e adsorption brought the effect of reducing the necessity of chemical cleaning which depended on the added doses for example the flux recovery after physical cleaning at 0 1 g l of pac was 97 while it increased up to 100 at the higher doses i e 0 3 and 0 5 g l fig 4c the amount of organic foulants followed a similar trend with the flux recovery after the physical cleaning of membrane the doc of the re foulants was reduced from 4 40 0 04 to 4 13 0 07 3 53 0 53 and 3 27 0 37 g l at 1 g l 5 g l and 10 g l of bc and to 2 43 0 64 2 28 0 29 and 1 74 0 05 mg l at 0 1 g l 0 3 g l and 0 5 mg l of pac respectively fig s7a in fact the irreversible membrane resistances rir after the addition of 10 g l of bc or 0 1 g l or 0 3 g l of pac were nearly equal to those of the virgin membrane i e 410 105 1 m with notable reduction of the ir foulants from 2 3 0 14 mg c l to negligible amounts 0 4 mg c l fig s8 these results supported that this integrated fo system was operated with the marked effect of irreversible fouling mitigation not requiring further chemical cleaning fig 4c the superior performance of pac versus bc as evidenced by the higher filtered volume and the lower extent of membrane fouling can be explained by its higher kinetics and a greater adsorption affinity of the leachate particularly for c1 fig s2b and table 1 the extent of concentration of leachate was dependent upon the filtered volume of leachate and the amount of organics adsorbed on the adsorbents the concentrated leachate of the integrated fo system was higher than that of the reference by 1 5 1 4 and 1 1 times for bc at 1 0 5 0 and 10 g l and by 2 3 1 8 and 1 7 times for pac at 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g l fig s7c meanwhile it was observable that the different fluorescent components in the concentrated leachate did not follow the trend of doc with the higher doses fig s7c such differences can be ascribed to the complex effects of the discrepancies among the three components in the adsorptive behaviors and the attachment propensities for membrane 3 5 evaluating the monitoring capability of eem parafac for fo membrane fouling mitigation considering the advantages of eem parafac such as the super sensitive and fast measurements and the possible compatibility with on line monitoring wu et al 2012 2011 its potential to describe the mitigation of fo membrane fouling was explored by comparing the correlations between various monitoring parameters and the performance of the integrated fo system for this work the flux recoveries after the concentration of leachate at different adsorbent s doses were correlated with the two bulk parameters including doc and uva254 as well as the three different fluorescent components expressed by fmax values table s2 the correlation with doc was poor r 0 02 p 0 05 indicating the complex removal behavior of landfill leachate in the system the c2 and c3 components also showed insignificant correlations with flux recovery in contrast the c1 component the main foulant exhibited a significant and negative correlation with flux recovery r 0 92 p 0 01 fig 5 signifying that the fo membrane fouling was mitigated in accordance with the extent of the removal of c1 by adsorption this finding points out the practical importance of identifying the primary fouling precursor from landfill leachate in properly assessing the fo performance in term of membrane fouling eem parafac may have a practical limitation for its on site utilization because it requires the measurements for a number of eems before the modeling to add a practical aspect to our previous findings i e the identification of a fouling precursor via eem parafac the flux recovery of the fo membrane was also correlated with the raw eem peak intensities corresponding to the same position of c1 ex em 230 335 nm fig 5 and fig s9 the correlation was still significant p 0 05 with a r2 value of 0 610 the result suggests that membrane fouling in the integrated fo system could be efficiently evaluated via the on site fluorescence monitoring on the fs fig 5 4 conclusions in the single operation of fo the tryptophan like component c1 characterized by the lmw fraction was found to be the primary foulant component the substantial removal of landfill leachate by the addition of bc or pac suggested that adsorption can be an effective integration option to mitigate fo membrane fouling both adsorbents bc and pac preferably removed the fluorescent components in the order of c1 the fulvic like c2 the humic like c3 which was well supported by their calculated freundlich isotherm model parameters the addition of bc or pac in line with the fo system resulted in notable improvements in the filtered volume 57 and the flux recovery 80 compared to the single fo operation at 10 g l dose of bc or 0 3 g l dose of pac the flux was fully recovered not requiring further chemical cleaning for fo membrane a significant correlation between c1 or the eem peak proxy and flux recovery p 0 05 was found for the integrated fo system evidencing that fo membrane fouling was mitigated in accordance with the targeted removal of the fouling precursor c1 in the present study by the in line

18736,forward osmosis fo has been adopted to treat complex wastewater such as landfill leachate due to its high rejection of organics in this study the in line adsorptive process using biochar bc or powdered activated carbon pac was applied to a cross flow fo system to enhance the mitigation of the fo membrane fouling from landfill leachate the changes in the leachate composition along the treatments were tracked by excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac to identify tryptophan like c1 fulvic like c2 and humic like c3 components after a single operation of fo the c1 was found to be the main constituent responsible for membrane fouling irrespective of varying operation conditions regarding draw solute concentrations and flow rates both sorbents i e bc and pac exhibited the preferential removal behavior towards c1 c2 c3 which was well supported by their individual adsorption isotherm model parameters the addition of in line adsorption treatment to fo resulted in substantial improvements in the filtered volume 57 and the flux recovery 80 compared to the single fo operation without chemical cleaning of membrane the flux was fully recovered at a dose of 10 g l bc or 0 3 g l of pac a significant and negative correlation was found between the flux recovery and the c1 of the feed leachate or the corresponding spectral peak intensity p 0 05 for the

forward osmosis biochar membrane fouling eem parafac adsorption 1 introduction cumulative disposal of municipal solid wastes into landfills is accompanied by the unavoidable production of tremendous amounts of undesirable landfill leachate encompassing a range of persistent contaminants jovanov et al 2018 kjeldsen et al 2002 untreated leachate may pose serious hazards to the surrounding environment requiring prompt and efficient action with suitable treatments silva et al 2004 with the growing age of landfills leachate tends to be enriched with non biodegradable organics such as humic substances which deteriorate the performance of the low cost biological treatments da costa et al 2018 kulikowska and klimiuk 2008 in this regard many physio chemical treatments including coagulation adsorption and advanced oxidation processes have been proposed and studied for the effective removal liu et al 2015 renou et al 2008 however these physiochemical treatments alone are insufficient for complete removal of diverse organics from leachate deng et al 2018 silva et al 2004 to overcome such limitations the integration of these treatments has been proposed in many previous studies aftab and hur 2018 li et al 2010 oloibiri et al 2017 2015 although membrane filtration processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been successfully employed as the substitutes to produce high quality effluent chaudhari and murthy 2010 di palma et al 2002 their operation under high trans membrane pressure eventually raises the operational cost and is accompanied by severe organic membrane fouling these issues may require more frequent maintenance or even the replacement of the whole membrane assemblies šír et al 2012 zularisam et al 2006 from an economic point of view the forward osmosis fo process is superior to nf or the ro treatments owing to its numerous advantages which include the high rejection for organic and inorganic pollutants no requirement for externally aided hydraulic pressure and a lower extent of membrane fouling with good reversibility iskander et al 2017 lee et al 2010 the fo process is based on the principle of the water permeation across a semi permeable membrane driven by the difference in the osmotic potential gradient between feed water and draw solution cath et al 2006 recently fo has been successfully applied in the direct concentration of the complex and high strength wastewater streams such as textile wastewater han et al 2016 drilling mud from oil refining hickenbottom et al 2013 landfill leachate iskander et al 2017 qin et al 2016 and domestic wastewater aftab et al 2017 2015 fo has also proved its excellent applicability in treating landfill leachate for the recovery of inorganics the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons and the water recovery from high saline and biologically treated leachates dong et al 2014 iskander et al 2017 li et al 2017 qin et al 2016 wu et al 2018 however despite a number of such practical applications no attention has been paid to the organic fouling potential of landfill leachate in fo which serves as a critical factor to determine the operational cost and water recovery a great deal of effort has gone to mitigate the conventional pressure driven i e uf and nf membrane fouling of landfill leachate the most common practice for the effort has been the integration of physio chemical pretreatments with membrane operation which have been based on coagulation flocculation dolar et al 2016 mariam and nghiem 2010 magnetic ion exchange resins miex singh et al 2012 and powdered activated carbon pac dolar et al 2016 ince et al 2010 among these common pretreatment options pac has received the most attention due to several advantages of its in line use with membrane filtration campinas and rosa 2010 the improved scouring of the membrane cake layer the enhanced mitigation of irreversible fouling huang et al 2017 and the removal of viruses oh et al 2007 recently biochars bcs have emerged as a promising substitute for pac with the additional benefits of their environmental sustainability ahmad et al 2013 2012 low production cost equivalent to one tenth of the pac s and improvement in agricultural land fertility and carbon sequestration upon the disposal furthermore bcs comprise additional cationic functional groups in their structures which makes it easy to modify the surface properties to improve the functions rajapaksha et al 2016 yang et al 2019 although there were several previous examples using pac or bcs for the pretreatments to the conventional membrane filtration shankar et al 2017 kim et al 2019 no effort has gone to date to explore their viability for the in line applications to fo system which warrants further investigations to prove enhanced performance of fo with the additional treatment size exclusion chromatography sec and excitation emission matrix in tandem with the parallel factor analysis eem parafac are the two renowned tools for dissolved organic matter dom analyses in tracking organic foulants in various membrane filtration systems ly et al 2018a c fan et al 2017 kennedy et al 2005 fan et al 2017 however to the best of the authors knowledge there is no study employing such advanced tools to examine the organic foulants of landfill leachate in fo systems in this study a lab scale cross flow fo system was optimized for the treatment of stabilized landfill leachate using nacl as a draw solute at varying cross flow velocities and draw solute concentrations and the in line applicability of pac or bc for the fo system was further explored this study specifically aimed to a track the behaviors of different constituents of landfill leachate in the fo system using sec and eem parafac b examine the pretreatment performances of bc and pac for targeted removal of main membrane foulants and c evaluate the feasibility of the bc or pac adsorption as the in line treatments to fo in terms of membrane fouling mitigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of landfill leachate and its basic characteristics a landfill leachate sample 40 l was collected from sudokwon municipal landfill site located in the vicinity of incheon city south korea with the covered area of 19 km2 after 8 years of operation this landfill was discontinued in 2000 the sample was collected in june 2018 in acid cleaned 20 l plastic containers from an onsite stabilizing tank it was immediately filtered through pre ashed whatman gf f glass fiber filter 0 7 μm and stored in the dark at 4 c the basic water quality of the leachate is shown in table s1 2 2 fo system setup and the configuration a lab scale fo system was set up in cross flow mode for the treatment of stabilized landfill leachate the fo system has an effective membrane area of 22 cm2 with a configuration of the active membrane layer facing the feed solution al fs fig s1 a cellulose triacetate cta membrane purchased from fluid technology solution inc ftsh2o albany usa was used for the setup sodium chloride solution 99 0 nacl sigma aldrich was used as a draw solute ds with the initial volume of 300 ml to maintain the initial ds concentration concentrated draw solute cds 5 m nacl was dosed into the draw tank using an online ec controller jishen china connected to a peristaltic pump ems tech korea fig s1 the feed and the draw solutions were circulated in the external fo membrane module by using separate peristaltic pumps ems tech korea the flow rate was adjusted and measured by a flow meter dwyer usa all experiments were performed at room temperature 25 c 2 3 batch adsorption experiments using pac and bc adsorption experiments using bc or pac were conducted in 50 ml vials with a working volume of 30 ml the pac a mesh size of 100 and the granular bc feedstock southern pine soft wood were purchased from sigma aldrich and wakefield columbia respectively the bc was heated in oven at 120 c for 6 h ground into powder sieved to obtain the similar size to pac and stored in a closed bottle for adsorption isotherm experiments different amounts of bc 0 50 g l or pac 0 3 5 g l or were added into the vials containing a constant concentration 180 mg c l of landfill leachate the vials were then set for agitation on a horizontal shaker at 150 rpm for 24 h the ph of each sample was kept at ph 7 during the experiments by adding 5 n hcl or 5 n naoh every 4 h the neutral ph was preferred because the results could be comparable with those in the other literature iskander et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 xu et al 2018 after adsorption the samples were filtered with 0 45 μm pre rinsed cta filter 47 mm advantac and stored for further analyses adsorption kinetics experiments were also performed following the same procedure above except for using a fixed dose of bc or pac bc dose 30 g l pac dose 2 g l adsorption parameters were estimated based on the freundlich isotherm model q e k f c e 1 n where qe mg c g and ce mg l are the adsorbed amount of landfill leachate per dosed grams of bc or pac and the leachate concentration in solution respectively at equilibrium the parameters kf and 1 n represent the adsorption capacity and site heterogeneity factor respectively 2 4 forward osmosis experiments a series of filtration runs were performed to optimize the fo system at varying ds concentrations and cross flow velocities or flow rates the concentration 180 mg c l and the ph of feed solution ph 7 were kept constant for each operation after the end of each run 12 h the treated and the concentrated samples from the ds and the feed tank respectively were collected and passed through the 0 45 μm pre rinsed cta filter the addition of the concentrated draw solution into the draw tank was taken into account to calculate the final filtered volume the conductivity of the final concentrate was measured using a conductivity meter sc 82 yokogawa membrane flux jw was calculated as follows j w 1 a m δ v t δ t where am is the effective membrane area and δvt is the changes in the weight reading at the time interval δt the integrated fo system with bc or pac was operated at an optimized condition of flow rate and ds concentration required amounts of pac or bc were dosed into the feed tank and the tank was continuously agitated with a magnetic stirrer to achieve an adequate adsorption of landfill leachate on bc or pac the same fo setup but without the addition of bc or pac was also run for the reference all the experiments were conducted in duplicate i e two repeated filtration before each run the whole fo system was flushed with distilled and deionized water ddw 2 5 membrane resistance analysis and flux recovery experiments after each filtration run 12 h the feed tank was filled with ddw and the membrane flux jo was calculated for 60 min using the same draw solution i e 0 5 m nacl the ddw was circulated with an elevated speed of 600 ml min for 30 min on the side of the feed solution to physically clean the membrane which by the loose cake layer was extracted from the membrane surface the extracted solution 50 ml was denoted as reversible re foulant after the filtration with 0 45 μm cta filter im et al 2018 the recovered flux jp after physical cleaning i e jp was calculated again for another 60 min run next the fo membrane was detached from the module and soaked in 50 ml of 0 1 m naoh solution for 30 min to chemically clean the membrane the extracted solution was then neutralized by adding 5 m hcl solution to obtain the irreversible ir foulants the membrane was rinsed with ddw and placed back into the cell to calculate the membrane flux with ddw for 60 min which was equivalent to the recovered flux jc after chemical cleaning more information for fo membrane flux recovery experiments is available in the literature gao et al 2018 resistance analysis of the fo membrane was performed based on poiseulle s law using the following equations siddiqui et al 2018 f l u x j 1 a d v d t δ c d c f μ r t r t j μ δ c d c f r t r m r r e r i r where μ is the dynamic viscosity cd and cf are the concentrations of ds and feed solute in term of conductivity ms cm the

filtration respectively rm was measured by the flux jm obtained for virgin membrane rre was measured using the flux jp after physically cleaning the membrane using ddw rir was calculated using the flux jc after chemically cleaning the membrane using 0 1 m naoh 2 6 bulk parameters and spectroscopic analyses for leachate bulk leachate samples were quantified in terms of dissolved organic carbon

excitations emissions matrices eems of samples were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f7000 japan the inner filter correction was avoided by diluting the samples with ddw to the

excitation ex and emission em wavelength ranges of 200 450 nm and 300 500 nm respectively in a scanning step of 10 nm for both the slit widths were fixed at 5 nm the eem scan of ddw was taken into account for blank subtraction yang and hur 2014 2 7 eem parafac modeling on fluorescence data parallel factor analysis parafac modeling was conducted to decompose the independent fluorescent components from the eems of the samples stedmon and bro 2008 which was based on the free downloadable toolbox domfluor http www models life du dk on matlab 13 0 mathworks natick ma the modeling procedures included assembling eems scatter removal normalizing signals the removal of outliers evaluation of model fit sensitivity analysis and the result interpretation nguyen et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 the final fluorescent components were confirmed by the split half validation and residual analysis for data analyses the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each identified component was normalized by the raman peak area lawaetz and stedmon 2009 2 8 size exclusion chromatography equipped with fluorescence detector sec fld the apparent molecular size distributions of different fluorescent components were obtained using a size exclusion chromatography sec system waters 1515 equipped with a protein pak 125 waters 7 8 300 mm column and a fluorescence detector fld multi λ fluorescence 2475 waters the details of the system calibration standards and the operation condition and the equation for apparent molecular weight amw of samples are available in lee and hur 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of different fluorescent components from landfill leachate three different fluorescent components were confirmed by the parafac modeling on the entire eem dataset of this study fig 1 component 1 c1 showed the primary and the secondary peaks at 230 nm and 280 nm ex respectively and at 335 nm em while the peaks of component 2 c2 were positioned at 240 nm and 310 nm ex and at 410 nm em component 3 c3 displayed three peaks at 250 nm 305 nm and 365 nm ex and at 458 nm em the loading plots of the three identified components are shown in fig s3 these three were comparable to those previously reported for landfill leachate aftab et al 2018 aftab and hur 2018 jung et al 2017 oloibiri et al 2017 based on the previous literature c1 can be associated with tryptophan like component which consists of hydrolyzed aromatic amino acids oloibiri et al 2017 renou et al 2008 or xenobiotic organics in landfill leachate baker and curry 2004 c2 and c3 presented the similar features to fulvic like and humic like components respectively ballesteros et al 2017 jung et al 2017 based on the location ex em of each primary peak the amw of the individual fluorescent components were estimated using the sec analysis and the value was higher in the order of c1 c2 c3 fig 1 this trend was consistent with the previous studies reporting that the fluorescence peaks of dom at longer em were closely linked with larger molecular size hur and kim 2009 lee et al 2015 and or with more hydrophobic nature ishii and boyer 2012 wu et al 2003 from the current results the components of c1 c2 and c3 can be assigned as low molecular weight lmw intermediate mw imw and high mw hmw fluorescent components respectively fig 1 3 2 fo operation at different conditions and the corresponding membrane fouling 3 2 1 membrane permeability and flux recovery at different conditions varying ds concentrations alter its osmotic pressure or driving force while recirculation flow rates affect the membrane permeability in fo systems johnson et al 2018 in this study increasing trends were observed for both the initial flux and the total water recovered from leachate with a higher ds concentration fig 2 a which suggested the development of the higher osmotic potential difference at elevated ds levels for example the initial flux was 4 lmh 8 lmh and 10 lmh and the recovered water volume reached 92 ml 116 ml and 140 ml at the ds concentration of 0 5 m 1 5 m and 3 0 m respectively fig 2a the results agreed with a recent study of gao et al 2018 reporting a good linear relationship r2 0 96 between ds concentrations and the initial flux for a fo system treating sewage sludge in the current study with increasing recirculation flow rates of the fs and ds the total filtered volume was also elevated with the recovered water volume of 10 2 ml 116 4 ml and 153 7 ml at 50 ml min 150 ml min and 300 ml min flow rate respectively these results signified the importance of the contact time for the ds or the feed solution fs with fo membrane in the process fig 2b irrespective of the different conditions the membrane flux tended to decline with operation time this observation has been attributed to either the increase in osmotic pressure or the feed leachate concentrations followed by the development of fouling cake layer on membrane surface li et al 2017 in the present work the former explanation can be excluded because a large difference in the conductivity was maintained between the ds and the fs even after the fs was fully concentrated thus the decline in the flux is more likely to result from membrane fouling gao et al 2018 meanwhile the membrane flux was more stable and the flux recovery was greater with a lower ds concentration fig 2a and c which can be explained by the lower permeation drag of the solutes in landfill leachate toward membrane as a result of its lower initial membrane flux ang and elimelech 2008 zhao et al 2016 in contrast the leachate treated at the higher ds concentration seems to be more prone to organic fouling as shown by the lower flux recovery at a higher ds concentration fig 2c such a trend i e more membrane fouling at a higher ds level has also been reported for other types of fss boo et al 2013 sardari et al 2018 the flux recovery after physical cleaning was lower at a higher ds concentration with the recovery percentages of 93 8 90 7 and 88 6 at 0 5 m 1 5 m and 3 0 m respectively the flux was fully recovered i e 100 after the final chemical cleaning for all the ds concentrations on the other hand the fo membrane tended to be less vulnerable to membrane fouling with a higher flow rate fig 2d as the flux recovery was improved with a higher flow rate i e 76 4 82 1 and 93 2 at 50 ml min 150 ml min and 300 ml min respectively it was previously reported that an increased flow rate might induce a stronger shear force on membrane which likely reduced the affinity of organics to attach on membrane surface iskander et al 2017 zou and he 2016 the changes in the treated water quality and feed leachate with varying ds concentrations and flowrates are shown in fig s4 3 2 2 identification of fo membrane foulants the amount of both reversible and irreversible fouling in terms of doc mg c l showed increasing trends with a higher ds concentration and a lower flow rate fig 3 which was consistent with the previous results of flux declines these fouling behaviors imply that the fo membrane fouling could be mitigated by lowering ds concentrations and or by increasing flow rates however the former action i e decreasing ds levels would operate to weaken the osmotic pressure or the driving force of the osmosis leading to a lower permeability flux of fo membrane on the other hand the latter i e increasing flow rates may elevate the operation cost of the system recently a pressure assisted fo system kook et al 2018 or a fo system using ultrasound choi et al 2018 was proposed as a measure to cope with elevated membrane fouling however these methods involve additional energy costs challenging the inherent cost effective advantage of fo system to reconcile the conflicting problems arising from energy cost and membrane fouling the selective removal of organic foulants from fs using adsorbents e g bc or pac can be a promising and cost effective method as the complementary treatment to fo operation for a successful integrated operation the adsorptive behaviors of different organic constituents in landfill leachate should be examined beforehand for this study the organic foulants in landfill leachate were identified based on the eem parafac results all three individual fluorescent components i e c1 c2 and c3 of the extracted foulants followed the similar trends with those of doc at the different conditions as shown in fig 3 however the relative abundance of each component was different by the fouling types the c1 was found to be the most responsible component for both re and ir fouling irrespective of the different operating conditions i e ds concentrations and flow rates which can be ascribed to its relatively hydrophilic nature that is attractive to the membrane via dipole dipole interactions and or hydrogen bonding i e hydrophilic cta zularisam et al 2006 the sec results of the inlet sample also supported the relative differences in the three fluorescent components with respect to the fouling behaviors the lmw characteristic of c1 amw 537 da fig 1 which is closely associated with pore blockage explained its major contribution to both re and ir fouling the c3 which is likely to have hydrophobic nature was the second most dominant component of the re foulants fig 3 the adsorption of hydrophobic organic matter onto fo membrane has been explained by the reduction of fo membrane surface charge as a result from the initial deposition of hydrophilic fractions followed by weakened repulsion between the organics and the membrane im et al 2018 due to the hmw characteristic c3 is not likely to play a major role in pore blockage of the membrane furthermore it is inferred that the weak bonding between c3 and hydrophilic membrane could make it easy to detach the c3 component from membrane surface upon simple physical cleaning meanwhile the c2 component was more responsible for the ir fouling than for the re fouling probably because of its relatively lmw and more hydrophilic characteristics compared to those of c3 fig 3 there is also a possibility that the initial deposition of the component i e c1 on membrane would contribute to the additional adsorption of relative hydrophobic fractions i e c2 and c3 onto the fo membrane therefore the targeted removal of this problematic organic component i e c1 from fluorescent components from landfill leachate or fs in fo operation should be an effective measure in terms of membrane fouling mitigation 3 3 adsorption behaviors of three fluorescent components on bc or pac numerous previous studies have demonstrated great performance of pac or commercialized bc as an effective adsorbent in the removal of lmw fractions from bulk dom huang et al 2017 marais et al 2018 shimizu et al 2018 szlachta and adamski 2009 in the present study the adsorptive removal behavior of landfill leachate was examined using bc and pac with different doses fig s5 with increasing doses of bc from 1 to 30 g l the doc and uva254 of the leachate decreased to the normalized values of 0 2 and 0 3 respectively meanwhile increased doses of pac from 0 1 to 2 g l resulted in the declines of the normalized values to 0 2 for doc and 0 3 for uva254 no substantial removal of doc or uva254 seems to occur at the doses of bc and pac above 30 g l and 2 g l respectively fig s5 although the optimized dose was much higher for bc 30 g l than for pac 2 g l it can be argued that bc is a favorable adsorbent competitive enough with pac because of its extra benefits for environmental sustainability e g low cost alternative fertilizer carbon sequestering function and so on jayawardhana et al 2016 the eem parafac results from the separate batch tests revealed that the adsorption of each fluorescent component was more pronounced with a higher dose of each adsorbent as expected the lmw c1 component was removed to the greatest extent followed by the c2 amw 673 da and c3 amw 945 da at the optimized doses the normalized values c co of c1 c2 and c3 were 0 03 0 06 and 0 32 respectively for bc and 0 01 0 08 and 0 07 for pac the preferential removal for c1 over the other components was fully supported by the comparison of the adsorption isotherm model parameters for the different components table 1 the freundlich adsorption affinity kf values r u g 1 l mg 1 1 n of the three fluorescent components corresponded to 2 3 0 2 c1 1 3 0 03 c2 and 0 02 0 02 c3 for bc respectively and 10 2 4 9 c1 4 6 2 0 c2 and 2 6 1 2 c3 for pac table 1 and fig s6 these results suggest that the adsorption using bc or pac could be the preferred treatment option to control the fouling precursors for both adsorbents a higher adsorption nonlinearity i e a lower 1 n was consistently observed for c1 compared to the other components which implies that the adsorption of c1 might be governed to a greater extent by site limiting adsorption processes than those of other components again these results revealed the high potential of the inline applications of bc or pac to the fo systems for the targeted removal of the most dominant fouling precursor in landfill leachate i e c1 in this study 3 4 integration of adsorption process with fo system for membrane fouling mitigation three different doses of bc 1 5 and 10 g l and pac 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g l which resulted in the removal of c1 by approximately 20 40 and 60 respectively fig s5 were selected to test the feasibility of their in line application to the fo system the higher doses of the adsorbents were not considered here because this investigation focused on the assessment of membrane fouling rather than on the maximum removal the fo system without the adsorbent s addition under the optimum condition i e ds concentration 1 5 m and flow rates 150 ml min was taken into account as a reference for this study which allowed the comparison of the membrane flux fig 4 a and b and membrane fouling potentials fig 4c and d between the single and the integrated fo systems the addition of the adsorbents resulted in great enhancement in the filtered volume of the leachate fig 4d with the improvements of 56 8 for bc and 82 3 for pac at each lowest dose with compared to the reference however there were no significant differences in the increased filtered volumes among the different doses used for each adsorbent anova p 0 1 there were initial increases of the flux up to 10 3 lmh irrespective of the adsorbent s doses fig 4 probably due to the high adsorption affinity of the fouling precursor i e c1 figs s5 s6 and table 1 however after 200 min of the filtration the flux started to substantially decline with more pronounced changes shown at the lower dose of bc or pac implying that the adsorption effects were overshadowed by membrane fouling at the later phase nevertheless the observed flux for each run maintained sufficiently higher levels than the reference throughout the filtration time fig 4a and b furthermore the addition of the adsorbents led to substantial enhancement of the flux recovery and the notable decline of the total membrane resistance after concentration of the leachate fig 4c and d for example the membrane flux recovery showed an increasing trend with the addition of adsorbents changing from 82 1 to 95 8 for bc and from 86 2 to 96 9 for pac correspondingly the total membrane resistances were on downward trend with the addition of adsorbents fig 4d confirming that using the adsorbents mitigated the membrane fouling meanwhile the action i e adsorption brought the effect of reducing the necessity of chemical cleaning which depended on the added doses for example the flux recovery after physical cleaning at 0 1 g l of pac was 97 while it increased up to 100 at the higher doses i e 0 3 and 0 5 g l fig 4c the amount of organic foulants followed a similar trend with the flux recovery after the physical cleaning of membrane the doc of the re foulants was reduced from 4 40 0 04 to 4 13 0 07 3 53 0 53 and 3 27 0 37 g l at 1 g l 5 g l and 10 g l of bc and to 2 43 0 64 2 28 0 29 and 1 74 0 05 mg l at 0 1 g l 0 3 g l and 0 5 mg l of pac respectively fig s7a in fact the irreversible membrane resistances rir after the addition of 10 g l of bc or 0 1 g l or 0 3 g l of pac were nearly equal to those of the virgin membrane i e 410 105 1 m with notable reduction of the ir foulants from 2 3 0 14 mg c l to negligible amounts 0 4 mg c l fig s8 these results supported that this integrated fo system was operated with the marked effect of irreversible fouling mitigation not requiring further chemical cleaning fig 4c the superior performance of pac versus bc as evidenced by the higher filtered volume and the lower extent of membrane fouling can be explained by its higher kinetics and a greater adsorption affinity of the leachate particularly for c1 fig s2b and table 1 the extent of concentration of leachate was dependent upon the filtered volume of leachate and the amount of organics adsorbed on the adsorbents the concentrated leachate of the integrated fo system was higher than that of the reference by 1 5 1 4 and 1 1 times for bc at 1 0 5 0 and 10 g l and by 2 3 1 8 and 1 7 times for pac at 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g l fig s7c meanwhile it was observable that the different fluorescent components in the concentrated leachate did not follow the trend of doc with the higher doses fig s7c such differences can be ascribed to the complex effects of the discrepancies among the three components in the adsorptive behaviors and the attachment propensities for membrane 3 5 evaluating the monitoring capability of eem parafac for fo membrane fouling mitigation considering the advantages of eem parafac such as the super sensitive and fast measurements and the possible compatibility with on line monitoring wu et al 2012 2011 its potential to describe the mitigation of fo membrane fouling was explored by comparing the correlations between various monitoring parameters and the performance of the integrated fo system for this work the flux recoveries after the concentration of leachate at different adsorbent s doses were correlated with the two bulk parameters including doc and uva254 as well as the three different fluorescent components expressed by fmax values table s2 the correlation with doc was poor r 0 02 p 0 05 indicating the complex removal behavior of landfill leachate in the system the c2 and c3 components also showed insignificant correlations with flux recovery in contrast the c1 component the main foulant exhibited a significant and negative correlation with flux recovery r 0 92 p 0 01 fig 5 signifying that the fo membrane fouling was mitigated in accordance with the extent of the removal of c1 by adsorption this finding points out the practical importance of identifying the primary fouling precursor from landfill leachate in properly assessing the fo performance in term of membrane fouling eem parafac may have a practical limitation for its on site utilization because it requires the measurements for a number of eems before the modeling to add a practical aspect to our previous findings i e the identification of a fouling precursor via eem parafac the flux recovery of the fo membrane was also correlated with the raw eem peak intensities corresponding to the same position of c1 ex em 230 335 nm fig 5 and fig s9 the correlation was still significant p 0 05 with a r2 value of 0 610 the result suggests that membrane fouling in the integrated fo system could be efficiently evaluated via the on site fluorescence monitoring on the fs fig 5 4 conclusions in the single operation of fo the tryptophan like component c1 characterized by the lmw fraction was found to be the primary foulant component the substantial removal of landfill leachate by the addition of bc or pac suggested that adsorption can be an effective integration option to mitigate fo membrane fouling both adsorbents bc and pac preferably removed the fluorescent components in the order of c1 the fulvic like c2 the humic like c3 which was well supported by their calculated freundlich isotherm model parameters the addition of bc or pac in line with the fo system resulted in notable improvements in the filtered volume 57 and the flux recovery 80 compared to the single fo operation at 10 g l dose of bc or 0 3 g l dose of pac the flux was fully recovered not requiring further chemical cleaning for fo membrane a significant correlation between c1 or the eem peak proxy and flux recovery p 0 05 was found for the integrated fo system evidencing that fo membrane fouling was mitigated in accordance with the targeted removal of the fouling precursor c1 in the present study by the in line adsorption treatment this study provided a new insight into the high potential of the in line integration of bc or pac adsorption with fo system treating landfill leachate declaration of interests the

18737,although rivers represent an important pathway for the transport of microplastics to the oceans research on riverine microplastics is limited compared to the marine environment hence we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics in the nakdong river down to 20 μm in size and characterized them using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in surface and mid waters and sediment the mean standard deviation abundance of microplastic in the nakdong river was in the range of 293 83 upstream february 2017 to 4760 5242 downstream august 2017 particles m3 in water and 1970 62 particles kg in sediment the abundance of microplastics was about three times higher in surface than mid waters in the downstream area polypropylene and polyester accounted for 41 8 and 23 1 of microplastics in the water respectively whereas about 50 in the sediment was composed of polypropylene and polyethylene microplastics smaller than 300 μm in size accounted for 74 in the water and 81 in sediment and the distribution peaked in the 50 150 μm size range based on these results we estimated the annual load of microplastics carried by the nakdong river in 2017 to be 5 4 11 trillion by number and 53 3 118 tons by weight the proportions of the total load transported through surface water and the water column were 8 and 92 respectively in addition the microplastic load was concentrated in the wet season which makes up 71 in number and 81 in weight these results indicate that it is necessary to reflect seasonal variation and sample both in the surface water and water column to estimate microplastic transport without considering these factors the annual load of microplastics may be overestimated or underestimated graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics

four seasons yonkos et al 2014 dris et al 2018a are scant and hence there is a general lack of information about the seasonal distribution of microplastics freshwater invertebrates daphnia magna

microplastic size for the ingestion and monitoring studies because microplastic investigations have mainly targeted surface waters there is little information available about riverine transport of microplastics through the water column as large plastic litter can be transferred along the bottoms of rivers morritt et al 2014 microplastics are also likely to be transported through the mid and bottom water the presence of microplastic has been confirmed in the bottom of a river in southern california moore et al 2011 in a tropical estuary in brazil the abundance of microplastic in the bottom water was comparable to that at the surface and was higher than surface abundances in the late rainy season lima et al 2014 investigation of microfibers in three water column layers at a depth of 2 6 m showed that the vertical variability was negligible dris et al 2018a microplastic is mainly concentrated in the surface layer song et al 2014 but a significant amount of microplastics were also found in water column in coastal environment song et al 2018 on the other hand a spot test at approximately 5 m depth in the rhine river showed no measurable microplastic particles mani et al 2015 the sediment serves as a reservoir of microplastics kapp and yeatman 2018 flooding exported approximately 70 of the microplastics stored in river beds in northwest england hurley et al 2018 the resuspension of microplastic deposited in sediment can constitute an additional source of microplastic in the water column to understand the role of sediment as a source and sink of microplastic it is necessary to investigate microplastic in sediment as well as in water and to compare them at the same time the seasonal and annual input loads of microplastics through riverine discharge can be a crucial factor influencing microplastic abundance and composition in receiving coastal waters and deposition onto adjacent shorelines rech et al 2014 regional input amount of river plastics to oceans varies seasonally by continent lebreton et al 2017 micro and mesoplastic litter input from the river danube into the black sea has been estimated to be 4 2 t per day lechner et al 2014 in a modeling study it was estimated that between 1 15 and 2 41 million tons of both macro and microplastic waste enters the ocean every year from rivers and the continent of asia is the dominant contributor of plastic litter lebreton et al 2017 however without considering microplastics less than 300 μm water column transportation and seasonal variation it is possible to overestimate or underestimate the annual riverine load of microplastics to the ocean in this study we aimed to investigate spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics in the nakdong river including characteristics of microplastic contamination in surface water water column and benthic sediment and to estimate annual load of microplastics through the river for this purpose we tested the following hypotheses hypothesis i is that microplastic abundance in water is relatively high according to the population in the river catchment from up to downstream along the course of a river the microplastic abundance can vary due to nearby sources such as highly populated cities and waste and sewage treatment plants hypothesis ii is that microplastic abundance is highest during the rainy season the abundance of microplastics entering the ocean through the river will also vary seasonally high precipitation during the summer monsoon may increase the waterborne microplastic abundance in rivers by carrying microplastics deposited in the watershed as well as by resuspension of microplastics deposited on the river bottom hypothesis iii is that microplastics denser than river water move mainly through the water column rather than in surface water microplastics have different densities according to their polymer types and the vertical movement of microplastics will vary according to density to test these hypotheses microplastic particles down to 20 μm in size were sampled seasonally from surface waters at up mid and downstream locations of the nakdong river in south korea microplastic abundances in the water column and surface bottom sediments were additionally investigated at the downstream site furthermore the amount of microplastic introduced into the ocean via the nakdong river was estimated using these in situ observations of microplastics and annual water discharge data to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to estimate the annual input of microplastics down to 20 μm in size while considering surface and subsurface and seasonal variation in microplastic abundance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nakdong river the second largest river in south korea was investigated the up mid and downstream watersheds have areas of 9336 5991 and 6261 km2 respectively table s1 population densities in the up mid and downstream areas were 76 606 and 950 inhabitants km2 respectively the midstream portion passes through daegu population 2484688 the fourth largest city in south korea and the downstream stretch passes through busan 3496779 the nation s second largest city there are 106 135 and 240 sewage and wastewater treatment facilities sewage 500 m3 day and sewage 500 m3 day including excreta industrial agricultural and livestock waste in the up mid and downstream areas respectively and their total processing capacities are 222091 2804167 and 1250545 m3 day busan development institute 2011 the salinity of downstream sampling site was below 0 2 psμ indicating that there was no saltwater intrusion to the sampling site 2 2 sample collection surface water samples were collected in triplicate from the up upstream surface us mid midstream surface ms and downstream downstream surface ds sites in february may august and october 2017 fig 1 for the upstream and midstream areas two water samples were collected from the western left riverbank and only one sample was collected from the eastern right bank because of lack of availability of the sampling boat surface water was collected near the bank but at least 3 m away from the shoreline where the water depth was over 1 m downstream samples were collected at three stations along the axis of the river at approximately 0 5 km intervals in the center of the river using a boat surface water within top 20 cm including the surface microlayer was manually collected using a stainless steel beaker 20 cm diameter with a handle mid water downstream midwater dm was collected only from the downstream area at 1 m above the benthic sediment using a submersible pump pd 272 wilo after flushing with water for the first 10 s at each station a total of 100 l of surface and mid water was collected and poured into a 20 μm mesh portable net to obtain volume reduced samples the volume reduced sample in the cod end of the net was transferred to a 1 l pre cleaned amber glass bottle because the 20 μm mesh net can be easily clogged by microorganisms particularly in algal blooming periods the sample volume was set as 100 l based on our previous study song et al 2018 the 100 l sampling size may miss or underestimate large plastic particles whose abundances are often very low but it is sufficient for evaluating the abundance of small microplastics a sampling size of 100 l or less of water has been used in numerous small microplastic monitoring studies leslie et al 2017 wang et al 2017 vermaire et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 sediment samples dsed were collected from the three downstream stations in may before the rainy season the samples were collected with a van veen grab and approximately the top 2 cm of the surface layer was placed into a 1 l amber glass bottle using a stainless steel spoon to identify the relationship between the abundance of microplastics and the amount of suspended solids ss 1 l of additional water was collected in a polyethylene bottle hplc grade water daejung chemicals korea was poured into three empty 1 l amber glass bottles at the sampling station as field blank samples all samples were taken to the laboratory and refrigerated until further microplastic analyses 2 3 analyses of water samples microplastics in the water were analyzed based on the method suggested by masura et al 2015 and song et al 2017 with some modifications fig s1 the sample was passed through a 20 μm sieve to drain off the water and the particles were washed on a sieve with hplc grade water to remove the remaining river water the front and back of the sieve were rinsed carefully with hplc grade water using a squeeze bottle to transfer the particles to 250 ml glass beakers which were then dried at 60 c in a drying oven wet peroxide oxidation was performed using 20 ml 35 h2o2 and fe ii solution on a hot plate 75 c 180 rpm for 30 min to remove organic matter hydrogen peroxide was added to the beaker every 30 min until no organic matter was visible the contents of the beaker were passed through the 20 μm sieve to drain the mixed solution and the particles were fully washed using hplc grade water particles on the sieve were transferred into a 250 ml glass density separation funnel using lithium metatungstate lmt solution and allowed to settle for 24 h the original density of lmt is 2 95 g cm3 but it was diluted with hplc grade water to 1 6 g cm3 to separate microplastics from denser inorganic particles the settled particles were drained and floating and suspended particles were filtered onto polycarbonate filter paper 5 μm 47 mm ø using a vacuum pump after the filter paper was dried in a glass petri dish at room temperature all plastic like particles on the filter paper were identified and the polymer type was confirmed using a fourier transform infrared ft ir microscope nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa in attenuated total reflectance mode each particle size was measured in the longest dimension with the digital ruler tool of ft ir the spectrum was recorded through 16 scans in the spectral range of 675 4000 cm 1 according to the number of microplastics identified on the filter paper 12 5 100 of the total filtered area was randomly examined and the partial values were converted to 100 values the minimum number of microplastic particles counted in a 12 5 area was 100 in our previous study random observations of 5 10 and 20 of the filter paper showed no significant differences in total particle counts 2 4 analyses of sediment samples from the 945 g sample of collected river sediment 100 g aliquot by wet weight was subsampled into a 600 ml pre cleaned wide neck glass bottle and dried at 60 c in a drying oven to determine the dry weight the same weight of wet sediment was transferred into a measuring cylinder and settled for 24 h and then the volume of sediment was measured dried samples were shaken with 300 ml lmt for 1 min after 10 min of settling the supernatant was transferred into a 1 l glass beaker this process was repeated twice with 200 ml lmt the beaker containing the supernatant was left for 24 h so that heavy particles would settle the supernatant in the beaker was passed through a 20 μm metal sieve and the remaining lmt solution in the sieve was washed with hplc grade water the particles on the sieve were transferred into a 250 ml glass beaker with hplc grade water the water in the beaker was fully dried in an oven at 60 c the subsequent procedure was the same as that used for water analyses 2 5 calculation of annual load of microplastics according to 5 years of average monthly precipitation and river discharge data the year was divided into four periods january february and march april may and june july august and september october november and december fig s2 the river discharge was calculated by dividing the river into two vertical portions at the downstream site surface from surface to 0 2 m and subsurface from 0 2 m to bottom their water discharge ratio was calculated as follows discharge through surface discharge 0 2 d discharge through subsurface discharge d 0 2 d where d is water depth m at downstream station and 0 2 means surface depth the load of microplastics carried by the nakdong river was calculated from the monthly average riverine water discharge and the representing abundance of microplastics during each period at the downstream site divided into surface and subsurface components table s2 the vertical and horizontal velocities of water and the distribution of microplastic vary in the cross section of the river dris et al 2018a but because it is impractical to consider all times and sections the four seasons and surface and mid waters were investigated it was assumed that the abundance of microplastic investigated in the four seasons february may august and october represented that in the aforementioned four periods monthly sub surface load monthly discharge through sub surface microplastic abundance of sub surface at each representing season monthly microplastic load monthly surface load monthly subsurface load for comparison the annual load of microplastics was additionally calculated by three other combinations of microplastic abundance and river water discharge see below section 3 4 and table 2 the annual load on a weight basis was calculated by converting the number of microplastics to weight based on their size and polymer density because mass is the product of volume and density the volume of each microplastic was determined and multiplied by a density of 1 04 g cm3 which is the average polymer density in the marine environment andrady 2011 besseling et al 2017 the volume of a microplastic particle was calculated according to its morphology fragment fiber sphere or film the shape of most of the fragments in the samples was flat under visual observation fig s3 the volume of the fragments was calculated assuming flat shape to reduce overestimation fragment and film types used a flat shape volume wherein the volume of the sphere was multiplied by 0 1 cozar et al 2014 fibers were calculated as a cylinder with a mean diameter of 20 μm fig s4 weight of non fiber 4 3πr3 1 04 α weight of fiber πr2h 1 04 where r is the radius for non fiber microplastics the measured length of individual plastic was used and for fiber particles the measured average radius 10 μm was used where α is the shape factor fragment and film 0 1 sphere 1 and h is the measured length of each fiber where 1 04 is the average polymer density g cm3 in the marine environment 2 6 suspended solids the samples of suspended solids were filtered onto pre weighed gf f filter paper using a vacuum pump the filter paper was dried at room temperature for more than 24 h and then weighed 2 7 quality control and blank test a field blank test was conducted using hplc grade water poured in the field to check for contamination throughout the experimental process triplicate blank samples were analyzed every sampling season n 12 and the analytical procedure was the same as that for sample analyses all plastic like particles on the filter paper were identified using a ft ir microscope a value three times the mean microplastic number identified from 12 field blank samples was set as the detection limit 3 particles filter paper corresponding to 30 particles m3 water sample all microplastic numbers counted on filter papers from samples were well above the detection limit at each step containers were covered with aluminum foil to avoid contamination with air cotton lab gowns and latex gloves were worn at all times all solutions except hplc grade water were filtered using gf f filter paper 0 45 μm 47 mm ø and all equipment was rinsed more than three times with hplc grade water prior to use a cleaned and dried sieve was used to obtain each sample total of 15 sieves per batch to avoid cross contamination of samples after use the sieve was rinsed with tap water and sonicated to remove any microplastics trapped in the sieve mesh in addition the dried sieve was cleaned with hplc grade water and an air gun directly before use 2 8 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed using the software program spss ver 19 ibm corp armonk ny usa the mean abundances of microplastics were compared seasonally and spatially with the kruskal wallis test followed by the mann whitney u test to compare the mean abundances of surface and mid water microplastics in the downstream area the mann whitney u test february and august and t test may and october were used the relationship between the abundance of microplastics and ss was analyzed using pearson correlation 3 results 3 1 abundance and spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics the mean abundance of microplastics in each triplicate set of samples was in the range of 293 us in feb to 4760 ds in aug particles m3 in water across the four seasons and 1971 particles kg dry weight 37311 particles m2 from the top 2 cm in sediment in may 2017 table 1 the fragment type accounted for 69 of total plastics in water samples followed by fibers 30 the proportion of spheres and films accounted for less than 1 fragments were also the most abundant type in the sediment 84 followed by fibers 15 and spheres 1 the film type was not observed in sediments the fragment type was predominant in microplastics 300 μm see below section 3 3 when the proportions of microplastic types 300 μm in size was considered fiber accounted for 78 in water and 34 in sediment the spatial distribution shows that the abundance of microplastics tended to increase toward the downstream but the only significant difference kruskal wallis test p 0 05 was found between us and ms due to the high seasonal variability of ds fig 2 a the mean abundance of microplastics in the downstream area was three times higher at the surface than in mid water but there were no significant differences mann whitney u test p 0 05 except for february fig s5 the temporal distribution indicated that the abundance of microplastics was relatively high in august and february representative of the wet and dry seasons respectively and these samples were significantly different kruskal wallis test p 0 05 from may fig 2b the proportion of fibers also increased toward the downstream and was relatively high in february and august when total microplastic abundances were high no statistical pearson correlation p 0 05 correlations were found between the abundance of microplastics and suspended solid concentration fig s6 3 2 polymer composition of microplastics the polymer types of all microplastics n 7466 were identified using ft ir spectroscopy among all water samples 30 different types of polymers were identified polypropylene pp 41 8 of the total microplastics identified was the most abundant polymer type followed by polyester pes 23 1 polyethylene pe 9 4 polyamide pa 5 8 polystyrene ps 2 1 alkyd 4 2 acrylic 3 2 poly ethylene vinyl acetate 2 6 polyurethane pu 1 4 poly vinyl chloride pvc 1 1 and poly acrylate styrene 1 other polymers accounted for less than 1 of microplastics in the sediment samples 22 polymer types were identified the polymer composition of sediment was 24 8 pp 24 5 pe 5 5 pes 5 4 pvc 5 3 ps 4 6 acrylic 4 5 polydimethylsiloxane 3 9 pu 3 7 poly acrylate styrene and 3 6 poly lauryl acrylate other polymers accounted for less than 3 comparing the polymer composition of the surface and mid water at the downstream site their compositions and proportions of major polymers were similar surface water was composed of 26 pp 30 pes 7 pe 10 pa and 6 alkyd similarly mid water was composed of 34 pp 23 pes 8 pe 8 pa and 5 alkyd 3 3 size distribution of microplastics among the total microplastic abundance in all water samples the peak size range was 50 150 μm fig 3 a and b the mean and median sizes were 265 and 154 μm respectively microplastics smaller than 300 μm in size accounted for 74 of the total microplastic particles the size range of 100 150 μm also showed the maximum microplastic abundance in the sediment samples fig 3c and d the mean and median sizes were 248 and 155 μm respectively microplastics smaller than 300 μm in size accounted for 81 of the total abundance in sediment samples regardless of sampling time and location the abundance of microplastics increased as particle size decreased and then decreased below a specific size threshold fig s7 3 4 annual load of microplastics through the nakdong river the estimated total annual load in the nakdong river reflecting the abundance of microplastics in both surface and subsurface water at the river mouth across four seasons was 5 4 trillion particles or 53 3 tons in 2017 case 1 fig 4 table 2 among them the proportions input through surface and subsurface waters were 8 and 92 respectively the three months of the wet season jul sep accounted for 71 of the number and 81 of the weight of the estimated annual microplastic load when the average abundance of microplastic in surface and mid water was used across four seasons the annual load was 11 trillion y or 118 tons y case 2 the total annual load calculated from the microplastic abundance data in the surface water alone was 17 trillion y or 185 tons y case 3 considering only the wet season august and surface microplastic abundance which represent the usual sampling period and layer respectively the annual load was 70 trillion y or 630 tons y case 4 4 discussion 4 1 abundance of microplastic the average abundance of microplastic in the nakdong river was 1 4 orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported in river water dris et al 2018b and was comparable to or lower than those reported in china zhao et al 2014 2015 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 due to differences in sampling and analytical methods and abundance units used among previous studies direct comparison of the abundance of microplastics has limitations in particular the minimum cut off size of microplastic sampling and analysis is crucial for such comparisons because many studies have used a manta trawl or neuston net to collect microplastics from surface waters microplastics smaller than the mesh size e g 300 μm were generally missed eo et al 2018 study on a sand beach in south korea and this study in the nakdong river showed that microplastics smaller than 300 μm accounted for 81 and 74 by number respectively analyses of sediment samples from the german bight showed that the abundance of microplastics increased as their size decreased primpke et al 2017 most studies that have investigated microplastics down to 30 or 50 μm in size have reported relatively high abundances of microplastic compared to studies that have investigated only particles 300 μm rodrigues et al 2018 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 river sediment is considered to be a temporary repository of sunken microplastics and microplastics accumulate over the dry season nel et al 2018 in this study microplastic abundance in sediment was 2827 times using the same units of particles m3 higher than in surface water at the downstream site in may before the rainy season in a previous study compared to water the sediment contained 1 4 orders of magnitude higher abundances of microplastics in xiangxi bay china zhang et al 2017 4 2 spatial distribution of microplastics sampling location can affect the abundance of microplastics the mean abundance of microplastics and the population of each catchment showed an increasing trend in the downstream direction in this study fig s8 the number of sewage and wastewater treatment facilities showed the same trend and total processing capacity was higher in mid and downstream than in upstream areas fig s9 these results support hypothesis i that microplastic pollution is affected by the population size or population density and the sewage and wastewater treatment facilities in the study area relatively high abundances of microplastic were also found in urbanized industrialized and densely populated areas in other studies zbyszewski and corcoran 2011 castañeda et al 2014 rech et al 2014 yonkos et al 2014 lima et al 2014 mani et al 2015 wang et al 2017 dris et al 2018a furthermore in the present study the population was higher in the downstream catchment but the processing capacity of sewage and wastewater treatment plants was lower in the downstream than in the midstream areas insufficient processing capacity of sewage and wastewater treatment plants relative to population in downstream areas may enhance the input of microplastics in those areas a previous study reported that the microplastic in the influent of a wastewater treatment plants was reduced by 98 in the final effluent murphy et al 2016 the proportion of fibers tended to increase toward downstream with high abundances in february and august the fibers observed in this study were mainly composed of pes pa acrylic and pp which are commonly used in fabrics and rope laundry drain water from washing machines was considered a major input source of fibers from households browne et al 2011 hartline et al 2016 hernandez et al 2017 another source of fiber is deposition from the atmosphere dris et al 2017 fiber can be deposited directly into the river or onto urban surfaces and then washed into the river by surface runoff after heavy rain 4 3 temporal distribution of microplastic the wet season in south korea august showed the highest microplastic abundance although there was no statistically significant difference from february the abundance was significantly higher than in may and october thus hypothesis ii is partially supported in the study area the microplastic abundance was high in periods such as the wet season spring tide and after typhoons and flooding in other studies sadri and thompson 2014 yonkos et al 2014 lima et al 2014 hurley et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2018 heavy rain induces runoff in adjacent areas leading to inflow of microplastics from land into the river during wet periods lima et al 2014 during the rainy season large amounts of river water discharge and fast water flow re suspend and transport microplastics that were previously deposited on the river bottom hurley et al 2018 this process causes water concentrations of microplastics to increase sharply due to resuspension during the rainy season this finding was partly supported by the high similarity of polymer composition between the sediment in may and water samples in august rather than that in may fig s10 aside from the high fiber abundance in the water in august the proportion of pe increased from 2 in ds in may to 10 in ds in august which may have been affected by re suspension of pe from the sediment 25 during the rainy season the relatively high pes abundance observed in august was likely from a different source such as increased sewage and surface runoff inputs in august in this context the abundance of microplastics in river water could be underestimated if sampling is performed only in the dry season xiong et al 2019 unexpectedly the microplastic abundance in surface water at ds was higher in february than in may and october but this pattern was not observed in us and ms because monthly average precipitation is low in february the input of microplastics through surface runoff is expected to also be low total precipitation for the 10 days prior to each sampling date in the downstream area data from a local station in busan city was 5 1 mm in february 0 mm in may 54 mm in august and 1 2 mm in october episodic precipitation in the dry season may influence the temporal increase in microplastic abundance the relatively large proportion of fibers during the dry season also implies that there was additional episodic input of fibers from land based sources before sampling additional sampling at a higher time resolution is required before and after precipitation events to test this hypothesis 4 4 differences in composition in surface water water column and sediment microplastics the size morphology and polymer composition of microplastics in downstream surface water and the water column were similar thus hypothesis iii was rejected in the study area the polymer types found in the surface water and water column were similar with more than 50 consisting of pp and pes in the ocean surface and subsurface waters can be mixed physically by wind kukulka et al 2012 river water flow may produce additional turbulence to mix the surface and subsurface water because the depth of the nakdong river at the downstream site is approximately 8 m physical mixing alone does not explain this compositional similarity interactions of aggregates biofouling and fecal matter may lead to increased density of microplastics along with decreased buoyancy and thus enhance their settling long et al 2015 cole et al 2016 rummel et al 2017 porter et al 2018 the presence of a high proportion of low density polymers pe and pp 49 in the sediment can also be explained by these reasons other studies have also observed low density polymers such as pe and pp in freshwater sediments for example large amounts of pe beads were found in st lawrence river sediment castañeda et al 2014 and pe or pp pellets were found in lake ontario sediment canada corcoran et al 2015 pe 53 3 and pp 30 were the dominant polymers in bay of brest sediment from france frere et al 2017 the most abundant types accounting for more than 82 of the total small microplastics 1 mm were pe and pp in sediments of the lagoon of venice italy vianello et al 2013 4 5 annual load of microplastics cases 1 and 2 in this study which considered the difference in abundance between surface and subsurface water as well as seasonal variation are more acceptable than cases 3 and 4 in case 3 where only surface water microplastic abundance was considered and its abundance was extrapolated to the entire water column the annual load was overestimated by about 2 3 times by number or 3 1 times by weight relative to case 1 the value of case 4 was calculated as the worst case scenario but it was 13 times by number and 12 times by weight higher than case 1 calculating the load carried by an entire river using the microplastic abundance of only the surface water or one particular season can result in under or overestimation of the load in future studies it would be useful to obtain a vertical profile of microplastic abundance in the river mouth at higher spatial and temporal resolution to yield a more realistic estimate of the annual load of microplastic delivered to the ocean lebreton et al 2017 estimated that 1 15 to 2 41 million ton y of micro and macroplastic waste entered the ocean this value is considerably higher than our estimate because we included only microplastics microplastics are present in high numbers with low mass compared to macroplastics when the model prediction of the annual plastic load in the nakdong river estimated by lebreton et al 2017 was converted into microplastic load the low mid and high points of the load were 1 1 9 and 5 4 ton y respectively our calculation based on in situ observation data from 2017 had a 27 fold higher value than the midpoint of the model prediction 5 conclusions the spatiotemporal distribution and characteristics of microplastics were investigated in the nakdong river in south korea the results show that some microplastics vary significantly in abundance and composition among sampling locations and seasons in addition the microplastic abundance in surface water was about three times greater than that in mid water in this study 70 80 of the annual microplastic load to the ocean occurred in the wet season and 92 of microplastics were carried in the water column additionally the annual load of microplastic in the worst case scenario based on abundances from the wet season and surface water was about 13 times by number or 12 times by weight higher than our estimate when calculating the annual load of microplastics it is essential to use their abundance data in the surface and water column during at least two seasons including the wet and dry seasons declaration of interests the

18737,although rivers represent an important pathway for the transport of microplastics to the oceans research on riverine microplastics is limited compared to the marine environment hence we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics in the nakdong river down to 20 μm in size and characterized them using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in surface and mid waters and sediment the mean standard deviation abundance of microplastic in the nakdong river was in the range of 293 83 upstream february 2017 to 4760 5242 downstream august 2017 particles m3 in water and 1970 62 particles kg in sediment the abundance of microplastics was about three times higher in surface than mid waters in the downstream area polypropylene and polyester accounted for 41 8 and 23 1 of microplastics in the water respectively whereas about 50 in the sediment was composed of polypropylene and polyethylene microplastics smaller than 300 μm in size accounted for 74 in the water and 81 in sediment and the distribution peaked in the 50 150 μm size range based on these results we estimated the annual load of microplastics carried by the nakdong river in 2017 to be 5 4 11 trillion by number and 53 3 118 tons by weight the proportions of the total load transported through surface water and the water column were 8 and 92 respectively in addition the microplastic load was concentrated in the wet season which makes up 71 in number and 81 in weight these results indicate that it is necessary to reflect seasonal variation and sample both in the surface water and water column to estimate microplastic transport without considering these factors the annual load of microplastics may be overestimated or underestimated graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics

of riverine microplastic have been limited compared to those of marine microplastic and investigation of riverine microplastic has only recently been carried out eerkes medrano et al 2015 rochman 2018 the occurrence of microplastics in freshwater systems has been reported in asia zhao et al 2014 free et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 su et al 2016 wang et al 2017 europe lechner et al 2014 mani et al 2015

four seasons yonkos et al 2014 dris et al 2018a are scant and hence there is a general lack of information about the seasonal distribution of microplastics freshwater invertebrates daphnia magna chironomus riparius physella acuta gammarus pulex and lumbriculus variegatus ingest polystyrene spheres 1 10 and 90 μm in size in laboratory exposure experiments scherer et al 2017 and the

μm most freshwater studies have reported on microplastics larger than 330 μm collected using a manta or neuston net 330 μm mesh size from surface waters li et al 2018b there has been mis match in microplastic size for the ingestion and monitoring studies because microplastic investigations have mainly targeted surface waters there is little information available about riverine transport of microplastics through the water column as large plastic litter can be transferred along the bottoms of rivers morritt et al 2014 microplastics are also likely to be transported through the mid and bottom water the presence of microplastic has been confirmed in the bottom of a river in southern california moore et al 2011 in a tropical estuary in brazil the abundance of microplastic in the bottom water was comparable to that at the surface and was higher than surface abundances in the late rainy season lima et al 2014 investigation of microfibers in three water column layers at a depth of 2 6 m showed that the vertical variability was negligible dris et al 2018a microplastic is mainly concentrated in the surface layer song et al 2014 but a significant amount of microplastics were also found in water column in coastal environment song et al 2018 on the other hand a spot test at approximately 5 m depth in the rhine river showed no measurable microplastic particles mani et al 2015 the sediment serves as a reservoir of microplastics kapp and yeatman 2018 flooding exported approximately 70 of the microplastics stored in river beds in northwest england hurley et al 2018 the resuspension of microplastic deposited in sediment can constitute an additional source of microplastic in the water column to understand the role of sediment as a source and sink of microplastic it is necessary to investigate microplastic in sediment as well as in water and to compare them at the same time the seasonal and annual input loads of microplastics through riverine discharge can be a crucial factor influencing microplastic abundance and composition in receiving coastal waters and deposition onto adjacent shorelines rech et al 2014 regional input amount of river plastics to oceans varies seasonally by continent lebreton et al 2017 micro and mesoplastic litter input from the river danube into the black sea has been estimated to be 4 2 t per day lechner et al 2014 in a modeling study it was estimated that between 1 15 and 2 41 million tons of both macro and microplastic waste enters the ocean every year from rivers and the continent of asia is the dominant contributor of plastic litter lebreton et al 2017 however without considering microplastics less than 300 μm water column transportation and seasonal variation it is possible to overestimate or underestimate the annual riverine load of microplastics to the ocean in this study we aimed to investigate spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics in the nakdong river including characteristics of microplastic contamination in surface water water column and benthic sediment and to estimate annual load of microplastics through the river for this purpose we tested the following hypotheses hypothesis i is that microplastic abundance in water is relatively high according to the population in the river catchment from up to downstream along the course of a river the microplastic abundance can vary due to nearby sources such as highly populated cities and waste and sewage treatment plants hypothesis ii is that microplastic abundance is highest during the rainy season the abundance of microplastics entering the ocean through the river will also vary seasonally high precipitation during the summer monsoon may increase the waterborne microplastic abundance in rivers by carrying microplastics deposited in the watershed as well as by resuspension of microplastics deposited on the river bottom hypothesis iii is that microplastics denser than river water move mainly through the water column rather than in surface water microplastics have different densities according to their polymer types and the vertical movement of microplastics will vary according to density to test these hypotheses microplastic particles down to 20 μm in size were sampled seasonally from surface waters at up mid and downstream locations of the nakdong river in south korea microplastic abundances in the water column and surface bottom sediments were additionally investigated at the downstream site furthermore the amount of microplastic introduced into the ocean via the nakdong river was estimated using these in situ observations of microplastics and annual water discharge data to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to estimate the annual input of microplastics down to 20 μm in size while considering surface and subsurface and seasonal variation in microplastic abundance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nakdong river the second largest river in south korea was investigated the up mid and downstream watersheds have areas of 9336 5991 and 6261 km2 respectively table s1 population densities in the up mid and downstream areas were 76 606 and 950 inhabitants km2 respectively the midstream portion passes through daegu population 2484688 the fourth largest city in south korea and the downstream stretch passes through busan 3496779 the nation s second largest city there are 106 135 and 240 sewage and wastewater treatment facilities sewage 500 m3 day and sewage 500 m3 day including excreta industrial agricultural and livestock waste in the up mid and downstream areas respectively and their total processing capacities are 222091 2804167 and 1250545 m3 day busan development institute 2011 the salinity of downstream sampling site was below 0 2 psμ indicating that there was no saltwater intrusion to the sampling site 2 2 sample collection surface water samples were collected in triplicate from the up upstream surface us mid midstream surface ms and downstream downstream surface ds sites in february may august and october 2017 fig 1 for the upstream and midstream areas two water samples were collected from the western left riverbank and only one sample was collected from the eastern right bank because of lack of availability of the sampling boat surface water was collected near the bank but at least 3 m away from the shoreline where the water depth was over 1 m downstream samples were collected at three stations along the axis of the river at approximately 0 5 km intervals in the center of the river using a boat surface water within top 20 cm including the surface microlayer was manually collected using a stainless steel beaker 20 cm diameter with a handle mid water downstream midwater dm was collected only from the downstream area at 1 m above the benthic sediment using a submersible pump pd 272 wilo after flushing with water for the first 10 s at each station a total of 100 l of surface and mid water was collected and poured into a 20 μm mesh portable net to obtain volume reduced samples the volume reduced sample in the cod end of the net was transferred to a 1 l pre cleaned amber glass bottle because the 20 μm mesh net can be easily clogged by microorganisms particularly in algal blooming periods the sample volume was set as 100 l based on our previous study song et al 2018 the 100 l sampling size may miss or underestimate large plastic particles whose abundances are often very low but it is sufficient for evaluating the abundance of small microplastics a sampling size of 100 l or less of water has been used in numerous small microplastic monitoring studies leslie et al 2017 wang et al 2017 vermaire et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 sediment samples dsed were collected from the three downstream stations in may before the rainy season the samples were collected with a van veen grab and approximately the top 2 cm of the surface layer was placed into a 1 l amber glass bottle using a stainless steel spoon to identify the relationship between the abundance of microplastics and the amount of suspended solids ss 1 l of additional water was collected in a polyethylene bottle hplc grade water daejung chemicals korea was poured into three empty 1 l amber glass bottles at the sampling station as field blank samples all samples were taken to the laboratory and refrigerated until further microplastic analyses 2 3 analyses of water samples microplastics in the water were analyzed based on the method suggested by masura et al 2015 and song et al 2017 with some modifications fig s1 the sample was passed through a 20 μm sieve to drain off the water and the particles were washed on a sieve with hplc grade water to remove the remaining river water the front and back of the sieve were rinsed carefully with hplc grade water using a squeeze bottle to transfer the particles to 250 ml glass beakers which were then dried at 60 c in a drying oven wet peroxide oxidation was performed using 20 ml 35 h2o2 and fe ii solution on a hot plate 75 c 180 rpm for 30 min to remove organic matter hydrogen peroxide was added to the beaker every 30 min until no organic matter was visible the contents of the beaker were passed through the 20 μm sieve to drain the mixed solution and the particles were fully washed using hplc grade water particles on the sieve were transferred into a 250 ml glass density separation funnel using lithium metatungstate lmt solution and allowed to settle for 24 h the original density of lmt is 2 95 g cm3 but it was diluted with hplc grade water to 1 6 g cm3 to separate microplastics from denser inorganic particles the settled particles were drained and floating and suspended particles were filtered onto polycarbonate filter paper 5 μm 47 mm ø using a vacuum pump after the filter paper was dried in a glass petri dish at room temperature all plastic like particles on the filter paper were identified and the polymer type was confirmed using a fourier transform infrared ft ir microscope nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa in attenuated total reflectance mode each particle size was measured in the longest dimension with the digital ruler tool of ft ir the spectrum was recorded through 16 scans in the spectral range of 675 4000 cm 1 according to the number of microplastics identified on the filter paper 12 5 100 of the total filtered area was randomly examined and the partial values were converted to 100 values the minimum number of microplastic particles counted in a 12 5 area was 100 in our previous study random observations of 5 10 and 20 of the filter paper showed no significant differences in total particle counts 2 4 analyses of sediment samples from the 945 g sample of collected river sediment 100 g aliquot by wet weight was subsampled into a 600 ml pre cleaned wide neck glass bottle and dried at 60 c in a drying oven to determine the dry weight the same weight of wet sediment was transferred into a measuring cylinder and settled for 24 h and then the volume of sediment was measured dried samples were shaken with 300 ml lmt for 1 min after 10 min of settling the supernatant was transferred into a 1 l glass beaker this process was repeated twice with 200 ml lmt the beaker containing the supernatant was left for 24 h so that heavy particles would settle the supernatant in the beaker was passed through a 20 μm metal sieve and the remaining lmt solution in the sieve was washed with hplc grade water the particles on the sieve were transferred into a 250 ml glass beaker with hplc grade water the water in the beaker was fully dried in an oven at 60 c the subsequent procedure was the same as that used for water analyses 2 5 calculation of annual load of microplastics according to 5 years of average monthly precipitation and river discharge data the year was divided into four periods january february and march april may and june july august and september october november and december fig s2 the river discharge was calculated by dividing the river into two vertical portions at the downstream site surface from surface to 0 2 m and subsurface from 0 2 m to bottom their water discharge ratio was calculated as follows discharge through surface discharge 0 2 d discharge through subsurface discharge d 0 2 d where d is water depth m at downstream station and 0 2 means surface depth the load of microplastics carried by the nakdong river was calculated from the monthly average riverine water discharge and the representing abundance of microplastics during each period at the downstream site divided into surface and subsurface components table s2 the vertical and horizontal velocities of water and the distribution of microplastic vary in the cross section of the river dris et al 2018a but because it is impractical to consider all times and sections the four seasons and surface and mid waters were investigated it was assumed that the abundance of microplastic investigated in the four seasons february may august and october represented that in the aforementioned four periods monthly sub surface load monthly discharge through sub surface microplastic abundance of sub surface at each representing season monthly microplastic load monthly surface load monthly subsurface load for comparison the annual load of microplastics was additionally calculated by three other combinations of microplastic abundance and river water discharge see below section 3 4 and table 2 the annual load on a weight basis was calculated by converting the number of microplastics to weight based on their size and polymer density because mass is the product of volume and density the volume of each microplastic was determined and multiplied by a density of 1 04 g cm3 which is the average polymer density in the marine environment andrady 2011 besseling et al 2017 the volume of a microplastic particle was calculated according to its morphology fragment fiber sphere or film the shape of most of the fragments in the samples was flat under visual observation fig s3 the volume of the fragments was calculated assuming flat shape to reduce overestimation fragment and film types used a flat shape volume wherein the volume of the sphere was multiplied by 0 1 cozar et al 2014 fibers were calculated as a cylinder with a mean diameter of 20 μm fig s4 weight of non fiber 4 3πr3 1 04 α weight of fiber πr2h 1 04 where r is the radius for non fiber microplastics the measured length of individual plastic was used and for fiber particles the measured average radius 10 μm was used where α is the shape factor fragment and film 0 1 sphere 1 and h is the measured length of each fiber where 1 04 is the average polymer density g cm3 in the marine environment 2 6 suspended solids the samples of suspended solids were filtered onto pre weighed gf f filter paper using a vacuum pump the filter paper was dried at room temperature for more than 24 h and then weighed 2 7 quality control and blank test a field blank test was conducted using hplc grade water poured in the field to check for contamination throughout the experimental process triplicate blank samples were analyzed every sampling season n 12 and the analytical procedure was the same as that for sample analyses all plastic like particles on the filter paper were identified using a ft ir microscope a value three times the mean microplastic number identified from 12 field blank samples was set as the detection limit 3 particles filter paper corresponding to 30 particles m3 water sample all microplastic numbers counted on filter papers from samples were well above the detection limit at each step containers were covered with aluminum foil to avoid contamination with air cotton lab gowns and latex gloves were worn at all times all solutions except hplc grade water were filtered using gf f filter paper 0 45 μm 47 mm ø and all equipment was rinsed more than three times with hplc grade water prior to use a cleaned and dried sieve was used to obtain each sample total of 15 sieves per batch to avoid cross contamination of samples after use the sieve was rinsed with tap water and sonicated to remove any microplastics trapped in the sieve mesh in addition the dried sieve was cleaned with hplc grade water and an air gun directly before use 2 8 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed using the software program spss ver 19 ibm corp armonk ny usa the mean abundances of microplastics were compared seasonally and spatially with the kruskal wallis test followed by the mann whitney u test to compare the mean abundances of surface and mid water microplastics in the downstream area the mann whitney u test february and august and t test may and october were used the relationship between the abundance of microplastics and ss was analyzed using pearson correlation 3 results 3 1 abundance and spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics the mean abundance of microplastics in each triplicate set of samples was in the range of 293 us in feb to 4760 ds in aug particles m3 in water across the four seasons and 1971 particles kg dry weight 37311 particles m2 from the top 2 cm in sediment in may 2017 table 1 the fragment type accounted for 69 of total plastics in water samples followed by fibers 30 the proportion of spheres and films accounted for less than 1 fragments were also the most abundant type in the sediment 84 followed by fibers 15 and spheres 1 the film type was not observed in sediments the fragment type was predominant in microplastics 300 μm see below section 3 3 when the proportions of microplastic types 300 μm in size was considered fiber accounted for 78 in water and 34 in sediment the spatial distribution shows that the abundance of microplastics tended to increase toward the downstream but the only significant difference kruskal wallis test p 0 05 was found between us and ms due to the high seasonal variability of ds fig 2 a the mean abundance of microplastics in the downstream area was three times higher at the surface than in mid water but there were no significant differences mann whitney u test p 0 05 except for february fig s5 the temporal distribution indicated that the abundance of microplastics was relatively high in august and february representative of the wet and dry seasons respectively and these samples were significantly different kruskal wallis test p 0 05 from may fig 2b the proportion of fibers also increased toward the downstream and was relatively high in february and august when total microplastic abundances were high no statistical pearson correlation p 0 05 correlations were found between the abundance of microplastics and suspended solid concentration fig s6 3 2 polymer composition of microplastics the polymer types of all microplastics n 7466 were identified using ft ir spectroscopy among all water samples 30 different types of polymers were identified polypropylene pp 41 8 of the total microplastics identified was the most abundant polymer type followed by polyester pes 23 1 polyethylene pe 9 4 polyamide pa 5 8 polystyrene ps 2 1 alkyd 4 2 acrylic 3 2 poly ethylene vinyl acetate 2 6 polyurethane pu 1 4 poly vinyl chloride pvc 1 1 and poly acrylate styrene 1 other polymers accounted for less than 1 of microplastics in the sediment samples 22 polymer types were identified the polymer composition of sediment was 24 8 pp 24 5 pe 5 5 pes 5 4 pvc 5 3 ps 4 6 acrylic 4 5 polydimethylsiloxane 3 9 pu 3 7 poly acrylate styrene and 3 6 poly lauryl acrylate other polymers accounted for less than 3 comparing the polymer composition of the surface and mid water at the downstream site their compositions and proportions of major polymers were similar surface water was composed of 26 pp 30 pes 7 pe 10 pa and 6 alkyd similarly mid water was composed of 34 pp 23 pes 8 pe 8 pa and 5 alkyd 3 3 size distribution of microplastics among the total microplastic abundance in all water samples the peak size range was 50 150 μm fig 3 a and b the mean and median sizes were 265 and 154 μm respectively microplastics smaller than 300 μm in size accounted for 74 of the total microplastic particles the size range of 100 150 μm also showed the maximum microplastic abundance in the sediment samples fig 3c and d the mean and median sizes were 248 and 155 μm respectively microplastics smaller than 300 μm in size accounted for 81 of the total abundance in sediment samples regardless of sampling time and location the abundance of microplastics increased as particle size decreased and then decreased below a specific size threshold fig s7 3 4 annual load of microplastics through the nakdong river the estimated total annual load in the nakdong river reflecting the abundance of microplastics in both surface and subsurface water at the river mouth across four seasons was 5 4 trillion particles or 53 3 tons in 2017 case 1 fig 4 table 2 among them the proportions input through surface and subsurface waters were 8 and 92 respectively the three months of the wet season jul sep accounted for 71 of the number and 81 of the weight of the estimated annual microplastic load when the average abundance of microplastic in surface and mid water was used across four seasons the annual load was 11 trillion y or 118 tons y case 2 the total annual load calculated from the microplastic abundance data in the surface water alone was 17 trillion y or 185 tons y case 3 considering only the wet season august and surface microplastic abundance which represent the usual sampling period and layer respectively the annual load was 70 trillion y or 630 tons y case 4 4 discussion 4 1 abundance of microplastic the average abundance of microplastic in the nakdong river was 1 4 orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported in river water dris et al 2018b and was comparable to or lower than those reported in china zhao et al 2014 2015 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2019 due to differences in sampling and analytical methods and abundance units used among previous studies direct comparison of the abundance of microplastics has limitations in particular the minimum cut off size of microplastic sampling and analysis is crucial for such comparisons because many studies have used a manta trawl or neuston net to collect microplastics from surface waters microplastics smaller than the mesh size e g 300 μm were generally missed eo et al 2018 study on a sand beach in south korea and this study in the nakdong river showed that microplastics smaller than 300 μm accounted for 81 and 74 by number respectively analyses of sediment samples from the german bight showed that the abundance of microplastics increased as their size decreased primpke et al 2017 most studies that have investigated microplastics down to 30 or 50 μm in size have reported relatively high abundances of microplastic compared to studies that have investigated only particles 300 μm rodrigues et al 2018 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 river sediment is considered to be a temporary repository of sunken microplastics and microplastics accumulate over the dry season nel et al 2018 in this study microplastic abundance in sediment was 2827 times using the same units of particles m3 higher than in surface water at the downstream site in may before the rainy season in a previous study compared to water the sediment contained 1 4 orders of magnitude higher abundances of microplastics in xiangxi bay china zhang et al 2017 4 2 spatial distribution of microplastics sampling location can affect the abundance of microplastics the mean abundance of microplastics and the population of each catchment showed an increasing trend in the downstream direction in this study fig s8 the number of sewage and wastewater treatment facilities showed the same trend and total processing capacity was higher in mid and downstream than in upstream areas fig s9 these results support hypothesis i that microplastic pollution is affected by the population size or population density and the sewage and wastewater treatment facilities in the study area relatively high abundances of microplastic were also found in urbanized industrialized and densely populated areas in other studies zbyszewski and corcoran 2011 castañeda et al 2014 rech et al 2014 yonkos et al 2014 lima et al 2014 mani et al 2015 wang et al 2017 dris et al 2018a furthermore in the present study the population was higher in the downstream catchment but the processing capacity of sewage and wastewater treatment plants was lower in the downstream than in the midstream areas insufficient processing capacity of sewage and wastewater treatment plants relative to population in downstream areas may enhance the input of microplastics in those areas a previous study reported that the microplastic in the influent of a wastewater treatment plants was reduced by 98 in the final effluent murphy et al 2016 the proportion of fibers tended to increase toward downstream with high abundances in february and august the fibers observed in this study were mainly composed of pes pa acrylic and pp which are commonly used in fabrics and rope laundry drain water from washing machines was considered a major input source of fibers from households browne et al 2011 hartline et al 2016 hernandez et al 2017 another source of fiber is deposition from the atmosphere dris et al 2017 fiber can be deposited directly into the river or onto urban surfaces and then washed into the river by surface runoff after heavy rain 4 3 temporal distribution of microplastic the wet season in south korea august showed the highest microplastic abundance although there was no statistically significant difference from february the abundance was significantly higher than in may and october thus hypothesis ii is partially supported in the study area the microplastic abundance was high in periods such as the wet season spring tide and after typhoons and flooding in other studies sadri and thompson 2014 yonkos et al 2014 lima et al 2014 hurley et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2018 heavy rain induces runoff in adjacent areas leading to inflow of microplastics from land into the river during wet periods lima et al 2014 during the rainy season large amounts of river water discharge and fast water flow re suspend and transport microplastics that were previously deposited on the river bottom hurley et al 2018 this process causes water concentrations of microplastics to increase sharply due to resuspension during the rainy season this finding was partly supported by the high similarity of polymer composition between the sediment in may and water samples in august rather than that in may fig s10 aside from the high fiber abundance in the water in august the proportion of pe increased from 2 in ds in may to 10 in ds in august which may have been affected by re suspension of pe from the sediment 25 during the rainy season the relatively high pes abundance observed in august was likely from a different source such as increased sewage and surface runoff inputs in august in this context the abundance of microplastics in river water could be underestimated if sampling is performed only in the dry season xiong et al 2019 unexpectedly the microplastic abundance in surface water at ds was higher in february than in may and october but this pattern was not observed in us and ms because monthly average precipitation is low in february the input of microplastics through surface runoff is expected to also be low total precipitation for the 10 days prior to each sampling date in the downstream area data from a local station in busan city was 5 1 mm in february 0 mm in may 54 mm in august and 1 2 mm in october episodic precipitation in the dry season may influence the temporal increase in microplastic abundance the relatively large proportion of fibers during the dry season also implies that there was additional episodic input of fibers from land based sources before sampling additional sampling at a higher time resolution is required before and after precipitation events to test this hypothesis 4 4 differences in composition in surface water water column and sediment microplastics the size morphology and polymer composition of microplastics in downstream surface water and the water column were similar thus hypothesis iii was rejected in the study area the polymer types found in the surface water and water column were similar with more than 50 consisting of pp and pes in the ocean surface and subsurface waters can be mixed physically by wind kukulka et al 2012 river water flow may produce additional turbulence to mix the surface and subsurface water because the depth of the nakdong river at the downstream site is approximately 8 m physical mixing alone does not explain this compositional similarity interactions of aggregates biofouling and fecal matter may lead to increased density of microplastics along with decreased buoyancy and thus enhance their settling long et al 2015 cole et al 2016 rummel et al 2017 porter et al 2018 the presence of a high proportion of low density polymers pe and pp 49 in the sediment can also be explained by these reasons other studies have also observed low density polymers such as pe and pp in freshwater sediments for example large amounts of pe beads were found in st lawrence river sediment castañeda et al 2014 and pe or pp pellets were found in lake ontario sediment canada corcoran et al 2015 pe 53 3 and pp 30 were the dominant polymers in bay of brest sediment from france frere et al 2017 the most abundant types accounting for more than 82 of the total small microplastics 1 mm were pe and pp in sediments of the lagoon of venice italy vianello et al 2013 4 5 annual load of microplastics cases 1 and 2 in this study which considered the difference in abundance between surface and subsurface water as well as seasonal variation are more acceptable than cases 3 and 4 in case 3 where only surface water microplastic abundance was considered and its abundance was extrapolated to the entire water column the annual load was overestimated by about 2 3 times by number or 3 1 times by weight relative to case 1 the value of case 4 was calculated as the worst case scenario but it was 13 times by number and 12 times by weight higher than case 1 calculating the load carried by an entire river using the microplastic abundance of only the surface water or one particular season can result in under or overestimation of the load in future studies it would be useful to obtain a vertical profile of microplastic abundance in the river mouth at higher spatial and temporal resolution to yield a more realistic estimate of the annual load of microplastic delivered to the ocean lebreton et al 2017 estimated that 1 15 to 2 41 million ton y of micro and macroplastic waste entered the ocean this value is considerably higher than our estimate because we included only microplastics microplastics are present in high numbers with low mass compared to macroplastics when the model prediction of the annual plastic load in the nakdong river estimated by lebreton et al 2017 was converted into microplastic load the low mid and high points of the load were 1 1 9 and 5 4 ton y respectively our calculation based on in situ observation data from 2017 had a 27 fold higher value than the midpoint of the model prediction 5 conclusions the spatiotemporal distribution and characteristics of microplastics were investigated in the nakdong river in south korea the results show that some microplastics vary significantly in abundance and composition among sampling locations and seasons in addition the microplastic abundance in surface water was about three times greater than that in mid water in this study 70 80 of the annual microplastic load to the ocean occurred in the wet season and 92 of microplastics were carried in the water column additionally the annual load of microplastic in the worst case scenario based on abundances from the wet season and surface water was about 13 times by number or 12 times by weight higher than our estimate when calculating the annual load of microplastics it is essential to use their abundance data in the surface and water column during at least two seasons including the wet and dry seasons declaration of interests the

18738,this study investigated the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 activation potential of fe mn binary oxides modified bio char femn bio char for the degradation of naphthalene the dominant pahs in drinking water results showed that femn bio char exhibited 80 7 and 2 18 times decomposition rates towards h2o2 than that of pure bio char and fe mn binary oxides respectively and consequently the femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system presented highest naphthalene removal efficiency the enhanced catalytic activity could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the combination of bio char and fe mn binary oxides such as promoting the adsorption capacity towards contaminant increasing concentration of persistent free radicals pfrs and introducing fe mn binary oxides as new activator according to the batch scale experiments femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system could degrade naphthalene effectively at a wide ph ranges and 82 2 of naphthalene was degraded under natural ph of 5 6 within 148 min free radicals quenching studies and electron spin resonance esr analyses verified that the dominant free radical within femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system was hydroxyl radical oh according to the preliminary analysis the generation of oh were ascribed to the activation of h2o2 by fe ii mn ii and pfrs on the catalyst surface the mainly degradation intermediates of naphthalene were identified by gc ms analysis consequently the possible degradation pathways were proposed moreover naphthalene degradation experiments were also conducted in river tap water industrial wastewater as well as medical wastewater and the results indicated that the femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system was effective in the treatment of naphthalene in natural waters this study brings a valuable insight for the potential environmental applications of modified bio char graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe mn modification bio char naphthalene hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radicals 1 introduction nowadays the rapid expansion of industrial scale and population has resulted in the discharging of various natural and synthetic refractory aromatic organic contaminants to the natural water systems which have potential adverse effects towards aquatic ecology and human health lai et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 yi et al 2019 among the environmental issues polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pollution has drawn attention in recent years because of the toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of pahs liu et al 2017 additionally pahs are an important class of persistent organic pollutants pops which can persistently present in environment due to their stability and strong recalcitrant nature sekar et al 2018 table s4 present the typical concentration of pahs in actual water thus developing an effective method for pahs degradation is necessary and important advanced oxidation processes aops have been recognized as promising technologies for the degradation of many hazardous and biorefractory contaminants li et al 2018 lai et al 2019a qin et al 2019 among these aops hydroxyl radical oh generated from fenton process has received particular attention cheng et al 2018a oh has a redox potential of 2 8 v which can react non selectively with organic pollutants and completely decompose them into co2 h2o and inorganic salts with rate constants of 106 109 m 1 s 1 cheng et al 2019 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been widely used as an oxidant for the generation of oh up till now activation of h2o2 has been reported by several pathways such as direct photolysis of h2o2 an and carraway 2002 and fenton fenton like oxidation lai et al 2019b bio char is a low cost and carbon rich porous substance produced by pyrolysis of various waste biomass zhang et al 2019 wu et al 2017 considering cost and solid waste reuse bio char is regarded as a promising alternative heterogeneous catalyst for wastewater treatment in addition to adsorption capacity recent studies indicated that bio char is also capable of catalyzing h2o2 because of persistent free radicals pfrs fang et al 2015 qin et al 2018 the pfrs existed on the bio char surface may activate h2o2 decomposition to form oh and further degrade organic pollutants in water for example fang et al 2014 have reported that heterogeneous catalytic oxidation by h2o2 coupled with bio char showed efficient decontamination of 2 chlorobiphenyl among which pfrs was found to be a great activator however the performance of bio char fails to meet the requirement of actual applications since the pfrs concentration of bio char markedly decreased after activating h2o2 fang et al 2014 qin et al 2018 and bio char are inconvenient to recycle from the treated effluent for reuse it is an interesting issue to improve the catalytic performance of bio char in real wastewater treatment of various activating technologies modified bio char with fe mn binary oxides might be an effective solution fe and mn elements are widely existing in the steel slag and metallurgical wastewater moreover fe mn binary oxides are kinds of fenton like catalysts which exhibit better stability in catalyzing h2o2 wan and wang 2017a wang et al 2018 nevertheless magnetic fe mn binary oxides tend to aggregate which may influence its catalytic activity different approaches such as dispersing transitional metal oxides onto carbon materials ouyang et al 2017 or using fluidized bed fenton fbf reactors garcia segura et al 2016 can avoid catalyst agglomeration combination of bio char with fe mn binary oxides are presumed to achieve the following synergistic effects in enhancing the oxidization of the h2o2 system i fe mn binary oxides attached on bio char can act as a new activator of h2o2 ii metal treatment can increase the concentration of pfrs in bio char fang et al 2015 iii the catalyst can be separated by external magnetic fields owing to the magnetic property of fe mn binary oxides liu et al 2019 simultaneously bio char can prevent the aggregation of fe mn binary oxides thus designing a binary heterogeneous catalyst of bio char and fe mn binary oxides and then making it combine with h2o2 to form a heterogeneous fenton like system seems to be very attractive in this study fe mn binary oxides modified bio char femn bio char was fabricated via one step pyrolysis method in addition numerous studies have reported that the introduction of visible light into fenton process can enhance the catalytic capacity towards h2o2 due to the regeneration of fe2 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 hence visible light irradiation was introduced into this femn bio char h2o2 fenton like system to promote the catalytic activity of catalyst naphthalene the dominant pahs in drinking water lair et al 2008 was selected as a model compound to investigate the removal of pahs from the contaminated aquatic systems the purposes of this study were to 1 produce a novel photo fenton system based on femn bio char 2 investigate the effects of different experimental parameters on the degradation performance of naphthalene such as h2o2 concentration catalyst dosage and initial ph 3 clarify the activation mechanism of h2o2 by femn bio char and explore the synergistic promoting effect between bio char and fe mn binary oxides 4 propose the possible degradation intermediates and reaction pathway of naphthalene 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials manganese dichloride tetrahydrate mncl2 4h2o ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent corp beijing china naphthalene was purchased from aladdin industrial corporation shanghai china the chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 25 mω was used for the preparation of aqueous solutions 2 2 preparation of catalysts pine needles were collected from changsha of hunan province china after being washed by ultrapure water several times pine needles were dried at 105 c for 24 h and grinded by a cutting mill then passed through a 100 mesh sieve the raw pine needles particles were retained and used as feedstock for impregnation the femn bio char samples were synthesized through wet impregnation method with one step pyrolysis using fecl3 6h2o as iron source and mncl2 4h2o as manganese source the preparation process is as follows 5 g pine needles feedstock was impregnated into a 90 ml solution mixture containing 16 22 g fecl3 6h2o 0 67 mol l and 5 94 g mncl2 4h2o 0 335 mol l the above mixed solution was stirred in a magnetic stirring water bath for 2 h at 80 c the obtained precursor was then dried at 105 c for 24 h after that the dried sample was pyrolyzed with an otf 1200x l tubular furnace at 500 c for 2 h with heating rate of 10 c min under a constant n2 flow rate the resulting bio char products were crushed washed and oven dried at 60 c for 12 h before characterization for comparison the fe mn binary oxides fe bio char and mn bio char was synthesized by the same method without adding pine needles feedstock mncl2 4h2o and fecl3 6h2o virgin bio char was made by pyrolyzing pine needles feedstock directly following the calcining procedure above 2 3 characterization of catalysts the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas of typical products were performed at 77 k in an autosorb 1 mp system micromeritics

photoelectron spectrometry xps was adopted to investigate the chemical states of elements by using an axis ultra spectrometer kratos japan with al kα source hv 1486 6 ev the magnetic properties of the materials were studied with vibrating sample magnetometer vsm squid vsm mpms 3 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrophotometer spectrum bx perkinelmer ltd usa was employed to characterize the surface functional groups 2 4 experimental procedure initially 100 ml of naphthalene solution without catalyst and h2o2 was exposed to visible light to study the volatilization of naphthalene under irradiation the concentration of naphthalene was set as 30 mg l according the concentration of naphthalene used in other researches and the typical concentration of naphthalene in wastewaters table s1 typically 100 mg of catalysts was added into 100 ml naphthalene solution 30 mg l and dark reaction 60 min was performed to obtain adsorption desorption equilibrium of naphthalene then required amount of h2o2 was added to initiate the reaction under visible light irradiation the visible light irradiation was supplied by a 300 w xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter and the irradiation intensity is determined as 2 7 kw m2 which was 2 7 times as large as the irradiation intensity of the natural sunlight expected at the surface of the earth 1 kw m2 samples were taken out regularly and then analyzed immediately after filtration through 0 45 μm millipore membrane filters to examine the adsorption of naphthalene by catalysts control experiments were conducted with no addition of h2o2 and visible light irradiation the results were presented in fig s1 to investigate the contribution of homogeneous fenton reaction under acidic conditions fe2 and mn2 were used as homogeneous catalysts to activate h2o2 for the removal of naphthalene and the results were shown in fig s5 the dosage of fe2 and mn2 used was the leaching amount under acidic conditions to study the practical application value of femn bio char the procedure of naphthalene degradation was also carried out under natural sunlight irradiation and the result was shown in fig s7 in the preliminary experiment on the real wastewater treatment river water xiangjiang river changsha china tap water derived from changsha running water company industrial wastewater obtained from hebei cangzhou dahua co ltd china and medical wastewater obtained from changsha 4th hospital changsha china were used as the solution for the preparation of 30 mg l naphthalene wastewater all experiments were performed in triplicate the detailed procedures for the treatment of bio char by ethanol were provided in supporting information text 1 2 5 analytic methods the concentrations of naphthalene were quantified by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa equipped with an agilent tc c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm and an uv vis photodiode array detector the mobile phase was a mixture of distilled water and methanol 20 80 v v at the detection wavelength of 240 nm the column temperature was 25 c and the flow rate was 1 ml min the concentration of fe and mn released in solution after reaction were measured by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy aas peaa700 perkin elmer usa the variation of h2o2 concentration during reaction was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer after complexation with metavanadate nogueira et al 2005 the electron spin resonance esr signals of spin trapped radicals were conducted on a bruker model esr jesfa200 spectrometer using spin trap reagent dmpo in water and methanol respectively the procedures for the determination of pfrs were presented in supporting information text 2 the degradation intermediate products of naphthalene were analyzed using a qp2010 plus gc ms system shimadzu japan equipped with a hp 5ms capillary column the procedures for the determination of intermediate products were presented in supporting information text 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the surface properties of virgin bio char and femn bio char was investigated using nitrogen adsorption and the results table s2 revealed that both as prepared samples displayed mesoporous structures it could be found from table s2 that the bet surface and pore volume of bio char increased after impregnation of fe mn binary oxides which increased from 14 14 m2 g and 0 0219 cm3 g to 159 05 m2 g and 0 1111 cm3 g respectively this might ascribe to the formation of new pores during impregnation and calcination in general catalyst with larger bet surface area possessed more active sites which was conductive to the catalytic reaction the morphology of bio char fe mn binary oxides and femn bio char were observed by sem as shown from fig 1 the virgin bio char showed smooth surface and sharp edges fig 1a while fe mn binary oxides obviously aggregated into a sphere fig 1b as for femn bio char fe mn binary oxides were homogeneously diffused onto the surface of bio char without obvious gathering fig 1c eds analysis shown in fig 1d indicated the coexistence of fe mn c and o the xrd patterns of virgin bio char fe bio char mn bio char and femn bio char were presented in fig 2 a as for bio char the xrd peak at 2θ 20 25 was regarded as the graphite amorphous structure of bio char ouyang et al 2017 the peak intensity of carbon became weaker with the doping of fe mn binary oxides suggesting that the introduction of fe mn binary oxides might cover the surface of bio char for fe bio char the diffraction peaks at 2θ 18 3 30 1 35 5 36 9 43 1 53 5 56 9 and 62 6 were ascribed to fe3o4 jcpsd 18 0803 and the diffraction peaks at 2θ 33 49 and 54 were attributed to fe2o3 jcpds 33 0664 diffraction lines for mn3o4 2θ 18 28 9 31 32 4 36 04 44 4 50 7 58 6 60 0 64 6 were detected over mn bio char in addition the peak appeared around 2θ 37 9 was attributed to mn2o3 zhao et al 2018a while the peaks of manganese oxides were not detected on the surface of femn bio char this might attribute to the fact that the amount of mn oxides was too low to form crystalline phase on the basis of monolayer dispersion theory xie and tang 1990 besides the xrd patterns of femn bio char show stronger and narrower peaks demonstrating high crystallinity of the resulted samples fig 2b showed the ftir spectra of bio char femn bio char before and after reaction in fig 2b five stretching vibration bands could be observed for bio char at wavelengths at 3440 1580 1388 1100 and 870 cm 1 respectively being assigned to oh c c carboxyl o c o alkoxy c o and aromatic c h groups tang et al 2016 meanwhile the intense adsorption band at 2918 cm 1 and 2843 cm 1 verified asymmetric and symmetric stretching of ch2 groups for femn bio char composite the peaks centered at 574 cm 1 and 417 cm 1 can be assigned to the fe o and mn o bending vibrations wan and wang 2017b compared with ftir patterns of bio char and femn bio char samples we could conclude that impregnation leads to slight shift in stretching band of surface functional groups such as oh from 3417 to 3404 cm 1 and cooh from 1410 to 1388 cm 1 suggesting that fe mn binary oxides were bounded on the surface of bio char via interactions with these functional groups yang et al 2018a in the case of femn bio char after reaction a new peak emerged at 1793 cm 1 which may be due to the presence of carbonyl units such as lactone groups li et al 2017a fig 3 a presented the survey spectra of femn bio char before and after reaction the elements of c 284 8 ev o 531 1 ev fe 287 711 0 ev 724 7 ev and mn 641 4 ev 653 6 ev could be observed from the survey spectra of both catalysts fig 3b showed the c 1s peak of femn bio char before and after reaction from the spectrum before reaction we can see that binding energy at 284 6 ev 285 1 ev 286 1 ev and 288 9 ev corresponded to c c c c c o and o c o respectively ouyang et al 2017 the appearance of c o after reaction could be ascribed to the byproduct of ring opening reaction of naphthalene which was consistent with ftir analysis from the xps spectrum of fe 2p fig 3c two main asymmetric peaks located at 711 0 ev and 724 7 ev could be ascribed to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively wan and wang 2017b for fe 2p3 2 the peak at 710 5 ev was attributed to fe ii another two binding energies at 711 8 ev and 713 2 ev were related to fe iii in different forms besides the shake up satellite peak at about 718 6 ev suggested the presence of fe iii du et al 2018 for high resolution xps spectra of mn 2p fig 3d two main peaks assigned to mn 2p3 2 and mn 2p1 2 were observed at 641 4 ev and 653 6 ev respectively the mn 2p3 2 peak can be divided into two peaks mn ii 641 2 ev and mn iii 642 8 ev du et al 2018 furthermore a satellite peak at 646 9 ev may be ascribed to the presence of mn ii zhou et al 2016 however some values shifted after the reaction with h2o2 and naphthelene from the deconvolution of mn 2p and fe 2p envelops before reaction the peak area ratio of mn iii mn ii was about 0 61 and the percentage of fe ii and fe iii were 49 and 51 respectively while according to the deconvolution of fe 2p and mn 2p envelops after reaction the mn iii mn ii value decreased to 0 37 and the percentage of fe ii and fe iii changed to 43 7 and 56 3 respectively these changes displayed that a good portion of fe ii and mn iii of used femn bio char was transformed to fe iii and mn ii indicating that both mn ii mn iii and fe ii fe iii species were involved in activation of h2o2 by femn bio char esr was used to verify the existence of pfrs in bio char and femn bio char samples and the result was shown in fig 4 the result suggested that for both bio char and femn bio char the pronounced esr signals were observed moreover the esr intensity of femn bio char was higher than that of bio char suggesting that the metal treatment would increase the concentration of pfrs in composite the similar effect was found by fang et al 2015 the room temperature magnetization curves and the magnetization property data of bare fe mn binary oxides and femn bio char composite were shown in fig s2 and table 1 the saturated magnetization ms of femn bio char composite was lower than the ms of bare fe mn binary oxides which might be attributed to the existence of bio char with large saturated magnetization femn bio char could be manipulated through external magnetic field such as magnet fig s2 inset moreover owing to the low remnant magnetization mr values femn bio char composite could easily re disperse in a solution for reuse after separating nguyen et al 2011 3 2 degradation of naphthalene 3 2 1 naphthalene removal using different catalysts the removal of naphthalene by bio char fe mn binary oxides and femn bio char were presented in fig 5 a and the decomposition behavior of h2o2 by different catalysts were shown in fig 5b under dark condition the adsorption equilibrium between naphthalene and catalysts were obtained within 60 min fig s1 approximately 23 4 20 1 and 48 9 of naphthalene was removed by bio char fe mn binary oxides and femn bio char respectively the optimal adsorption performance of femn bio char suggested that there is a synergistic promoting effect between fe mn binary oxides and bio char after addition of h2o2 and visible light irradiation the degradation efficiency of naphthalene significantly improved as seen from fig 5a naphthalene was decreased by 8 5 without catalysts and h2o2 due to volatilization the degradation of naphthalene is ordered as femn bio char femn binary oxides bio char h2o2 alone and the specific value after 148 min is 75 8 46 9 44 9 and 11 5 respectively the removal efficiency with h2o2 alone indicated that h2o2 could hardly degrade naphthalene under visible light irradiation the lower degradation efficiency of fe mn binary oxides might be attributed to the catalyst aggregation which weakened the accessibility of reactants towards the active sites as shown in fig 1 the addition of bio char obviously alleviated the agglomeration of material which was mainly responsible for the higher catalytic performance of femn bio char compared to fe mn binary oxides in addition femn bio char showed a higher catalytic capability towards activating h2o2 for naphthalene removal than bio char probably due to the increasing concentration of pfrs and the activation of h2o2 by fe mn binary oxides eqs 1 and 2 as stated above the synergistic effects of bio char and fe mn binary oxides were significant to the enhancement of catalytic activity for comparison fe bio char and mn bio char were also taken into consideration the pseudo first order plots of h2o2 decomposition under different catalysts were also analyzed fig s3 as shown in fig 5 and fig s3 mn bio char composite exhibited the fastest h2o2 decomposition nearly 89 3 of h2o2 was decomposed within 88 min k 0 029 min 1 whereas only 63 7 naphthalene was degraded by mn bio char composite under visible light irradiation this might be ascribed to the scavenging of oh and less generation of o2 in mn bio char h2o2 system as shown from fig s4 no apparent difference of peak intensities of dmpo oh could be observed between femn bio char and mn bio char though mn bio char exhibited faster decomposition rate of h2o2 than femn bio char this result suggested that the amount of effective oh generated in mn bio char h2o2 system was not larger than that in femn bio char h2o2 system which was possibly because the oh generated rapidly in a short time would be quenched zhong et al 2014 xue et al 2018 additionally we can see from fig s4 that the peak intensities of dmpo o2 in mn bio char h2o2 system was much weaker than that in femn bio char h2o2 system indicating less generation of o2 in mn bio char h2o2 system in comparison the decomposition of h2o2 with fe bio char as catalyst was relatively slower k 0 006 min 1 about 39 2 of h2o2 was decomposed in the presence of fe bio char the faster degradation rate of h2o2 by mn bio char compared to fe bio char might be ascribed to the reaction between mn iii and h2o2 since the order of reactivity between transition ions and h2o2 is mn iii co iii fe iii wan and wang 2017a meanwhile 63 of naphthalene was degraded by fe bio char both degradation values of naphthalene by mn bio char and fe bio char were not comparable with that of femn bio char that is to say the catalysts combining iron and manganese are more efficient in photo fenton reaction therefore femn bio char was selected for further study 1 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh 2 mn ii h2o2 mn iii oh oh 3 2 2 effects of catalyst dosage on naphthalene degradation to select optimum femn bio char dosage the naphthalene degradation by femn bio char was investigated under different initial dosage as shown in fig 6 a femn bio char 0 25 g l 0 5 g l 1 g l and h2o2 within the 148 min reaction time removed 66 7 70 1 and 77 1 of the naphthalene as the amount of femn bio char dosage increased there would be more active sites on catalyst surface in addition more catalyst might increase the adsorption of naphthalene but there was no significant increase of degradation efficiency when further increasing the dosage to 1 5 g l and 2 0 g l on the one hand excessive catalyst in the solution might lead to the loss of available radiation because of light scattering zhong et al 2012 and consequently the regeneration of fe ii would be decreased due to the less effective utilization of visible light see detail discussion in section 3 2 5 on the other hand the scavenging of oh would occur when presenting excessive catalyst eq 3 hence 1 g l was the optimal dosage for the sample 3 m ii oh m iii oh m fe or mn 3 2 3 effects of h2o2 concentration on naphthalene degradation the effect of h2o2 dosage 25 mm 200 mm on naphthalene degradation was shown in fig 6b from fig 6b the degradation efficiency was 64 6 71 2 75 2 and 82 2 corresponding to the concentration of h2o2 at 25 50 100 and 150 mm with the addition of h2o2 there would be more oh generated to degrade high concentration of naphthalene which leads to the increase of naphthalene removal efficiency however when h2o2 concentration increased from 150 mm to 200 mm the degradation of naphthalene decreased from 82 1 to 74 9 which can be attributed to the scavenging of oh by excess h2o2 eq 4 besides excess h2o2 can also compete with naphthalene for the adsorption sites on catalyst surface wan and wang 2017b thus 150 mm h2o2 was an optimal concentration and utilized in subsequent experiments 4 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 3 2 4 effects of ph on naphthalene degradation the degradation efficiency of naphthalene under different initial ph was also explored as seen from fig 6c naphthalene was degraded 77 3 82 8 80 1 and 79 7 under the initial ph of 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively this result suggested that the femn bio char can work effectively under a wide range of ph while a ph 3 solution resulted in a minimal efficiency according to our experiments which was different from the previous studies hu et al 2011 we further studied the removal of naphthalene by homogeneous photo fenton reaction under acidic conditions and the results were presented in fig s5 since the leaching amount of fe and mn after reaction was 1 03 mg l and 2 29 mg l respectively under acidic conditions this may not the optimum catalyst dosage in homogeneous photo fenton reaction when h2o2 concentration was 150 mm hence the degradation kinetic is still governed by heterogeneous fenton reaction in femn bio char h2o2 system under acidic conditions from the results in fig s5 to further explain the relatively lower degradation efficiency of naphthalene under acidic conditions we studied the change of solution ph during reaction under different initial ph as shown from fig s6 when the initial ph was 3 5 5 6 7 and 9 respectively the solution ph dropped rapidly to 2 45 3 0 3 02 3 3 and 7 06 respectively after photo fenton reaction and then changed slightly in the following degradation process the decrease of solution ph might be ascribed to the generation of acidic intermediates during naphthalene degradation hence when the initial ph was 3 the solution ph would rapidly decrease to 2 45 after reaction the formation of fe h2o 6 3 at lower acid environment would restrain the reaction between h2o2 and catalyst leading to the less generation of oh gao et al 2018 which might be reasonable for the lower efficiency at initial ph of 3 additionally previous studies which obtained lower degradation efficiency at acidic conditions have been presented in table s3 when the initial ph was set as 9 0 a slower degradation rate of naphthalene was observed because the generation of oh from h2o2 was gradually restricted and the oxidation potential of oh also decreased with the ph increasing while a relatively higher efficiency was obtained at ph 9 which would be ascribed to the better adsorption of naphthalene in higher ph cheng et al 2018b this was probably because the solutions at higher ph had different ionic strength further affecting adsorption capacity lair et al 2008 moreover femn bio char had relatively high degradation efficacy at neutral initial ph so there was no need to control the ph of wastewater 3 2 5 effects of visible light irradiation on naphthalene degradation to explore the role of light in catalytic oxidation experiment was further conducted under dark condition with femn bio char as catalyst as shown in fig 6d the degradation ratio of naphthalene declined to 69 8 for femn bio char composite in the dark moreover the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 was greatly declined with the absence of visible light irradiation fig 6d inset the remarkable decrease of catalytic efficiency under dark condition possibly because photo reduction of fe iii also played an important role in naphthalene degradation reaction li et al 2017b since the regeneration of fe ii could be accelerated via photo reduction of fe iii eq 5 cai et al 2016 li et al 2017b diao et al 2018 ruales lonfat et al 2015 simultaneously the forming fenton s reagent fe ii h2o2 may further oxidize the contaminants by fenton reaction eq 1 furthermore we studied the degrading activity of femn bio char towards naphthalene under natural sunlight irradiation to investigate the practical application value of this catalyst location hunan university n28 10 54 e112 56 18 date may 9 2019 weather cloudy day as seen from fig s7 83 7 of naphthalene was degraded within 148 min under sunlight irradiation indicating that femn bio char could effectively remove naphthalene under natural sunlight irradiation the obtained results suggested that this photo fenton catalyst exhibited good potentials in environmental remediation process 5 fe iii oh hυ fe ii oh 3 3 identification of reactive radical species the free radical trapping experiments were conducted to identify the reactive oxygen radicals in femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system benzoquinone bq and tert butyl alcohol tba were used as scavengers of superoxide radicals o2 and oh respectively gao et al 2018 yang et al 2018b as seen from fig 7 a the addition of tba rapidly decreased the degradation efficiency of naphthalene while the efficiency was scarcely decreased with the addition of bq the results indicated that oh was the main active species but o2 played minor roles in the photo fenton process to further verify the free radicals species esr with dmpo in aqueous solution was carried out to further determine the free radicals species in this femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system the results were shown in fig 7b the intensity of esr signal depends on concentration of radical s concentration obviously the peak intensities of dmpo oh radical increased with time going on in addition the signals of dmpo o2 were also detected under visible light irradiation indicating that both oh and o2 were generated during reaction however the intensity signals of dmpo o2 were much weaker than dmpo oh this result suggested that oh was the primary oxidative species in this heterogeneous photo fenton system and o2 partially contributed the degradation of naphthalene which were consistent with the results of free radical trapping experiments 3 4 reaction mechanism the mechanism of femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system in the removal of naphthalene was summarized in fig 8 on the one hand pfrs on the surface of samples could directly activate h2o2 to generate oh and further degraded naphthalene to further testify the catalytic performance of pfrs during photo fenton reaction ethanol was used as the scavenger to decrease the concentration of pfrs in bio char zhao et al 2018b as seen from fig s8 the removal efficiency of naphthalene decreased with the increase of the concentration of scavenger the obtained result further confirmed the decent effect of pfrs in this photo fenton process on the other hand the redox catalytic cycle of fe ii fe iii and mn ii mn iii in femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system eqs 1 and 2 can produce oh to oxide naphthalene in this cyclical reaction mn iii can be reduced by fe ii thermodynamically according to the redox potential of e0 mn iii mn ii 1 51 v and e0 fe iii fe ii 0 771v eq 6 which promotes the electron transfer in the reaction system and breaks the restriction that the conversion of mn iii to mn ii was dependent on h2o2 eq 7 simultaneously fe ii could be regenerated via photolysis of fe iii eq 5 the efficient regeneration of fe ii and mn ii could contribute to the remarkable increase of naphthalene degradation activity 6 fe ii mn iii mn ii fe iii 7 mn iii h2o2 mn ii ho2 h 3 5 identification of intermediates and transformation pathway the main intermediates identification and confirmation by gc ms analysis are presented in table s6 and the possible degradation pathways were proposed based on above intermediates the oh formed from femn bio char photo fenton system could attack α position of naphthalene 1 and led to the structure 2 fig 9 an abstraction of h from structure 2 yielded the formation of 1 naphthol 3 which was the primary intermediates of naphthalene degradation andas et al 2014 the second possibility was the formation of 2 formylcinnamaldehyde 5 by an attack of o2 on the naphthalene which produced an unstable endoperoxide 4 lair et al 2008 while the direct attack by o2 was rare since o2 was not the primary active radicals in this study in addition oh attacking structure 5 resulted in the formation of 1 2 benzenedicarboxaldehyde 6 and finally led to the generation of 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid 7 yang et al 2018b then structure 7 further reacted with oh to form 1 propene 1 2 3 tricarboxylic acid 8 garcia segura et al 2013 3 6 reuse of catalyst and application on the real wastewater treatment the stability of femn bio char is significantly important in actual application hence four consecutive experiments were conducted to investigate the stability of femn bio char as seen from fig 10 a the removal efficiency after four cycles was 82 2 75 3 72 2 and 71 0 respectively the loss of activity might be ascribed to the following reasons firstly the concentration of pfrs would decrease after addition of h2o2 fang et al 2014 and the slight leaching of metal ions on the catalyst would lead to the loss of active sites secondly some residual by products might block the active catalytic sites and further hindered the degradation efficiency of organics nguyen et al 2011 besides the xrd pattern of femn bio char before and after use was presented in fig 10b to examine the crystal structure of catalyst no apparent changes can be seen from fig 10b further confirming the stability of the catalyst additionally the leaching amount of fe and mn after reaction was 0 55 mg l and 2 03 mg l respectively water matrix is an important factor in actual applications hence the difference between actual wastewater and simulated wastewater could significantly impact the degradation efficiency of target contaminant naphthalene in this study the removal efficiency of naphthalene in ultrapure water tap water changsha running water company river water taken from xiangjiang river changsha industrial wastewater obtained from hebei cangzhou dahua co ltd china and medical wastewater obtained from changsha 4th hospital changsha china were investigated fig s9 the results fig s9 showed that the removal efficiency of naphthalene in ultrapure water tap water river water industrial wastewater and medical wastewater was 82 2 80 4 79 5 70 7 and 72 3 respectively the consumption of oh by the organic matters in industrial wastewater and medical wastewater might be responsible for the relatively lower removal of naphthalene in these two wastewaters the obtained results showed the proposed photo fenton process could remove most of the naphthalene in different types of polluted waters suggesting that this photo fenton catalyst exhibited good potentials for treatment of actual wastewater 4 conclusion in this study the bio char based catalysts were successfully synthesized via wet impregnation method with one step pyrolysis moreover the femn bio char exhibited pronounced photo fenton reactivity than fe bio char and mn bio char owing to the synergistic effects of iron and manganese the femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system can work effectively at a wide ph range additionally femn bio char showed good stability and reusability during photo fenton process bio char and fe mn binary oxides presented synergistic promoting effect in this photo fenton system the combination of these two materials not only enhanced the adsorption capacity of contaminant but also accelerated the activation towards h2o2 the regeneration of fe ii and mn ii and the increase concentration of pfrs mainly responsible for the remarkable increase of removal efficiency a further study conducted in river water tap water industrial wastewater and medical wastewater confirmed the application feasibility of femn bio char in actual wastewater treatment this work may bring valuable insights for the potential environmental applications of modified bio char declaration of interest statement there are no conflicts to declare

18738,this study investigated the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 activation potential of fe mn binary oxides modified bio char femn bio char for the degradation of naphthalene the dominant pahs in drinking water results showed that femn bio char exhibited 80 7 and 2 18 times decomposition rates towards h2o2 than that of pure bio char and fe mn binary oxides respectively and consequently the femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system presented highest naphthalene removal efficiency the enhanced catalytic activity could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the combination of bio char and fe mn binary oxides such as promoting the adsorption capacity towards contaminant increasing concentration of persistent free radicals pfrs and introducing fe mn binary oxides as new activator according to the batch scale experiments femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system could degrade naphthalene effectively at a wide ph ranges and 82 2 of naphthalene was degraded under natural ph of 5 6 within 148 min free radicals quenching studies and electron spin resonance esr analyses verified that the dominant free radical within femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system was hydroxyl radical oh according to the preliminary analysis the generation of oh were ascribed to the activation of h2o2 by fe ii mn ii and pfrs on the catalyst surface the mainly degradation intermediates of naphthalene were identified by gc ms analysis consequently the possible degradation pathways were proposed moreover naphthalene degradation experiments were also conducted in river tap water industrial wastewater as well as medical wastewater and the results indicated that the femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system was effective in the treatment of naphthalene in natural waters this study brings a valuable insight for the potential environmental applications of modified bio char graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe mn modification bio char naphthalene hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radicals 1 introduction nowadays the rapid expansion of industrial scale and population has resulted in the discharging of various natural and synthetic refractory aromatic organic contaminants to the natural water systems which have potential adverse effects towards aquatic ecology and human health lai et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 yi et al 2019 among the environmental issues polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pollution has drawn attention in recent years because of the toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of pahs liu et al 2017 additionally pahs are an important class of persistent organic pollutants pops which can persistently present in environment due to their stability and strong recalcitrant nature sekar et al 2018 table s4 present the typical concentration of pahs in actual water thus developing an effective method for pahs degradation is necessary and important advanced oxidation processes aops have been recognized as promising technologies for the degradation of many hazardous and biorefractory contaminants li et al 2018 lai et al 2019a qin et al 2019 among these aops hydroxyl radical oh generated from fenton process has received particular attention cheng et al 2018a oh has a redox potential of 2 8 v which can react non selectively with organic pollutants and completely decompose them into co2 h2o and inorganic salts with rate constants of 106 109 m 1 s 1 cheng et al 2019 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been widely used as an oxidant for the generation of oh up till now activation of h2o2 has been reported by several pathways such as direct photolysis of h2o2 an and carraway 2002 and fenton fenton like oxidation lai et al 2019b bio char is a low cost and carbon rich porous substance produced by pyrolysis of various waste biomass zhang et al 2019 wu et al 2017 considering cost and solid waste reuse bio char is regarded as a promising alternative heterogeneous catalyst for wastewater treatment in addition to adsorption capacity recent studies indicated that bio char is also capable of catalyzing h2o2 because of persistent free radicals pfrs fang et al 2015 qin et al 2018 the pfrs existed on the bio char surface may activate h2o2 decomposition to form oh and further degrade organic pollutants in water for example fang et al 2014 have reported that heterogeneous catalytic oxidation by h2o2 coupled with bio char showed efficient decontamination of 2 chlorobiphenyl among which pfrs was found to be a great activator however the performance of bio char fails to meet the requirement of actual applications since the pfrs concentration of bio char markedly decreased after activating h2o2 fang et al 2014 qin et al 2018 and bio char are inconvenient to recycle from the treated effluent for reuse it is an interesting issue to improve the catalytic performance of bio char in real wastewater treatment of various activating technologies modified bio char with fe mn binary oxides might be an effective solution fe and mn elements are widely existing in the steel slag and metallurgical wastewater moreover fe mn binary oxides are kinds of fenton like catalysts which exhibit better stability in catalyzing h2o2 wan and wang 2017a wang et al 2018 nevertheless magnetic fe mn binary oxides tend to aggregate which may influence its catalytic activity different approaches such as dispersing transitional metal oxides onto carbon materials ouyang et al 2017 or using fluidized bed fenton fbf reactors garcia segura et al 2016 can avoid catalyst agglomeration combination of bio char with fe mn binary oxides are presumed to achieve the following synergistic effects in enhancing the oxidization of the h2o2 system i fe mn binary oxides attached on bio char can act as a new activator of h2o2 ii metal treatment can increase the concentration of pfrs in bio char fang et al 2015 iii the catalyst can be separated by external magnetic fields owing to the magnetic property of fe mn binary oxides liu et al 2019 simultaneously bio char can prevent the aggregation of fe mn binary oxides thus designing a binary heterogeneous catalyst of bio char and fe mn binary oxides and then making it combine with h2o2 to form a heterogeneous fenton like system seems to be very attractive in this study fe mn binary oxides modified bio char femn bio char was fabricated via one step pyrolysis method in addition numerous studies have reported that the introduction of visible light into fenton process can enhance the catalytic capacity towards h2o2 due to the regeneration of fe2 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 hence visible light irradiation was introduced into this femn bio char h2o2 fenton like system to promote the catalytic activity of catalyst naphthalene the dominant pahs in drinking water lair et al 2008 was selected as a model compound to investigate the removal of pahs from the contaminated aquatic systems the purposes of this study were to 1 produce a novel photo fenton system based on femn bio char 2 investigate the effects of different experimental parameters on the degradation performance of naphthalene such as h2o2 concentration catalyst dosage and initial ph 3 clarify the activation mechanism of h2o2 by femn bio char and explore the synergistic promoting effect between bio char and fe mn binary oxides 4 propose the possible degradation intermediates and reaction pathway of naphthalene 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials manganese dichloride tetrahydrate mncl2 4h2o ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent corp beijing china naphthalene was purchased from aladdin industrial corporation shanghai china the chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 25 mω was used for the preparation of aqueous solutions 2 2 preparation of catalysts pine needles were collected from changsha of hunan province china after being washed by ultrapure water several times pine needles were dried at 105 c for 24 h and grinded by a cutting mill then passed through a 100 mesh sieve the raw pine needles particles were retained and used as feedstock for impregnation the femn bio char samples were synthesized through wet impregnation method with one step pyrolysis using fecl3 6h2o as iron source and mncl2 4h2o as manganese source the preparation process is as follows 5 g pine needles feedstock was impregnated into a 90 ml solution mixture containing 16 22 g fecl3 6h2o 0 67 mol l and 5 94 g mncl2 4h2o 0 335 mol l the above mixed solution was stirred in a magnetic stirring water bath for 2 h at 80 c the obtained precursor was then dried at 105 c for 24 h after that the dried sample was pyrolyzed with an otf 1200x l tubular furnace at 500 c for 2 h with heating rate of 10 c min under a constant n2 flow rate the resulting bio char products were crushed washed and oven dried at 60 c for 12 h before characterization for comparison the fe mn binary oxides fe bio char and mn bio char was synthesized by the same method without adding pine needles feedstock mncl2 4h2o and fecl3 6h2o virgin bio char was made by pyrolyzing pine needles feedstock directly following the calcining procedure above 2 3 characterization of catalysts the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas of typical products were performed at 77 k in an autosorb 1 mp system micromeritics

surface functional groups 2 4 experimental procedure initially 100 ml of naphthalene solution without catalyst and h2o2 was exposed to visible light to study the volatilization of naphthalene under irradiation the concentration of naphthalene was set as 30 mg l according the concentration of naphthalene used in other researches and the typical concentration of naphthalene in wastewaters table s1 typically 100 mg of catalysts was added into 100 ml naphthalene solution 30 mg l and dark reaction 60 min was performed to obtain adsorption desorption equilibrium of naphthalene then required amount of h2o2 was added to initiate the reaction under visible light irradiation the visible light irradiation was supplied by a 300 w xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter and the irradiation intensity is determined as 2 7 kw m2 which was 2 7 times as large as the irradiation intensity of the natural sunlight expected at the surface of the earth 1 kw m2 samples were taken out regularly and then analyzed immediately after filtration through 0 45 μm millipore membrane filters to examine the adsorption of naphthalene by catalysts control experiments were conducted with no addition of h2o2 and visible light irradiation the results were presented in fig s1 to investigate the contribution of homogeneous fenton reaction under acidic conditions fe2 and mn2 were used as homogeneous catalysts to activate h2o2 for the removal of naphthalene and the results were shown in fig s5 the dosage of fe2 and mn2 used was the leaching amount under acidic conditions to study the practical application value of femn bio char the procedure of naphthalene degradation was also carried out under natural sunlight irradiation and the result was shown in fig s7 in the preliminary experiment on the real wastewater treatment river water xiangjiang river changsha china tap water derived from changsha running water company industrial wastewater obtained from hebei cangzhou dahua co ltd china and medical wastewater obtained from changsha 4th hospital changsha china were used as the solution for the preparation of 30 mg l naphthalene wastewater all experiments were performed in triplicate the detailed procedures for the treatment of bio char by ethanol were provided in supporting information text 1 2 5 analytic methods the concentrations of naphthalene were quantified by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa equipped with an agilent tc c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm and an uv vis photodiode array detector the mobile phase was a mixture of distilled water and methanol 20 80 v v at the detection wavelength of 240 nm the column temperature was 25 c and the flow rate was 1 ml min the concentration of fe and mn released in solution after reaction were measured by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy aas peaa700 perkin elmer usa the variation of h2o2 concentration during reaction was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer after complexation with metavanadate nogueira et al 2005 the electron spin resonance esr signals of spin trapped radicals were conducted on a bruker model esr jesfa200 spectrometer using spin trap reagent dmpo in water and methanol respectively the procedures for the determination of pfrs were presented in supporting information text 2 the degradation intermediate products of naphthalene were analyzed using a qp2010 plus gc ms system shimadzu japan equipped with a hp 5ms capillary column the procedures for the determination of intermediate products were presented in supporting information text 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the surface properties of virgin bio char and femn bio char was investigated using nitrogen adsorption and the results table s2 revealed that both as prepared samples displayed mesoporous structures it could be found from table s2 that the bet surface and pore volume of bio char increased after impregnation of fe mn binary oxides which increased from 14 14 m2 g and 0 0219 cm3 g to 159 05 m2 g and 0 1111 cm3 g respectively this might ascribe to the formation of new pores during impregnation and calcination in general catalyst with larger bet surface area possessed more active sites which was conductive to the catalytic reaction the morphology of bio char fe mn binary oxides and femn bio char were observed by sem as shown from fig 1 the virgin bio char showed smooth surface and sharp edges fig 1a while fe mn binary oxides obviously aggregated into a sphere fig 1b as for femn bio char fe mn binary oxides were homogeneously diffused onto the surface of bio char without obvious gathering fig 1c eds analysis shown in fig 1d indicated the coexistence of fe mn c and o the xrd patterns of virgin bio char fe bio char mn bio char and femn bio char were presented in fig 2 a as for bio char the xrd peak at 2θ 20 25 was regarded as the graphite amorphous structure of bio char ouyang et al 2017 the peak intensity of carbon became weaker with the doping of fe mn binary oxides suggesting that the introduction of fe mn binary oxides might cover the surface of bio char for fe bio char the diffraction peaks at 2θ 18 3 30 1 35 5 36 9 43 1 53 5 56 9 and 62 6 were ascribed to fe3o4 jcpsd 18 0803 and the diffraction peaks at 2θ 33 49 and 54 were attributed to fe2o3 jcpds 33 0664 diffraction lines for mn3o4 2θ 18 28 9 31 32 4 36 04 44 4 50 7 58 6 60 0 64 6 were detected over mn bio char in addition the peak appeared around 2θ 37 9 was attributed to mn2o3 zhao et al 2018a while the peaks of manganese oxides were not detected on the surface of femn bio char this might attribute to the fact that the amount of mn oxides was too low to form crystalline phase on the basis of monolayer dispersion theory xie and tang 1990 besides the xrd patterns of femn bio char show stronger and narrower peaks demonstrating high crystallinity of the resulted samples fig 2b showed the ftir spectra of bio char femn bio char before and after reaction in fig 2b five stretching vibration bands could be observed for bio char at wavelengths at 3440 1580 1388 1100 and 870 cm 1 respectively being assigned to oh c c carboxyl o c o alkoxy c o and aromatic c h groups tang et al 2016 meanwhile the intense adsorption band at 2918 cm 1 and 2843 cm 1 verified asymmetric and symmetric stretching of ch2 groups for femn bio char composite the peaks centered at 574 cm 1 and 417 cm 1 can be assigned to the fe o and mn o bending vibrations wan and wang 2017b compared with ftir patterns of bio char and femn bio char samples we could conclude that impregnation leads to slight shift in stretching band of surface functional groups such as oh from 3417 to 3404 cm 1 and cooh from 1410 to 1388 cm 1 suggesting that fe mn binary oxides were bounded on the surface of bio char via interactions with these functional groups yang et al 2018a in the case of femn bio char after reaction a new peak emerged at 1793 cm 1 which may be due to the presence of carbonyl units such as lactone groups li et al 2017a fig 3 a presented the survey spectra of femn bio char before and after reaction the elements of c 284 8 ev o 531 1 ev fe 287 711 0 ev 724 7 ev and mn 641 4 ev 653 6 ev could be observed from the survey spectra of both catalysts fig 3b showed the c 1s peak of femn bio char before and after reaction from the spectrum before reaction we can see that binding energy at 284 6 ev 285 1 ev 286 1 ev and 288 9 ev corresponded to c c c c c o and o c o respectively ouyang et al 2017 the appearance of c o after reaction could be ascribed to the byproduct of ring opening reaction of naphthalene which was consistent with ftir analysis from the xps spectrum of fe 2p fig 3c two main asymmetric peaks located at 711 0 ev and 724 7 ev could be ascribed to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively wan and wang 2017b for fe 2p3 2 the peak at 710 5 ev was attributed to fe ii another two binding energies at 711 8 ev and 713 2 ev were related to fe iii in different forms besides the shake up satellite peak at about 718 6 ev suggested the presence of fe iii du et al 2018 for high resolution xps spectra of mn 2p fig 3d two main peaks assigned to mn 2p3 2 and mn 2p1 2 were observed at 641 4 ev and 653 6 ev respectively the mn 2p3 2 peak can be divided into two peaks mn ii 641 2 ev and mn iii 642 8 ev du et al 2018 furthermore a satellite peak at 646 9 ev may be ascribed to the presence of mn ii zhou et al 2016 however some values shifted after the reaction with h2o2 and naphthelene from the deconvolution of mn 2p and fe 2p envelops before reaction the peak area ratio of mn iii mn ii was about 0 61 and the percentage of fe ii and fe iii were 49 and 51 respectively while according to the deconvolution of fe 2p and mn 2p envelops after reaction the mn iii mn ii value decreased to 0 37 and the percentage of fe ii and fe iii changed to 43 7 and 56 3 respectively these changes displayed that a good portion of fe ii and mn iii of used femn bio char was transformed to fe iii and mn ii indicating that both mn ii mn iii and fe ii fe iii species were involved in activation of h2o2 by femn bio char esr was used to verify the existence of pfrs in bio char and femn bio char samples and the result was shown in fig 4 the result suggested that for both bio char and femn bio char the pronounced esr signals were observed moreover the esr intensity of femn bio char was higher than that of bio char suggesting that the metal treatment would increase the concentration of pfrs in composite the similar effect was found by fang et al 2015 the room temperature magnetization curves and the magnetization property data of bare fe mn binary oxides and femn bio char composite were shown in fig s2 and table 1 the saturated magnetization ms of femn bio char composite was lower than the ms of bare fe mn binary oxides which might be attributed to the existence of bio char with large saturated magnetization femn bio char could be manipulated through external magnetic field such as magnet fig s2 inset moreover owing to the low remnant magnetization mr values femn bio char composite could easily re disperse in a solution for reuse after separating nguyen et al 2011 3 2 degradation of naphthalene 3 2 1 naphthalene removal using different catalysts the removal of naphthalene by bio char fe mn binary oxides and femn bio char were presented in fig 5 a and the decomposition behavior of h2o2 by different catalysts were shown in fig 5b under dark condition the adsorption equilibrium between naphthalene and catalysts were obtained within 60 min fig s1 approximately 23 4 20 1 and 48 9 of naphthalene was removed by bio char fe mn binary oxides and femn bio char respectively the optimal adsorption performance of femn bio char suggested that there is a synergistic promoting effect between fe mn binary oxides and bio char after addition of h2o2 and visible light irradiation the degradation efficiency of naphthalene significantly improved as seen from fig 5a naphthalene was decreased by 8 5 without catalysts and h2o2 due to volatilization the degradation of naphthalene is ordered as femn bio char femn binary oxides bio char h2o2 alone and the specific value after 148 min is 75 8 46 9 44 9 and 11 5 respectively the removal efficiency with h2o2 alone indicated that h2o2 could hardly degrade naphthalene under visible light irradiation the lower degradation efficiency of fe mn binary oxides might be attributed to the catalyst aggregation which weakened the accessibility of reactants towards the active sites as shown in fig 1 the addition of bio char obviously alleviated the agglomeration of material which was mainly responsible for the higher catalytic performance of femn bio char compared to fe mn binary oxides in addition femn bio char showed a higher catalytic capability towards activating h2o2 for naphthalene removal than bio char probably due to the increasing concentration of pfrs and the activation of h2o2 by fe mn binary oxides eqs 1 and 2 as stated above the synergistic effects of bio char and fe mn binary oxides were significant to the enhancement of catalytic activity for comparison fe bio char and mn bio char were also taken into consideration the pseudo first order plots of h2o2 decomposition under different catalysts were also analyzed fig s3 as shown in fig 5 and fig s3 mn bio char composite exhibited the fastest h2o2 decomposition nearly 89 3 of h2o2 was decomposed within 88 min k 0 029 min 1 whereas only 63 7 naphthalene was degraded by mn bio char composite under visible light irradiation this might be ascribed to the scavenging of oh and less generation of o2 in mn bio char h2o2 system as shown from fig s4 no apparent difference of peak intensities of dmpo oh could be observed between femn bio char and mn bio char though mn bio char exhibited faster decomposition rate of h2o2 than femn bio char this result suggested that the amount of effective oh generated in mn bio char h2o2 system was not larger than that in femn bio char h2o2 system which was possibly because the oh generated rapidly in a short time would be quenched zhong et al 2014 xue et al 2018 additionally we can see from fig s4 that the peak intensities of dmpo o2 in mn bio char h2o2 system was much weaker than that in femn bio char h2o2 system indicating less generation of o2 in mn bio char h2o2 system in comparison the decomposition of h2o2 with fe bio char as catalyst was relatively slower k 0 006 min 1 about 39 2 of h2o2 was decomposed in the presence of fe bio char the faster degradation rate of h2o2 by mn bio char compared to fe bio char might be ascribed to the reaction between mn iii and h2o2 since the order of reactivity between transition ions and h2o2 is mn iii co iii fe iii wan and wang 2017a meanwhile 63 of naphthalene was degraded by fe bio char both degradation values of naphthalene by mn bio char and fe bio char were not comparable with that of femn bio char that is to say the catalysts combining iron and manganese are more efficient in photo fenton reaction therefore femn bio char was selected for further study 1 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh 2 mn ii h2o2 mn iii oh oh 3 2 2 effects of catalyst dosage on naphthalene degradation to select optimum femn bio char dosage the naphthalene degradation by femn bio char was investigated under different initial dosage as shown in fig 6 a femn bio char 0 25 g l 0 5 g l 1 g l and h2o2 within the 148 min reaction time removed 66 7 70 1 and 77 1 of the naphthalene as the amount of femn bio char dosage increased there would be more active sites on catalyst surface in addition more catalyst might increase the adsorption of naphthalene but there was no significant increase of degradation efficiency when further increasing the dosage to 1 5 g l and 2 0 g l on the one hand excessive catalyst in the solution might lead to the loss of available radiation because of light scattering zhong et al 2012 and consequently the regeneration of fe ii would be decreased due to the less effective utilization of visible light see detail discussion in section 3 2 5 on the other hand the scavenging of oh would occur when presenting excessive catalyst eq 3 hence 1 g l was the optimal dosage for the sample 3 m ii oh m iii oh m fe or mn 3 2 3 effects of h2o2 concentration on naphthalene degradation the effect of h2o2 dosage 25 mm 200 mm on naphthalene degradation was shown in fig 6b from fig 6b the degradation efficiency was 64 6 71 2 75 2 and 82 2 corresponding to the concentration of h2o2 at 25 50 100 and 150 mm with the addition of h2o2 there would be more oh generated to degrade high concentration of naphthalene which leads to the increase of naphthalene removal efficiency however when h2o2 concentration increased from 150 mm to 200 mm the degradation of naphthalene decreased from 82 1 to 74 9 which can be attributed to the scavenging of oh by excess h2o2 eq 4 besides excess h2o2 can also compete with naphthalene for the adsorption sites on catalyst surface wan and wang 2017b thus 150 mm h2o2 was an optimal concentration and utilized in subsequent experiments 4 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 3 2 4 effects of ph on naphthalene degradation the degradation efficiency of naphthalene under different initial ph was also explored as seen from fig 6c naphthalene was degraded 77 3 82 8 80 1 and 79 7 under the initial ph of 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively this result suggested that the femn bio char can work effectively under a wide range of ph while a ph 3 solution resulted in a minimal efficiency according to our experiments which was different from the previous studies hu et al 2011 we further studied the removal of naphthalene by homogeneous photo fenton reaction under acidic conditions and the results were presented in fig s5 since the leaching amount of fe and mn after reaction was 1 03 mg l and 2 29 mg l respectively under acidic conditions this may not the optimum catalyst dosage in homogeneous photo fenton reaction when h2o2 concentration was 150 mm hence the degradation kinetic is still governed by heterogeneous fenton reaction in femn bio char h2o2 system under acidic conditions from the results in fig s5 to further explain the relatively lower degradation efficiency of naphthalene under acidic conditions we studied the change of solution ph during reaction under different initial ph as shown from fig s6 when the initial ph was 3 5 5 6 7 and 9 respectively the solution ph dropped rapidly to 2 45 3 0 3 02 3 3 and 7 06 respectively after photo fenton reaction and then changed slightly in the following degradation process the decrease of solution ph might be ascribed to the generation of acidic intermediates during naphthalene degradation hence when the initial ph was 3 the solution ph would rapidly decrease to 2 45 after reaction the formation of fe h2o 6 3 at lower acid environment would restrain the reaction between h2o2 and catalyst leading to the less generation of oh gao et al 2018 which might be reasonable for the lower efficiency at initial ph of 3 additionally previous studies which obtained lower degradation efficiency at acidic conditions have been presented in table s3 when the initial ph was set as 9 0 a slower degradation rate of naphthalene was observed because the generation of oh from h2o2 was gradually restricted and the oxidation potential of oh also decreased with the ph increasing while a relatively higher efficiency was obtained at ph 9 which would be ascribed to the better adsorption of naphthalene in higher ph cheng et al 2018b this was probably because the solutions at higher ph had different ionic strength further affecting adsorption capacity lair et al 2008 moreover femn bio char had relatively high degradation efficacy at neutral initial ph so there was no need to control the ph of wastewater 3 2 5 effects of visible light irradiation on naphthalene degradation to explore the role of light in catalytic oxidation experiment was further conducted under dark condition with femn bio char as catalyst as shown in fig 6d the degradation ratio of naphthalene declined to 69 8 for femn bio char composite in the dark moreover the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 was greatly declined with the absence of visible light irradiation fig 6d inset the remarkable decrease of catalytic efficiency under dark condition possibly because photo reduction of fe iii also played an important role in naphthalene degradation reaction li et al 2017b since the regeneration of fe ii could be accelerated via photo reduction of fe iii eq 5 cai et al 2016 li et al 2017b diao et al 2018 ruales lonfat et al 2015 simultaneously the forming fenton s reagent fe ii h2o2 may further oxidize the contaminants by fenton reaction eq 1 furthermore we studied the degrading activity of femn bio char towards naphthalene under natural sunlight irradiation to investigate the practical application value of this catalyst location hunan university n28 10 54 e112 56 18 date may 9 2019 weather cloudy day as seen from fig s7 83 7 of naphthalene was degraded within 148 min under sunlight irradiation indicating that femn bio char could effectively remove naphthalene under natural sunlight irradiation the obtained results suggested that this photo fenton catalyst exhibited good potentials in environmental remediation process 5 fe iii oh hυ fe ii oh 3 3 identification of reactive radical species the free radical trapping experiments were conducted to identify the reactive oxygen radicals in femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system benzoquinone bq and tert butyl alcohol tba were used as scavengers of superoxide radicals o2 and oh respectively gao et al 2018 yang et al 2018b as seen from fig 7 a the addition of tba rapidly decreased the degradation efficiency of naphthalene while the efficiency was scarcely decreased with the addition of bq the results indicated that oh was the main active species but o2 played minor roles in the photo fenton process to further verify the free radicals species esr with dmpo in aqueous solution was carried out to further determine the free radicals species in this femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system the results were shown in fig 7b the intensity of esr signal depends on concentration of radical s concentration obviously the peak intensities of dmpo oh radical increased with time going on in addition the signals of dmpo o2 were also detected under visible light irradiation indicating that both oh and o2 were generated during reaction however the intensity signals of dmpo o2 were much weaker than dmpo oh this result suggested that oh was the primary oxidative species in this heterogeneous photo fenton system and o2 partially contributed the degradation of naphthalene which were consistent with the results of free radical trapping experiments 3 4 reaction mechanism the mechanism of femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system in the removal of naphthalene was summarized in fig 8 on the one hand pfrs on the surface of samples could directly activate h2o2 to generate oh and further degraded naphthalene to further testify the catalytic performance of pfrs during photo fenton reaction ethanol was used as the scavenger to decrease the concentration of pfrs in bio char zhao et al 2018b as seen from fig s8 the removal efficiency of naphthalene decreased with the increase of the concentration of scavenger the obtained result further confirmed the decent effect of pfrs in this photo fenton process on the other hand the redox catalytic cycle of fe ii fe iii and mn ii mn iii in femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system eqs 1 and 2 can produce oh to oxide naphthalene in this cyclical reaction mn iii can be reduced by fe ii thermodynamically according to the redox potential of e0 mn iii mn ii 1 51 v and e0 fe iii fe ii 0 771v eq 6 which promotes the electron transfer in the reaction system and breaks the restriction that the conversion of mn iii to mn ii was dependent on h2o2 eq 7 simultaneously fe ii could be regenerated via photolysis of fe iii eq 5 the efficient regeneration of fe ii and mn ii could contribute to the remarkable increase of naphthalene degradation activity 6 fe ii mn iii mn ii fe iii 7 mn iii h2o2 mn ii ho2 h 3 5 identification of intermediates and transformation pathway the main intermediates identification and confirmation by gc ms analysis are presented in table s6 and the possible degradation pathways were proposed based on above intermediates the oh formed from femn bio char photo fenton system could attack α position of naphthalene 1 and led to the structure 2 fig 9 an abstraction of h from structure 2 yielded the formation of 1 naphthol 3 which was the primary intermediates of naphthalene degradation andas et al 2014 the second possibility was the formation of 2 formylcinnamaldehyde 5 by an attack of o2 on the naphthalene which produced an unstable endoperoxide 4 lair et al 2008 while the direct attack by o2 was rare since o2 was not the primary active radicals in this study in addition oh attacking structure 5 resulted in the formation of 1 2 benzenedicarboxaldehyde 6 and finally led to the generation of 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid 7 yang et al 2018b then structure 7 further reacted with oh to form 1 propene 1 2 3 tricarboxylic acid 8 garcia segura et al 2013 3 6 reuse of catalyst and application on the real wastewater treatment the stability of femn bio char is significantly important in actual application hence four consecutive experiments were conducted to investigate the stability of femn bio char as seen from fig 10 a the removal efficiency after four cycles was 82 2 75 3 72 2 and 71 0 respectively the loss of activity might be ascribed to the following reasons firstly the concentration of pfrs would decrease after addition of h2o2 fang et al 2014 and the slight leaching of metal ions on the catalyst would lead to the loss of active sites secondly some residual by products might block the active catalytic sites and further hindered the degradation efficiency of organics nguyen et al 2011 besides the xrd pattern of femn bio char before and after use was presented in fig 10b to examine the crystal structure of catalyst no apparent changes can be seen from fig 10b further confirming the stability of the catalyst additionally the leaching amount of fe and mn after reaction was 0 55 mg l and 2 03 mg l respectively water matrix is an important factor in actual applications hence the difference between actual wastewater and simulated wastewater could significantly impact the degradation efficiency of target contaminant naphthalene in this study the removal efficiency of naphthalene in ultrapure water tap water changsha running water company river water taken from xiangjiang river changsha industrial wastewater obtained from hebei cangzhou dahua co ltd china and medical wastewater obtained from changsha 4th hospital changsha china were investigated fig s9 the results fig s9 showed that the removal efficiency of naphthalene in ultrapure water tap water river water industrial wastewater and medical wastewater was 82 2 80 4 79 5 70 7 and 72 3 respectively the consumption of oh by the organic matters in industrial wastewater and medical wastewater might be responsible for the relatively lower removal of naphthalene in these two wastewaters the obtained results showed the proposed photo fenton process could remove most of the naphthalene in different types of polluted waters suggesting that this photo fenton catalyst exhibited good potentials for treatment of actual wastewater 4 conclusion in this study the bio char based catalysts were successfully synthesized via wet impregnation method with one step pyrolysis moreover the femn bio char exhibited pronounced photo fenton reactivity than fe bio char and mn bio char owing to the synergistic effects of iron and manganese the femn bio char h2o2 photo fenton system can work effectively at a wide ph range additionally femn bio char showed good stability and reusability during photo fenton process bio char and fe mn binary oxides presented synergistic promoting effect in this photo fenton system the combination of these two materials not only enhanced the adsorption capacity of contaminant but also accelerated the activation towards h2o2 the regeneration of fe ii and mn ii and the increase concentration of pfrs mainly responsible for the remarkable increase of removal efficiency a further study conducted in river water tap water industrial wastewater and medical wastewater confirmed the application feasibility of femn bio char in actual wastewater treatment this work may bring valuable insights for the potential environmental applications of modified bio char declaration of interest statement there are no conflicts to declare

18739,decentralized wastewater treatment represents a promising sustainable option for future wastewater management blackwater collected from toilets contains high concentrations of organic matter ideal for energy recovery using anaerobic digestion up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors treating conventional toilet ct 9 l water per flush and vacuum toilet vt 1 l water per flush blackwater with increments of loadings were successfully operated to steady state in three phases the organic loading rates were maintained at comparable levels between the two reactors the methanisation rates were 0 23 0 29 and 0 41 0 48 gch4 cod gfeedcod in the ct and vt reactors and the cod removal rates were 72 and 89 respectively the enriched microbial consortia and the community dynamics under different loading phases were compared the rank abundance distributions and alpha diversity showed that archaeal communities were predominated by mono enrichments in both ct and vt reactors while bacterial communities showed lower diversity in the vt reactor through principal coordinates analysis beta diversity clear divergences of archaeal and bacterial communities between the ct and vt reactors were revealed and the archaeal community developed at a slower rate than the bacterial community the enriched archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanolinea in the ct reactor 56 6 and methanogenium in the vt reactor 62 3 the enriched bacteria were porphyromonadaceae in both ct 15 9 and vt 13 4 reactors sulfate reducing bacteria in the ct reactor and fibrobacteraceae in the vt reactor 13 8 links between enriched consortia and ammonia stress were discussed isotope fraction analysis of the biogas showed a slight shift from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis a closer look into the predicted metagenomic functional profiles showed agreeing results where hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and fhs gene abundances were higher in the vt reactor we demonstrated that different blackwater types enriched different microbial consortia probably due to ammonia concentrations and sulfate loadings which should be taken into consideration for practical applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial community structure anaerobic digestion blackwater decentralized wastewater management 1 introduction many large centralized wastewater management systems have become less preferable due to their high maintenance and renewal costs and costly energy use with traditional aerobic treatment systems in areas with population growth and higher housing densities decentralized wastewater management systems are an attractive option to reduce energy and water footprints abdel shafy et al 2009 gao et al 2019 taking a more systems based view resource recovery systems are generally preferable over conventional centralized systems schoen et al 2017 source diversion of household wastewater by separately collecting blackwater toilet wastewater and greywater laundry handwashing shower and kitchen waste has brought up new possibilities for decentralized wastewater treatment to maximize energy saving and resource recovery kujawa roeleveld et al 2006 xue et al 2016 blackwater contains the majority of organics nutrients and pathogens gallagher and sharvelle 2010 and treating it separately improves the efficiency for energy and nutrient recovery anaerobic digestion is a sustainable wastewater treatment technology that transforms organics into biomethane lettinga et al 2001 but is typically not considered efficient for treating municipal wastewater blackwater however is more amenable but varies significantly based on the amount of water used for toilet flushing gallagher and sharvelle 2010 conventional toilets may use 5 9 l water for each flush while at the other extreme vacuum flush toilets typically consume 0 5 1 5 l water for each flush when considering energy recovery through methanogenesis previous batch studies have demonstrated that the biological methane potential bmp of blackwater collected from different toilets vary significantly gao et al 2019 our previous results showed that distinct microbial communities were developed in batch reactors treating different types of blackwater gao et al 2019 the microbial community development was associated with not only the organics composition and concentration but also free ammonia concentration and ph in particular vacuum toilet collected blackwater contains a much greater free ammonia concentration as compared to blackwater collected from conventional toilets high concentration of free ammonia has been reported as a stress factor in full scale anaerobic digesters treating municipal sludge manure and other organic wastes sun et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2015 muller et al 2016 tian et al 2018a free ammonia could inhibit microbial activities and reduce cod removal and methane production efficiencies it has been recognized that hydrogenotrophic methanogens predominate under high ammonia stresses rather than acetoclastic methanogens werner et al 2014 tian et al 2018a using acetate as the organic feed it was demonstrated that microorganisms undergo a syntrophic acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm pathway under high ammonia conditions mosbaek et al 2016 westerholm et al 2016 tian et al 2018b for complex substrate feeding e g blackwater whether such a mechanism could occur remains unknown further microbial population development in continuous operating reactors differs from batch systems one of the most widely applied anaerobic digestion systems is the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor the up flow operation enables the sludge maintenance inside the reactor and improves the contact between the wastewater stream and the microorganisms luostarinen and rintala 2007 blackwater treatment using a continuous uasb reactor has been reported in a few recent studies at different operational conditions a 91 cod removal and a methane production of 0 27 gch4 cod gcod were achieved through the combination of uasb and membrane reactor at 37 c treating 5 l water flushed blackwater van voorthuizen et al 2008 an average of 78 cod removal and methane production of 1 8 m3 ch4 m3 of blackwater were reported in a uasb reactor treating vacuum toilet blackwater at 25 c with an hrt of 8 7 days de graaff et al 2010 a 90 cod removal was achieved at low temperatures of 20 c and 10 c treating synthetic blackwater of 1 g l total cod with a two phased uasb septic tank luostarinen and rintala 2007 however no studies have reported the development of the microbial communities inside continuous operating blackwater treatment reactors at different operational conditions or investigated the links between operational parameters microbial communities and reactor performances the current study aims to investigate the microbial community development in continuous operating uasb reactors treating conventional and vacuum toilet flushed blackwater with increments of loadings and to compare the acclimatized microbial consortia between the two types of blackwater feedings two uasb reactors were operated at mesophilic conditions the microbial community structure diversity and composition at three development phases were investigated the information can help elucidate the underlying microbial driving force and guide future reactor design and operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and reactor operation fresh blackwater was collected from 20 persons every week during the experimental period and stored at 4 c until use dilution of blackwater was performed using tap water to mimic conventional toilets at 9 l water per

working volume 4 7 l with peristaltic pumps longer pump bt 100 2 j the uasb reactors were operated at 35 c fed with 1 l water flush or 9 l water flush blackwater both uasb reactors were seeded with 2

local wastewater treatment plant in edmonton alberta canada the operational conditions of uasb reactors and treatment performances at three phases are shown in table 1 total operation durations for the uasb reactors treating conventional toilet blackwater and vacuum toilet blackwater were 120 and 115 days respectively the calculation of hydraulic retention time hrt was performed by dividing the reactor working volume l to the influent blackwater flowrate l day the organic loading rates olr were calculated by dividing the average influent blackwater chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations to the hrt of each operation phase for the two uasb reactors the hrt was stepwise reduced from phase 1 to phase 3 leading to increasing organic loading rates for the conventional toilet blackwater

the organic loading rate was 0 28 0 48 and 0 81 kgcod m3 d in phases 1 2 and 3 respectively for each operational phase the two reactors organic loading rates were maintained relatively similar p 0 05 hrts and corresponding olrs applied in the current study were selected based on literature values and tested in our reactors to ensure stable operation for instance the reported hrt for ct blackwater anaerobic treatment systems varied from 0 5 to 3 5 days abdel shafy et al 2009 gallagher and sharvelle 2010 van voorthuizen et al 2008 while much longer hrts ranging from 8 3 to 30 days zeeman et al 2008 were reported for vt blackwater treatment 2 2 chemical analysis the influent and effluent characteristics of each phase were monitored to reveal chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency and

closed references in greengenes version 13 8 using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust langille et al 2013 the reference database used in picrust was the integrated microbial genomes img system markowitz et al 2012 for metagenome and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg kanehisa et al 2012 for functional gene annotation 3 results 3 1 operation phases and performance the treatment performances were shown in table 1 the different toilet flushing systems provided different cod and tan concentrations for the two types of collected blackwater with the influent cod concentration at 900 1100 mg l and tan at 40 70 mg l for the conventional toilet ct blackwater and the influent cod concentration at 8500 11000 mg l and tan at 1000 1100 mg l supplemented with ammonia when the ammonia concentration of the collected vacuum toilet vt blackwater showed values lower than the 1 000 1 100 mg l to maintain constant feedstock properties for the vacuum toilet vt blackwater the variations in chemical properties in both conventional toilet and vacuum toilet collected blackwater are due to the natural fluctuation of the blackwater production the influent blackwater properties for the two types were similar as reported in literatures de graaff et al 2010 van voorthuizen et al 2008 the methanisation was significantly higher in the vt reactor p 0 05 but not significantly different between different phases in either reactor the accumulated methane content in the biogas was stable through all phases and was slightly higher in the vt reactor 72 in the ct reactor and 75 in the vt reactor the ct reactor methanisation 0 23 0 29 gch4 cod gfeedcod was comparable with reported results of 0 27 gch4 cod gfeedcod using the combined uasb and membrane reactor van voorthuizen et al 2008 the effluent qualities were relatively stable for both reactors in terms of effluent ph cod and tan the average cod removal efficiencies for the ct reactor was 72 6 for the three operational phases in this study which was higher than the reported 64 cod removal efficiency with similar operating temperature at 37 c but shorter hrt of 12 h van voorthuizen et al 2008 the average cod removal efficiencies for vt reactor was 89 2 for the three operational phases in this study which was higher than the reported 78 cod removal efficiency with a less favourable operating temperature at 25 c and shorter hrt of 8 7 days de graaff et al 2010 each type of detected volatile fatty acids vfas for both reactors were lower than 50 mg l indicating sufficient methanogenesis capacity inside the systems under the studied conditions the tan concentrations were increased in the effluent compared with the influent due to the release of ammonia from the substrate hydrolysis process accordingly the calculated free ammonia concentrations were higher in the vt reactor 98 9 123 5 mg l than in the ct reactor 1 7 2 5 mg l the free ammonia levels were lower than the typically reported inhibition levels of 200 mg l de graaff et al 2010 gao et al 2019 in the vt reactor the sludge vss concentration increased from the initial concentration of 13 1 0 6 g l to 24 9 5 1 28 9 3 4 and 23 5 0 4 g l in phases 1 3 respectively the ct reactor also showed increases of sludge vss concentrations to 15 6 1 4 17 5 4 7 and 15 4 1 7 g l in phases 1 3 respectively vss concentrations were resulted from different microbial growth dynamics and developed microbial communities in the two reactors the community development is a dynamic process which can be affected by various factors the organic loading rates olrs were kept similar between the two reactors but the ammonia loading rates and concentrations were higher in the vt reactor therefore the main factors for microbial community development were olr increases through phases 1 3 and ammonia concentration difference between the two reactors 3 2 microbial community diversity the rank abundance distributions of archaeal and bacterial communities at the genus level and the total number of genera are presented in fig 1 in both ct and vt reactors the archaeal communities fig 1a showed a steeper gradient than the inoculum representing a less even distribution the first ranked archaeal genus took up around 60 of total community abundance indicating mono enrichment in the community the total number of genera were similar between 9 and 11 in each sample the distribution curves of the first 15 bacterial genera fig 1b of the three phases in the ct reactor were lower than the inoculum on the contrary the vt reactor showed much steeper slopes in phases 1 and 2 due to the higher relative abundance of the first ranked genus in phase 3 the relative abundance of the first ranked genus dropped and the distribution curve became similar with the inoculum the number of genera was 119 in the inoculum 116 in ct phase 1 and increased to 146 and 172 in phases 2 and 3 a decrease was shown in the vt reactor to 81 71 and 79 in the three phases respectively the evenness of the communities was measured using the gini coefficient werner et al 2014 fig 1c in archaea the gini coefficient fluctuated along different phases in bacteria the community changed to higher evenness lower gini coefficient in the ct reactor than the inoculum while it remained similar in the vt reactor compared with the inoculum the archaeal shannon diversity fig 1d fluctuated in different phases in the bacterial community the shannon index showed higher values in the ct reactor compared with the inoculum the vt reactor showed similar levels with the inoculum the lower bacterial diversity in the vt reactor fewer genera evenness and shannon index as compared to that in the ct reactor indicated a higher stress level possibly attributed to the high organic and ammonia concentrations in vt collected blackwater table 1 nevertheless lower bacterial diversity co occurred with higher methane production in the vt reactor this observation could be explained by the high substrate concentrations selecting microorganisms with higher growth rates i e r strategists klappenbach et al 2000 nemergut et al 2016 wu et al 2017 resulting in higher substrate utilization and methane production a previous study showed that higher organic loading rate selected r strategists which resulted an increased methane production with no inhibition on the microbial communities wu et al 2017 the beta diversity of the archaeal and bacterial communities was presented on the principal coordinate analysis pcoa plot of bray curtis distances among samples fig 2 the archaeal communities in phase 1 of both reactors shifted towards the same direction fig 2a then the two reactors diverged to different directions forming two clusters apart from each other along the pcoa1 axis which explains 75 5 of total sample variance the bacterial communities of the inoculum feed blackwater ct and vt reactors formed clusters distinct with each other fig 2b the community was stable through phase 1 to phase 3 in either reactor the bacterial communities that developed in the two reactors were divergent yet more similar than to the original community in the feeding blackwater indicating that the operational conditions had greater impacts on the reactor communities than the communities in the feed water the archaeal community changed slowly from phases 1 to 3 whereas the bacterial community did not change from phase 1 comparing the temporal changes the archaeal community takes a longer time than the bacterial community to stabilize this could be explained by the fact that archaea have higher doubling time i e slower growth than bacteria and the community turnover rate is also slower zinder 1993 the concentrations of cod and tan are putative leading factors that selected different communities werner et al 2014 found that increases in ammonia concentration perturbed the bacterial community in anaerobic digesters leading to more unevenness in the microbial community higher gini coefficient similarly in our data the vt reactor received a high ammonia loading and showed greater unevenness than the ct reactor fig 1c noticeably the vt reactor had lower numbers of genera in both archaeal and bacterial communities than the ct reactor the high concentrations of ammonia and other substrates probably inhibited more microbial genera resulting in less diverse communities 3 3 enriched archaeal consortia at the genus level 11 archaeal taxa were detected among all samples fig 3 the inoculum was dominated by three methanogens each 10 methanolinea and two unidentified genera in the family f methanospirillaceae two other genera showed relative abundance 1 methanoculleus and methanospirillum methanosarcina and methanosaeta were at very low abundances 0 03 and 0 04 respectively in the inoculum the ct reactor inherited the most abundant genus methanolinea from the inoculum which dominated through phase 1 to phase 3 methanospirillum gradually increased from phase 1 to phase 3 becoming the second predominant genus methanoculleus and the two unidentified genera in f methanospirillaceae deceased gradually methanosarcina increased in phases 1 and 2 1 methanosaeta was not detected in phase 1 and appeared in phase 2 and 3 at low levels 1 in the vt reactor methanolinea was the most abundant genus in phase 1 and second most abundant in phases 2 and 3 a remarkable increase was shown for methanogenium which was not detected in inoculum or the ct reactor but became dominant in phases 2 and 3 in the vt reactor the two unidentified genera in methanospirillaceae methanospirillum and methanoculleus decreased at the end of phase 3 compared with the inoculum methanosaeta became non detectable while methanosarcina slightly increased compared with the inoculum the predominant archaeal genera in the inoculum and reactors were different in composition methanolinea the family methanospirillaceae methanoculleus methanospirillum and methanogenium but they all belong to the order methanomicrobiales which all perform hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis garcia et al 2006 methanomicrobiales is closely correlated to high tan conditions in other studies especially the genus methanoculleus westerholm et al 2012 moestedt et al 2016 tian et al 2018a in full scale reactors methanomicrobiales was less affected by the ammonia concentration compared to methanobacteriales methanosaetaceae and methanosarcinaceae de vrieze et al 2015 methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales were the most abundant archaeal orders in syntrophic acetate oxidization digesters werner et al 2014 in our study methanomicrobiales took up 99 97 and 99 of archaeal communities of the inoculum ct reactor and vt reactor respectively methanoculleus accounted for only 0 55 0 84 and 2 89 9 56 in ct and vt reactors respectively methanogenium was reported in a limited number of studies of anaerobic digesters it was reported as the most abundant archaea in household digesters at low temperatures 11 1 15 7 c in high plateau environments han et al 2018 it was grown at low abundance in mesophilic anaerobic digester treating swine manure zhu et al 2011 qin et al 2013 as well as swine manure storage tanks barret et al 2012 2013 pure culture of methanogenium sp showed slower growth rates with increasing concentration of ammonia at higher than 3 g nh4 n l hendriksen and ahring 1991 however previous studies aiming for high tan conditions rarely reported methanogenium in the archaeal community methanogenium was found in marine methanogens romesser et al 1979 which are tolerant to high salinity in a high salinity anaerobic digester treating secondary sludge methanomicrobiales dominated in the archaeal community and species closely related to methanogenium marinum were abundant shin et al 2010 whether the salinity tolerance and ammonia tolerance could be compared may need further information acetoclastic methanogenesis is more vulnerable to high ammonia concentration than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis karakashev et al 2006 thus acetoclastic methanogenesis may be inhibited in ammonia rich reactors such as reactors treating manure or slaughterhouse waste sun et al 2014 in our blackwater fed reactors the acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta were in low abundance in the ct reactor and decreased to undetectable levels in the vt reactor methanosarcina increased slightly in both reactors possibly due to its versatile functionalities and resistance to harsh conditions sun et al 2014 mosbaek et al 2016 although they were most commonly reported methanogens in sewage sludge fed anaerobic digesters de vrieze et al 2015 their abundance was lower than expected in our study noticeably the sum of methanosaeta and methanosarcina only accounted for 0 07 of inoculum archaeal community which may have some impact on the community in our reactors 3 4 enriched bacterial consortia in ct and vt reactors the most abundant families and fold changes compared to the inoculum are shown in fig 4 four groups of families were classified groups a d in fig 4 based on their fold changes in relative abundances in group a bacterial families increased in both reactors families in group b or c were enriched in the ct reactor only or vt reactor only respectively group d represents families that remained at similar or decreased abundances in both reactors enriched families in group a were low in the inoculum the family porphyromonadaceae increased to 15 9 in the ct reactor in phase 3 and 13 4 in the vt reactor in phase 3 fibrobacteraceae increased remarkably in the vt reactor to 13 8 in phase 3 bacteroidaceae grew to 1 8 and 7 0 and marinilabiaceae increased to 1 8 and 1 6 in phase 3 of ct and vt reactors respectively lachnospiraceae reached 2 8 in ct phase 3 one unidentified family in the order clostridiales increased to 2 0 in the vt reactor in phase 3 species in the families porphyromonadaceae lachnospiraceae and in the order clostridiales were also observed in communities under high ammonium conditions muller et al 2016 porphyromonadaceae abundance was significantly higher in high ammonia reactors than in low ammonia reactors muller et al 2016 and a predominated anaerobic digester treating chicken wastes ziganshina et al 2015 bacteroidaceae was found at elevated abundance correlated with total ammonia concentration in full scale reactors de vrieze et al 2015 clostridiales species were reported for their tolerance of high ammonia concentrations de vrieze et al 2015 mosbaek et al 2016 muller et al 2016 tian et al 2018a they were widely spread in the inoculum and reactors some of these bacteria were reported in anaerobic digesters treating animal wastes e g swine manure cattle manure and chicken waste marinilabiaceae was highly abundant in ammonia rich chicken waste anaerobic digesters ziganshina et al 2015 fibrobacteraceae was the second most abundant family in cattle rumen fluid bacteroidaceae was the second most abundant family in cattle manure ozbayram et al 2018b fibrobacteraceae bacteroidaceae porphyromonadaceae are important fiber digesting bacteria capable of enhancing anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass yan et al 2012 ozbayram et al 2018a 2018b their increased abundance in the blackwater fed reactors could be associated with the presence of lignocellulosic matter in blackwater group d showed families that reduced to non detectable levels such as microthrixaceae in both reactors comamonadaceae and syntrophorhabdaceae in the vt reactor the well known syntrophic families syntrophorhabdaceae and syntrophaceae decreased in both reactors the other families in group d decreased but still maintained their high abundances such as anaerolinaceae cloacamonaceae spirochaetaceae thermovirgaceae and rikenellaceae 3 5 enriched bacteria specific to the ct reactor in the ct reactor the enrichments group b fig 4 included sulfate reducing bacterial families desulfobulbaceae desulfomicrobiaceae and desulfobacteraceae with total abundances of 7 3 5 2 and 5 5 in phases 1 3 respectively this observation is correlated with the relatively higher sulfate concentration in the ct collected blackwater since the blackwater sulfate source was supplemented from tap water at a concentration of 61 9 0 1 mg l ct collected blackwater contains a higher sulfate concentration per cod 90 5 17 8 mg per gcod as compared to vt collected blackwater 28 3 3 8 mg per gcod the cod so4 2 ratios were 10 9 11 7 and 33 6 35 2 in the ct and vt feed respectively which were higher than the reported inhibition threshold of 1 6 siles et al 2010 and did not cause complete inhibition of methanogenesis negative effects of sulfate on methanogenesis have been reported previously and mainly include i organic substrate competition between sulphate reducing bacteria and methanogens and ii toxicity of sulphate reduction produced h2s towards methanogens j w h et al 1994 chen et al 2008 siles et al 2010 dai et al 2017 hereby sulphate concentrations in ct collected blackwater should be monitored when designing anaerobic digestion systems for ct collected blackwater treatment campylobacteraceae rhodocyclaceae pseudanabaenaceae an unidentifed family in the class opb56 geobacteraceae opitutaceae elusimicrobiaceae and an unidentifed family in the class bacteroidales were higher than 1 in the last phase inferring their possible active roles in treating the ct collected blackwater 3 6 enriched bacteria specific to the vt reactor in the vt reactor fibrobacteraceae 13 8 an unidentified family in the order clostridiales 13 6 fig 4 group c together with porphyromonadaceae 13 4 were the most abundant families specifically less numbers of taxa group c fig 4 were enriched compared with the ct reactor group b in accordance with the lower community diversity fig 1 ruminococcaceae tissierellaceae and clostridiaceae showed higher than a 2 fold change compared with the inoculum xanthomonadaceae and actinomycetales were largely increased in phase 1 then decreased in phases 2 and 3 ruminococcaceae tissierellaceae and clostridiales have been reported in high ammonia stressed anaerobic communities muller et al 2016 species in the family tissierellaceae were related to salt tolerance such as tissierella and soehngeni wang et al 2017 sedimentibacter in the family tissierellaceae was enriched in low ammonia sao communities muller et al 2016 sao bacterial species include five known species thermacetogenium phaeum pseudothermotoga lettingae tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans clostridium ultunense and syntrophaceticus schinkii the latter two characterized as mesophilic saob westerholm et al 2016 however these species were not identified in our study the enriched consortia in the vt reactor under high organic loading and ammonia stresses resemble previously reported sao communities werner et al 2014 muller et al 2016 tian et al 2018a suggesting that a broader number of species may be associated with sao function under the high ammonia stress westerholm et al 2016 3 7 functional shift at the end of reactor operation a carbon isotope test was performed for the methane and carbon dioxide gases our results showed that the biogas δ 13 c o 2 fraction was 46 71 and the δ 13 c h 4 fraction was 10 60 in the ct reactor and 49 65 δ 13 c o 2 and 4 59 δ 13 c h 4 fraction in the vt reactor the apparent fractionation factor α c was 1 038 and 1 047 for the ct and vt reactors respectively a higher α c indicates that a methanogenesis pathway shifts from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis lü et al 2013 hao et al 2017 our results showed that the α c value was higher in the vt reactor than that in the ct reactor indicating that the archaeal communities were dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens the ammonia concentration was higher in the vt reactor which may be related with the higher α c the microbial community 16s rrna gene data were analyzed to predict functional genes kanehisa et al 2012 markowitz et al 2012 related with sao hm the major methanogenesis pathways hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis consisted of different functional genes supplementary information the total abundances are shown in fig 5 a hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis genes slightly decreased in the ct reactor and increased in the vt reactor whereas acetoclastic methanogenesis genes stayed at similar levels in all samples the gene abundances were predicted from the 16s rrna genes thus it reflects the taxonomic abundances in fig 3 in the bacterial community the prevalence of sao indicator fhs gene muller et al 2016 is shown in fig 5b compared to the inoculum both 9l bw and 1l bw fed reactors had increased levels of the fhs gene it increased gradually in the ct reactor in the vt reactor the fhs gene abundance showed a dramatic increase from phase 1 to phase 2 then marginally decreased in phase 3 the total relative abundances of otus contributing to fhs gene prevalence showed similar trends accounting for 24 of total bacterial otu abundance in the inoculum 34 40 in the ct reactor and 30 38 in the vt reactor detailed otu relative contribution to the fhs gene prevalence is shown in supplementary fig s2 and fig s3 at a family level the main contributing families in the inoculum were syntrophic bacteria syntrophorhabdaceae and syntrophaceae which decreased in both reactors in the ct reactor the highest contribution was from sulfate reducing bacterial families desulfobulbaceae and desulfomicrobiaceae porphyromonadaceae and ruminococcaceae showed increased contribution in phase 3 in the vt reactor the highest contribution was from an unidentified family in the order clostridiales which increased through phases 1 to 3 it is noticed that the ct and vt reactors did not show significant differences in their predicted functional profiles their reactor performances and enriched community compositions are different but it could hardly be explained through the predicted prevalence of the fhs gene the higher abundances of sulfate reducing bacteria fig 4 in the ct reactor may contribute to lower methane production yield liu et al 2015 due to the competition of sulfate reducing bacteria for carbon source and or the toxicity of hydrogen sulphide produced from sulfate reduction reaction to methanogens j w h et al 1994 siles et al 2010 dai et al 2017 ammonia concentration together with other possible stress factors in the vt reactor could contribute to the low microbial community diversity which did not significantly impact the sao hm communities 4 conclusions water saving vacuum toilets vt collected blackwater contains significantly higher concentrations of organics and ammonia compared to the conventional toilets ct collected blackwater which has led to different biogas production rates and microbial communities in anaerobic digestion reactors treating blackwater the vt reactor showed a higher methane production rate without any noticeable inhibition to the microbial community the temporal dynamics of archaeal and bacterial communities indicated that the archaeal community had slowly adapted during different phases resulting in a mono dominance of a single genus whereas the bacterial community was quickly adapted and remained stable through different phases lower alpha diversity and higher methane production rates indicated selection of r strategists in the vt reactor consortia due to the high substrate and ammonia concentrations in vt collected blackwater the enriched microorganisms were compared between the ct and vt reactors methanolinea was the most abundant archaeal genus in the ct reactor and methanogenium in the vt reactor methanogenium was reported to tolerate high ammonia concentrations but is infrequently reported as dominant in anaerobic digesters both reactors were dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens the enriched bacteria were linked with high ammonia conditions including porphyromonadaceae fibrobacteraceae ruminococcaceae bacteroidaceae clostridiales etc the apparent fractionation factor α c calculated from δ 13 c o 2 and δ 13 c h 4 fractions and predicted metagenomic functions indicated functional shifts to the syntrophic acetate oxidization and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway in the vt reactor this study provided detailed information on microbial community dynamics and implied functions for concentrated and dilute

18739,decentralized wastewater treatment represents a promising sustainable option for future wastewater management blackwater collected from toilets contains high concentrations of organic matter ideal for energy recovery using anaerobic digestion up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors treating conventional toilet ct 9 l water per flush and vacuum toilet vt 1 l water per flush blackwater with increments of loadings were successfully operated to steady state in three phases the organic loading rates were maintained at comparable levels between the two reactors the methanisation rates were 0 23 0 29 and 0 41 0 48 gch4 cod gfeedcod in the ct and vt reactors and the cod removal rates were 72 and 89 respectively the enriched microbial consortia and the community dynamics under different loading phases were compared the rank abundance distributions and alpha diversity showed that archaeal communities were predominated by mono enrichments in both ct and vt reactors while bacterial communities showed lower diversity in the vt reactor through principal coordinates analysis beta diversity clear divergences of archaeal and bacterial communities between the ct and vt reactors were revealed and the archaeal community developed at a slower rate than the bacterial community the enriched archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanolinea in the ct reactor 56 6 and methanogenium in the vt reactor 62 3 the enriched bacteria were porphyromonadaceae in both ct 15 9 and vt 13 4 reactors sulfate reducing bacteria in the ct reactor and fibrobacteraceae in the vt reactor 13 8 links between enriched consortia and ammonia stress were discussed isotope fraction analysis of the biogas showed a slight shift from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis a closer look into the predicted metagenomic functional profiles showed agreeing results where hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and fhs gene abundances were higher in the vt reactor we demonstrated that different blackwater types enriched different microbial consortia probably due to ammonia concentrations and sulfate loadings which should be taken into consideration for practical applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial community structure anaerobic digestion blackwater decentralized wastewater management 1 introduction many large centralized wastewater management systems have become less preferable due to their high maintenance and renewal costs and costly energy use with traditional aerobic treatment systems in areas with population growth and higher housing densities decentralized wastewater management systems are an attractive option to reduce energy and water footprints abdel shafy et al 2009 gao et al 2019 taking a more systems based view resource recovery systems are generally preferable over conventional centralized systems schoen et al 2017 source diversion of household wastewater by separately collecting blackwater toilet wastewater and greywater laundry handwashing shower and kitchen waste has brought up new possibilities for decentralized wastewater treatment to maximize energy saving and resource recovery kujawa roeleveld et al 2006 xue et al 2016 blackwater contains the majority of organics nutrients and pathogens gallagher and sharvelle 2010 and treating it separately improves the efficiency for energy and nutrient recovery anaerobic digestion is a sustainable wastewater treatment technology that transforms organics into biomethane lettinga et al 2001 but is typically not considered efficient for treating municipal wastewater blackwater however is more amenable but varies significantly based on the amount of water used for toilet flushing gallagher and sharvelle 2010 conventional toilets may use 5 9 l water for each flush while at the other extreme vacuum flush toilets typically consume 0 5 1 5 l water for each flush when considering energy recovery through methanogenesis previous batch studies have demonstrated that the biological methane potential bmp of blackwater collected from different toilets vary significantly gao et al 2019 our previous results showed that distinct microbial communities were developed in batch reactors treating different types of blackwater gao et al 2019 the microbial community development was associated with not only the organics composition and concentration but also free ammonia concentration and ph in particular vacuum toilet collected blackwater contains a much greater free ammonia concentration as compared to blackwater collected from conventional toilets high concentration of free ammonia has been reported as a stress factor in full scale anaerobic digesters treating municipal sludge manure and other organic wastes sun et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2015 muller et al 2016 tian et al 2018a free ammonia could inhibit microbial activities and reduce cod removal and methane production efficiencies it has been recognized that hydrogenotrophic methanogens predominate under high ammonia stresses rather than acetoclastic methanogens werner et al 2014 tian et al 2018a using acetate as the organic feed it was demonstrated that microorganisms undergo a syntrophic acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm pathway under high ammonia conditions mosbaek et al 2016 westerholm et al 2016 tian et al 2018b for complex substrate feeding e g blackwater whether such a mechanism could occur remains unknown further microbial population development in continuous operating reactors differs from batch systems one of the most widely applied anaerobic digestion systems is the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor the up flow operation enables the sludge maintenance inside the reactor and improves the contact between the wastewater stream and the microorganisms luostarinen and rintala 2007 blackwater treatment using a continuous uasb reactor has been reported in a few recent studies at different operational conditions a 91 cod removal and a methane production of 0 27 gch4 cod gcod were achieved through the combination of uasb and membrane reactor at 37 c treating 5 l water flushed blackwater van voorthuizen et al 2008 an average of 78 cod removal and methane production of 1 8 m3 ch4 m3 of blackwater were reported in a uasb reactor treating vacuum toilet blackwater at 25 c with an hrt of 8 7 days de graaff et al 2010 a 90 cod removal was achieved at low temperatures of 20 c and 10 c treating synthetic blackwater of 1 g l total cod with a two phased uasb septic tank luostarinen and rintala 2007 however no studies have reported the development of the microbial communities inside continuous operating blackwater treatment reactors at different operational conditions or investigated the links between operational parameters microbial communities and reactor performances the current study aims to investigate the microbial community development in continuous operating uasb reactors treating conventional and vacuum toilet flushed blackwater with increments of loadings and to compare the acclimatized microbial consortia between the two types of blackwater feedings two uasb reactors were operated at mesophilic conditions the microbial community structure diversity and composition at three development phases were investigated the information can help elucidate the underlying microbial driving force and guide future reactor design and operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and reactor operation fresh blackwater was collected from 20 persons every week during the experimental period and stored at 4 c until use dilution of blackwater was performed using tap water to mimic conventional toilets at 9 l water per flush and vacuum toilets at 1 l water per flush the influent was prepared daily and filled into storage bottles at room temperature then fed into two 5 l up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors working volume 4 7 l with peristaltic pumps longer pump bt 100 2 j the uasb reactors were operated at 35 c fed with 1 l water flush or 9 l water flush blackwater both uasb reactors were seeded with 2 35 l anaerobic flocculant sludge volatile suspended solids vss concentration of 13 1 0 6 g l from a full scale mesophilic anaerobic digester treating primary sludge and waste activated sludge in a local wastewater treatment plant in edmonton alberta canada the operational conditions of uasb reactors and treatment performances at three phases are shown in table 1 total operation durations for the uasb reactors treating conventional toilet blackwater and vacuum toilet blackwater were 120 and 115 days respectively the calculation of hydraulic retention time hrt was performed by dividing the reactor working volume l to the influent blackwater flowrate l day the organic loading rates olr were calculated by dividing the average influent blackwater chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations to the hrt of each operation phase for the two uasb reactors the hrt was stepwise reduced from phase 1 to phase 3 leading to increasing organic loading rates for the conventional toilet blackwater reactor ct hrt decreased from 5 5 to 3 and 1 4 d and the organic loading rate was increased from 0 18 to 0 36 and 0 76 kgcod m3 d for the vacuum toilet blackwater reactor vt hrt were 36 20 12 d and the organic loading rate was 0 28 0 48 and 0 81 kgcod m3 d in phases 1 2 and 3 respectively for each operational phase the two reactors organic loading rates were maintained relatively similar p 0 05 hrts and corresponding olrs applied in the current study were selected based on literature values and tested in our reactors to ensure stable operation for instance the reported hrt for ct blackwater anaerobic treatment systems varied from 0 5 to 3 5 days abdel shafy et al 2009 gallagher and sharvelle 2010 van voorthuizen et al 2008 while much longer hrts ranging from 8 3 to 30 days zeeman et al 2008 were reported for vt blackwater treatment 2 2 chemical analysis the influent and effluent characteristics of each phase were monitored to reveal chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency and

1 operation phases and performance the treatment performances were shown in table 1 the different toilet flushing systems provided different cod and tan concentrations for the two types of collected blackwater with the influent cod concentration at 900 1100 mg l and tan at 40 70 mg l for the conventional toilet ct blackwater and the influent cod concentration at 8500 11000 mg l and tan at 1000 1100 mg l supplemented with ammonia when the ammonia concentration of the collected vacuum toilet vt blackwater showed values lower than the 1 000 1 100 mg l to maintain constant feedstock properties for the vacuum toilet vt blackwater the variations in chemical properties in both conventional toilet and vacuum toilet collected blackwater are due to the natural fluctuation of the blackwater production the influent blackwater properties for the two types were similar as reported in literatures de graaff et al 2010 van voorthuizen et al 2008 the methanisation was significantly higher in the vt reactor p 0 05 but not significantly different between different phases in either reactor the accumulated methane content in the biogas was stable through all phases and was slightly higher in the vt reactor 72 in the ct reactor and 75 in the vt reactor the ct reactor methanisation 0 23 0 29 gch4 cod gfeedcod was comparable with reported results of 0 27 gch4 cod gfeedcod using the combined uasb and membrane reactor van voorthuizen et al 2008 the effluent qualities were relatively stable for both reactors in terms of effluent ph cod and tan the average cod removal efficiencies for the ct reactor was 72 6 for the three operational phases in this study which was higher than the reported 64 cod removal efficiency with similar operating temperature at 37 c but shorter hrt of 12 h van voorthuizen et al 2008 the average cod removal efficiencies for vt reactor was 89 2 for the three operational phases in this study which was higher than the reported 78 cod removal efficiency with a less favourable operating temperature at 25 c and shorter hrt of 8 7 days de graaff et al 2010 each type of detected volatile fatty acids vfas for both reactors were lower than 50 mg l indicating sufficient methanogenesis capacity inside the systems under the studied conditions the tan concentrations were increased in the effluent compared with the influent due to the release of ammonia from the substrate hydrolysis process accordingly the calculated free ammonia concentrations were higher in the vt reactor 98 9 123 5 mg l than in the ct reactor 1 7 2 5 mg l the free ammonia levels were lower than the typically reported inhibition levels of 200 mg l de graaff et al 2010 gao et al 2019 in the vt reactor the sludge vss concentration increased from the initial concentration of 13 1 0 6 g l to 24 9 5 1 28 9 3 4 and 23 5 0 4 g l in phases 1 3 respectively the ct reactor also showed increases of sludge vss concentrations to 15 6 1 4 17 5 4 7 and 15 4 1 7 g l in phases 1 3 respectively vss concentrations were resulted from different microbial growth dynamics and developed microbial communities in the two reactors the community development is a dynamic process which can be affected by various factors the organic loading rates olrs were kept similar between the two reactors but the ammonia loading rates and concentrations were higher in the vt reactor therefore the main factors for microbial community development were olr increases through phases 1 3 and ammonia concentration difference between the two reactors 3 2 microbial community diversity the rank abundance distributions of archaeal and bacterial communities at the genus level and the total number of genera are presented in fig 1 in both ct and vt reactors the archaeal communities fig 1a showed a steeper gradient than the inoculum representing a less even distribution the first ranked archaeal genus took up around 60 of total community abundance indicating mono enrichment in the community the total number of genera were similar between 9 and 11 in each sample the distribution curves of the first 15 bacterial genera fig 1b of the three phases in the ct reactor were lower than the inoculum on the contrary the vt reactor showed much steeper slopes in phases 1 and 2 due to the higher relative abundance of the first ranked genus in phase 3 the relative abundance of the first ranked genus dropped and the distribution curve became similar with the inoculum the number of genera was 119 in the inoculum 116 in ct phase 1 and increased to 146 and 172 in phases 2 and 3 a decrease was shown in the vt reactor to 81 71 and 79 in the three phases respectively the evenness of the communities was measured using the gini coefficient werner et al 2014 fig 1c in archaea the gini coefficient fluctuated along different phases in bacteria the community changed to higher evenness lower gini coefficient in the ct reactor than the inoculum while it remained similar in the vt reactor compared with the inoculum the archaeal shannon diversity fig 1d fluctuated in different phases in the bacterial community the shannon index showed higher values in the ct reactor compared with the inoculum the vt reactor showed similar levels with the inoculum the lower bacterial diversity in the vt reactor fewer genera evenness and shannon index as compared to that in the ct reactor indicated a higher stress level possibly attributed to the high organic and ammonia concentrations in vt collected blackwater table 1 nevertheless lower bacterial diversity co occurred with higher methane production in the vt reactor this observation could be explained by the high substrate concentrations selecting microorganisms with higher growth rates i e r strategists klappenbach et al 2000 nemergut et al 2016 wu et al 2017 resulting in higher substrate utilization and methane production a previous study showed that higher organic loading rate selected r strategists which resulted an increased methane production with no inhibition on the microbial communities wu et al 2017 the beta diversity of the archaeal and bacterial communities was presented on the principal coordinate analysis pcoa plot of bray curtis distances among samples fig 2 the archaeal communities in phase 1 of both reactors shifted towards the same direction fig 2a then the two reactors diverged to different directions forming two clusters apart from each other along the pcoa1 axis which explains 75 5 of total sample variance the bacterial communities of the inoculum feed blackwater ct and vt reactors formed clusters distinct with each other fig 2b the community was stable through phase 1 to phase 3 in either reactor the bacterial communities that developed in the two reactors were divergent yet more similar than to the original community in the feeding blackwater indicating that the operational conditions had greater impacts on the reactor communities than the communities in the feed water the archaeal community changed slowly from phases 1 to 3 whereas the bacterial community did not change from phase 1 comparing the temporal changes the archaeal community takes a longer time than the bacterial community to stabilize this could be explained by the fact that archaea have higher doubling time i e slower growth than bacteria and the community turnover rate is also slower zinder 1993 the concentrations of cod and tan are putative leading factors that selected different communities werner et al 2014 found that increases in ammonia concentration perturbed the bacterial community in anaerobic digesters leading to more unevenness in the microbial community higher gini coefficient similarly in our data the vt reactor received a high ammonia loading and showed greater unevenness than the ct reactor fig 1c noticeably the vt reactor had lower numbers of genera in both archaeal and bacterial communities than the ct reactor the high concentrations of ammonia and other substrates probably inhibited more microbial genera resulting in less diverse communities 3 3 enriched archaeal consortia at the genus level 11 archaeal taxa were detected among all samples fig 3 the inoculum was dominated by three methanogens each 10 methanolinea and two unidentified genera in the family f methanospirillaceae two other genera showed relative abundance 1 methanoculleus and methanospirillum methanosarcina and methanosaeta were at very low abundances 0 03 and 0 04 respectively in the inoculum the ct reactor inherited the most abundant genus methanolinea from the inoculum which dominated through phase 1 to phase 3 methanospirillum gradually increased from phase 1 to phase 3 becoming the second predominant genus methanoculleus and the two unidentified genera in f methanospirillaceae deceased gradually methanosarcina increased in phases 1 and 2 1 methanosaeta was not detected in phase 1 and appeared in phase 2 and 3 at low levels 1 in the vt reactor methanolinea was the most abundant genus in phase 1 and second most abundant in phases 2 and 3 a remarkable increase was shown for methanogenium which was not detected in inoculum or the ct reactor but became dominant in phases 2 and 3 in the vt reactor the two unidentified genera in methanospirillaceae methanospirillum and methanoculleus decreased at the end of phase 3 compared with the inoculum methanosaeta became non detectable while methanosarcina slightly increased compared with the inoculum the predominant archaeal genera in the inoculum and reactors were different in composition methanolinea the family methanospirillaceae methanoculleus methanospirillum and methanogenium but they all belong to the order methanomicrobiales which all perform hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis garcia et al 2006 methanomicrobiales is closely correlated to high tan conditions in other studies especially the genus methanoculleus westerholm et al 2012 moestedt et al 2016 tian et al 2018a in full scale reactors methanomicrobiales was less affected by the ammonia concentration compared to methanobacteriales methanosaetaceae and methanosarcinaceae de vrieze et al 2015 methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales were the most abundant archaeal orders in syntrophic acetate oxidization digesters werner et al 2014 in our study methanomicrobiales took up 99 97 and 99 of archaeal communities of the inoculum ct reactor and vt reactor respectively methanoculleus accounted for only 0 55 0 84 and 2 89 9 56 in ct and vt reactors respectively methanogenium was reported in a limited number of studies of anaerobic digesters it was reported as the most abundant archaea in household digesters at low temperatures 11 1 15 7 c in high plateau environments han et al 2018 it was grown at low abundance in mesophilic anaerobic digester treating swine manure zhu et al 2011 qin et al 2013 as well as swine manure storage tanks barret et al 2012 2013 pure culture of methanogenium sp showed slower growth rates with increasing concentration of ammonia at higher than 3 g nh4 n l hendriksen and ahring 1991 however previous studies aiming for high tan conditions rarely reported methanogenium in the archaeal community methanogenium was found in marine methanogens romesser et al 1979 which are tolerant to high salinity in a high salinity anaerobic digester treating secondary sludge methanomicrobiales dominated in the archaeal community and species closely related to methanogenium marinum were abundant shin et al 2010 whether the salinity tolerance and ammonia tolerance could be compared may need further information acetoclastic methanogenesis is more vulnerable to high ammonia concentration than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis karakashev et al 2006 thus acetoclastic methanogenesis may be inhibited in ammonia rich reactors such as reactors treating manure or slaughterhouse waste sun et al 2014 in our blackwater fed reactors the acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta were in low abundance in the ct reactor and decreased to undetectable levels in the vt reactor methanosarcina increased slightly in both reactors possibly due to its versatile functionalities and resistance to harsh conditions sun et al 2014 mosbaek et al 2016 although they were most commonly reported methanogens in sewage sludge fed anaerobic digesters de vrieze et al 2015 their abundance was lower than expected in our study noticeably the sum of methanosaeta and methanosarcina only accounted for 0 07 of inoculum archaeal community which may have some impact on the community in our reactors 3 4 enriched bacterial consortia in ct and vt reactors the most abundant families and fold changes compared to the inoculum are shown in fig 4 four groups of families were classified groups a d in fig 4 based on their fold changes in relative abundances in group a bacterial families increased in both reactors families in group b or c were enriched in the ct reactor only or vt reactor only respectively group d represents families that remained at similar or decreased abundances in both reactors enriched families in group a were low in the inoculum the family porphyromonadaceae increased to 15 9 in the ct reactor in phase 3 and 13 4 in the vt reactor in phase 3 fibrobacteraceae increased remarkably in the vt reactor to 13 8 in phase 3 bacteroidaceae grew to 1 8 and 7 0 and marinilabiaceae increased to 1 8 and 1 6 in phase 3 of ct and vt reactors respectively lachnospiraceae reached 2 8 in ct phase 3 one unidentified family in the order clostridiales increased to 2 0 in the vt reactor in phase 3 species in the families porphyromonadaceae lachnospiraceae and in the order clostridiales were also observed in communities under high ammonium conditions muller et al 2016 porphyromonadaceae abundance was significantly higher in high ammonia reactors than in low ammonia reactors muller et al 2016 and a predominated anaerobic digester treating chicken wastes ziganshina et al 2015 bacteroidaceae was found at elevated abundance correlated with total ammonia concentration in full scale reactors de vrieze et al 2015 clostridiales species were reported for their tolerance of high ammonia concentrations de vrieze et al 2015 mosbaek et al 2016 muller et al 2016 tian et al 2018a they were widely spread in the inoculum and reactors some of these bacteria were reported in anaerobic digesters treating animal wastes e g swine manure cattle manure and chicken waste marinilabiaceae was highly abundant in ammonia rich chicken waste anaerobic digesters ziganshina et al 2015 fibrobacteraceae was the second most abundant family in cattle rumen fluid bacteroidaceae was the second most abundant family in cattle manure ozbayram et al 2018b fibrobacteraceae bacteroidaceae porphyromonadaceae are important fiber digesting bacteria capable of enhancing anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass yan et al 2012 ozbayram et al 2018a 2018b their increased abundance in the blackwater fed reactors could be associated with the presence of lignocellulosic matter in blackwater group d showed families that reduced to non detectable levels such as microthrixaceae in both reactors comamonadaceae and syntrophorhabdaceae in the vt reactor the well known syntrophic families syntrophorhabdaceae and syntrophaceae decreased in both reactors the other families in group d decreased but still maintained their high abundances such as anaerolinaceae cloacamonaceae spirochaetaceae thermovirgaceae and rikenellaceae 3 5 enriched bacteria specific to the ct reactor in the ct reactor the enrichments group b fig 4 included sulfate reducing bacterial families desulfobulbaceae desulfomicrobiaceae and desulfobacteraceae with total abundances of 7 3 5 2 and 5 5 in phases 1 3 respectively this observation is correlated with the relatively higher sulfate concentration in the ct collected blackwater since the blackwater sulfate source was supplemented from tap water at a concentration of 61 9 0 1 mg l ct collected blackwater contains a higher sulfate concentration per cod 90 5 17 8 mg per gcod as compared to vt collected blackwater 28 3 3 8 mg per gcod the cod so4 2 ratios were 10 9 11 7 and 33 6 35 2 in the ct and vt feed respectively which were higher than the reported inhibition threshold of 1 6 siles et al 2010 and did not cause complete inhibition of methanogenesis negative effects of sulfate on methanogenesis have been reported previously and mainly include i organic substrate competition between sulphate reducing bacteria and methanogens and ii toxicity of sulphate reduction produced h2s towards methanogens j w h et al 1994 chen et al 2008 siles et al 2010 dai et al 2017 hereby sulphate concentrations in ct collected blackwater should be monitored when designing anaerobic digestion systems for ct collected blackwater treatment campylobacteraceae rhodocyclaceae pseudanabaenaceae an unidentifed family in the class opb56 geobacteraceae opitutaceae elusimicrobiaceae and an unidentifed family in the class bacteroidales were higher than 1 in the last phase inferring their possible active roles in treating the ct collected blackwater 3 6 enriched bacteria specific to the vt reactor in the vt reactor fibrobacteraceae 13 8 an unidentified family in the order clostridiales 13 6 fig 4 group c together with porphyromonadaceae 13 4 were the most abundant families specifically less numbers of taxa group c fig 4 were enriched compared with the ct reactor group b in accordance with the lower community diversity fig 1 ruminococcaceae tissierellaceae and clostridiaceae showed higher than a 2 fold change compared with the inoculum xanthomonadaceae and actinomycetales were largely increased in phase 1 then decreased in phases 2 and 3 ruminococcaceae tissierellaceae and clostridiales have been reported in high ammonia stressed anaerobic communities muller et al 2016 species in the family tissierellaceae were related to salt tolerance such as tissierella and soehngeni wang et al 2017 sedimentibacter in the family tissierellaceae was enriched in low ammonia sao communities muller et al 2016 sao bacterial species include five known species thermacetogenium phaeum pseudothermotoga lettingae tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans clostridium ultunense and syntrophaceticus schinkii the latter two characterized as mesophilic saob westerholm et al 2016 however these species were not identified in our study the enriched consortia in the vt reactor under high organic loading and ammonia stresses resemble previously reported sao communities werner et al 2014 muller et al 2016 tian et al 2018a suggesting that a broader number of species may be associated with sao function under the high ammonia stress westerholm et al 2016 3 7 functional shift at the end of reactor operation a carbon isotope test was performed for the methane and carbon dioxide gases our results showed that the biogas δ 13 c o 2 fraction was 46 71 and the δ 13 c h 4 fraction was 10 60 in the ct reactor and 49 65 δ 13 c o 2 and 4 59 δ 13 c h 4 fraction in the vt reactor the apparent fractionation factor α c was 1 038 and 1 047 for the ct and vt reactors respectively a higher α c indicates that a methanogenesis pathway shifts from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis lü et al 2013 hao et al 2017 our results showed that the α c value was higher in the vt reactor than that in the ct reactor indicating that the archaeal communities were dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens the ammonia concentration was higher in the vt reactor which may be related with the higher α c the microbial community 16s rrna gene data were analyzed to predict functional genes kanehisa et al 2012 markowitz et al 2012 related with sao hm the major methanogenesis pathways hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis consisted of different functional genes supplementary information the total abundances are shown in fig 5 a hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis genes slightly decreased in the ct reactor and increased in the vt reactor whereas acetoclastic methanogenesis genes stayed at similar levels in all samples the gene abundances were predicted from the 16s rrna genes thus it reflects the taxonomic abundances in fig 3 in the bacterial community the prevalence of sao indicator fhs gene muller et al 2016 is shown in fig 5b compared to the inoculum both 9l bw and 1l bw fed reactors had increased levels of the fhs gene it increased gradually in the ct reactor in the vt reactor the fhs gene abundance showed a dramatic increase from phase 1 to phase 2 then marginally decreased in phase 3 the total relative abundances of otus contributing to fhs gene prevalence showed similar trends accounting for 24 of total bacterial otu abundance in the inoculum 34 40 in the ct reactor and 30 38 in the vt reactor detailed otu relative contribution to the fhs gene prevalence is shown in supplementary fig s2 and fig s3 at a family level the main contributing families in the inoculum were syntrophic bacteria syntrophorhabdaceae and syntrophaceae which decreased in both reactors in the ct reactor the highest contribution was from sulfate reducing bacterial families desulfobulbaceae and desulfomicrobiaceae porphyromonadaceae and ruminococcaceae showed increased contribution in phase 3 in the vt reactor the highest contribution was from an unidentified family in the order clostridiales which increased through phases 1 to 3 it is noticed that the ct and vt reactors did not show significant differences in their predicted functional profiles their reactor performances and enriched community compositions are different but it could hardly be explained through the predicted prevalence of the fhs gene the higher abundances of sulfate reducing bacteria fig 4 in the ct reactor may contribute to lower methane production yield liu et al 2015 due to the competition of sulfate reducing bacteria for carbon source and or the toxicity of hydrogen sulphide produced from sulfate reduction reaction to methanogens j w h et al 1994 siles et al 2010 dai et al 2017 ammonia concentration together with other possible stress factors in the vt reactor could contribute to the low microbial community diversity which did not significantly impact the sao hm communities 4 conclusions water saving vacuum toilets vt collected blackwater contains significantly higher concentrations of organics and ammonia compared to the conventional toilets ct collected blackwater which has led to different biogas production rates and microbial communities in anaerobic digestion reactors treating blackwater the vt reactor showed a higher methane production rate without any noticeable inhibition to the microbial community the temporal dynamics of archaeal and bacterial communities indicated that the archaeal community had slowly adapted during different phases resulting in a mono dominance of a single genus whereas the bacterial community was quickly adapted and remained stable through different phases lower alpha diversity and higher methane production rates indicated selection of r strategists in the vt reactor consortia due to the high substrate and ammonia concentrations in vt collected blackwater the enriched microorganisms were compared between the ct and vt reactors methanolinea was the most abundant archaeal genus in the ct reactor and methanogenium in the vt reactor methanogenium was reported to tolerate high ammonia concentrations but is infrequently reported as dominant in anaerobic digesters both reactors were dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens the enriched bacteria were linked with high ammonia conditions including porphyromonadaceae fibrobacteraceae ruminococcaceae bacteroidaceae clostridiales etc the apparent fractionation factor α c calculated from δ 13 c o 2 and δ 13 c h 4 fractions and predicted metagenomic functions indicated functional shifts to the syntrophic acetate oxidization and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway in the vt reactor this study provided detailed information on microbial community dynamics and implied functions for concentrated and dilute
