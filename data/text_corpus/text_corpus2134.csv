10670,potential health risks associated with water used to irrigate fresh produce are increasingly recognized worldwide leading to the implementation of water quality standards as part of many food safety programs these standards are generally based on the presence of the fecal indicator bacterium fib generic escherichia coli however the persistence and potential growth of this species in the environment suggests current standards may not accurately predict health risks associated with irrigation water in this context we evaluated enterococci as an alternate fib for assessing agricultural water quality under baseflow conditions which typically coincide with peak demands for supplemental irrigation in the study area we compared culture based concentrations of enterococcus to e coli over two growing seasons at four different irrigation canals in alberta canada that historically exceed the e coli irrigation guideline on a frequent basis we also examined enterococci species distributions among irrigation water animal feces and human sewage escherichia coli and enterococci were significantly correlated at three of the four canals although on average more guideline exceedances and higher mean concentrations of enterococci were reported specific differences in fib dynamics were observed between canals most notably enterococci concentrations were significantly higher than e coli at one canal while e coli concentrations were significantly higher than enterococci at a different canal enterococci species distributions were markedly different between irrigation water and animal feces enterococci species reportedly associated with plants predominated in irrigation water whereas these species were absent or present in very low proportions in human sewage and animal feces results of this study suggest the limitations of using enterococci for measuring microbial quality of irrigation water are similar to e coli in that risk analyses with respect to food safety may be confounded by the presence of environment associated species and or strains keywords agricultural water irrigation water quality generic escherichia coli enterococcus membrane filtration

coli is the fib of choice for most countries that have irrigation water quality guidelines or regulations for food safety purposes uyttendaele et al 2015 despite recognition that it is capable of prolonged survival and growth in the environment potentially confounding water quality assessments jang et al 2017 in contrast growth of fecal enterococcus species in freshwater is considered less

freshwater boehm and sassoubre 2014 hc 2012 wade et al 2006 2003 and some countries have stipulated enterococci targets for wastewater reuse in irrigation paranychianakis et al 2015 rock et al 2019 however to the best of our knowledge no national or international water quality guidelines specific to the use of surface water for irrigation have been specified for this fib published research on the use of enterococci for evaluating fecal contamination of surface water used to irrigate crops in semi arid regions that rely heavily upon infrastructure in the form of pipelines and canals to distribute water is limited therefore the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the applicability of enterococci as an indicator of fecal contamination of surface water in irrigation canals under baseflow conditions i e at times of low or negligible precipitation which typically coincide with peak demands for supplemental irrigation in the study area our first objective was to compare culture based concentrations of enterococci to e coli throughout two growing seasons and relate them back to national water quality guidelines to determine if exceedances of the recommended guidelines would differ between the two fib second our evaluation included examination of enterococci species distributions in irrigation water and fecal sources as this may provide some albeit limited information about host source for example enterococcus faecalis and e faecium are the most predominant species among human hosts staley et al 2014 while cattle feces are characterized by a high predominance of e hirae beukers et al 2015 in a recent study a significant proportion of environment specific e coli fingerprints were repeatedly detected in irrigation reservoirs and canals under baseflow conditions in southern alberta but not representative animal hosts thus they were attributed to bacterial survival and in situ proliferation jokinen et al 2019 based on this recent research and the fastidious growth requirements of enterococci relative to e coli we hypothesized enterococci would be more suitable indicators of animal feces in irrigation water while providing additional qualitative information about water quality through species determination 2 methods 2 1 study area and water sample collection irrigation canal sampling sites were selected for this study based on six

2 2 fecal sample collection for comparisons of enterococci species distributions fecal samples were collected within a 150 km radius of the city of lethbridge concurrently with water samples in year 1 beef cattle and waterfowl geese and ducks were of primary interest as these hosts were likely the predominant fecal contamination sources based on land use in the study area swine feces and human sewage were sampled for comparison purposes and the latter because of its importance from a human health perspective beef cattle feces were obtained from feedlots and pastures at five farms n 12

most canadian provinces uyttendaele et al 2015 in the absence of an irrigation water guideline for enterococci concentrations of this fib were compared to the fresh water recreation guideline recommended by health canada 70 enterococci 100 ml 1 which is slightly more permissive than what is recommended by the usepa 62 enterococci 100 ml 1 for fresh recreation water hc 2012 we compared fib concentrations to single sample maximum values rather than geometric means because the minimum weekly sampling criterion associated with geometric means was not logistically possible hc 2012 significance was established at p 0 05 for all statistical tests escherichia coli and enterococci density data were log transformed prior to statistical analyses scatterplots were constructed to visualize differences in fib concentrations when guidelines were exceeded fisher s exact test was used to identify differences in the number of guideline exceedances between fib and between canals while the paired t test data distributed normally or wilcoxon signed rank test data not distributed normally was used to quantify concentration differences between the two fib at each canal pearson correlation r was conducted to quantify relationships between the two fib at each canal permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova of bray curtis distances with 9999 permutations was performed in past hammer et al 2001 to determine differences in enterococci species distributions between irrigation water canals between host fecal sources and also between irrigation water canals and host fecal sources similarity percentage simper analysis was conducted in past to identify which species accounted for the variation between enterococci communities observed in irrigation water and within host fecal sources 3 results 3 1 precipitation at each site seasonal precipitation was lower in year 1 and year 2 of the study than the previous six year average fig s2a thirty six hour antecedent precipitation was less than the 15 mm cut off throughout both growing seasons year 1 and year 2 in fact 36 h antecedent precipitation was typically very low to negligible less than 5 mm at all weather stations monitored except on one occasion in year 1 at brid 6 1 mm and wid 12 85 mm and one occasion in year 2 at brid 6 0 mm eid 7 9 mm and wid 8 5 mm 3 2 escherichia coli and enterococci guideline exceedances in irrigation water the e coli guideline for irrigation water 100 cfu 100 ml 1 or 2 00 log10 cfu and enterococci guideline for recreation water 70 cfu 100 ml 1 or 1 85 log10 cfu were exceeded repeatedly at all canals throughout the study fig 1 at least one fib guideline was exceeded in 84 of samples i e only 16 of samples met both guidelines and both guidelines were exceeded in 53 of samples data not shown combined two year enterococci guideline exceedances were more pronounced at lnid than brid p 0 05 and wid p 0 005 but not at eid no differences in the two year combined e coli exceedances were observed between canals no intra or inter site differences in frequency of exceedances between the two study years or fib were observed 3 3 concordance of escherichia coli and enterococci concentrations in irrigation canals throughout the entire study period fib concentrations tended to increase and decrease in tandem fig 2 despite this different patterns in absolute concentrations between the two fib were observed specifically enterococci concentrations were consistently lower than e coli at brid paired t test p 0 05 13 16 samples and consistently higher than e coli at lnid p 0 01 14 16 samples whereas differences in fib concentration patterns were inconsistent at eid and wid fig 2 an overall positive correlation was observed between e coli and enterococci concentrations r 0 609 p 0 001 data not shown site specific correlations were strongest between fib concentrations at brid r 0 752 p 0 001 and wid r 0 750 p 0 01 and moderate at lnid r 0 664 p 0 01 no significant relationship between the two fib was observed at eid r 0 443 p 0 05 fig 3 although relative concentrations were generally concordant between e coli and enterococci temporally as revealed by fig 2 and correlation analyses there were several instances involving each canal 19 in total when only one fib exceeded the respective guideline per 100 milliliters of water fig 3 in the majority of these instances 68 13 19 the enterococci recreation guideline was exceeded while the e coli irrigation guideline was met most notably at lnid enterococci concentrations exceeded the recreation guideline in all 16 samples whereas the e coli guideline for irrigation was exceeded in only 11 of these p 0 05 3 4 enterococci species distributions in irrigation water and host fecal sources enterococci isolated from different irrigation water canals and fecal sources were identified to species level and distributions compared overall enterococci species distributions differed between canals permanova f 2 61 p 0 005 and between host fecal sources f 1 76 p 0 05 fig 4 a and 4b respectively table s2 on average the enterococcus species e mundtii e casseliflavus and e faecalis accounted for 71 of the intra sample variation among irrigation canals whereas e hirae e faecalis and e faecium accounted for 74 of this variation in species distributions among fecal sources as determined by simper analysis table s2 enterococci species distributions between irrigation water and fecal sources i e inter sample variation were remarkably different permanova f 6 45 p 0 001 table s3 most notably e casseliflavus and e mundtii were more common among irrigation water than fecal samples fig 4a and 4b table s3 human sewage was the only fecal source that contained e casseliflavus similar in proportion to some irrigation canals in contrast proportions of e faecium and e mundtii were vastly different between human sewage and irrigation water on average e faecium was 14 times higher in human sewage than irrigation water while e mundtii was not detected in human sewage despite being the most predominant enterococcus species in irrigation canals p 0 01 also noteworthy distributions of e faecalis and e faecium in cattle feces and e hirae in swine feces were largely different from irrigation water p 0 05 table s3 4 discussion prolonged survival and potential growth of e coli in the environment is a significant concern with respect to the reliability of this bacterium as a fecal indicator and therefore water quality jang et al 2017 this is supported by a previous study conducted on irrigation water originating in a region adjacent to the current study area where exceedances of the irrigation guideline for e coli under drought conditions were likely due to growth of bacteria present in sediment rather than recent fecal contamination jokinen et al 2019 to address this issue the aim of the current study was to explore the utility of enterococci as an alternate indicator of fecal contamination in irrigation water we hypothesized enterococci would be a better indicator of recent fecal contamination in irrigation water and would provide more qualitative information about water quality through species identification this was based on enterococci being more fastidious with respect to nutrient requirements byappanahalli et al 2003 and having lower environmental growth potential and persistence in freshwater than e coli byappanahalli et al 2012b korajkic et al 2019 stocker et al 2015 moreover enterococci are easily identifiable and provide some information about source since species distributions tend to have a certain degree of host specificity beukers et al 2015 staley et al 2014 accordingly we assessed correlation between e coli and enterococci from irrigation canal water sampled at four different districts i e brid eid lnid and wid and examined enterococci species distributions among irrigation water and animal hosts irrigation water quality was assessed quantitatively under baseflow conditions in the context of food safety using e coli and enterococci guidelines for irrigation 100 cfu 100 ml 1 uyttendaele et al 2015 and recreation 70 cfu 100 ml 1 hc 2012 respectively for lack of an irrigation guideline for enterococci we related concentrations of this fib to the guideline recommended by health canada for primary contact recreation in marine water which may be used with fresh water if enterococci can adequately demonstrate the presence of fecal contamination hc 2012 studies exploring the use of fib other than e coli for evaluation of irrigation water quality in this way are limited although there were more exceedances of the enterococci guideline for recreation than e coli for irrigation the majority of irrigation water samples exceeded at least one of the fib guidelines typically with greater enterococci concentrations relative to e coli as previously reported holvoet et al 2014 partyka et al 2018 moreover the overall positive correlation between e coli and enterococci concentrations in the current study is consistent with previous studies involving surface waters holvoet et al 2014 jin et al 2004 topalcengiz et al 2017 xue et al 2018 and in tandem fluctuations of the two fib suggest similar processes are influencing fate and transport dynamics of the bacteria following this logic a simultaneous increase in two different fib as observed in this study might imply a fecal contamination event however the stark difference in enterococci species distributions observed between irrigation water and fecal sources does not support this specifically e mundtii and e casseliflavus were rarely detected in feces even though 68 of all irrigation water isolates belonged to these species rather these two enterococcus species are predominantly associated with sediments aquatic plants and other vegetation badgley et al 2010 byappanahalli et al 2012a ferguson et al 2016 muller et al 2001 staley et al 2014 suggesting more than half of the enterococci detected at each site of the current study are persisting and potentially growing in the irrigation water environment either in association with plants or sediment in contrast to enterococci species distributions in irrigation water distributions within animal hosts were similar to other studies fig 4 all species identified from goose and duck feces in the current study have also been identified in wild bird feces in poland stepien pysniak et al 2017 enterococcus hirae was the predominant species in cattle as demonstrated previously staley et al 2014 tymensen et al 2017 enterococcus hirae and e faecalis were the most common species detected in pig feces in the current study consistent with a study in poland skowron et al 2016 and e faecium and e faecalis are typically abundant in human waste staley et al 2014 taken together the positive correlation between e coli and enterococci concentrations and significant proportion of enterococci obtained from irrigation water that were unlikely from recent fecal deposits suggests the potential for water quality assessments to be confounded by environment associated bacteria exists regardless of the fib used based on historical e coli densities at the irrigation canals selected for this study it was not surprising the majority of irrigation water samples exceeded at least one of the fib guidelines despite the overall positive correlation between the indicators enterococci were typically more numerous compared to e coli which also has implications for irrigation water quality monitoring in the context of food safety standards using the guidelines applied in the current study as an example shifting from e coli to enterococci for irrigation water quality assessments would increase the overall proportion of exceedances from 63 to 74 at specific canals such as lnid the impact would be greater with exceedances increasing from 69 to 100 even if we apply the more permissive e coli irrigation guideline to enterococci i e 100 cfu 100 ml 1 exceedances remain 100 at lnid such a shift could potentially increase the burden for crop producers to meet water quality guidelines which may not be predictive of food safety risk in terms of irrigation water use in primary production of fresh fruits and vegetables it is well established that correlations between various fib and pathogens are variable and fib are generally not good predictors of enteric pathogens in surface waters pachepsky et al 2016 partyka et al 2018 wu et al 2011 consequently microbial guidelines for e coli and enterococci for recreational water were developed based on epidemiological evidence involving the relationship between concentrations of these bacteria to the incidence of swimming associated enteric illness hc 2012 in contrast there is a general paucity of data on the correspondence of fib concentrations to pathogen presence on crops and foodborne illness associated with consumption of these crops rock et al 2019 given this and the high incidence of guideline exceedances in the current study regardless of which fib is used it would be prudent to base irrigation guidelines on similar epidemiological evidence as evaluated to draft recreation guidelines ultimately relating fib concentrations to the presence of pathogens on irrigated crops through to the incidence and or likelihood of human disease development in association with the consumption of raw produce is recommended 5 conclusions the current study highlights the prevalence of environment associated fib in irrigation water as well as differences in fib dynamics among canals in the same general geographic region throughout two growing seasons both e coli and enterococci were correlated albeit more enterococci exceedances were observed since concentrations of this indicator were based on the recreation guideline which is more stringent with respect to setting a lower acceptable concentration of indicator organisms than the irrigation guideline for e coli spikes in concentration of both fib were observed simultaneously suggesting the bacteria originated from recent fecal contamination however this was not supported by enterococci species distributions which were predominantly environment associated based on this it would appear enterococci concentration is not suitable for assessing irrigation water quality in southern alberta under baseflow conditions results of the current study and previous reports that e coli is subject to environmental growth suggest risk analyses considering concentrations of either fib to assess the quality of irrigation water used for fresh produce may be confounded by the presence of environment associated and or adapted species this could potentially lead to a greater number of unwarranted fib guideline exceedances and therefore restricted global market access where certain standards must be met in order to export crops declaration of competing

most canadian provinces uyttendaele et al 2015 in the absence of an irrigation water guideline for enterococci concentrations of this fib were compared to the fresh water recreation guideline recommended by health canada 70 enterococci 100 ml 1 which is slightly more permissive than what is recommended by the usepa 62 enterococci 100 ml 1 for fresh recreation water hc 2012 we compared fib concentrations to single sample maximum values rather than geometric means because the minimum weekly sampling criterion associated with geometric means was not logistically possible hc 2012 significance was established at p 0 05 for all statistical tests escherichia coli and enterococci density data were log transformed prior to statistical analyses scatterplots were constructed to visualize differences in fib concentrations when guidelines were exceeded fisher s exact test was used to identify differences in the number of guideline exceedances between fib and between canals while the paired t test data distributed normally or wilcoxon signed rank test data not distributed normally was used to quantify concentration differences between the two fib at each canal pearson correlation r was conducted to quantify relationships between the two fib at each canal permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova of bray curtis distances with 9999 permutations was performed in past hammer et al 2001 to determine differences in enterococci species distributions between irrigation water canals between host fecal sources and also between irrigation water canals and host fecal sources similarity percentage simper analysis was conducted in past to identify which species accounted for the variation between enterococci communities observed in irrigation water and within host fecal sources 3 results 3 1 precipitation at each site seasonal precipitation was lower in year 1 and year 2 of the study than the previous six year average fig s2a thirty six hour antecedent precipitation was less than the 15 mm cut off throughout both growing seasons year 1 and year 2 in fact 36 h antecedent precipitation was typically very low to negligible less than 5 mm at all weather stations monitored except on one occasion in year 1 at brid 6 1 mm and wid 12 85 mm and one occasion in year 2 at brid 6 0 mm eid 7 9 mm and wid 8 5 mm 3 2 escherichia coli and enterococci guideline exceedances in irrigation water the e coli guideline for irrigation water 100 cfu 100 ml 1 or 2 00 log10 cfu and enterococci guideline for recreation water 70 cfu 100 ml 1 or 1 85 log10 cfu were exceeded repeatedly at all canals throughout the study fig 1 at least one fib guideline was exceeded in 84 of samples i e only 16 of samples met both guidelines and both guidelines were exceeded in 53 of samples data not shown combined two year enterococci guideline exceedances were more pronounced at lnid than brid p 0 05 and wid p 0 005 but not at eid no differences in the two year combined e coli exceedances were observed between canals no intra or inter site differences in frequency of exceedances between the two study years or fib were observed 3 3 concordance of escherichia coli and enterococci concentrations in irrigation canals throughout the entire study period fib concentrations tended to increase and decrease in tandem fig 2 despite this different patterns in absolute concentrations between the two fib were observed specifically enterococci concentrations were consistently lower than e coli at brid paired t test p 0 05 13 16 samples and consistently higher than e coli at lnid p 0 01 14 16 samples whereas differences in fib concentration patterns were inconsistent at eid and wid fig 2 an overall positive correlation was observed between e coli and enterococci concentrations r 0 609 p 0 001 data not shown site specific correlations were strongest between fib concentrations at brid r 0 752 p 0 001 and wid r 0 750 p 0 01 and moderate at lnid r 0 664 p 0 01 no significant relationship between the two fib was observed at eid r 0 443 p 0 05 fig 3 although relative concentrations were generally concordant between e coli and enterococci temporally as revealed by fig 2 and correlation analyses there were several instances involving each canal 19 in total when only one fib exceeded the respective guideline per 100 milliliters of water fig 3 in the majority of these instances 68 13 19 the enterococci recreation guideline was exceeded while the e coli irrigation guideline was met most notably at lnid enterococci concentrations exceeded the recreation guideline in all 16 samples whereas the e coli guideline for irrigation was exceeded in only 11 of these p 0 05 3 4 enterococci species distributions in irrigation water and host fecal sources enterococci isolated from different irrigation water canals and fecal sources were identified to species level and distributions compared overall enterococci species distributions differed between canals permanova f 2 61 p 0 005 and between host fecal sources f 1 76 p 0 05 fig 4 a and 4b respectively table s2 on average the enterococcus species e mundtii e casseliflavus and e faecalis accounted for 71 of the intra sample variation among irrigation canals whereas e hirae e faecalis and e faecium accounted for 74 of this variation in species distributions among fecal sources as determined by simper analysis table s2 enterococci species distributions between irrigation water and fecal sources i e inter sample variation were remarkably different permanova f 6 45 p 0 001 table s3 most notably e casseliflavus and e mundtii were more common among irrigation water than fecal samples fig 4a and 4b table s3 human sewage was the only fecal source that contained e casseliflavus similar in proportion to some irrigation canals in contrast proportions of e faecium and e mundtii were vastly different between human sewage and irrigation water on average e faecium was 14 times higher in human sewage than irrigation water while e mundtii was not detected in human sewage despite being the most predominant enterococcus species in irrigation canals p 0 01 also noteworthy distributions of e faecalis and e faecium in cattle feces and e hirae in swine feces were largely different from irrigation water p 0 05 table s3 4 discussion prolonged survival and potential growth of e coli in the environment is a significant concern with respect to the reliability of this bacterium as a fecal indicator and therefore water quality jang et al 2017 this is supported by a previous study conducted on irrigation water originating in a region adjacent to the current study area where exceedances of the irrigation guideline for e coli under drought conditions were likely due to growth of bacteria present in sediment rather than recent fecal contamination jokinen et al 2019 to address this issue the aim of the current study was to explore the utility of enterococci as an alternate indicator of fecal contamination in irrigation water we hypothesized enterococci would be a better indicator of recent fecal contamination in irrigation water and would provide more qualitative information about water quality through species identification this was based on enterococci being more fastidious with respect to nutrient requirements byappanahalli et al 2003 and having lower environmental growth potential and persistence in freshwater than e coli byappanahalli et al 2012b korajkic et al 2019 stocker et al 2015 moreover enterococci are easily identifiable and provide some information about source since species distributions tend to have a certain degree of host specificity beukers et al 2015 staley et al 2014 accordingly we assessed correlation between e coli and enterococci from irrigation canal water sampled at four different districts i e brid eid lnid and wid and examined enterococci species distributions among irrigation water and animal hosts irrigation water quality was assessed quantitatively under baseflow conditions in the context of food safety using e coli and enterococci guidelines for irrigation 100 cfu 100 ml 1 uyttendaele et al 2015 and recreation 70 cfu 100 ml 1 hc 2012 respectively for lack of an irrigation guideline for enterococci we related concentrations of this fib to the guideline recommended by health canada for primary contact recreation in marine water which may be used with fresh water if enterococci can adequately demonstrate the presence of fecal contamination hc 2012 studies exploring the use of fib other than e coli for evaluation of irrigation water quality in this way are limited although there were more exceedances of the enterococci guideline for recreation than e coli for irrigation the majority of irrigation water samples exceeded at least one of the fib guidelines typically with greater enterococci concentrations relative to e coli as previously reported holvoet et al 2014 partyka et al 2018 moreover the overall positive correlation between e coli and enterococci concentrations in the current study is consistent with previous studies involving surface waters holvoet et al 2014 jin et al 2004 topalcengiz et al 2017 xue et al 2018 and in tandem fluctuations of the two fib suggest similar processes are influencing fate and transport dynamics of the bacteria following this logic a simultaneous increase in two different fib as observed in this study might imply a fecal contamination event however the stark difference in enterococci species distributions observed between irrigation water and fecal sources does not support this specifically e mundtii and e casseliflavus were rarely detected in feces even though 68 of all irrigation water isolates belonged to these species rather these two enterococcus species are predominantly associated with sediments aquatic plants and other vegetation badgley et al 2010 byappanahalli et al 2012a ferguson et al 2016 muller et al 2001 staley et al 2014 suggesting more than half of the enterococci detected at each site of the current study are persisting and potentially growing in the irrigation water environment either in association with plants or sediment in contrast to enterococci species distributions in irrigation water distributions within animal hosts were similar to other studies fig 4 all species identified from goose and duck feces in the current study have also been identified in wild bird feces in poland stepien pysniak et al 2017 enterococcus hirae was the predominant species in cattle as demonstrated previously staley et al 2014 tymensen et al 2017 enterococcus hirae and e faecalis were the most common species detected in pig feces in the current study consistent with a study in poland skowron et al 2016 and e faecium and e faecalis are typically abundant in human waste staley et al 2014 taken together the positive correlation between e coli and enterococci concentrations and significant proportion of enterococci obtained from irrigation water that were unlikely from recent fecal deposits suggests the potential for water quality assessments to be confounded by environment associated bacteria exists regardless of the fib used based on historical e coli densities at the irrigation canals selected for this study it was not surprising the majority of irrigation water samples exceeded at least one of the fib guidelines despite the overall positive correlation between the indicators enterococci were typically more numerous compared to e coli which also has implications for irrigation water quality monitoring in the context of food safety standards using the guidelines applied in the current study as an example shifting from e coli to enterococci for irrigation water quality assessments would increase the overall proportion of exceedances from 63 to 74 at specific canals such as lnid the impact would be greater with exceedances increasing from 69 to 100 even if we apply the more permissive e coli irrigation guideline to enterococci i e 100 cfu 100 ml 1 exceedances remain 100 at lnid such a shift could potentially increase the burden for crop producers to meet water quality guidelines which may not be predictive of food safety risk in terms of irrigation water use in primary production of fresh fruits and vegetables it is well established that correlations between various fib and pathogens are variable and fib are generally not good predictors of enteric pathogens in surface waters pachepsky et al 2016 partyka et al 2018 wu et al 2011 consequently microbial guidelines for e coli and enterococci for recreational water were developed based on epidemiological evidence involving the relationship between concentrations of these bacteria to the incidence of swimming associated enteric illness hc 2012 in contrast there is a general paucity of data on the correspondence of fib concentrations to pathogen presence on crops and foodborne illness associated with consumption of these crops rock et al 2019 given this and the high incidence of guideline exceedances in the current study regardless of which fib is used it would be prudent to base irrigation guidelines on similar epidemiological evidence as evaluated to draft recreation guidelines ultimately relating fib concentrations to the presence of pathogens on irrigated crops through to the incidence and or likelihood of human disease development in association with the consumption of raw produce is recommended 5 conclusions the current study highlights the prevalence of environment associated fib in irrigation water as well as differences in fib dynamics among canals in the same general geographic region throughout two growing seasons both e coli and enterococci were correlated albeit more enterococci exceedances were observed since concentrations of this indicator were based on the recreation guideline which is more stringent with respect to setting a lower acceptable concentration of indicator organisms than the irrigation guideline for e coli spikes in concentration of both fib were observed simultaneously suggesting the bacteria originated from recent fecal contamination however this was not supported by enterococci species distributions which were predominantly environment associated based on this it would appear enterococci concentration is not suitable for assessing irrigation water quality in southern alberta under baseflow conditions results of the current study and previous reports that e coli is subject to environmental growth suggest risk analyses considering concentrations of either fib to assess the quality of irrigation water used for fresh produce may be confounded by the presence of environment associated and or adapted species this could potentially lead to a greater number of unwarranted fib guideline exceedances and therefore restricted global market access where certain standards must be met in order to export crops declaration of competing

10671,in the southern usa low soil water holding capacity and erratic rainfall patterns create scenarios where plant water stress may occur reducing early peach tree growth therefore irrigation management is a key component to ensure adequate water supply during early tree growth stages the objective of this study was to determine water requirements and crop coefficient kc of young peach trees grown in a subtropical climate a study was conducted in central florida using young peach trees tropicbeauty grafted onto flordaguard daily actual evapotranspiration eta was determined using weighing lysimeters the highest daily peach water demand was recorded during the shoot development stage 23 7 l between august and october whereas the lowest daily eta was 0 71 l during dormancy in december and january year round kc values for young peach trees were obtained and ranged from 0 20 to 0 68 there was a significant correlation between plant water consumption with trunk cross sectional area tcsa and projected canopy area pca which can be used to estimate eta peach irrigation water demand for 1 3 years old trees expressed as daily eta can be estimated using daily reference evapotranspiration and pca the accurate determination of crop water demand allows the seasonal adjustment of irrigation scheduling avoiding water stress or over irrigation of young peach trees keywords crop coefficient projected canopy area weighing lysimeters 1 introduction peach prunus persica l batsch harvested area has increased by approximately 7 from 2010 to 2016 worldwide reaching over 1 6 million ha fao stat 2019 this increase is attributed to a need for crop diversification fruit demand and availability of low chill cultivars morgan and olmstead 2013 in florida low chill peach harvest usually occurs between late march and early may allowing peach growers to harvest fruits earlier than in northern latitudes which require a greater number of chilling hours peaches harvested from these low chill areas can be marketed and receive higher prices compared to those harvested later in the year in the last 15 years florida peach acreage has significantly increased with more than 500 ha in production andresen and athearn 2016 and will continue to expand about 54 of florida peach growers surveyed in 2018 indicated they had plans to expand their production area as the demand for florida peaches strengthens zambrano vaca and zotarelli 2018 peach trees during the first three years after planting have limited fruit production in subtropical climates and most of the carbohydrates and water resources are used for vegetative growth strong vegetative growth is crucial for the development of tree architecture that will support future fruit production plant water demand depends on the phenological stage plant spacing size and shape of the tree allen et al 1998 for example dormancy is very short and may last about 50 days in subtropical climates while in temperate climates peach dormancy can last more than 90 days sawamura et al 2017 plant water demand also depends on climate conditions according to the köppen classification florida has a humid subtropical climate cfa in which the mean air temperature in the warmest month is above 22 c and daily maximum air temperatures are above 30 c winters are mild with the coldest month averaging air temperatures below 18 c but higher than 3 c occasional frosts can occur but not for prolonged durations as in other production areas of the united states humid subtropical climates are characterized by hot summers with higher rainfall compared to winters with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunder and tropical storms in central florida the 20 yr average annual precipitation ranged from 812 to 1790 mm fawn 2019 however most of the precipitation occur during summer months peach leaf and fruit development occurs between february and may which are months characterized by low precipitation during this period eto surpasses precipitation in 10 65 mm requiring supplemental irrigation the eto is the sum of evaporation and transpiration of a reference surface which is conventionally is a hypothetical grass assumed height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the hypothetical grass closely resembles an extensive surface of green well watered grass of uniform height actively growing and completely shading the ground the eto is then related to a given crop by using the kc value which represents the difference in growth characteristics over time and changes in phenological stages between the reference grass and a particular field crop of interest allen et al 1998 daily actual evapotranspiration eta can be directly measured by using weighing lysimeters which are considered the most reliable and accurate tool for plant water use determination howell et al 1991 the eta of a given crop is commonly measured by recording the volume of water per unit of time a tree transpires in l day 1 beeson et al 2017 or the depth of water used over a defined area beeson et al 2018 thus the ratio of eta to eto can be used to determine kc for different crop stages determination of kc values for peaches grown in humid subtropical climates is key to optimize irrigation practices and water use efficiency in the past kc for humid subtropical climates have been determined for citrus trees jia et al 2007 morgan et al 2006 rabbiteye and highbush blueberries haman et al 1997 providing more specific recommendations for crop water demand that is customized for regional cultural practices compared to the general guidelines from fao 56 allen et al 1998 currently peach crop coefficients reported in the literature originate from mediterranean climates abrisqueta et al 2013 ayars et al 2003 bryla et al 2003 ferreira et al 1997 1996 johnson et al 2004 2002 2000 temperate climates massai and remorini 2000 paço et al 2006 or more general recommendations allen et al 1998 there is a lack of information on water requirements for young peach trees in humid subtropical climates therefore the objectives of this study were i to measure young peach tree water use volume as eta using weighing lysimeters ii to determine a relationship between eta rates of young peach trees with trunk cross sectional area and projected tree canopy area and iii to determine year round crop coefficients kc for 1 3 year old peach trees for humid subtropical conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment location and lysimeter

november 2017 the lysimeter trees were repotted into 760 l containers 1 21 m top diameter 1 06 m bottom diameter 0 70 m height using basket lysimeters as described by beeson 2011 the substrate used was 60 composted pine bark 30 florida sedge peat 10 coarse sand substrate the substrate was amended with 0 68 kg m 3 of micronutrients micromax scotts company marysville oh usa and 2 3 kg m 3 of dolomite limestone to buffer the substrate to a ph of 6 0 three weighing lysimeters each one a replicate were placed at the center of the plot suspended from 227 kg load cells interface force scottsdale az usa at the top of quad pods constructed of 25 mm diameter 6 3 m long galvanized pipe inserted into receptacles and welded onto a 15 cm length of 15 cm square tubing and pinned at the top beeson 2011 the remaining border trees n 12 were placed around the lysimeters using in row and in between row spacings of 4 6 and 6 1 m respectively resulting in a plant density of 358 trees ha 1 standard spacing for a commercial orchard all trees were pruned twice a year in june and december and fertilized as needed using controlled release fertilizer 2 2 weather data collection and reference evapotranspiration calculation eto was calculated daily using the penman monteith equation fao 56 allen et al 1998 from weather data collected from a weather station located in a grassland within 17 m

and maximum trunk diameter at 0 15 m and 0 30 m above the original substrate were recorded on lysimeter trees every three weeks throughout the study except when trees were leafless december to february horizontal projected canopy area pca measured with a tape measure and it was calculated by multiplying consistent perpendicular measurements of branch spread from north south and east west directions pca was expressed in m2 trunk cross sectional area tsca was measured with a forest caliper and was estimated as equivalent to a circle and expressed in cm2 cumulative chill units were calculated as 1 chill unit equal to 1 h of air temperatures at 2 m height from soil surface between 0 and 7 c chill units were calculated from 1 november to 28 february pruning of the open vase system occurred on 25 july 2016 24 july 2017 and 25 july 2018 for the summer pruning and on 14 december 2016 and 15 december 2017 for the winter pruning to maintain cultural practices consistent with commercial production in florida defoliation was induced by a foliar application of zinc sulfate dissolved in water at 10 concentration on the day of winter pruning the pruning practices for shoot size and ultimately for canopy size followed the guidelines of commercial production for subtropical peaches sarkhosh and ferguson 2007 the growth habit of a peach tree under florida conditions was divided into crop phenological stages according to the biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt und chemische industrie bbch in dormancy occurring between 335 20 doy leaf development 21 105 doy shoot development 106 300 and senescence 301 354 doy meier et al 1994 2 4 irrigation management and water use measurements starting in april 2016 all trees were irrigated daily with a microirrigation spray stake 24 2 l hr 1 roberts irrigation san marcos ca usa the eta for each tree lysimeter system was calculated by subtracting the mass at 22 00 h from the mass at 6 00 h the interval between the two measurements allowed the excess drainage soil moisture in the growing media to reach an equilibrium and avoid corrections for dew condensation beeson 2006 during rain events container mass increases due to water accumulation on the foliage were corrected as described by beeson 2006 by visually examining and estimating the beginning and ending times of eta to exclude rain events irrigation volume was based on the greatest mass change within the three tree replicates multiplied by 1 15 to account for irrigation non uniformity and for increases in plant mass due to growth beeson 2006 due to the high air temperature from may through november of each year an additional irrigation event was applied daily at 13 00 to the equivalent of 50 of mass between 6 00 and 13 00 water percolation from this irrigation event did not result in additional drainage the additional irrigation regime was maintained for the 31 months of the study to avoid water stress however the additional irrigation event was suspended to adjust the decreasing eta as trees entered the dormancy period when partial midday irrigation occurred increases in mass from midday irrigation was calculated by the data logger cr10x campbell scientific north logan ut and added to the daily sum if data loss occurred daily eta was estimated according to beeson 2006 2 5 actual evapotranspiration and tree growth relationship calculation measurements of eta l and eto mm were used to model daily plant water usage described by beeson 2006 an average of a seven day eta was divided by the same days of eto to obtain normalized eta n eta eq 1 1 n eta l mm 1 eta l eto mm normalized eta was plotted against pca and tcsa at 15 and 30 cm above ground obtaining a linear fit for the three growth measurements also daily pca and tcsa were calculated by averaging the growth between measurements then daily eta was estimated by multiplying daily eto by the linear regression equations that resulted between pca tcsa and n eta obtaining values of water consumption throughout the year eq 2 2 eta l eto mm intercept slope pca or tcsa 2 6 crop coefficient calculation daily eta l was divided by pca m2 to obtain daily eta mm and subsequently divided by daily eto mm to obtain a daily kc then two methods were used to estimate a kc throughout the year the first method was based on the distribution of kc values throughout the year in which three segment linear regression between 1 100 doy 101 300 doy and 301 365 doy were determined the second method consisted of a quadratic regression plotted between the calculated kc values and doy the days used to calculate kc values were selected excluding days with heavy rainfall when the mass correction could have not been done beeson 2006 days where technical problems occurred due to electrical power loss or weather conditions on the lysimeters occurred were also excluded 2 7 statistical analysis the kc and eta estimations were analyzed using a one way analysis of variance anova at p 0 05 significance using the glimmix procedure of sas version 9 4 sas institute cary nc usa the pearson product moment correlation was conducted between measured and estimated values of eta and kc values using sigmaplot 14 0 software systat software san jose ca regression analysis was used to determine if a linear or quadratic relationship existed for projected canopy area

daily average rh ranged from 69 to 85 during the shoot development stage late april to october fig 1b the relatively high air temperature fig 1a and high rh fig 1b resulted in vpd values of about 1 8 kpa during the shoot development stage between april to october fig 1c the vpd was lowest during dormancy in late december to mid january with vpd reaching about 0 14 kpa fig 1c values of vpd reported did not exceed 2 0 kpa fig 1c and were much lower than vpd values commonly reported in other peach growing regions such as california where vpd can reach over 3 5 kpa johnson et al 2004 on average 1090 mm occurred from may to october in the three years of study which was equivalent to 78 of the annual rainfall during peach tree dormancy to shoot development stages which correspond to the period between november to april the average rainfall was 315 mm on september 9 and 10 2017 the cumulative rainfall was 280 mm due to hurricane irma resulted fig 2 b on average daily eto throughout the year ranged from as low as 0 3 mm during dormancy to as high as 6 6 mm during the shoot development stage fig 2a c there was a decline in eto values around doy 200 when growth ceased trees were defoliated and entered into dormancy 3 2 tree growth the projected canopy area pca progressively increased throughout the study and was influenced by annual growth and pruning activities fig 3 a bud swell appeared around the end of january doy 21 as air temperature increased there was no foliage growth until mid february fig 3a the pca values were maintained around 1 7 m2 in the first and the second year of the trial during the spring of the third year there was an exponential increase of pca reaching up to 5 5 m2 by october 2018 fig 3a the reduced pca during the second year occurred because the trees lost branches and foliage due to hurricane irma which was followed by the transplanting of trees to bigger containers in november 2017 annual pruning maintained the pca around 5 5 m2 a typical size in commercial orchards for near mature peach trees the trunk cross sectional area tcsa increased from 2 to 50 cm2 measured at 0 15 m above ground during the 31 months of the study fig 3b bryla et al 2003 reported relatively similar tcsa 20 cm above ground values for young peach trees irrigated with microjets 2 3 week reaching about 9 26 and 41 cm2 from the first to the third year despite the differences in climate conditions between the study conducted by bryla et al 2003 and the present study trees had similar growth rates but crop evapotranspiration rates reported by bryla et al 2003 were slightly higher than the ones reported in this study 3 3 lysimeter measurements daily young peach tree eta l using weighing lysimeters is presented in fig 4 daily water consumption increased throughout the trial due to the increase in tree canopy size for the first two years daily eta peaked in late may to mid july reaching 7 7 l in 2016 and 6 8 l in 2017 in 2018 the peak of daily eta occurred during august reaching about 23 7 l because of the high eto and more developed tree canopy within each year the variation on the daily eta that occurred from may to october was due to rainfall and cloudy days reaching low eta values of about 0 2 l in 2016 0 1 l in 2017 and 4 l in 2018 the cumulative water consumption of young peach trees in the first tree years of development totaled 336 mm from april to december 2016 573 mm from january to december 2017 and 731 mm from january to october 2018 comparatively for the same months presented above young peach trees grown in san joaquin valley californina required 260 516 and 818 mm during the first three years bryla et al 2003 this comparison illustrate two main points the rate of plant development and water consumption for young peach trees in the first tree years were relatively similar between the present study conducted in florida and california and by the third year peach trees are expected to have reached the full transpiration potential in both locations bryla et al 2003 considering the pruning practices adopted in this study there are some considerations to be made on the determination of tree water consumption using weighing lysimeters with the substrate and water balance determined under undisturbed soil conditions the lysimeters used in this study provided a more accurate measurement of daily tree water usage since the estimation of eta considers the difference in water mass after water drainage stopped in addition a mid day water replenishment during months with high eto ensured that there were no limitations in tree water uptake berliner and oosterhuis 1987 reported that well irrigated plants cultivated in the field frequently presented signs of water stress earlier than plants cultivated in lysimeters this was due to the different root growth and distribution between the two media which directly impacted the plant water consumption rate during the day trees grown in lysimeters are subjected to conditions that generally do not occur in commercial fields for example uniform substrate no plant competition for water and variability in soil water movement patterns which can result in higher water consumption by plants pütz et al 2018 3 4 plant water requirement quantification the estimation of young peach tree water demand was conducted in two steps the first step was to establish a linear relationship between the daily eta and correspondent growth measurements of pca and tcsa the measured eta was applied in eq 1 to obtain a normalized daily actual evapotranspiration n eta and then it was correlated to pca and tcsa measurements there was a significant linear relationship p 0 001 between n eta and pca and tcsa at 0 15 and 0 30 m above ground level fig 5 a c it is noteworthy that this correlation was performed for the period that peach plants had leaves the period from late december to february was excluded from this particular analysis because trees were leafless and tcsa had no detectable growth during the plant dormancy stage the linear regression equations obtained by the correlation between n eta and the growth parameters fig 5a c were then multiplied by eto to estimate the daily eta l the use of pca to estimate water requirements of fruit trees has been previously used for olives in mediterranean regions masmoudi charfi 2013 testi et al 2004 and pecan trees sammis et al 2004 under humid subtropical conditions like in this study the relationship between pca tcsa and eta has been reported for evergreen and deciduous tree species beeson 2016 beeson et al 2018 2017 therefore pca and tcsa can be a useful tool to determine water demand not only for orchards establishment but also for containerized peach trees in nurseries where tree canopies are generally kept with similar size the second step was to use the daily eta and the correspondent pca to estimate daily kc and to determine a relationship between kc throughout the year in this study the pca was used as area for all the calculations differently of other studies where a fixed area was used to calculate the volume of water evapotranspirated per day in mm the first attempt was to fit the calculated kc values on a three segment linear regression along doy fig 6 there was a significant relationship p 0 001 for the first doy 0 100 and third segment doy 301 365 eqs 3 and 5 however there was no significant relationship for the segment correspondent to the doy 101 300 eq 4 which was attributed to the great variability of the kc values ranging from 0 5 0 8 in that period 3 kc 0 197 0 00426 doy for doy 1 100 r2 0 84 4 kc 0 637 0 0000314 doy for doy 101 300 r2 0 001 5 kc 2 694 0 00667 doy for doy 301 365 r2 0 81 the second attempt included the fitting of a quadratic regression in this case there was a significant relationship p 0 001 between kc and doy eq 6 6 kc 0 216 0 00462 doy 0 0000116 doy2 for doy 1 365 r2 0 70 during the dormancy stage the kc linear three segment ranged from 0 20 0 30 and kc for the quadratic fit ranged from 0 22 to 0 35 which were comparable to the kc value of 0 20 reported on fao 56 allen et al 1998 the kc values determined in the present study for the other peach phenological stages were much lower than reported by allen et al 1998 fig 6 the values of kc determined in californina using from weighing lysimeters ranged from 0 1 to 1 8 from april to september for two year old peach trees johnson et al 2002 while the model prediction of kc for the same period ranged from about 0 1 to 0 9 in florida the measured kc values ranged from 0 15 in january to 0 80 during the month of july comparatively in this study the three segment linear fit and the quadratic fit ranged from 0 20 to 0 63 and 0 22 to 0 68 respectively for the time interval from january dormancy to july shoot development fig 6 the kc values from both prediction models in the present study are not only different from johnson et al 2002 but they also reflect different lengths of time due to the duration of crop stage in florida and california the reported kc values from johnson et al 2002 considered the period from march to september while in florida trees were growing from late january to mid december totaling about 335 days of growth a year the determination of kc values was also conducted in other regions paço et al 2006 reported average kc values of 0 7 for young peach trees during 160 250 doy using the fao 56 approach in temperate condition of portugal in italy massai and remorini 2000 determined kc values for young peaches between june to september to range from 0 02 to 0 17 in the first year 0 17 to 0 45 in the second year and 0 26 to 0 65 in the third year using sap flow method the kc values on the second and third year were similar to the results obtained on the present study using weight lysimeters however it is noteworthy that the studies conducted by paço et al 2006 and massai and remorini 2000 determined kc for young peaches only for 3 and 4 months of the year respectively and not for the entire year span which makes their findings not directly transferable to humid subtropical conditions with extended growing periods as reported in this study 3 5 comparison of peach tree water requirement estimation methods a one way anova and a pearson product moment correlation were conducted to evaluate significant differences between kc values estimated by the three segment linear and quadratic methods used to estimate kc for young peach trees there was no significant difference between the methods p 0 26 and they were highly correlated table 1 therefore any of the models can be used to daily kc estimation for young peach trees in humid subtropical climates a one way anova was used to verify possible differences of measured eta values using pca tcsa 0 15 and 0 30 m three segment linear fit and the quadratic fit the eta analysis was conducted using the respective days when pca and tcsa were collected throughout the study eta values for the three segment linear and the quadratic fit estimation used the kc values previously obtained from eqs 3 6 the analysis determined that there was no significant difference between any of the estimation methods of eta p 0 95 the analysis of pearson product moment correlation revealed significant coefficient of correlations between the different estimation methods table 2 therefore pca or tcsa can be used to estimate daily eta for young peach trees the cumulative tree water use for the period between april 2016 to october 2018 was estimated using kc values published on fao 56 and kc values determined from the three segment linear fit eqs 3 5 and quadratic fit eq 6 when fao 56 kc were used the total crop water usage was estimated as 2505 mm while for the three segment regression the estimated crop water usage was 1795 mm and for the quadratic regression was 1808 mm the use of kc values determined in the study represented a reduction in 710 mm 28 in the estimation of crop water demand of young peach tree during the three first years 4 conclusion young peach trees grown in humid subtropical conditions are expected to have lower water requirements compared to similar trees grown in drier climates a significant relationship between eta l and plant growth measurements pca and tcsa was determined and peach water requirements can be estimated by regularly measuring the tree growth there was a significant relationship between doy and kc values described by the three segment linear or the quadratic fit there was no significant differences between the three segment linear and the quadratic fit for kc estimation throughout the year the kc values ranged from 0 20 during dormancy stage to 0 63 0 68 on the shoot development stage for the conditions of the study the values of kc from fao 56 would result in an overestimation of plant water demand in 710 mm or 28 compared to the kc values determined in this study there was no significant difference between the eta estimation methods however pca and the three segment linear fit had the highest correlation with the measured eta the use of pca was the simplest method to obtain growth data from peach trees and had no significant difference compared to the tcsa therefore regular measurements of tree pca and local estimation of eto can be used for the determination of crop water demand allows the seasonal adjustment of irrigation scheduling avoiding water stress or over irrigation of young peach trees declaration of

10671,in the southern usa low soil water holding capacity and erratic rainfall patterns create scenarios where plant water stress may occur reducing early peach tree growth therefore irrigation management is a key component to ensure adequate water supply during early tree growth stages the objective of this study was to determine water requirements and crop coefficient kc of young peach trees grown in a subtropical climate a study was conducted in central florida using young peach trees tropicbeauty grafted onto flordaguard daily actual evapotranspiration eta was determined using weighing lysimeters the highest daily peach water demand was recorded during the shoot development stage 23 7 l between august and october whereas the lowest daily eta was 0 71 l during dormancy in december and january year round kc values for young peach trees were obtained and ranged from 0 20 to 0 68 there was a significant correlation between plant water consumption with trunk cross sectional area tcsa and projected canopy area pca which can be used to estimate eta peach irrigation water demand for 1 3 years old trees expressed as daily eta can be estimated using daily reference evapotranspiration and pca the accurate determination of crop water demand allows the seasonal adjustment of irrigation scheduling avoiding water stress or over irrigation of young peach trees keywords crop coefficient projected canopy area weighing lysimeters 1 introduction peach prunus persica l batsch harvested area has increased by approximately 7 from 2010 to 2016 worldwide reaching over 1 6 million ha fao stat 2019 this increase is attributed to a need for crop diversification fruit demand and availability of low chill cultivars morgan and olmstead 2013 in florida low chill peach harvest usually occurs between late march and early may allowing peach growers to harvest fruits earlier than in northern latitudes which require a greater number of chilling hours peaches harvested from these low chill areas can be marketed and receive higher prices compared to those harvested later in the year in the last 15 years florida peach acreage has significantly increased with more than 500 ha in production andresen and athearn 2016 and will continue to expand about 54 of florida peach growers surveyed in 2018 indicated they had plans to expand their production area as the demand for florida peaches strengthens zambrano vaca and zotarelli 2018 peach trees during the first three years after planting have limited fruit production in subtropical climates and most of the carbohydrates and water resources are used for vegetative growth strong vegetative growth is crucial for the development of tree architecture that will support future fruit production plant water demand depends on the phenological stage plant spacing size and shape of the tree allen et al 1998 for example dormancy is very short and may last about 50 days in subtropical climates while in temperate climates peach dormancy can last more than 90 days sawamura et al 2017 plant water demand also depends on climate conditions according to the köppen classification florida has a humid subtropical climate cfa in which the mean air temperature in the warmest month is above 22 c and daily maximum air temperatures are above 30 c winters are mild with the coldest month averaging air temperatures below 18 c but higher than 3 c occasional frosts can occur but not for prolonged durations as in other production areas of the united states humid subtropical climates are characterized by hot summers with higher rainfall compared to winters with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunder and tropical storms in central florida the 20 yr average annual precipitation ranged from 812 to 1790 mm fawn 2019 however most of the precipitation occur during summer months peach leaf and fruit development occurs between february and may which are months characterized by low precipitation during this period eto surpasses precipitation in 10 65 mm requiring supplemental irrigation the eto is the sum of evaporation and transpiration of a reference surface which is conventionally is a hypothetical grass assumed height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the hypothetical grass closely resembles an extensive surface of green well watered grass of uniform height actively growing and completely shading the ground the eto is then related to a given crop by using the kc value which represents the difference in growth characteristics over time and changes in phenological stages between the reference grass and a particular field crop of interest allen et al 1998 daily actual evapotranspiration eta can be directly measured by using weighing lysimeters which are considered the most reliable and accurate tool for plant water use determination howell et al 1991 the eta of a given crop is commonly measured by recording the volume of water per unit of time a tree transpires in l day 1 beeson et al 2017 or the depth of water used over a defined area beeson et al 2018 thus the ratio of eta to eto can be used to determine kc for different crop stages determination of kc values for peaches grown in humid subtropical climates is key to optimize irrigation practices and water use efficiency in the past kc for humid subtropical climates have been determined for citrus trees jia et al 2007 morgan et al 2006 rabbiteye and highbush blueberries haman et al 1997 providing more specific recommendations for crop water demand that is customized for regional cultural practices compared to the general guidelines from fao 56 allen et al 1998 currently peach crop coefficients reported in the literature originate from mediterranean climates abrisqueta et al 2013 ayars et al 2003 bryla et al 2003 ferreira et al 1997 1996 johnson et al 2004 2002 2000 temperate climates massai and remorini 2000 paço et al 2006 or more general recommendations allen et al 1998 there is a lack of information on water requirements for young peach trees in humid subtropical climates therefore the objectives of this study were i to measure young peach tree water use volume as eta using weighing lysimeters ii to determine a relationship between eta rates of young peach trees with trunk cross sectional area and projected tree canopy area and iii to determine year round crop coefficients kc for 1 3 year old peach trees for humid subtropical conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment location and lysimeter description the study was conducted from april 2016 to october 2018 at the university of florida mid florida research and education center in apopka florida latitude 28 63 longitude 81 54 fifteen one

november 2017 the lysimeter trees were repotted into 760 l containers 1 21 m top diameter 1 06 m bottom diameter 0 70 m height using basket lysimeters as described by beeson 2011 the substrate used was 60 composted pine bark 30 florida sedge peat 10 coarse sand substrate the substrate was amended with 0 68 kg m 3 of micronutrients micromax scotts company marysville oh usa and 2 3 kg m 3 of dolomite limestone to buffer the substrate to a ph of 6 0 three weighing lysimeters each one a replicate were placed at the center of the plot suspended from 227 kg load cells interface force scottsdale az usa at the top of quad pods constructed of 25 mm diameter 6 3 m long galvanized pipe inserted into receptacles and welded onto a 15 cm length of 15 cm square tubing and pinned at the top beeson 2011 the remaining border trees n 12 were placed around the lysimeters using in row and in between row spacings of 4 6 and 6 1 m respectively resulting in a plant density of 358 trees ha 1 standard spacing for a commercial orchard all trees were pruned twice a year in june and december and fertilized as needed using controlled release fertilizer 2 2 weather data collection and reference evapotranspiration calculation eto was calculated daily using the penman monteith equation fao 56 allen et al 1998 from weather data collected from a weather station located in a grassland within 17 m from the lysimeters the weather station was equipped with a pyranometer li 200 li cor inc lincoln ne usa a tipping bucket rain gauge te525 texas instruments dallas tx usa air temperature humidity

application note 4 the vpd was calculated daily using the fao 56 equation allen et al 1998 2 3 tree growth measurements and chilling unit calculation growth measurements of the projected canopy area and maximum trunk diameter at 0 15 m and 0 30 m above the original substrate were recorded on lysimeter trees every three weeks throughout the study except when trees were leafless december to february horizontal projected canopy area pca measured with a tape measure and it was calculated by multiplying consistent perpendicular measurements of branch spread from north south and east west directions pca was expressed in m2 trunk cross sectional area tsca was measured with a forest caliper and was estimated as equivalent to a circle and expressed in cm2 cumulative chill units were calculated as 1 chill unit equal to 1 h of air temperatures at 2 m height from soil surface between 0 and 7 c chill units were calculated from 1 november to 28 february pruning of the open vase system occurred on 25 july 2016 24 july 2017 and 25 july 2018 for the summer pruning and on 14 december 2016 and 15 december 2017 for the winter pruning to maintain cultural practices consistent with commercial production in florida defoliation was induced by a foliar application of zinc sulfate dissolved in water at 10 concentration on the day of winter pruning the pruning practices for shoot size and ultimately for canopy size followed the guidelines of commercial production for subtropical peaches sarkhosh and ferguson 2007 the growth habit of a peach tree under florida conditions was divided into crop phenological stages according to the biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt und chemische industrie bbch in dormancy occurring between 335 20 doy leaf development 21 105 doy shoot development 106 300 and senescence 301 354 doy meier et al 1994 2 4 irrigation management and water use measurements starting in april 2016 all trees were irrigated daily with a microirrigation spray stake 24 2 l hr 1 roberts irrigation san marcos ca usa the eta for each tree lysimeter system was calculated by subtracting the mass at 22 00 h from the mass at 6 00 h the interval between the two measurements allowed the excess drainage soil moisture in the growing media to reach an equilibrium and avoid corrections for dew condensation beeson 2006 during rain events container mass increases due to water accumulation on the foliage were corrected as described by beeson 2006 by visually examining and estimating the beginning and ending times of eta to exclude rain events irrigation volume was based on the greatest mass change within the three tree replicates multiplied by 1 15 to account for irrigation non uniformity and for increases in plant mass due to growth beeson 2006 due to the high air temperature from may through november of each year an additional irrigation event was applied daily at 13 00 to the equivalent of 50 of mass between 6 00 and 13 00 water percolation from this irrigation event did not result in additional drainage the additional irrigation regime was maintained for the 31 months of the study to avoid water stress however the additional irrigation event was suspended to adjust the decreasing eta as trees entered the dormancy period when partial midday irrigation occurred increases in mass from midday irrigation was calculated by the data logger cr10x campbell scientific north logan ut and added to the daily sum if data loss occurred daily eta was estimated according to beeson 2006 2 5 actual evapotranspiration and tree growth relationship calculation measurements of eta l and eto mm were used to model daily plant water usage described by beeson 2006 an average of a seven day eta was divided by the same days of eto to obtain normalized eta n eta eq 1 1 n eta l mm 1 eta l eto mm normalized eta was plotted against pca and tcsa at 15 and 30 cm above ground obtaining a linear fit for the three growth measurements also daily pca and tcsa were calculated by averaging the growth between measurements then daily eta was estimated by multiplying daily eto by the linear regression equations that resulted between pca tcsa and n eta obtaining values of water consumption throughout the year eq 2 2 eta l eto mm intercept slope pca or tcsa 2 6 crop coefficient calculation daily eta l was divided by pca m2 to obtain daily eta mm and subsequently divided by daily eto mm to obtain a daily kc then two methods were used to estimate a kc throughout the year the first method was based on the distribution of kc values throughout the year in which three segment linear regression between 1 100 doy 101 300 doy and 301 365 doy were determined the second method consisted of a quadratic regression plotted between the calculated kc values and doy the days used to calculate kc values were selected excluding days with heavy rainfall when the mass correction could have not been done beeson 2006 days where technical problems occurred due to electrical power loss or weather conditions on the lysimeters occurred were also excluded 2 7 statistical analysis the kc and eta estimations were analyzed using a one way analysis of variance anova at p 0 05 significance using the glimmix procedure of sas version 9 4 sas institute cary nc usa the pearson product moment correlation was conducted between measured and estimated values of eta and kc values using sigmaplot 14 0 software systat software san jose ca regression analysis was used to determine if a linear or quadratic relationship existed for projected canopy area trunk cross sectional area and eta and kc and doy 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather parameters and reference evapotranspiration in this study peach trees accumulated 78 2016 17 growing season and

the time of the study fig 1b during winter and early spring which corresponded to the leaf development stage daily rh was slightly lower compared to summer months averaging between 65 and 79 minimum daily average rh ranged from 69 to 85 during the shoot development stage late april to october fig 1b the relatively high air temperature fig 1a and high rh fig 1b resulted in vpd values of about 1 8 kpa during the shoot development stage between april to october fig 1c the vpd was lowest during dormancy in late december to mid january with vpd reaching about 0 14 kpa fig 1c values of vpd reported did not exceed 2 0 kpa fig 1c and were much lower than vpd values commonly reported in other peach growing regions such as california where vpd can reach over 3 5 kpa johnson et al 2004 on average 1090 mm occurred from may to october in the three years of study which was equivalent to 78 of the annual rainfall during peach tree dormancy to shoot development stages which correspond to the period between november to april the average rainfall was 315 mm on september 9 and 10 2017 the cumulative rainfall was 280 mm due to hurricane irma resulted fig 2 b on average daily eto throughout the year ranged from as low as 0 3 mm during dormancy to as high as 6 6 mm during the shoot development stage fig 2a c there was a decline in eto values around doy 200 when growth ceased trees were defoliated and entered into dormancy 3 2 tree growth the projected canopy area pca progressively increased throughout the study and was influenced by annual growth and pruning activities fig 3 a bud swell appeared around the end of january doy 21 as air temperature increased there was no foliage growth until mid february fig 3a the pca values were maintained around 1 7 m2 in the first and the second year of the trial during the spring of the third year there was an exponential increase of pca reaching up to 5 5 m2 by october 2018 fig 3a the reduced pca during the second year occurred because the trees lost branches and foliage due to hurricane irma which was followed by the transplanting of trees to bigger containers in november 2017 annual pruning maintained the pca around 5 5 m2 a typical size in commercial orchards for near mature peach trees the trunk cross sectional area tcsa increased from 2 to 50 cm2 measured at 0 15 m above ground during the 31 months of the study fig 3b bryla et al 2003 reported relatively similar tcsa 20 cm above ground values for young peach trees irrigated with microjets 2 3 week reaching about 9 26 and 41 cm2 from the first to the third year despite the differences in climate conditions between the study conducted by bryla et al 2003 and the present study trees had similar growth rates but crop evapotranspiration rates reported by bryla et al 2003 were slightly higher than the ones reported in this study 3 3 lysimeter measurements daily young peach tree eta l using weighing lysimeters is presented in fig 4 daily water consumption increased throughout the trial due to the increase in tree canopy size for the first two years daily eta peaked in late may to mid july reaching 7 7 l in 2016 and 6 8 l in 2017 in 2018 the peak of daily eta occurred during august reaching about 23 7 l because of the high eto and more developed tree canopy within each year the variation on the daily eta that occurred from may to october was due to rainfall and cloudy days reaching low eta values of about 0 2 l in 2016 0 1 l in 2017 and 4 l in 2018 the cumulative water consumption of young peach trees in the first tree years of development totaled 336 mm from april to december 2016 573 mm from january to december 2017 and 731 mm from january to october 2018 comparatively for the same months presented above young peach trees grown in san joaquin valley californina required 260 516 and 818 mm during the first three years bryla et al 2003 this comparison illustrate two main points the rate of plant development and water consumption for young peach trees in the first tree years were relatively similar between the present study conducted in florida and california and by the third year peach trees are expected to have reached the full transpiration potential in both locations bryla et al 2003 considering the pruning practices adopted in this study there are some considerations to be made on the determination of tree water consumption using weighing lysimeters with the substrate and water balance determined under undisturbed soil conditions the lysimeters used in this study provided a more accurate measurement of daily tree water usage since the estimation of eta considers the difference in water mass after water drainage stopped in addition a mid day water replenishment during months with high eto ensured that there were no limitations in tree water uptake berliner and oosterhuis 1987 reported that well irrigated plants cultivated in the field frequently presented signs of water stress earlier than plants cultivated in lysimeters this was due to the different root growth and distribution between the two media which directly impacted the plant water consumption rate during the day trees grown in lysimeters are subjected to conditions that generally do not occur in commercial fields for example uniform substrate no plant competition for water and variability in soil water movement patterns which can result in higher water consumption by plants pütz et al 2018 3 4 plant water requirement quantification the estimation of young peach tree water demand was conducted in two steps the first step was to establish a linear relationship between the daily eta and correspondent growth measurements of pca and tcsa the measured eta was applied in eq 1 to obtain a normalized daily actual evapotranspiration n eta and then it was correlated to pca and tcsa measurements there was a significant linear relationship p 0 001 between n eta and pca and tcsa at 0 15 and 0 30 m above ground level fig 5 a c it is noteworthy that this correlation was performed for the period that peach plants had leaves the period from late december to february was excluded from this particular analysis because trees were leafless and tcsa had no detectable growth during the plant dormancy stage the linear regression equations obtained by the correlation between n eta and the growth parameters fig 5a c were then multiplied by eto to estimate the daily eta l the use of pca to estimate water requirements of fruit trees has been previously used for olives in mediterranean regions masmoudi charfi 2013 testi et al 2004 and pecan trees sammis et al 2004 under humid subtropical conditions like in this study the relationship between pca tcsa and eta has been reported for evergreen and deciduous tree species beeson 2016 beeson et al 2018 2017 therefore pca and tcsa can be a useful tool to determine water demand not only for orchards establishment but also for containerized peach trees in nurseries where tree canopies are generally kept with similar size the second step was to use the daily eta and the correspondent pca to estimate daily kc and to determine a relationship between kc throughout the year in this study the pca was used as area for all the calculations differently of other studies where a fixed area was used to calculate the volume of water evapotranspirated per day in mm the first attempt was to fit the calculated kc values on a three segment linear regression along doy fig 6 there was a significant relationship p 0 001 for the first doy 0 100 and third segment doy 301 365 eqs 3 and 5 however there was no significant relationship for the segment correspondent to the doy 101 300 eq 4 which was attributed to the great variability of the kc values ranging from 0 5 0 8 in that period 3 kc 0 197 0 00426 doy for doy 1 100 r2 0 84 4 kc 0 637 0 0000314 doy for doy 101 300 r2 0 001 5 kc 2 694 0 00667 doy for doy 301 365 r2 0 81 the second attempt included the fitting of a quadratic regression in this case there was a significant relationship p 0 001 between kc and doy eq 6 6 kc 0 216 0 00462 doy 0 0000116 doy2 for doy 1 365 r2 0 70 during the dormancy stage the kc linear three segment ranged from 0 20 0 30 and kc for the quadratic fit ranged from 0 22 to 0 35 which were comparable to the kc value of 0 20 reported on fao 56 allen et al 1998 the kc values determined in the present study for the other peach phenological stages were much lower than reported by allen et al 1998 fig 6 the values of kc determined in californina using from weighing lysimeters ranged from 0 1 to 1 8 from april to september for two year old peach trees johnson et al 2002 while the model prediction of kc for the same period ranged from about 0 1 to 0 9 in florida the measured kc values ranged from 0 15 in january to 0 80 during the month of july comparatively in this study the three segment linear fit and the quadratic fit ranged from 0 20 to 0 63 and 0 22 to 0 68 respectively for the time interval from january dormancy to july shoot development fig 6 the kc values from both prediction models in the present study are not only different from johnson et al 2002 but they also reflect different lengths of time due to the duration of crop stage in florida and california the reported kc values from johnson et al 2002 considered the period from march to september while in florida trees were growing from late january to mid december totaling about 335 days of growth a year the determination of kc values was also conducted in other regions paço et al 2006 reported average kc values of 0 7 for young peach trees during 160 250 doy using the fao 56 approach in temperate condition of portugal in italy massai and remorini 2000 determined kc values for young peaches between june to september to range from 0 02 to 0 17 in the first year 0 17 to 0 45 in the second year and 0 26 to 0 65 in the third year using sap flow method the kc values on the second and third year were similar to the results obtained on the present study using weight lysimeters however it is noteworthy that the studies conducted by paço et al 2006 and massai and remorini 2000 determined kc for young peaches only for 3 and 4 months of the year respectively and not for the entire year span which makes their findings not directly transferable to humid subtropical conditions with extended growing periods as reported in this study 3 5 comparison of peach tree water requirement estimation methods a one way anova and a pearson product moment correlation were conducted to evaluate significant differences between kc values estimated by the three segment linear and quadratic methods used to estimate kc for young peach trees there was no significant difference between the methods p 0 26 and they were highly correlated table 1 therefore any of the models can be used to daily kc estimation for young peach trees in humid subtropical climates a one way anova was used to verify possible differences of measured eta values using pca tcsa 0 15 and 0 30 m three segment linear fit and the quadratic fit the eta analysis was conducted using the respective days when pca and tcsa were collected throughout the study eta values for the three segment linear and the quadratic fit estimation used the kc values previously obtained from eqs 3 6 the analysis determined that there was no significant difference between any of the estimation methods of eta p 0 95 the analysis of pearson product moment correlation revealed significant coefficient of correlations between the different estimation methods table 2 therefore pca or tcsa can be used to estimate daily eta for young peach trees the cumulative tree water use for the period between april 2016 to october 2018 was estimated using kc values published on fao 56 and kc values determined from the three segment linear fit eqs 3 5 and quadratic fit eq 6 when fao 56 kc were used the total crop water usage was estimated as 2505 mm while for the three segment regression the estimated crop water usage was 1795 mm and for the quadratic regression was 1808 mm the use of kc values determined in the study represented a reduction in 710 mm 28 in the estimation of crop water demand of young peach tree during the three first years 4 conclusion young peach trees grown in humid subtropical conditions are expected to have lower water requirements compared to similar trees grown in drier climates a significant relationship between eta l and plant growth measurements pca and tcsa was determined and peach water requirements can be estimated by regularly measuring the tree growth there was a significant relationship between doy and kc values described by the three segment linear or the quadratic fit there was no significant differences between the three segment linear and the quadratic fit for kc estimation throughout the year the kc values ranged from 0 20 during dormancy stage to 0 63 0 68 on the shoot development stage for the conditions of the study the values of kc from fao 56 would result in an overestimation of plant water demand in 710 mm or 28 compared to the kc values determined in this study there was no significant difference between the eta estimation methods however pca and the three segment linear fit had the highest correlation with the measured eta the use of pca was the simplest method to obtain growth data from peach trees and had no significant difference compared to the tcsa therefore regular measurements of tree pca and local estimation of eto can be used for the determination of crop water demand allows the seasonal adjustment of irrigation scheduling avoiding water stress or over irrigation of young peach trees declaration of

soil water storage differed significantly between treatments in each cropping season with the apsi treatment greatly improving sws weather conditions influenced soil water status and surface conditions which play a key role in summer maize growth and development in semi arid regions zhang et al 2011 precipitation during the summer maize growing seasons was relatively low in 2013 and 2015 but high in 2011 2012 and 2014 and the different amounts of precipitation led to different sws fig 1 the apsi and alsi treatments always had higher sws than the ck treatment which is consistent with yu et al 2017 our study showed that weather factors affected sws under summer maize for example in the wetter years of 2011 2012 and 2014 the apsi treatment increased sws much more than the ck treatment which was likely due to the incorporated straw retaining more water zhao et al 2016 the powdered straw decreased soil bulk density and led to faster straw decomposition singh et al 2003 tarafdar et al 2001 soil bulk density is closely related to other soil properties such as soil porosity structure and water content lampurlanés and cantero martinez 2003 the apsi treatment had the highest sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the growing season previous studies have reported that straw residue incorporated into farmland improves crop water consumption patterns by reducing evapotranspiration li et al 2013b zhang et al 2014 and promoting transpiration li et al 2013a mwale et al 2007 thereby increasing yield and wue cai et al 2015 chen et al 2015 mo et al 2016 the shorter straw size will improve soil porosity maintain loose soil chen et al 2007 li et al 2001 improve soil permeability and hydraulic conductivity blanco canqui et al 2007 and increase water storage in the soil profile in our study the apsi treatment had a higher sws which is consistent with shaver et al 2013 who asserted that plowing straw into the soil might improve soil water conditions by increasing water infiltration 4 2 crop growth dynamics the lai in the apsi treatment increased significantly with increasing pari at maize jointing and flowering stages which led to greater aboveground biomass accumulation than the alsi and ck treatments fig 3 the aboveground biomass likely responded to the increased leaf area bennett et al 1989 greater leaf photosynthesis echarte et al 2008 and increased radiation capture akhtar et al 2019 similar findings were reported by liu et al 2010b who found that the relationship between pari and grain yield is influenced by lai during summer maize growing stages sharma et al 2011 reported that tillage practices e g subsoiling in the maize season but no tillage during the wheat season and straw mulching during the wheat and maize seasons affected nutrient availability in the topsoil which might be attributed to maize productivity this increase corresponds with our field management modes i e wheat straw plowing into the soil across five cropping seasons aboveground biomass and grain productivity have been directly correlated with lai and pari mwale et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 which is consistent with our findings the cumulative pari during crop growth increased dramatically in the apsi and alsi treatments and was accompanied by increases in aboveground biomass and grain yield this may be due to the incorporation of ammoniated wheat straw into soil which increased the soil water content and reduced evaporation during the growing season yu et al 2015 2017 radiation use efficiency is the amount of aboveground biomass produced per unit intercepted solar radiation gaju et al 2016 jia et al 2018 and can differ between growing seasons i e reductions in intercepted photosynthetically active radiation pari and leaf area may cause losses of rue dry matter and crop productivity lindquist et al 2005 jia et al 2018 indicated that crop production and dry matter are affected by the cumulative pari during growth 4 3 et and wue as shown by srivastava et al 2016 et is strongly correlated with soil available water saw similar findings were reported by nagore et al 2014 and hernández et al 2015 for maize in argentina the straw returning management practices and precipitation distribution in our study significantly affected et which agrees with the findings of other studies on the loess plateau of china ding et al 2018 li et al 2018 the apsi and alsi treatments had lower ets than the ck treatment suggesting that ammoniated straw incorporation effectively retards soil evaporation improves plant transpiration and conserves water for later growth the wue of rainfed summer maize was influenced by weather factors and varied significantly from season to season wang et al 2012 reported that most of the rainfall is lost to evaporation in the loess plateau of northwestern china low precipitation our studies showed that the apsi treatment increased wue more than the alsi and ck treatments over five cropping seasons which may be why the shorter wheat straw incorporated into the soil conserved more water fuentes et al 2003 shao et al 2016 wang et al 2009 similar findings were reported by munawar et al 1990 who demonstrated that straw returned to the experimental field reduced soil evaporation losses and enhanced the collection of precipitation throughout the growing season powdered straw incorporation improved soil structure i e soil bulk density chivenge et al 2011 soil aggregates bossuyt et al 2001 oldfield et al 2019 and soil porosity jat et al 2009 recent studies have demonstrated that ammoniated straw low c n ratios returned to experimental plots decomposed rapidly creating a favorable soil environment chivenge et al 2011 hoorens et al 2003 melillo et al 1989 thus the apsi

soil water storage differed significantly between treatments in each cropping season with the apsi treatment greatly improving sws weather conditions influenced soil water status and surface conditions which play a key role in summer maize growth and development in semi arid regions zhang et al 2011 precipitation during the summer maize growing seasons was relatively low in 2013 and 2015 but high in 2011 2012 and 2014 and the different amounts of precipitation led to different sws fig 1 the apsi and alsi treatments always had higher sws than the ck treatment which is consistent with yu et al 2017 our study showed that weather factors affected sws under summer maize for example in the wetter years of 2011 2012 and 2014 the apsi treatment increased sws much more than the ck treatment which was likely due to the incorporated straw retaining more water zhao et al 2016 the powdered straw decreased soil bulk density and led to faster straw decomposition singh et al 2003 tarafdar et al 2001 soil bulk density is closely related to other soil properties such as soil porosity structure and water content lampurlanés and cantero martinez 2003 the apsi treatment had the highest sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the growing season previous studies have reported that straw residue incorporated into farmland improves crop water consumption patterns by reducing evapotranspiration li et al 2013b zhang et al 2014 and promoting transpiration li et al 2013a mwale et al 2007 thereby increasing yield and wue cai et al 2015 chen et al 2015 mo et al 2016 the shorter straw size will improve soil porosity maintain loose soil chen et al 2007 li et al 2001 improve soil permeability and hydraulic conductivity blanco canqui et al 2007 and increase water storage in the soil profile in our study the apsi treatment had a higher sws which is consistent with shaver et al 2013 who asserted that plowing straw into the soil might improve soil water conditions by increasing water infiltration 4 2 crop growth dynamics the lai in the apsi treatment increased significantly with increasing pari at maize jointing and flowering stages which led to greater aboveground biomass accumulation than the alsi and ck treatments fig 3 the aboveground biomass likely responded to the increased leaf area bennett et al 1989 greater leaf photosynthesis echarte et al 2008 and increased radiation capture akhtar et al 2019 similar findings were reported by liu et al 2010b who found that the relationship between pari and grain yield is influenced by lai during summer maize growing stages sharma et al 2011 reported that tillage practices e g subsoiling in the maize season but no tillage during the wheat season and straw mulching during the wheat and maize seasons affected nutrient availability in the topsoil which might be attributed to maize productivity this increase corresponds with our field management modes i e wheat straw plowing into the soil across five cropping seasons aboveground biomass and grain productivity have been directly correlated with lai and pari mwale et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 which is consistent with our findings the cumulative pari during crop growth increased dramatically in the apsi and alsi treatments and was accompanied by increases in aboveground biomass and grain yield this may be due to the incorporation of ammoniated wheat straw into soil which increased the soil water content and reduced evaporation during the growing season yu et al 2015 2017 radiation use efficiency is the amount of aboveground biomass produced per unit intercepted solar radiation gaju et al 2016 jia et al 2018 and can differ between growing seasons i e reductions in intercepted photosynthetically active radiation pari and leaf area may cause losses of rue dry matter and crop productivity lindquist et al 2005 jia et al 2018 indicated that crop production and dry matter are affected by the cumulative pari during growth 4 3 et and wue as shown by srivastava et al 2016 et is strongly correlated with soil available water saw similar findings were reported by nagore et al 2014 and hernández et al 2015 for maize in argentina the straw returning management practices and precipitation distribution in our study significantly affected et which agrees with the findings of other studies on the loess plateau of china ding et al 2018 li et al 2018 the apsi and alsi treatments had lower ets than the ck treatment suggesting that ammoniated straw incorporation effectively retards soil evaporation improves plant transpiration and conserves water for later growth the wue of rainfed summer maize was influenced by weather factors and varied significantly from season to season wang et al 2012 reported that most of the rainfall is lost to evaporation in the loess plateau of northwestern china low precipitation our studies showed that the apsi treatment increased wue more than the alsi and ck treatments over five cropping seasons which may be why the shorter wheat straw incorporated into the soil conserved more water fuentes et al 2003 shao et al 2016 wang et al 2009 similar findings were reported by munawar et al 1990 who demonstrated that straw returned to the experimental field reduced soil evaporation losses and enhanced the collection of precipitation throughout the growing season powdered straw incorporation improved soil structure i e soil bulk density chivenge et al 2011 soil aggregates bossuyt et al 2001 oldfield et al 2019 and soil porosity jat et al 2009 recent studies have demonstrated that ammoniated straw low c n ratios returned to experimental plots decomposed rapidly creating a favorable soil environment chivenge et al 2011 hoorens et al 2003 melillo et al 1989 thus the apsi treatment is particularly well suited for increasing seasonal wue in rainfed areas yu et al 2017 considering the lower c n ratios ammoniated straw returning might achieve a balance between grain production and water utilization in the loess plateau however further research is required to investigate the effects of ammoniated straw returning on soil physicochemical characteristics to improve soil quality 5 conclusion a five year field experiment from 2011 to 2015 evaluated the effect of straw incorporation on water utilization and maize growth in the loess plateau of china powdered straw incorporation apsi improved water utilization i e higher wue and lower et more than the long straw and control plots soil water storage and wue in the apsi plots increased by 0 2 5 1 and 4 6 7 9 respectively and et decreased by 2 6 3 4 compared with the control the promotion of soil water utilization with straw incorporated into soil created a better environment for summer maize growth and

10673,accurate quantification of crop water use or evapotranspiration et is crucial in agriculture for improved irrigation scheduling and water resource planning across a wide range of farming conditions the aim of this study was to quantify et dynamics for irrigated sweet potato ipomoea batatas in order to determine the fao type single crop coefficients kc that can be used in models to estimate crop water use under a wider range of semi arid climatic conditions an open path eddy covariance system containing energy balance sensors was installed in a 1 3 ha field to estimate et of orange fleshed sweet potato the study was conducted during the 2014 15 and 2015 16 growing seasons daily et varied between 0 5 and 5 5 mm linked closely to canopy cover and weather conditions with total seasonal measured et of 361 and 347 mm for the 2014 15 and 2015 16 seasons respectively time averaged kc values of 0 47 for the initial stage 0 97 for the mid season stage and 0 44 for the late growth stage were derived from this study in addition a heat unit based growing degree days kc equation was successfully developed and validated in this study to adjust kc values of sweet potato to specific climates these kc values can be used in combination with the fao 56 reference evapotranspiration eto to estimate site specific sweet potato et which is vital for improving water management of irrigated sweet potato cropping systems growing under semi arid conditions keywords crop coefficients eddy covariance fao 56 irrigation scheduling 1 introduction sweet potato ipomoea batatas is cultivated in more than 100 countries worldwide mostly throughout tropical and subtropical asia and africa in hot semi arid climatic regions where air temperatures are relatively high daff 2011 orange fleshed sweet potato ofsp is commonly grown for its edible storage roots which contain high levels of β carotene iron fe and zinc zn according to the latest statistics the area under sweet potato production in south africa is approximately 2000 3500 ha daff 2015 although white fleshed sweet potato wfsp is the most produced cultivar due to its ability to attain higher marketable yields its β carotene level the major precursor of vitamin a is significantly lower compared to ofsp cultivars motsa et al 2015 low et al 2017 as a result ofsp is becoming increasingly popular in a number of countries worldwide including south africa especially amongst the smallholder farmers in rural areas as its consumption can play an important role towards improving human diet and alleviating malnutrition burri 2011 tanumihardjo et al 2017 sweet potato is planted mainly in the rainy season and is considered as a drought tolerant crop motsa et al 2015 several studies have investigated the water use or evapotranspiration et of sweet potato using a simple soil water balance method gomes and carr 2003 laurie et al 2009 beletse et al 2011 jovanovic and israel 2012 laurie et al 2012 lewthwaite and triggs 2012 beletse 2013 masango 2014 prabawardani and suparno 2015 nyathi et al 2016 when determining crop et using the soil water balance method components such as runoff deep percolation subsurface flow and water brought by capillary rise are often ignored goldhamer et al 1993 rana and katerji 2000 ignoring such components can result in inaccurate estimations of the crop et rana and katerji 2000 according to the above mentioned studies the et rates of both wfsp and ofsp were widely variable affected by several factors including weather conditions and crop management practices as a result more site specific estimations of sweet potato et and crop coefficients are crucial for the estimation of water use of the crop under semi arid climatic conditions according to jovanovic and annandale 1999 often the most accurate way of estimating et is achieved through direct physical measurements such as energy flux measurements using an eddy covariance system therefore quantifying sweet potato water use directly using such a system under optimal crop management conditions will contribute useful information on the water requirements and irrigation water management of this crop since the sweet potato et measurements are highly variable estimates from the eddy covariance system can be used to determine crop coefficients kc the eddy covariance estimates will enable the extrapolation of site specific measurements to various climates using modelling approaches such as the fao 56 single crop coefficient and heat unit based growing degree days allen et al 1998 this will assist in improving water resource planning and irrigation water management of sweet potato production across a wide range of climatic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and

and 200 kg k ha 1 were applied in the first season and 100 kg n ha 1 and 150 kg k ha 1 in the second season after 21 days of planting the fertiliser forms used were n p k 1 0 1 36 and superphosphate 10 5 at planting and lan 28 and kcl 50 for top dressing the trial size was 130 m 100 m 13 000 m2 in both growing seasons the trial was planted with cuttings of ofsp cultivar bophelo planting was done on the 12th of january during the 2014 15 season and 11th of january during the 2015 16 season the cultivar bophelo was chosen due to its superior nutritional value and linked potential in alleviating malnutrition the cultivar is also becoming popular among south african farmers in both seasons 0 3 m ofsp cuttings were manually planted at a planting density of 35 507 plants ha 1 on ridges which were 1 4 m apart for each ridge two rows of plants were planted at a spacing of 0 4 m between plants dragline sprinklers were used to irrigate the trial at a flow rate of 15 litres per hour neutron probe access tubes as well as chameleon moisture sensors stirzaker et al 2017 were installed at six different positions in the field for irrigation scheduling monitoring plant available water paw was determined using the following equation allen et al 1998 1 paw fc pwp rd where paw is plant available water mm fc is field capacity m3 m 3 pwp is permanent wilting point m3 m 3 and rd is rooting depth mm a volume of 20 mm of irrigation was applied immediately after the cuttings were planted and subsequently the crop was irrigated once a week to fc to ensure that more than 50 of paw was never depleted weeds were controlled manually between rows and ridges until the ground was fully covered by the crop canopy the crop was grown under water and nutrient non limiting conditions and kept free of pests and diseases during both experimental seasons 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 eddy covariance system setup and data recording the ec 150 campbell scientific inc logan utah usa was used to estimate et directly and indirectly using the shortened energy balance equation three dimensional wind velocity and temperature fluctuations were measured using a csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc logan utah usa water vapour concentration was measured using a fast response ec 150 co2 h2o open path gas analyser campbell scientific inc logan utah usa as part of the ec system all ec data were logged at 30 min intervals with subsequent storage in a cr5000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa additional sensors including an nr lite net radiometer kipp and zonen delft the netherlands thermocouples a time domain reflectometer tdr and soil heat flux plates were used for measuring the remaining components of the energy balance in order to complete the energy balance equation all sensors were installed at a height of 1 3 m above the 0 1 0 5 m canopy height on a tower which was situated around the middle of the plot but closer to the one end where the prevailing wind dominates this was done to obtain enough fetch for the ec measurements in order to improve the energy balance closure four soil heat flux plates hft s rebs seattle wa were installed at the depth of 0 08 m below the soil surface and thermocouple soil temperature averaging probes were installed at the depths of 0 02 and 0 06 m to measure the heat stored above soil heat flux plates volumetric soil water content for the top 0 20 m soil was measured using two cs616 probes the ec system estimates sensible heat fluxes h based on measurements of the turbulent boundary layer above the canopy rana and katerji 2000 the air flow is assumed to be made up of a large number of eddies each having three dimensional components horizontal and vertical burba and anderson 2010 the sensors measured the water content of the air the vertical component of wind speed and air temperature at 10 hz the data was averaged every 30 min nagler et al 2005 the ec flux measurements allow et to be calculated directly whereas additional instruments allow the surface energy balance to be calculated indirectly as indicated in eq 2 twine et al 2000 nagler et al 2005 these measurements were conducted throughout the entire experimental period to check the validity of et measurements in order to assess the energy balance closure using the bowen ratio method as described by twine et al 2000 and ezzahar et al 2009 2 rn g le h wherern is the net radiation measured above the canopy using a net radiometer g is soil heat flux measured using soil heat flux plates le is latent energy flux evaporation multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization which was measured using an open path gas analyzer h is sensible heat flux measured using a sonic temperature sensor 2 2 2 monitoring of crop growth during both growing seasons fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation fipar and leaf area index lai were measured non destructively using a decagon sunfleck ceptometer decagon pullman washington usa in order to monitor canopy development and the relationship between canopy development and et biweekly readings were taken above and below the canopy of a selected sampling area of 0 16 m2 this was done under clear sky days between 12 00 14 00 pm leaf area index lai m2 m 2 was also determined through destructive measurements using an lai 3100 belt driven meter li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa to measure total leaf area m2 this was done monthly to confirm the non destructive measurements of lai the following equation was used to calculate lai watson 1947 3 l a i m e a s u r e d t o t a l l e a f a r e a s a m p l e d g r o u n d a r e a fractional interception fi was calculated using the equation below jovanovic and annandale 1998 4 f i 100 1 i o i t whereio is the measured photosynthetic active radiation μmol m 2 s 1 on the surface of the ground and it is the radiant flux density on top of the canopy μmol m 2 s 1 plant growth fresh mass and dry matter was measured at three week intervals throughout the growing season and was done by sampling the above ground and harvestable storage root plant material of six plants from each sampling area samples were separated into stems leaves and storage roots for fresh mass determination the different samples were then oven dried at 70 c to a constant mass for dry matter determination 2 2 3 daily crop evapotranspiration daily et mm day 1 was calculated from data measured using the ec system following eq 4 5 e t m m d a y 1 86400 l e λ ρ w where le w m 2 is latent heat fluxes measured using the ec system which was averaged over 24 h to obtain daily et λ the specific latent heat of vaporization of water per unit mass 2454 000 j kg 1 and ρw kg m 3 is the density of water the factor 86 400 converts from seconds to days 2 2 4 determining the surface energy balance closure and ec data processing surface energy balance closure for the ec system measurements was determined for the two growing seasons of sweet potato at the half hourly time scale using eq 2 estimates of the turbulent fluxes le h from the ec system were subsequently compared to estimates of the available energy rn g using the energy balance method in order to determine the energy balance closure using the bowen ratio method twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 nagler et al 2005 this method assumes that rn g was correctly measured by the ec system so that both values of h le could be increased according to the ratio of h and le in order to balance eq 2 as described by fitzjarrald and moore 1994 blanken et al 1997 and twine et al 2000 the adjustment was done by computing the difference between le h and rn g flux values measured at the same time and divide the product by two then the final value was used to compensate values of le h blanken et al 1997 twine et al 2000 cleverly et al 2002 hipps et al 2002 scott et al 2004 nagler et al 2005 the surface energy balance closure was analysed by plotting the sum between h le turbulent fluxes against the rn g available energy using good quality data for 20 days during the 2014 15 growing season 2 8 3 and 7 days during initial development mid season and late growth stages respectively and 11 days during the 2015 16 growing season 2 3 4 and 2 days during initial development mid season and late growth stages respectively stannard et al 1994 stated that if all components of energy balance are measured with accuracy independently and sum to zero it shows that the ec measurements are good and the energy balance equation is satisfied in such a case the linear equation of h le against rn g should have a slope close to one and an intercept close to zero 2 2 5 crop coefficient daily weekly and time average crop coefficients kc for sweet potato grown under optimum management conditions were determined for two consecutive growing seasons using the fao single crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 6 k c e t e t o where eto is reference evapotranspiration mm eto was calculated according to the fao penman monteith equation using daily weather data measured at the study site allen et al 1998 7 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t is air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height in m s 1 es is saturation vapour pressure kpa ea is actual vapour pressure kpa and δ is the slope of the vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 in order to adjust the determined crop coefficients for sweet potato to site specific climatic conditions a heat unit based growing degree days gdd equation was developed using measured data during the 2014 15 growing season gdds were calculated using a base temperature of 15 5 c and with no cut off temperatures as suggested by wees et al 2016 the equation developed using gdds was subsequently validated using an independent growing season of measurements 2 2 6 soil water content rainfall and irrigation soil water content was measured using a neutron probe water meter model 503dr cpn hydroprobe campbell pacific nuclear inc california usa that measures volumetric water content θ for irrigation scheduling pre calibrated on site five neutron probe access tubes were installed in the field to a depth of 1 0 m soil water content was measured at 0 2 m increments by lowering the probe through the access tubes once a week to determine the water depletion level prior to irrigation chameleon soil moisture sensors were also installed at depths of 0 15 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 m to monitor soil water tension two to three times a week in order to check whether the crop was optimally irrigated when changes in soil water content could not be monitored using a neutron probe stirzaker et al 2017 these sensors give outputs in three different colours which correspond to varying ranges of soil water tension measured namely blue wet soil 25 kpa green moist 25 50 kpa and red dry soil 50 kpa for the period when chameleon sensors were used irrigation was scheduled based on the established relationship between soil water tension obtained with chameleon sensors and volumetric soil water content obtained with a neutron probe at the study site rainfall was recorded with te 525 tipping bucket rain gauges texas electronics inc dallas tx usa which was connected to a cr10x campbell scientific utah usa data logger the actual irrigation applied was measured using manual rain gauges which were positioned at various points in the field to account for the variability in sprinkler irrigation uniformity 2 2 7 weather data weather data daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and relative humidity total daily solar radiation wind speed and direction were obtained from an automatic weather station campbell scientific inc logan utah usa which was located about 500 m from the trial site in roodeplaat pretoria 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather data variability generally weather variables maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall during the 2014 15 growing season were lower than the subsequent season 2015 16 as illustrated in table 2 temperatures during both growing seasons were favorable for sweet potato growth rainfall during the 2015 16 growing season was higher than during the 2014 15 growing season but not well distributed with most of the rain being received in march long term average rainfall was higher when compared to both growing seasons the average long term reference evapotranspiration eto was lower than the actual eto for the two growing seasons table 2 3 2 profile soil water content the seasonal change in soil water content in response to rainfall received and irrigation applied during the 2014 15 growing season is shown in fig 1 for the 2015 16 season changes in soil water tension as affected by rainfall and irrigation events are shown in table 3 and fig 2 the total applied irrigation water and rainfall received during the 2014 15 season 481 mm was lower but better distributed than during the 2015 16 season 585 mm which contributed to an adequate profile soil water content between 90 and 100 of field capacity as a result the crop was likely grown under non limited soil water conditions throughout the experimental period 3 3 leaf area index and fractional interception of photosynthetic active radiation the lai fig 3 and fi fig 4 recorded during both growing seasons followed similar trends when related to changes in growing degree days gdd the values increased from the early to mid season growth stage but decreased in the late growth stage dropping quickly after the crop reached maturity the sharp decrease of lai during the late growth stage was due to the fact that the crop reached maturity which was accompanied by senescence of leaves van den berg et al 2004v nedunchezhiyan et al 2012 the lai and fi in the 2014 15 season reached slightly higher values than the lai and fi in the 2015 16 season and as a result higher par was intercepted during the 2014 15 growing season these measurements were conducted to assess whether the et measured using ec system increased with canopy development the lai reported in this study was within the lai ranges reported in the scientific literature shibayama and akita 2002 masango 2014 the maximum lais observed were 2 4 and 2 6 m2 m 2 this was in agreement with shibayama and akita 2002 and masango 2014 who reported maximum lais of 2 7 and 3 0 m2 m 2 for sweet potato respectively bourke 1982 reported that storage root dry matter accumulation is determined by the period that the crop leaves are green where high par will be intercepted in this study the crop was actively growing from the planting date on the 11th of january until mid april for both growing seasons for 95 days after planting until the crop accumulated approximately 650 gdd where lai values increased until 2 6 m2 m 2 during the 2014 15 season and 2 4 m2 m 2 during the 2015 16 season it is not surprising that the difference in maximum attained lai during the two growing seasons of measurements was quite small as the crop reaches full cover and closed canopy crop during this period of growth following the same trend of lai increment fi also increased during both growing seasons to a maximum of 97 99 then it decreased until the end of the growing season due to crop reaching maturity and senescence of leaves 117 days after planting accumulating a total of 730 750 gdd in this study it was observed that the fi directly depended on canopy architecture and the density of canopy foliage flenet et al 1996 pilau and angelocci 2015 3 4 energy balance closure an energy imbalance between h le and rn g was observed during both growing seasons during the 2014 15 growing season the energy balance closure error was 45 while during the 2015 16 growing season the energy balance closure error was 48 in this study the twine et al 2000 method was followed which suggests forcing closure is justified when the available energy is known and errors in its measurement are modest as a result the le and h heat fluxes were scaled to force closure while conserving the measured bowen ratio therefore the bowen ratio closure brc method was used to improve h le by adding to h le fluxes twine et al 2000 stated that for their study le h measured using the ec system were most often less than rn g typically ranging from 5 30 which simply means that turbulent fluxes measured with the ec system are mainly underestimated the reasons that caused energy imbalance between h le and rn g in our study could be due to errors in ec measurement which may have been caused by dirt on the sonic transducers noise in the measurement system paw et al 2000 baldocchi and mayers 1991 scott et al 2003 papale et al 2006 in addition lack of steady state conditions consumption of net radiation by photosynthesis neglected energy sinks heat storage in the top soil mismatch in footprint and malfunctions of sensors during rainfall conditions might have also contributed to an increased closure error ezzahar et al 2009 teixeira and bastiaanssen 2010 finnigan et al 2003 also suggest that the averaging time of generally 30 min used to calculate covariances could be inadequate for assessing turbulent fluxes the energy balance closure in this study was again assessed by comparing the discrepancy between rn g and h le after adjustment using the brc method and the closure error during the 2014 15 growing season was 5 which has improved by 50 from the closure error before adjustment with the brc method while for the 2015 16 growing season the closure error was 9 which has improved by 43 from the closure error before adjustment the energy balance closure values obtained after adjustment using brc method were 95 and 91 for 2014 15 and 2015 16 growing seasons respectively the linear regression between h le and rn g yielded a slope of 0 95 an intercept of 0 0052 wm 2 and coefficient of determination r2 0 97 for the 2014 15 growing season fig 5 a and a slope of 0 84 an intercept of 0 0156 wm 2 and r2 0 83 for the 2015 16 season fig 5b this shows that there was a good relationship between the available energy obtained with surface energy balance method and the adjusted turbulent fluxes therefore it is crucial to estimate et using corrected le values after energy balance closure assessment the adjusted energy balance closure obtained in this study 91 95 was comparable to those reported in the scientific literature parent and anctil 2012 reported energy balance closure of 79 for potato solanum tuberosum l in south eastern canada ma et al 2009 reported energy balance closure of 70 in summer and 92 in winter over a flat prairie on the northern tibetan plateau while wright et al 1992 reported excellent closure of 99 during the dry season in brazil over ranchland of prairie sporobolus cryptandrus grass numerous researchers have reported average ec energy balance closure between 70 and 99 for different vegetation surfaces falgae et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 li et al 2005 barr et al 2006 a lack of closure on the surface energy budget of 5 30 has been reported by different authors for turbulent fluxes measured using the ec system twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 aubinet et al 2002 oncley et al 2002 barr et al 2006 liu et al 2006 gao et al 2009 ma et al 2009 su et al 2009 pirvulesca 2013 stated that in reality the perfect closure is not simple to obtain which is supported by the argument of wilson et al 2002 and twine et al 2000 who reported imbalances of surface energy budget by 20 at 22 fluxnet sites this shows that there is no perfect closure for the energy balance and the lack of closure usually results in turbulent fluxes h le being less than the available energy rn g when the referred discrepancy is above 30 it is recommended that turbulent flux measurements obtained with the ec system be adjusted in order to improve the energy balance closure wilson et al 2002 twine et al 2000 3 5 evapotranspiration daily et of sweet potato varied from 0 5 mm during rainy days to 5 5 mm during clear sunny days for the 2014 15 growing season and 0 9 5 1 mm for the 2015 16 growing season daily eto varied between 2 3 mm cloudy days and 7 mm sunny days during the 2014 15 growing season and between 0 8 mm cloudy days and 6 9 mm sunny days during the 2015 16 growing season fig 6 a and d during initial growing stage january and towards the end may of both growing seasons the daily et was lower than eto because of lower lai values which resulted in less par intercepted by the crop the main reasons for the low et estimates at the beginning of the season were due to a still developing canopy cover while at the end of the season it was the result of crop maturity and leaf senescence which led to low par interception the et estimates increased from january to march as the canopy developed and there was a close match between et and eto values around march to april when the lai reached its maximum fig 6a and d while the cumulative eto steadily increased from the beginning until the end of the season the et only followed similar pattern until mid april thereafter the cumulative seasonal et remained fairly constant as a result of decreased et due to crop reaching maturity and leaf senescence fig 6b and e the cumulative eto was generally higher than et during both experimental seasons which is also evident in fig 6c and f furthermore it was observed that et during the 2014 15 growing season was higher than during the 2015 16 growing season which could be due to the presence of higher canopy growth in 2014 15 season as compared to the subsequent season although the total amount of water supplied to the crop was the opposite therefore water supply in abundance does not guarantee greater crop development as the yield during the 2014 15 season 32 t ha 1 was higher than during the 2015 16 season 29 t ha 1 this is particularly true in so called drought tolerant crops like sweet potato for both seasons seasonal eto 521 535 mm was higher than measured et 344 361 mm the et values reported in this study are lower than those reported for ofsp sweet potato cultivar bophelo growing under irrigated conditions in semi arid regions of south african using a soil water balance method 478 658 mm masango 2014 nyathi et al 2019 studies conducted in other parts of africa such as mozambique and kenya using a similar measurement procedure have also reported higher sweet potato et ranging between 350 and 850 mm gomes and carr 2003 karanja 2006 when determining crop et using the soil water balance method components such as runoff deep percolation subsurface flow and water brought by capillary rise are often ignored which frequently result in overestimation of the crop et goldhamer et al 1993 rana and katerji 2000 the dissimilarity in water use findings may not only be due to the method employed to estimate et but also due to differences in crop and site specific characteristics kuslu et al 2010 abyaneh et al 2011 since the et of sweet potato is highly variable there is a need to identify possible procedures to predict the et of this crop under site specific conditions which is possible through the development of crop coefficients 3 6 crop coefficients daily values of crop coefficients kc for sweet potato grown under optimum management practices were determined using the fao single crop coefficient methodology allen et al 1998 for two consecutive growing seasons 2014 15 and 2015 16 from fig 7 9 it was observed that values of kc remained fairly constant for 39 days during the initial growth stage average kc of 0 46 followed by a sharp increase up to a maximum of 0 97 for 25 days during the development stage values of kc remained practically unchangeable for 25 days during the mid season stage and finally decreased to a minimum of 0 44 during the late season stage the ofsp cultivar bophelo kc values reported for a semi arid climate in this study were slightly different from those reported in the scientific literature for sub humid climates in the usa allen et al 1998 dukes et al 2012 the above mentioned studies reported sweet potato kc values of 0 20 0 40 during the initial stage 1 11 1 15 during the mid season stage and 0 65 0 71 during the late stage the differences in sweet potato kc values reported were likely related to differences in cultivars used between the measurement sites and climatic conditions three day running average kc values obtained during the 2014 15 sweet potato growing season were used to develop a heat unit time based equation eq 8 which allows adjustment of kc values to site specific semi arid climatic conditions based on gdd the calculated crop coefficient based on gdd fits a fourth degree polynomial equation with an r2 0 84 fig 10 the equation was successfully validated by comparing measured against estimated kc using cumulative gdd determined during the 2015 16 growing season with an r2 0 80 and mean absolute percent difference mapd 7 fig 11 8 k c 3 358 x 10 12 g d d 4 1 138 x 10 8 g d d 3 1 521 x 10 5 g d d 2 3 803 x 10 3 g d d 6 698 x 10 1 4 conclusion the eddy covariance system was used to estimate evapotranspiration et of sweet potato for two consecutive growing seasons in a semi arid area the actual evapotranspiration et was then used in combination with reference evapotranspiration eto to determine daily weekly and time averaged crop coefficients kc of sweet potato for two consecutive growing seasons this is the first study of its kind in south africa and first on locally developed ofsp cultivar bophelo time averaged kc values of 0 47 during the initial stage 39 days 0 47 0 97 during the development stage 25 days 0 97 during mid season stage 25 days and 0 44 during late growing stage 25 days were obtained from this study for ofsp a heat unit based gdd equation was also successfully developed and validated using three day running average kc values these derived time averaged kc values can be used in the future to aid in the extrapolation of measured experimental results to different semi arid climatic conditions using the fao 56 single crop coefficient approach alternatively kc values of sweet potato can be adjusted to site specific climates using the heat unit based gdd equation developed in this study since potential et usually exceeds rainfall in semi arid regions this information will assist in improving ofsp productivity through improved irrigation scheduling in order to meet crop water requirements optimally the findings from this study will also improve water resource planning and irrigation water management of ofsp growers thereby conserving the scarce natural water resources to ensure its sustainability for agriculture and food security in south africa due to the limited information available currently on sweet potato et and kc it is recommended that more similar studies be conducted under different environmental conditions and crop management practices on a range of cultivars to test the validity of kc values estimated for site specific conditions using modelling approaches proposed in this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements we would like to acknowledge

10673,accurate quantification of crop water use or evapotranspiration et is crucial in agriculture for improved irrigation scheduling and water resource planning across a wide range of farming conditions the aim of this study was to quantify et dynamics for irrigated sweet potato ipomoea batatas in order to determine the fao type single crop coefficients kc that can be used in models to estimate crop water use under a wider range of semi arid climatic conditions an open path eddy covariance system containing energy balance sensors was installed in a 1 3 ha field to estimate et of orange fleshed sweet potato the study was conducted during the 2014 15 and 2015 16 growing seasons daily et varied between 0 5 and 5 5 mm linked closely to canopy cover and weather conditions with total seasonal measured et of 361 and 347 mm for the 2014 15 and 2015 16 seasons respectively time averaged kc values of 0 47 for the initial stage 0 97 for the mid season stage and 0 44 for the late growth stage were derived from this study in addition a heat unit based growing degree days kc equation was successfully developed and validated in this study to adjust kc values of sweet potato to specific climates these kc values can be used in combination with the fao 56 reference evapotranspiration eto to estimate site specific sweet potato et which is vital for improving water management of irrigated sweet potato cropping systems growing under semi arid conditions keywords crop coefficients eddy covariance fao 56 irrigation scheduling 1 introduction sweet potato ipomoea batatas is cultivated in more than 100 countries worldwide mostly throughout tropical and subtropical asia and africa in hot semi arid climatic regions where air temperatures are relatively high daff 2011 orange fleshed sweet potato ofsp is commonly grown for its edible storage roots which contain high levels of β carotene iron fe and zinc zn according to the latest statistics the area under sweet potato production in south africa is approximately 2000 3500 ha daff 2015 although white fleshed sweet potato wfsp is the most produced cultivar due to its ability to attain higher marketable yields its β carotene level the major precursor of vitamin a is significantly lower compared to ofsp cultivars motsa et al 2015 low et al 2017 as a result ofsp is becoming increasingly popular in a number of countries worldwide including south africa especially amongst the smallholder farmers in rural areas as its consumption can play an important role towards improving human diet and alleviating malnutrition burri 2011 tanumihardjo et al 2017 sweet potato is planted mainly in the rainy season and is considered as a drought tolerant crop motsa et al 2015 several studies have investigated the water use or evapotranspiration et of sweet potato using a simple soil water balance method gomes and carr 2003 laurie et al 2009 beletse et al 2011 jovanovic and israel 2012 laurie et al 2012 lewthwaite and triggs 2012 beletse 2013 masango 2014 prabawardani and suparno 2015 nyathi et al 2016 when determining crop et using the soil water balance method components such as runoff deep percolation subsurface flow and water brought by capillary rise are often ignored goldhamer et al 1993 rana and katerji 2000 ignoring such components can result in inaccurate estimations of the crop et rana and katerji 2000 according to the above mentioned studies the et rates of both wfsp and ofsp were widely variable affected by several factors including weather conditions and crop management practices as a result more site specific estimations of sweet potato et and crop coefficients are crucial for the estimation of water use of the crop under semi arid climatic conditions according to jovanovic and annandale 1999 often the most accurate way of estimating et is achieved through direct physical measurements such as energy flux measurements using an eddy covariance system therefore quantifying sweet potato water use directly using such a system under optimal crop management conditions will contribute useful information on the water requirements and irrigation water management of this crop since the sweet potato et measurements are highly variable estimates from the eddy covariance system can be used to determine crop coefficients kc the eddy covariance estimates will enable the extrapolation of site specific measurements to various climates using modelling approaches such as the fao 56 single crop coefficient and heat unit based growing degree days allen et al 1998 this will assist in improving water resource planning and irrigation water management of sweet potato production across a wide range of climatic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and agronomic practices the study was conducted at the roodeplaat experimental farm of the agricultural research council vegetable and ornamental plants arc vop 25 35 n 28 21 e 1164 m above sea level masl

10 5 at planting and lan 28 and kcl 50 for top dressing the trial size was 130 m 100 m 13 000 m2 in both growing seasons the trial was planted with cuttings of ofsp cultivar bophelo planting was done on the 12th of january during the 2014 15 season and 11th of january during the 2015 16 season the cultivar bophelo was chosen due to its superior nutritional value and linked potential in alleviating malnutrition the cultivar is also becoming popular among south african farmers in both seasons 0 3 m ofsp cuttings were manually planted at a planting density of 35 507 plants ha 1 on ridges which were 1 4 m apart for each ridge two rows of plants were planted at a spacing of 0 4 m between plants dragline sprinklers were used to irrigate the trial at a flow rate of 15 litres per hour neutron probe access tubes as well as chameleon moisture sensors stirzaker et al 2017 were installed at six different positions in the field for irrigation scheduling monitoring plant available water paw was determined using the following equation allen et al 1998 1 paw fc pwp rd where paw is plant available water mm fc is field capacity m3 m 3 pwp is permanent wilting point m3 m 3 and rd is rooting depth mm a volume of 20 mm of irrigation was applied immediately after the cuttings were planted and subsequently the crop was irrigated once a week to fc to ensure that more than 50 of paw was never depleted weeds were controlled manually between rows and ridges until the ground was fully covered by the crop canopy the crop was grown under water and nutrient non limiting conditions and kept free of pests and diseases during both experimental seasons 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 eddy covariance system setup and data recording the ec 150 campbell scientific inc logan utah usa was used to estimate et directly and indirectly using the shortened energy balance equation three dimensional wind velocity and temperature fluctuations were measured using a csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc logan utah usa water vapour concentration was measured using a fast response ec 150 co2 h2o open path gas analyser campbell scientific inc logan utah usa as part of the ec system all ec data were logged at 30 min intervals with subsequent storage in a cr5000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa additional sensors including an nr lite net radiometer kipp and zonen delft the netherlands thermocouples a time domain reflectometer tdr and soil heat flux plates were used for measuring the remaining components of the energy balance in order to complete the energy balance equation all sensors were installed at a height of 1 3 m above the 0 1 0 5 m canopy height on a tower which was situated around the middle of the plot but closer to the one end where the prevailing wind dominates this was done to obtain enough fetch for the ec measurements in order to improve the energy balance closure four soil heat flux plates hft s rebs seattle wa were installed at the depth of 0 08 m below the soil surface and thermocouple soil temperature averaging probes were installed at the depths of 0 02 and 0 06 m to measure the heat stored above soil heat flux plates volumetric soil water content for the top 0 20 m soil was measured using two cs616 probes the ec system estimates sensible heat fluxes h based on measurements of the turbulent boundary layer above the canopy rana and katerji 2000 the air flow is assumed to be made up of a large number of eddies each having three dimensional components horizontal and vertical burba and anderson 2010 the sensors measured the water content of the air the vertical component of wind speed and air temperature at 10 hz the data was averaged every 30 min nagler et al 2005 the ec flux measurements allow et to be calculated directly whereas additional instruments allow the surface energy balance to be calculated indirectly as indicated in eq 2 twine et al 2000 nagler et al 2005 these measurements were conducted throughout the entire experimental period to check the validity of et measurements in order to assess the energy balance closure using the bowen ratio method as described by twine et al 2000 and ezzahar et al 2009 2 rn g le h wherern is the net radiation measured above the canopy using a net radiometer g is soil heat flux measured using soil heat flux plates le is latent energy flux evaporation multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization which was measured using an open path gas analyzer h is sensible heat flux measured using a sonic temperature sensor 2 2 2 monitoring of crop growth during both growing seasons fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation fipar and leaf area index lai were measured non destructively using a decagon sunfleck ceptometer decagon pullman washington usa in order to monitor canopy development and the relationship between canopy development and et biweekly readings were taken above and below the canopy of a selected sampling area of 0 16 m2 this was done under clear sky days between 12 00 14 00 pm leaf area index lai m2 m 2 was also determined through destructive measurements using an lai 3100 belt driven meter li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa to measure total leaf area m2 this was done monthly to confirm the non destructive measurements of lai the following equation was used to calculate lai watson 1947 3 l a i m e a s u r e d t o t a l l e a f a r e a s a m p l e d g r o u n d a r e a fractional interception fi was calculated using the equation below jovanovic and annandale 1998 4 f i 100 1 i o i t whereio is the measured photosynthetic active radiation μmol m 2 s 1 on the surface of the ground and it is the radiant flux density on top of the canopy μmol m 2 s 1 plant growth fresh mass and dry matter was measured at three week intervals throughout the growing season and was done by sampling the above ground and harvestable storage root plant material of six plants from each sampling area samples were separated into stems leaves and storage roots for fresh mass determination the different samples were then oven dried at 70 c to a constant mass for dry matter determination 2 2 3 daily crop evapotranspiration daily et mm day 1 was calculated from data measured using the ec system following eq 4 5 e t m m d a y 1 86400 l e λ ρ w where le w m 2 is latent heat fluxes measured using the ec system which was averaged over 24 h to obtain daily et λ the specific latent heat of vaporization of water per unit mass 2454 000 j kg 1 and ρw kg m 3 is the density of water the factor 86 400 converts from seconds to days 2 2 4 determining the surface energy balance closure and ec data processing surface energy balance closure for the ec system measurements was determined for the two growing seasons of sweet potato at the half hourly time scale using eq 2 estimates of the turbulent fluxes le h from the ec system were subsequently compared to estimates of the available energy rn g using the energy balance method in order to determine the energy balance closure using the bowen ratio method twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 nagler et al 2005 this method assumes that rn g was correctly measured by the ec system so that both values of h le could be increased according to the ratio of h and le in order to balance eq 2 as described by fitzjarrald and moore 1994 blanken et al 1997 and twine et al 2000 the adjustment was done by computing the difference between le h and rn g flux values measured at the same time and divide the product by two then the final value was used to compensate values of le h blanken et al 1997 twine et al 2000 cleverly et al 2002 hipps et al 2002 scott et al 2004 nagler et al 2005 the surface energy balance closure was analysed by plotting the sum between h le turbulent fluxes against the rn g available energy using good quality data for 20 days during the 2014 15 growing season 2 8 3 and 7 days during initial development mid season and late growth stages respectively and 11 days during the 2015 16 growing season 2 3 4 and 2 days during initial development mid season and late growth stages respectively stannard et al 1994 stated that if all components of energy balance are measured with accuracy independently and sum to zero it shows that the ec measurements are good and the energy balance equation is satisfied in such a case the linear equation of h le against rn g should have a slope close to one and an intercept close to zero 2 2 5 crop coefficient daily weekly and time average crop coefficients kc for sweet potato grown under optimum management conditions were determined for two consecutive growing seasons using the fao single crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 6 k c e t e t o where eto is reference evapotranspiration mm eto was calculated according to the fao penman monteith equation using daily weather data measured at the study site allen et al 1998 7 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t is air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height in m s 1 es is saturation vapour pressure kpa ea is actual vapour pressure kpa and δ is the slope of the vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 in order to adjust the determined crop coefficients for sweet potato to site specific climatic conditions a heat unit based growing degree days gdd equation was developed using measured data during the 2014 15 growing season gdds were calculated using a base temperature of 15 5 c and with no cut off temperatures as suggested by wees et al 2016 the equation developed using gdds was subsequently validated using an independent growing season of measurements 2 2 6 soil water content rainfall and irrigation soil water content was measured using a neutron probe water meter model 503dr cpn hydroprobe campbell pacific nuclear inc california usa that measures volumetric water content θ for irrigation scheduling pre calibrated on site five neutron probe access tubes were installed in the field to a depth of 1 0 m soil water content was measured at 0 2 m increments by lowering the probe through the access tubes once a week to determine the water depletion level prior to irrigation chameleon soil moisture sensors were also installed at depths of 0 15 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 m to monitor soil water tension two to three times a week in order to check whether the crop was optimally irrigated when changes in soil water content could not be monitored using a neutron probe stirzaker et al 2017 these sensors give outputs in three different colours which correspond to varying ranges of soil water tension measured namely blue wet soil 25 kpa green moist 25 50 kpa and red dry soil 50 kpa for the period when chameleon sensors were used irrigation was scheduled based on the established relationship between soil water tension obtained with chameleon sensors and volumetric soil water content obtained with a neutron probe at the study site rainfall was recorded with te 525 tipping bucket rain gauges texas electronics inc dallas tx usa which was connected to a cr10x campbell scientific utah usa data logger the actual irrigation applied was measured using manual rain gauges which were positioned at various points in the field to account for the variability in sprinkler irrigation uniformity 2 2 7 weather data weather data daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and relative humidity total daily solar radiation wind speed and direction were obtained from an automatic weather station campbell scientific inc logan utah usa which was located about 500 m from the trial site in roodeplaat pretoria 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather data variability generally weather variables maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall during the 2014 15 growing season were lower than the subsequent season 2015 16 as illustrated in table 2 temperatures during both growing seasons were favorable for sweet potato growth rainfall during the 2015 16 growing season was higher than during the 2014 15 growing season but not well distributed with most of the rain being received in march long term average rainfall was higher when compared to both growing seasons the average long term reference evapotranspiration eto was lower than the actual eto for the two growing seasons table 2 3 2 profile soil water content the seasonal change in soil water content in response to rainfall received and irrigation applied during the 2014 15 growing season is shown in fig 1 for the 2015 16 season changes in soil water tension as affected by rainfall and irrigation events are shown in table 3 and fig 2 the total applied irrigation water and rainfall received during the 2014 15 season 481 mm was lower but better distributed than during the 2015 16 season 585 mm which contributed to an adequate profile soil water content between 90 and 100 of field capacity as a result the crop was likely grown under non limited soil water conditions throughout the experimental period 3 3 leaf area index and fractional interception of photosynthetic active radiation the lai fig 3 and fi fig 4 recorded during both growing seasons followed similar trends when related to changes in growing degree days gdd the values increased from the early to mid season growth stage but decreased in the late growth stage dropping quickly after the crop reached maturity the sharp decrease of lai during the late growth stage was due to the fact that the crop reached maturity which was accompanied by senescence of leaves van den berg et al 2004v nedunchezhiyan et al 2012 the lai and fi in the 2014 15 season reached slightly higher values than the lai and fi in the 2015 16 season and as a result higher par was intercepted during the 2014 15 growing season these measurements were conducted to assess whether the et measured using ec system increased with canopy development the lai reported in this study was within the lai ranges reported in the scientific literature shibayama and akita 2002 masango 2014 the maximum lais observed were 2 4 and 2 6 m2 m 2 this was in agreement with shibayama and akita 2002 and masango 2014 who reported maximum lais of 2 7 and 3 0 m2 m 2 for sweet potato respectively bourke 1982 reported that storage root dry matter accumulation is determined by the period that the crop leaves are green where high par will be intercepted in this study the crop was actively growing from the planting date on the 11th of january until mid april for both growing seasons for 95 days after planting until the crop accumulated approximately 650 gdd where lai values increased until 2 6 m2 m 2 during the 2014 15 season and 2 4 m2 m 2 during the 2015 16 season it is not surprising that the difference in maximum attained lai during the two growing seasons of measurements was quite small as the crop reaches full cover and closed canopy crop during this period of growth following the same trend of lai increment fi also increased during both growing seasons to a maximum of 97 99 then it decreased until the end of the growing season due to crop reaching maturity and senescence of leaves 117 days after planting accumulating a total of 730 750 gdd in this study it was observed that the fi directly depended on canopy architecture and the density of canopy foliage flenet et al 1996 pilau and angelocci 2015 3 4 energy balance closure an energy imbalance between h le and rn g was observed during both growing seasons during the 2014 15 growing season the energy balance closure error was 45 while during the 2015 16 growing season the energy balance closure error was 48 in this study the twine et al 2000 method was followed which suggests forcing closure is justified when the available energy is known and errors in its measurement are modest as a result the le and h heat fluxes were scaled to force closure while conserving the measured bowen ratio therefore the bowen ratio closure brc method was used to improve h le by adding to h le fluxes twine et al 2000 stated that for their study le h measured using the ec system were most often less than rn g typically ranging from 5 30 which simply means that turbulent fluxes measured with the ec system are mainly underestimated the reasons that caused energy imbalance between h le and rn g in our study could be due to errors in ec measurement which may have been caused by dirt on the sonic transducers noise in the measurement system paw et al 2000 baldocchi and mayers 1991 scott et al 2003 papale et al 2006 in addition lack of steady state conditions consumption of net radiation by photosynthesis neglected energy sinks heat storage in the top soil mismatch in footprint and malfunctions of sensors during rainfall conditions might have also contributed to an increased closure error ezzahar et al 2009 teixeira and bastiaanssen 2010 finnigan et al 2003 also suggest that the averaging time of generally 30 min used to calculate covariances could be inadequate for assessing turbulent fluxes the energy balance closure in this study was again assessed by comparing the discrepancy between rn g and h le after adjustment using the brc method and the closure error during the 2014 15 growing season was 5 which has improved by 50 from the closure error before adjustment with the brc method while for the 2015 16 growing season the closure error was 9 which has improved by 43 from the closure error before adjustment the energy balance closure values obtained after adjustment using brc method were 95 and 91 for 2014 15 and 2015 16 growing seasons respectively the linear regression between h le and rn g yielded a slope of 0 95 an intercept of 0 0052 wm 2 and coefficient of determination r2 0 97 for the 2014 15 growing season fig 5 a and a slope of 0 84 an intercept of 0 0156 wm 2 and r2 0 83 for the 2015 16 season fig 5b this shows that there was a good relationship between the available energy obtained with surface energy balance method and the adjusted turbulent fluxes therefore it is crucial to estimate et using corrected le values after energy balance closure assessment the adjusted energy balance closure obtained in this study 91 95 was comparable to those reported in the scientific literature parent and anctil 2012 reported energy balance closure of 79 for potato solanum tuberosum l in south eastern canada ma et al 2009 reported energy balance closure of 70 in summer and 92 in winter over a flat prairie on the northern tibetan plateau while wright et al 1992 reported excellent closure of 99 during the dry season in brazil over ranchland of prairie sporobolus cryptandrus grass numerous researchers have reported average ec energy balance closure between 70 and 99 for different vegetation surfaces falgae et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 li et al 2005 barr et al 2006 a lack of closure on the surface energy budget of 5 30 has been reported by different authors for turbulent fluxes measured using the ec system twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 aubinet et al 2002 oncley et al 2002 barr et al 2006 liu et al 2006 gao et al 2009 ma et al 2009 su et al 2009 pirvulesca 2013 stated that in reality the perfect closure is not simple to obtain which is supported by the argument of wilson et al 2002 and twine et al 2000 who reported imbalances of surface energy budget by 20 at 22 fluxnet sites this shows that there is no perfect closure for the energy balance and the lack of closure usually results in turbulent fluxes h le being less than the available energy rn g when the referred discrepancy is above 30 it is recommended that turbulent flux measurements obtained with the ec system be adjusted in order to improve the energy balance closure wilson et al 2002 twine et al 2000 3 5 evapotranspiration daily et of sweet potato varied from 0 5 mm during rainy days to 5 5 mm during clear sunny days for the 2014 15 growing season and 0 9 5 1 mm for the 2015 16 growing season daily eto varied between 2 3 mm cloudy days and 7 mm sunny days during the 2014 15 growing season and between 0 8 mm cloudy days and 6 9 mm sunny days during the 2015 16 growing season fig 6 a and d during initial growing stage january and towards the end may of both growing seasons the daily et was lower than eto because of lower lai values which resulted in less par intercepted by the crop the main reasons for the low et estimates at the beginning of the season were due to a still developing canopy cover while at the end of the season it was the result of crop maturity and leaf senescence which led to low par interception the et estimates increased from january to march as the canopy developed and there was a close match between et and eto values around march to april when the lai reached its maximum fig 6a and d while the cumulative eto steadily increased from the beginning until the end of the season the et only followed similar pattern until mid april thereafter the cumulative seasonal et remained fairly constant as a result of decreased et due to crop reaching maturity and leaf senescence fig 6b and e the cumulative eto was generally higher than et during both experimental seasons which is also evident in fig 6c and f furthermore it was observed that et during the 2014 15 growing season was higher than during the 2015 16 growing season which could be due to the presence of higher canopy growth in 2014 15 season as compared to the subsequent season although the total amount of water supplied to the crop was the opposite therefore water supply in abundance does not guarantee greater crop development as the yield during the 2014 15 season 32 t ha 1 was higher than during the 2015 16 season 29 t ha 1 this is particularly true in so called drought tolerant crops like sweet potato for both seasons seasonal eto 521 535 mm was higher than measured et 344 361 mm the et values reported in this study are lower than those reported for ofsp sweet potato cultivar bophelo growing under irrigated conditions in semi arid regions of south african using a soil water balance method 478 658 mm masango 2014 nyathi et al 2019 studies conducted in other parts of africa such as mozambique and kenya using a similar measurement procedure have also reported higher sweet potato et ranging between 350 and 850 mm gomes and carr 2003 karanja 2006 when determining crop et using the soil water balance method components such as runoff deep percolation subsurface flow and water brought by capillary rise are often ignored which frequently result in overestimation of the crop et goldhamer et al 1993 rana and katerji 2000 the dissimilarity in water use findings may not only be due to the method employed to estimate et but also due to differences in crop and site specific characteristics kuslu et al 2010 abyaneh et al 2011 since the et of sweet potato is highly variable there is a need to identify possible procedures to predict the et of this crop under site specific conditions which is possible through the development of crop coefficients 3 6 crop coefficients daily values of crop coefficients kc for sweet potato grown under optimum management practices were determined using the fao single crop coefficient methodology allen et al 1998 for two consecutive growing seasons 2014 15 and 2015 16 from fig 7 9 it was observed that values of kc remained fairly constant for 39 days during the initial growth stage average kc of 0 46 followed by a sharp increase up to a maximum of 0 97 for 25 days during the development stage values of kc remained practically unchangeable for 25 days during the mid season stage and finally decreased to a minimum of 0 44 during the late season stage the ofsp cultivar bophelo kc values reported for a semi arid climate in this study were slightly different from those reported in the scientific literature for sub humid climates in the usa allen et al 1998 dukes et al 2012 the above mentioned studies reported sweet potato kc values of 0 20 0 40 during the initial stage 1 11 1 15 during the mid season stage and 0 65 0 71 during the late stage the differences in sweet potato kc values reported were likely related to differences in cultivars used between the measurement sites and climatic conditions three day running average kc values obtained during the 2014 15 sweet potato growing season were used to develop a heat unit time based equation eq 8 which allows adjustment of kc values to site specific semi arid climatic conditions based on gdd the calculated crop coefficient based on gdd fits a fourth degree polynomial equation with an r2 0 84 fig 10 the equation was successfully validated by comparing measured against estimated kc using cumulative gdd determined during the 2015 16 growing season with an r2 0 80 and mean absolute percent difference mapd 7 fig 11 8 k c 3 358 x 10 12 g d d 4 1 138 x 10 8 g d d 3 1 521 x 10 5 g d d 2 3 803 x 10 3 g d d 6 698 x 10 1 4 conclusion the eddy covariance system was used to estimate evapotranspiration et of sweet potato for two consecutive growing seasons in a semi arid area the actual evapotranspiration et was then used in combination with reference evapotranspiration eto to determine daily weekly and time averaged crop coefficients kc of sweet potato for two consecutive growing seasons this is the first study of its kind in south africa and first on locally developed ofsp cultivar bophelo time averaged kc values of 0 47 during the initial stage 39 days 0 47 0 97 during the development stage 25 days 0 97 during mid season stage 25 days and 0 44 during late growing stage 25 days were obtained from this study for ofsp a heat unit based gdd equation was also successfully developed and validated using three day running average kc values these derived time averaged kc values can be used in the future to aid in the extrapolation of measured experimental results to different semi arid climatic conditions using the fao 56 single crop coefficient approach alternatively kc values of sweet potato can be adjusted to site specific climates using the heat unit based gdd equation developed in this study since potential et usually exceeds rainfall in semi arid regions this information will assist in improving ofsp productivity through improved irrigation scheduling in order to meet crop water requirements optimally the findings from this study will also improve water resource planning and irrigation water management of ofsp growers thereby conserving the scarce natural water resources to ensure its sustainability for agriculture and food security in south africa due to the limited information available currently on sweet potato et and kc it is recommended that more similar studies be conducted under different environmental conditions and crop management practices on a range of cultivars to test the validity of kc values estimated for site specific conditions using modelling approaches proposed in this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements we would like to acknowledge the agricultural research council professional development programme the department of rural development and land reform as well as the national research foundation of south africa for funding this study our gratitude is extended to dr yacob beletse for initiating this research 
10674,the fao 56 crop coefficient kc approach is widely used for making irrigation decisions allen and pereira 2009 extended this approach by developing a method for estimating kc using a density coefficient kd which is estimated from the fraction of ground covered by vegetation and plant height in this study we evaluated this method using detailed measurements of transpiration t evapotranspiration et soil attributes weather and tree physiological variables in 12 apple malus domestica borkh orchards in the western cape province of south africa mid summer canopy cover of the orchards was less than 20 in young non bearing and exceeded 60 in mature full bearing orchards data were collected over three growing seasons october 2014 to may 2017 in orchards planted to the golden delicious reinders cripps pink cripps red and rosy glow apple cultivars the original allen and pereira a p method significantly overestimated the basal crop coefficients kcb by on average 47 in mature and 103 in young orchards respectively however improved kcb estimates were obtained by adjusting the ratio of the resistances i e rl 100 in the a p method where rl is the mean leaf resistance and 100 s m is the typical resistance for annual crops we defined a resistance parameter α for apple orchards which is equivalent to the bulk canopy resistance of a well watered tree replacing rl 100 with rl α and using the measured mean rl and other biophysical measurements to solve the a p equation for α gave a value 37 s m the improved kcb values were used to derive the orchard kc taking into account the contribution of cover crops whose transpiration was measured using miniature stem heat balance sap flow gauges the seasonal total transpiration t estimated as t kcb x eto where eto is the reference et closely matched the measured values with a rmse root of the mean square error of 16 mm therefore using the mean canopy resistance which is representative of apple trees in the a p method has the potential to accurately predict both the crop coefficients and water use of apple orchards from planting until full bearing age keywords basal crop coefficient canopy cover evapotranspiration leaf resistance 1 introduction water is a scarce resource in major fruit producing countries such as italy south africa spain morocco etc where most fruits are grown under irrigation in south africa for example irrigated agriculture uses approximately 62 of the surface water resources and yet between 30 and 45 of this water is wasted mainly due to poor irrigation practices and leakages nwrs 2 2013 inefficient irrigation practices increasing economic activities and changing climatic conditions all contribute to increasing water scarcity girona et al 2011 marsal et al 2013 dzikiti et al 2018a so water saving technologies and sound water management strategies particularly irrigation scheduling are required to ensure the long term sustainability and growth of the fruit industry volschenk et al 2003 girona et al 2011 several methods have been developed over the years to improve irrigation scheduling in orchards in order to increase the crop water productivity these include soil based approaches whereby soil water content sensors are used to monitor the water status in the root zone and beyond sui and vories 2018 volschenk 2017 while this approach is fairly widely used it has several drawbacks these include the need for detailed and expensive monitoring networks lack of broad spatial representativeness across soil and orchard characteristics and uncertainties in water movement in the soil profile plant based irrigation scheduling methods use the plant as a biosensor which integrates the soil and atmospheric conditions as well as the plant s physiological response to water deficit dzikiti et al 2010 fernández 2017 a comprehensive review of the advantages and disadvantages of the plant based irrigation scheduling methods was given by jones 2004 the fao 56 approach described by allen et al 1998 is the most widely used climate based crop water requirement estimation method due to its simplicity and robustness in this approach crop evapotranspiration et is estimated as the product of the reference evapotranspiration eto and a crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 tabulated typical kc values for a range of irrigated crops several studies have compared the results obtained using the fao 56 method with actual evapotranspiration measured using various techniques marin et al 2016 allen 2000 gupta et al 2017 zanotelli et al 2019 paço et al 2006 the results demonstrate the need to adjust the tabulated crop coefficients to specific growing conditions in an attempt to make the crop coefficients transferrable to different sites and climatic regions allen and pereira 2009 used readily available data to estimate the crop coefficients and this method is referred hereafter as the a p method allen and pereira 2009 found that both the kc and the basal crop coefficient kcb can be determined using the fraction of ground covered by the vegetation crop height and the degree of stomatal regulation under wet soil conditions however other studies have shown mixed performances of the a p method relative to the measured crop water consumption for example paço et al 2019 found a good agreement between the a p kcb values and those measured using sap flow sensors in an olive orchard in portugal in another study by taylor et al 2015 in three citrus orchards the a p method overestimated the sap flow derived kcb by up to 127 under sub tropical and mediterranean type growing conditions in south africa in this study we evaluated the a p method using detailed field data collected in 12 apple orchards with varying canopy cover ranging from young non bearing to mature high yielding orchards in the western cape province of south africa the specific objectives were 1 to evaluate the performance of the a p method using actual measured field data over a range of fractional canopy cover apple cultivars and microclimates 2 to investigate and document sources of uncertainty in the a p method and to propose improvements and 3 to extensively validate the improved a p method to estimate the water use rates of apple orchards under mediterranean climatic conditions in addition for the first time we incorporate detailed measurements of cover crop transpiration into the a p method to produce accurate crop coefficients for micro sprinkler irrigated apple orchards with substantial cover crops growing between the tree rows the hypothesis is that by parameterizing the a p method for specific crop types one can refine kcb and kc and get accurate estimates of crop water requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field data were collected in 12 apple orchards over three growing seasons i e 2014 15 2015 16 and 2016 17 in two prime apple producing regions in the western cape province of south africa fig 1 these regions are the koue bokkeveld kbv located about 150 km to the northeast of the city of cape town and the elgin grabouw vyeboom villiersdorp egvv which is about 70 km southeast of cape town both regions have a mediterranean type climate more than 50 of the rain falls during the winter months from may to august a typical growing season for apples in these regions extends from september october to april depending on the cultivar the two production regions have somewhat different microclimates the egvv region has milder summers and winters due to proximity to the indian ocean to the south the inland kbv region on the other hand has very cold winters with occasional snowfall in high lying areas and hot summers during the 2014 15 season data were collected in four orchards in kbv comprising two mature high yielding 74 110 t ha orchards with a high effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation of about 0 64 one orchard was planted to golden delicious apple trees which is the most widely planted cultivar in south africa the second mature orchard was planted to cripps pink apple trees which is a high value cultivar but with a long growing season the other two orchards had young less than 3 yr old non bearing trees of the golden delicious reinders and rosy glow cultivars detailed information about the orchards is summarized in table 1 the average effective fraction of vegetation cover in the young orchards was less than 0 20 during the mid summer period when canopy cover was at the maximum during 2015 16 data were collected in four orchards in egvv with similar attributes to those in kbv yields of 100 109 t ha these included mature golden delicious and cripps pink blocks while the non bearing orchards were planted to the golden delicious reinders and cripps red cultivars table 1 in 2016 17 measurements were taken in two orchards in each production region with medium fractional canopy cover ranging from 0 26 to 0 37 table 1 the orchards were planted to cripps pink and golden delicious reinders trees respectively with yields ranging between 18 and 61 t ha soil texture was predominantly sandy to sandy loam in both regions except for the high and medium cover cripps pink in egvv which had dark red clayey loam soils of the kroonstad soil form ochric planosol according to the soil classification working group 1991 soil physical and chemical analyses for the 12 orchards were done at a commercial laboratory bemlab pty ltd south africa table 2 summarizes the physical properties of the soils for all the orchards 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 transpiration and irrigation measurements tree transpiration on medium and high canopy cover orchards was measured during the apple growing season october to may on between three and six trees of different stem sizes using the heat ratio method of monitoring sap flow burgess et al 2001 four probes were inserted to four different depths in trunks of the selected trees to capture the radial variation in sap velocity wullschleger and king 2000 each probe set consisted of two t type thermocouples placed equidistantly 0 5 cm upstream and downstream of a stainless steel heater probe heat pulse velocities were measured and logged hourly using data loggers model cr1000 campbell sci inc logan ut usa connected to multiplexers model am16 32b campbell sci inc logan ut usa the heat pulse velocity signals were converted to sap flow volumes per tree taking into account wound sizes wood moisture fraction and wood density according to the procedure described by swanson and whitfield 1981 the size of the conducting sapwood area was determined by injecting methylene blue dye into the stems to establish the extent of the active xylem vessels transpiration by the smaller trees in the young non bearing orchards was measured using granier probes tdp 10 dynamax inc houston usa granier 1987 three healthy and actively growing trees were instrumented per orchard the sensors were installed at a height between 50 and 75 cm from the ground to eliminate errors due to the cold sap especially in the morning a reflective aluminium foil was wrapped around the probes to minimize the effects of exogenous heating on the sap temperature signals data were collected at a scan rate of 10 s and hourly averages of sap velocity were recorded all orchards were irrigated using micro sprinkler systems with one sprinkler per tree delivering between 30 and 32 litres of water per hour irrigation frequency ranged from two to three times per week with each event lasting for one to two hours early in the season the irrigation frequency increased to daily or several times a day during hot summer months water flow meters model arad multi jet water meter germiston south africa with a resolution of 10 l pulse were installed on the irrigation line to monitor the irrigation volumes 2 2 2 evapotranspiration and physiological measurements actual evapotranspiration from the orchards was measured using two open path eddy covariance systems at selected intervals during the growing season as summarised in table 3 continuous measurement of et throughout the study period was not possible because of the equipment limitations the eddy covariance systems comprised of sonic anemometers model csat3 campbell sci inc utah usa and infrared gas analysers irga model li 7500a li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa installed at heights ranging from 1 2 to 1 8 m above the mean canopy height depending on the size of the orchard which varied from 3 8 7 0 ha the flux towers were located downstream of the prevailing wind direction to maximize the fetch other sensors to quantify the orchard energy balance included the single component net radiometers model cnr1 kipp zonen delft the netherlands soil heat flux plates model hukse flux campbell sci inc utah usa installed at about 8 cm depth cs616 soil moisture probes and soil averaging thermocouples installed at 2 and 6 cm depths from the surface to correct the measured fluxes for the energy stored by the soil above the plates the signals were sampled at a frequency of 10 hz and the outputs were averaged at 30 min intervals using cr3000 and cr5000 data loggers campbell sci inc utah usa the high frequency data were processed using the eddypro v 6 2 0 software li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa to correct the data for the lack of sensor levelness sensor time lags fluctuations in the air density among others the data were further corrected for lack of energy balance closure using the bowen ratio approach as described by twine et al 2000 orchard leaf area index lai m2 of leaf area per m2 of ground area was measured at monthly intervals in the 12 orchards using a leaf area meter model lai 2000 li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa these data were collected on overcast days or just before sunset when the leaves approximated black bodies the fraction of the ground surface covered by vegetation at midday fc was estimated from the lai measurements using the relationship fc 1 e k lai where k is the extinction coefficient taken as equal to 0 6 impens and lemeur 1969 the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by the trees fceff was calculated from fc and other variables as described by allen and pereira 2009 and allen et al 1998 the stomatal resistance rl was measured at monthly intervals using the infrared gas analyser model li 6400 li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa data were collected on two healthy sun exposed leaves from ten tagged trees per orchard around midday from 12h00 to 14h30 the midday xylem water potential ψx was measured on the same ten trees using a pressure chamber model 615 pms instrument company albany oregon usa two healthy and fully expanded leaves per tree located close to the stem were enclosed in the morning using zip lock silver reflective stem water potential bags prune bags pms instrument company albany oregon usa to allow the leaf water potential to equilibrate with stem water potential for measurements at midday 2 2 3 weather data weather variables namely the maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind speed at 2 m height wind direction solar radiation and rainfall were monitored hourly using automatic weather stations situated close to each of the study sites the stations were installed on open spaces with uniform short grass cover the reference evapotranspiration eto for a short grass was computed according to allen et al 1998 2 3 calculation of crop coefficients 2 3 1 basal crop factors kcb according to allen et al 1998 the basal crop coefficient kcb also referred to as the transpiration crop coefficient is given by 1 k c b t e t o where t is the orchard transpiration in mm d derived from the sap flow measurements orchard level transpiration was calculated as the sum of the products of the sap flux density u and the orchard sapwood area index sai m2 of sapwood per m2 of ground area for trees in different stem diameter classes as 2 t i 1 s a i i u i where ui is the average sap flux density in a specific stem size class and each of the sap flow instrumented trees was assigned to an appropriate stem diameter class eq 1 assumes that the orchards did not suffer significant water stress this was a reasonable assumption based on the measurements of tree water status as the orchards were generally well watered sustained periods with water stress were excluded from the analysis given that kcb is dependent on the amount of vegetation and also to ensure that the basal crop coefficients are transferable between fields allen and pereira 2009 proposed a density coefficient kd which they defined as 3 k d k c b k c min k c b f u l l k c min where kcmin is the minimum basal coefficient for bare soil kcbfull is the estimated basal crop coefficient under conditions of nearly full ground cover lai 3 0 according to the a p method the density coefficient is estimated from the effective vegetation cover fceff and the mean tree height h as 4 k d min 1 m l f c e f f f c e f f 1 1 h where ml is a multiplier on fceff describing the effect of canopy density on shading we used values of ml 2 0 for mature orchards and 1 5 for orchards with low and medium canopy cover respectively in situations where kcbfull is not measured it can be estimated from 5 k c b f u l l f r min 1 0 0 1 h 1 20 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where u2 is the mean wind speed measured at 2 0 m height and rhmin is the minimum relative humidity according to allen and pereira 2009 the parameter fr which can be considered as a kcb adjustment factor through crop stomatal control and has values in the range 0 1 was estimated using the following equation 6 f r δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 r l 100 where δ is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure vs temperature curve pa ºc and γ is the psychrometric constant pa ºc rl is the mean leaf resistance for the vegetation in question s m according to the a p method values of r l for apple orchards were suggested as 140 s m for the initial and midseason periods and 370 s m at the end of the season in addition the resistance value of 100 s m in the denominator of eq 6 is the mean resistance for annual crops and this could be a source of uncertainty for perennial crops like most fruit trees using the suggested parameters on apple orchards led to significant over estimates of kcb for orchards of all age groups as will be discussed in detail in the results section consequently we replaced the 100 s m in eq 6 with a resistance parameter α which can be considered to represent the minimum unstressed canopy resistance for apple trees we then inverted eq 6 using measured values of the climatic variables the kcbfull in eq 5 derived from sap flow measurements of transpiration at the mid season stage of a mature well watered apple orchard lai 3 6 and the measured average leaf resistance rl for all the 12 orchards of about 202 s m we solved the a p equation for α and obtained a mean value of about 37 s m the micro sprinkler irrigated orchards had cover crops and weeds of varying densities between the tree rows these ranged from exotic species such as the tall fescues festuca arundinacea to various indigenous grasses such as the heart seed love grass eragrostis capensis etc to account for the cover crop transpiration the whole orchard kcb was estimated according to the a p method as 7 k c b k c b cov e r k d max k c b f u l l k c b cov e r k c b f u l l k c b cov e r 2 where kcbcover is the basal crop coefficient due to the cover crop the seasonal dynamics of the cover crop lai was monitored in at least five orchards at regular intervals throughout the season using a destructive sampling technique in this method plants in several 50 cm x 50 cm quadrants were harvested and their leaf area measured manually using a leaf area meter model li 3000 li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa estimates of cover crop transpiration tc were obtained using three to four miniature stem heat balance sap flow gauges model sga2 dynamax houston usa installed on straight portions of individual grass blades the sensors were installed during short window periods lasting a few days at a time to avoid damage by farm machinery the transpiration data to determine the maximum basal coefficient for the cover crops kcbfullc was collected in winter july 2017 when the trees were leafless and there was no shading of the cover crops if sfi is the sap flow in cm3 h of a single cover crop plant whose leaf area on the exposed part of the sap flow sensor is ai then the cover crop transpiration tc in mm h expressed over the full orchard surface was given by 8 t c i s f i a i l a i c where laic is the leaf area index of the cover crop the maximum cover crop basal crop coefficient kcbfullc was then determined using eq 9 9 k c b f u l l c t c e t o the density coefficient for the cover crops kdc was subsequently derived according to allen and pereira 2009 as 10 k d c 1 e 0 7 l a i c kcbcover was then determined by combining eqs 3 9 and 10 assuming kcmin of about 0 15 allen and pereira 2009 2 3 2 determining orchard crop coefficients kc the whole orchard kc values were determined also using the density coefficient as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 as 11 k c k s o i l k d max k c f u l l k s o i l k c f u l l k s o i l 2 where kcfull represents kc from a fully covered soil with some background evaporation and it was calculated as 12 k c f u l l max 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 k c b 0 05 ksoil in eq 11 represents the average kc from the non vegetated exposed portion of the surface and reflects the impact of wetting frequency and soil type this was determined taking into account evaporation from the wet and dry portions of the orchard floor as 13 k s o i l k e w e t k e d r y where kewet was calculated following allen et al 2005 as 14 k e w e t t e w t e w r e w exp t w e s o r e w t e w r e w t w e t o f w where tew is the total evaporable water which represents the depth of water that can be evaporated from the surface soil layer when the layer has been initially completely wetted rew represents the readily evaporable water which represents the cumulative evaporation during stage 1 drying allen et al 1998 tw is the average time between independent wetting events which was calculated to be on average 2 7 days for wetting due to irrigation eso is the potential evaporation rate from a wet soil surface as described in eq 17 and fw represents the fraction of the orchard floor that is wetted by irrigation or rain 0 1 k edry in this study was taken as a constant at 0 06 based on microlysimeter measurements of soil evaporation and also given that the study area receives very little rainfall during the fruit growing season tew was estimated as 15 t e w 1000 θ f c 0 5 θ w p z e where θfc and θwp represent the volumetric soil water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point respectively cm3 cm 3 and ze is the effective depth of soil evaporation which was taken as 0 15 m allen et al 1998 rew was calculated from soil texture data according to ritchie et al 1989 as 16 r e w 20 0 15 s a f o r s a 80 r e w 11 0 06 c c l f o r c l 50 r e w 8 0 06 c l f o r s a 80 a n d c l 50 where sa is the percentage fraction of sand in soil and cl is the percentage fraction of clay in the soil which were determined for the twelve orchards at a commercial laboratory to account for the presence of tree cover on soil evaporation eso used in eq 14 we used the expression proposed by allen et al 2005 wherein 17 e s o k c max k c b e t o where kcmax is the maximum crop coefficient for the surface under full vegetation and it is equal to kcfull eq 12 kcb is the basal crop coefficient calculated according to eq 7 3 results 3 1 water use dynamics of apple orchards with varying canopy cover there were clear differences in the water use patterns of the orchards with different canopy cover the typical seasonal dynamics of the reference evapotranspiration eto actual evapotranspiration et transpiration t and irrigation in young medium and high canopy cover orchards are shown in fig 2 a c in the young golden delicious reinders orchard fig 2a for example the measured et was lower than the eto but higher than the sap flow derived t as expected on warm days following irrigation the measured et was quite high exceeding 4 mm d due to high evaporation rates from the wet orchard floor this is clearly evident for the period october to november 2014 at this time orchard floor evaporation accounted for close to 60 of et in the young orchard fig 2a the orchard floor evaporative losses were exacerbated by the tall and dense cover crop and weeds that grew on the orchard floor at the beginning of the season september to late october however as the residual soil moisture from the winter and spring rains depleted the vegetation between the rows became patchy and less vigorous so periods of sustained water deficit e g from 08 february to 07 march 2015 resulted in the measured transpiration being of the same order of magnitude as the measured et see region marked with an oval circle in fig 2a water stress was deliberately imposed on the trees during this time by withholding irrigation in order to derive the soil water retention curve for the orchard the fact that the sap flow derived transpiration was close to the eddy covariance measured et when evaporation from the orchard floor was negligible confirms that the two techniques agreed well taylor et al 2015 reported a similar observation for mature drip irrigated citrus orchards in south africa the measured et in the medium fig 2b and the high canopy cover orchards fig 2c were comparable with the eto in most cases as expected tree transpiration contributed the most to the et of the older orchards the high et rates early in the growing season october 2014 for the mature cripps pink fig 2c were a result of transpiration by the dense cover crop and weeds and evaporation from the wet soil when tree canopy cover was still low the actual et measured ranged from 0 4 to 4 1 mm d in young orchards 1 3 5 7 mm d in the medium cover and 0 94 to around 6 6 mm d in the mature orchards the high et rates which were close to eto especially in mature orchards confirm that the orchards were well watered in most instances although periods of water stress were also observed on occasion the measured tree transpiration peaked at about 1 7 mm d for the young orchards 3 1 mm d for the medium cover orchards and 3 8 mm d for the mature cripps pink orchard the maximum contribution of evaporation from the orchard floor accounted for between 30 and 50 of et in medium cover orchards falling to between 18 and 32 in mature high canopy cover orchards 3 2 measured vs calculated basal crop coefficients the major advantage of the allen and pereira 2009 method is that the crop coefficients can be calculated from readily available information which makes the method very appealing for practical irrigation scheduling the kcb for example can be calculated from estimates of the fractional vegetation cover tree height and microclimatic data using eqs 3 7 in this way different crop coefficients for mature and young orchards are derived leading to more accurate irrigation decision making however using the parameters published by allen and pereira 2009 for apple orchards to derive the kcb values for orchards with varying canopy cover led to significant over estimates fig 3 a c illustrates typical trends of kcb for entire growing seasons for young medium and high canopy cover orchards in these examples the a p method over estimated kcb by 103 69 and 47 for the young medium and high canopy cover orchards respectively similar trends were observed for the remaining nine orchards whose data are not shown a possible source of uncertainty causing the poor fit resides in eq 6 in which the ratio of the leaf resistances is used to adjust kcb through the adjustment factor fr as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 for this reason we collected detailed data to further investigate how the tree water status and environmental factors influenced the leaf resistance of apple trees table 4 the measured stomatal resistance for the 12 apple orchards ranged from 100 to just over 500 s m the average resistance for the irrigation season november to april for all the orchards was around 202 s m an extremely high resistance of about 2 446 s m was observed once in the young rosy glow orchard when the irrigation system malfunctioned fig 4 a over the course of all the growing seasons the mean leaf resistance showed an exponentially decreasing trend with the rising midday stem water potential ψx as shown in fig 4a this confirms that the stomata opened as the tree water status increased less negative ψx using the leaf resistance measured for apple orchards and also using the value of α 37 s m derived in this study led to improved estimates of kcb for all the 12 orchards fig 5a f show examples of six orchards with different cultivars and canopy cover classes the improved a p approach predicted the kcb quite accurately for all the orchards this result suggests that using crop specific information improves the accuracy of the estimated crop coefficients derived using the a p approach this appears to be particularly the case especially for fruit trees whose physiology differs quite substantially from annual crops 3 3 estimating the orchard transpiration using improved kcb the improved basal crop coefficients were used to predict the monthly transpiration totals calculated as t kcb x eto fig 6 a c shows that the predicted transpiration was comparable with the sap flow measured values for orchards with low medium and high canopy cover a summary for all the 12 orchards is shown in table 5 in the high canopy cover cripps pink orchard the monthly transpiration was slightly underestimated in october but marginally overestimated from november to the end of the growing season fig 6a the good performance of the model was however confirmed by the statistical parameters mae 12 9 mm rmse 7 84 mm nse 0 68 and r2 0 92 nse is the nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated according to nash and sutcliffe 1970 in the medium canopy cover cripps pink and young golden delicious reinders orchards the monthly predicted transpiration was slightly underestimated throughout the growing season except for the month of may and april respectively nevertheless the model performance was still satisfactory with an mae of 5 36 and 5 07 mm rmse of 6 46 and 6 36 nse of 0 86 and 0 47 and r2 of 0 94 and 0 81 for medium canopy cover cripps pink and young golden delicious reinders orchards respectively fig 6b c 3 4 estimating orchard et using improved crop coefficients the eddy covariance energy balance closure varied with orchard canopy cover as illustrated for the young and mature orchards in fig 7 these calculations were done using hourly data collected over two to three clear days it is apparent that the closure ratio was higher for the mature 0 95 than the young 0 79 orchards these differences can be explained by among other things the more uniform vegetation cover in mature orchards while the orchard surface was more heterogeneous in young orchards the crop coefficients kc for all the orchards were fairly well predicted by the improved a p method and fig 8 a shows the data only for clear days cloudy days were excluded as these produced unrealistically high values due to the low reference evapotranspiration for the first time the contribution of the cover crop to the orchard kc is also included in this analysis as far as the authors are aware no studies have assessed the cover crop contribution in detail to the whole orchard crop coefficients the average leaf area index of the cover crops laic was about 0 24 which gave a density function kdc of 0 15 using eq 10 the daily total transpiration for a typical clear day in winter expressed over the full orchard surface was around 0 9 mm d while the reference evapotranspiration was around 4 0 mm d this gave a full cover kcb for the cover crops of about 0 225 and an average kcbcover of approx 0 034 as detailed in the methodology the maximum observed leaf area index for the cover crops was around 1 0 and following the above procedure this gave a kcbcover of about 0 08 therefore the following cover crop threshold values were used for estimating the kcb of microsprinkler irrigated apple orchards i e kcbcover 0 for bare orchard floor laic 0 1 kcbcover 0 03 for moderate density cover crop 0 1 laic 0 8 which was the most common cover type and kcbcover 0 1 for orchards with tall and density cover crops laic 0 8 the crop coefficients for the mature orchards in fig 8a tended to be high because most of the et data were collected when canopy cover had reached its maximum in summer see table 3 the larger spread of the kc values in the young orchards is a result of the high et observed early in the growing season when the orchards had dense cover crop and weeds while the atmospheric evaporative demand was still comparatively low orchard et calculated as et kc x eto where kc is the crop coefficients derived from the improved a p method closely matched the eddy covariance derived et values in fig 8b the data shown in fig 8b is for the three orchard classes i e low medium and high canopy cover for days when the eddy covariance data were collected the calculated orchard et was within 10 of the eddy covariance measured values 4 discussion the fao 56 crop coefficient approach for estimating crop water requirements under well watered conditions is a standard approach that has been widely adopted and used for irrigation management particularly irrigation scheduling girona et al 2011 volschenk 2017 gush et al 2019 however accurate estimates of crop water requirements with this method require accurate crop factors and this is the major limitation of the method as the published fao crop coefficients are not readily transferable between fields and growing regions casa et al 2000 allen 2000 lascano 2000 to address this challenge allen and pereira 2009 have advanced the original fao 56 approach by proposing a method whereby crop coefficients kcb and kc are estimated using readily available crops data such as the fraction of ground cover and crop height this method has a very high potential for improving irrigation management through improved crop coefficients given the simple inputs that are required to calculate the kc values for this reason the a p method has been the subject of research interest and several studies have evaluated its performance albeit with mixed results jiang et al 2014 paço et al 2019 taylor et al 2015 for example jiang et al 2014 applied the a p method on maize in the great plains of china they observed a close fit between the measured and calculated crop coefficients using the parameters published by allen and pereira 2009 for the maize crop observations from the present study indicate that the a p method significantly over estimates the crop coefficients for apple orchards under the mediterranean type growing conditions consistent with the conclusions by taylor et al 2015 on citrus orchards in south africa taylor et al 2015 however proposed using a variable leaf resistance term in eq 6 instead of a fixed one to improve the kcb estimates this was a logical step given that citrus trees are known to have a very strong stomatal control of leaf gas exchange cohen and cohen 1983 dzikiti et al 2011 they noted a strongly linear relationship between the leaf resistance and the reference evapotranspiration the leaf resistance for citrus had a much wider range than for apple trees varying from around 500 to close to 3 000 s m in contrast to citrus trees the rl eto relationship for apple trees was in fact non linear as shown in fig 4b these data exclude instances when the orchards were experiencing water stress the orchards were deemed to be under water stress when the midday stem water potential was lower than 2 0 mpa following dzikiti et al 2018a b with no water stress the rl eto relationship for apple trees suggests that the stomatal resistance increases sharply with the increasing atmospheric evaporative demand this trend is due to the high sensitivity of apple trees to high vapor pressure deficits of the air gush et al 2019 applying the rl eto relationship to the a p method as proposed by taylor et al 2015 also did not yield satisfactory results in this study likely because of the differences in the physiology of citrus and apple trees data not shown apple trees have a narrower range of leaf resistance 100 515 s m than citrus which lead to a higher fr ratio causing high kcb values in another study but on olive trees in portugal paço et al 2019 also observed inconsistencies between the a p crop factors and those determined from eddy covariance measurements they also adjusted the fr ratio but by trial and error to obtain accurate crop factors which also agreed with the simulations by the simdualkc model paço et al 2014 our study however provides a possible procedure for adjusting the fr term objectively based on the physiology of the crop without resorting to trial and error the fact that jiang et al 2014 obtained satisfactory results on an annual crop maize using the a p parameters as published yet applications on three different perennial crops citrus olive and apples required adjustments for stomatal sensitivity suggests that there is need to differentiate between annual and perennial crops in the a p approach here we demonstrate that using the rl for apple trees and replacing the leaf resistance of an annual crop 100 s m with the canopy resistance of well watered apple trees gave accurate results for 12 orchards comprising different cultivars and canopy cover fractions this observation is to some extent expected given the differences in the hydraulic properties of tree crops and annual crops which are dominated by non woody species e g maize wheat etc findings in this study support the use of an appropriate tree reference resistance in the a p method for fruit trees rather than the grass reference 100 s m being used for all crop types 5 conclusions while the need for a method to derive accurate crop coefficients using readily available information is essential for precise water resources management this study demonstrates that there is also a need for a more nuanced understanding of the physiology of the specific crops different crops regulate their stomatal aperture in different ways to regulate water use for apple trees in a semi arid mediterranean type climate typical of the western cape province of south africa replacing the annual crop resistance 100 s m with the unstressed canopy resistance for apple trees of 37 s m gave accurate estimates of crop coefficientss for apple orchards from our assessment the input data requirements to accurately determine the kc and kcb values of crops using the improved a p method include the fractional vegetation cover tree height average wind speed at 2 0 m minimum relative humidity and the bulk canopy resistance of the species concerned although we are yet to test this approach on other fruit tree species however the approach accurately predicted both the seasonal transpiration and daily evapotranspiration in 12 apple orchards under the mediterranean climatic conditions in the western cape province of south africa the contribution of the cover crops transpiration to the orchard crop coefficientss appeared to be quite small accurate crop coefficients information can be incorporated into precision irrigation management decision support systems leading to significant water savings which are critical for the sustainability and growth of the fruit industry while the a p method is potentially useful for deriving crop coefficients crop specific information is needed to improve accuracies declaration of

10674,the fao 56 crop coefficient kc approach is widely used for making irrigation decisions allen and pereira 2009 extended this approach by developing a method for estimating kc using a density coefficient kd which is estimated from the fraction of ground covered by vegetation and plant height in this study we evaluated this method using detailed measurements of transpiration t evapotranspiration et soil attributes weather and tree physiological variables in 12 apple malus domestica borkh orchards in the western cape province of south africa mid summer canopy cover of the orchards was less than 20 in young non bearing and exceeded 60 in mature full bearing orchards data were collected over three growing seasons october 2014 to may 2017 in orchards planted to the golden delicious reinders cripps pink cripps red and rosy glow apple cultivars the original allen and pereira a p method significantly overestimated the basal crop coefficients kcb by on average 47 in mature and 103 in young orchards respectively however improved kcb estimates were obtained by adjusting the ratio of the resistances i e rl 100 in the a p method where rl is the mean leaf resistance and 100 s m is the typical resistance for annual crops we defined a resistance parameter α for apple orchards which is equivalent to the bulk canopy resistance of a well watered tree replacing rl 100 with rl α and using the measured mean rl and other biophysical measurements to solve the a p equation for α gave a value 37 s m the improved kcb values were used to derive the orchard kc taking into account the contribution of cover crops whose transpiration was measured using miniature stem heat balance sap flow gauges the seasonal total transpiration t estimated as t kcb x eto where eto is the reference et closely matched the measured values with a rmse root of the mean square error of 16 mm therefore using the mean canopy resistance which is representative of apple trees in the a p method has the potential to accurately predict both the crop coefficients and water use of apple orchards from planting until full bearing age keywords basal crop coefficient canopy cover evapotranspiration leaf resistance 1 introduction water is a scarce resource in major fruit producing countries such as italy south africa spain morocco etc where most fruits are grown under irrigation in south africa for example irrigated agriculture uses approximately 62 of the surface water resources and yet between 30 and 45 of this water is wasted mainly due to poor irrigation practices and leakages nwrs 2 2013 inefficient irrigation practices increasing economic activities and changing climatic conditions all contribute to increasing water scarcity girona et al 2011 marsal et al 2013 dzikiti et al 2018a so water saving technologies and sound water management strategies particularly irrigation scheduling are required to ensure the long term sustainability and growth of the fruit industry volschenk et al 2003 girona et al 2011 several methods have been developed over the years to improve irrigation scheduling in orchards in order to increase the crop water productivity these include soil based approaches whereby soil water content sensors are used to monitor the water status in the root zone and beyond sui and vories 2018 volschenk 2017 while this approach is fairly widely used it has several drawbacks these include the need for detailed and expensive monitoring networks lack of broad spatial representativeness across soil and orchard characteristics and uncertainties in water movement in the soil profile plant based irrigation scheduling methods use the plant as a biosensor which integrates the soil and atmospheric conditions as well as the plant s physiological response to water deficit dzikiti et al 2010 fernández 2017 a comprehensive review of the advantages and disadvantages of the plant based irrigation scheduling methods was given by jones 2004 the fao 56 approach described by allen et al 1998 is the most widely used climate based crop water requirement estimation method due to its simplicity and robustness in this approach crop evapotranspiration et is estimated as the product of the reference evapotranspiration eto and a crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 tabulated typical kc values for a range of irrigated crops several studies have compared the results obtained using the fao 56 method with actual evapotranspiration measured using various techniques marin et al 2016 allen 2000 gupta et al 2017 zanotelli et al 2019 paço et al 2006 the results demonstrate the need to adjust the tabulated crop coefficients to specific growing conditions in an attempt to make the crop coefficients transferrable to different sites and climatic regions allen and pereira 2009 used readily available data to estimate the crop coefficients and this method is referred hereafter as the a p method allen and pereira 2009 found that both the kc and the basal crop coefficient kcb can be determined using the fraction of ground covered by the vegetation crop height and the degree of stomatal regulation under wet soil conditions however other studies have shown mixed performances of the a p method relative to the measured crop water consumption for example paço et al 2019 found a good agreement between the a p kcb values and those measured using sap flow sensors in an olive orchard in portugal in another study by taylor et al 2015 in three citrus orchards the a p method overestimated the sap flow derived kcb by up to 127 under sub tropical and mediterranean type growing conditions in south africa in this study we evaluated the a p method using detailed field data collected in 12 apple orchards with varying canopy cover ranging from young non bearing to mature high yielding orchards in the western cape province of south africa the specific objectives were 1 to evaluate the performance of the a p method using actual measured field data over a range of fractional canopy cover apple cultivars and microclimates 2 to investigate and document sources of uncertainty in the a p method and to propose improvements and 3 to extensively validate the improved a p method to estimate the water use rates of apple orchards under mediterranean climatic conditions in addition for the first time we incorporate detailed measurements of cover crop transpiration into the a p method to produce accurate crop coefficients for micro sprinkler irrigated apple orchards with substantial cover crops growing between the tree rows the hypothesis is that by parameterizing the a p method for specific crop types one can refine kcb and kc and get accurate estimates of crop water requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field data were collected in 12 apple orchards over three growing seasons i e 2014 15 2015 16 and 2016 17 in two prime apple producing regions in the western cape province of south africa fig 1 these regions are the koue bokkeveld kbv located about 150 km to the northeast of the city of cape town and the elgin grabouw vyeboom villiersdorp egvv which is about 70 km southeast of cape town both regions have a mediterranean type climate more than 50 of the rain falls during the winter months from may to august a typical growing season for apples in these regions extends from september october to april depending on the cultivar the two production regions have somewhat different microclimates the egvv region has milder summers and winters due to proximity to the indian ocean to the south the inland kbv region on the other hand has very cold winters with occasional snowfall in high lying areas and hot summers during the 2014 15 season data were collected in four orchards in kbv comprising two mature high yielding 74 110 t ha orchards with a high effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation of about 0 64 one orchard was planted to golden delicious apple trees which is the most widely planted cultivar in south africa the second mature orchard was planted to cripps pink apple trees which is a high value cultivar but with a long growing season the other two orchards had young less than 3 yr old non bearing trees of the golden delicious reinders and rosy glow cultivars detailed information about the orchards is summarized in table 1 the average effective fraction of vegetation cover in the young orchards was less than 0 20 during the mid summer period when canopy cover was at the maximum during 2015 16 data were collected in four orchards in egvv with similar attributes to those in kbv yields of 100 109 t ha these included mature golden delicious and cripps pink blocks while the non bearing orchards were planted to the golden delicious reinders and cripps red cultivars table 1 in 2016 17 measurements were taken in two orchards in each production region with medium fractional canopy cover ranging from 0 26 to 0 37 table 1 the orchards were planted to cripps pink and golden delicious reinders trees respectively with yields ranging between 18 and 61 t ha soil texture was predominantly sandy to sandy loam in both regions except for the high and medium cover cripps pink in egvv which had dark red clayey loam soils of the kroonstad soil form ochric planosol according to the soil classification working group 1991 soil physical and chemical analyses for the 12 orchards were done at a commercial laboratory bemlab pty ltd south africa table 2 summarizes the physical properties of the soils for all the orchards 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 transpiration and irrigation measurements tree transpiration on medium and high canopy cover orchards was measured during the apple growing season october to may on between three and six trees of different stem sizes using the heat ratio method of monitoring sap flow burgess et al 2001 four probes were inserted to four different depths in trunks of the selected trees to capture the radial variation in sap velocity wullschleger and king 2000 each probe set consisted of two t type thermocouples placed equidistantly 0 5 cm upstream and downstream of a stainless steel heater probe heat pulse velocities were measured and logged hourly using data loggers model cr1000 campbell sci inc logan ut usa connected to multiplexers model am16 32b campbell sci inc logan ut usa the heat pulse velocity signals were converted to sap flow volumes per tree taking into account wound sizes wood moisture fraction and wood density according to the procedure described by swanson and whitfield 1981 the size of the conducting sapwood area was determined by injecting methylene blue dye into the stems to establish the extent of the active xylem vessels transpiration by the smaller trees in the young non bearing orchards was measured using granier probes tdp 10 dynamax inc houston usa granier 1987 three healthy and actively growing trees were instrumented per orchard the sensors were installed at a height between 50 and 75 cm from the ground to eliminate errors due to the cold sap especially in the morning a reflective aluminium foil was wrapped around the probes to minimize the effects of exogenous heating on the sap temperature signals data were collected at a scan rate of 10 s and hourly averages of sap velocity were recorded all orchards were irrigated using micro sprinkler systems with one sprinkler per tree delivering between 30 and 32 litres of water per hour irrigation frequency ranged from two to three times per week with each event lasting for one to two hours early in the season the irrigation frequency increased to daily or several times a day during hot summer months water flow meters model arad multi jet water meter germiston south africa with a resolution of 10 l pulse were installed on the irrigation line to monitor the irrigation volumes 2 2 2 evapotranspiration and physiological measurements actual evapotranspiration from the orchards was measured using two open path eddy covariance systems at selected intervals during the growing season as summarised in table 3 continuous measurement of et throughout the study period was not possible because of the equipment limitations the eddy covariance systems comprised of sonic anemometers model csat3 campbell sci inc utah usa and infrared gas analysers irga model li 7500a li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa installed at heights ranging from 1 2 to 1 8 m above the mean canopy height depending on the size of the orchard which varied from 3 8 7 0 ha the flux towers were located downstream of the prevailing wind direction to maximize the fetch other sensors to quantify the orchard energy balance included the single component net radiometers model cnr1 kipp zonen delft the netherlands soil heat flux plates model hukse flux campbell sci inc utah usa installed at about 8 cm depth cs616 soil moisture probes and soil averaging thermocouples installed at 2 and 6 cm depths from the surface to correct the measured fluxes for the energy stored by the soil above the plates the signals were sampled at a frequency of 10 hz and the outputs were averaged at 30 min intervals using cr3000 and cr5000 data loggers campbell sci inc utah usa the high frequency data were processed using the eddypro v 6 2 0 software li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa to correct the data for the lack of sensor levelness sensor time lags fluctuations in the air density among others the data were further corrected for lack of energy balance closure using the bowen ratio approach as described by twine et al 2000 orchard leaf area index lai m2 of leaf area per m2 of ground area was measured at monthly intervals in the 12 orchards using a leaf area meter model lai 2000 li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa these data were collected on overcast days or just before sunset when the leaves approximated black bodies the fraction of the ground surface covered by vegetation at midday fc was estimated from the lai measurements using the relationship fc 1 e k lai where k is the extinction coefficient taken as equal to 0 6 impens and lemeur 1969 the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by the trees fceff was calculated from fc and other variables as described by allen and pereira 2009 and allen et al 1998 the stomatal resistance rl was measured at monthly intervals using the infrared gas analyser model li 6400 li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa data were collected on two healthy sun exposed leaves from ten tagged trees per orchard around midday from 12h00 to 14h30 the midday xylem water potential ψx was measured on the same ten trees using a pressure chamber model 615 pms instrument company albany oregon usa two healthy and fully expanded leaves per tree located close to the stem were enclosed in the morning using zip lock silver reflective stem water potential bags prune bags pms instrument company albany oregon usa to allow the leaf water potential to equilibrate with stem water potential for measurements at midday 2 2 3 weather data weather variables namely the maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind speed at 2 m height wind direction solar radiation and rainfall were monitored hourly using automatic weather stations situated close to each of the study sites the stations were installed on open spaces with uniform short grass cover the reference evapotranspiration eto for a short grass was computed according to allen et al 1998 2 3 calculation of crop coefficients 2 3 1 basal crop factors kcb according to allen et al 1998 the basal crop coefficient kcb also referred to as the transpiration crop coefficient is given by 1 k c b t e t o where t is the orchard transpiration in mm d derived from the sap flow measurements orchard level transpiration was calculated as the sum of the products of the sap flux density u and the orchard sapwood area index sai m2 of sapwood per m2 of ground area for trees in different stem diameter classes as 2 t i 1 s a i i u i where ui is the average sap flux density in a specific stem size class and each of the sap flow instrumented trees was assigned to an appropriate stem diameter class eq 1 assumes that the orchards did not suffer significant water stress this was a reasonable assumption based on the measurements of tree water status as the orchards were generally well watered sustained periods with water stress were excluded from the analysis given that kcb is dependent on the amount of vegetation and also to ensure that the basal crop coefficients are transferable between fields allen and pereira 2009 proposed a density coefficient kd which they defined as 3 k d k c b k c min k c b f u l l k c min where kcmin is the minimum basal coefficient for bare soil kcbfull is the estimated basal crop coefficient under conditions of nearly full ground cover lai 3 0 according to the a p method the density coefficient is estimated from the effective vegetation cover fceff and the mean tree height h as 4 k d min 1 m l f c e f f f c e f f 1 1 h where ml is a multiplier on fceff describing the effect of canopy density on shading we used values of ml 2 0 for mature orchards and 1 5 for orchards with low and medium canopy cover respectively in situations where kcbfull is not measured it can be estimated from 5 k c b f u l l f r min 1 0 0 1 h 1 20 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where u2 is the mean wind speed measured at 2 0 m height and rhmin is the minimum relative humidity according to allen and pereira 2009 the parameter fr which can be considered as a kcb adjustment factor through crop stomatal control and has values in the range 0 1 was estimated using the following equation 6 f r δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 r l 100 where δ is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure vs temperature curve pa ºc and γ is the psychrometric constant pa ºc rl is the mean leaf resistance for the vegetation in question s m according to the a p method values of r l for apple orchards were suggested as 140 s m for the initial and midseason periods and 370 s m at the end of the season in addition the resistance value of 100 s m in the denominator of eq 6 is the mean resistance for annual crops and this could be a source of uncertainty for perennial crops like most fruit trees using the suggested parameters on apple orchards led to significant over estimates of kcb for orchards of all age groups as will be discussed in detail in the results section consequently we replaced the 100 s m in eq 6 with a resistance parameter α which can be considered to represent the minimum unstressed canopy resistance for apple trees we then inverted eq 6 using measured values of the climatic variables the kcbfull in eq 5 derived from sap flow measurements of transpiration at the mid season stage of a mature well watered apple orchard lai 3 6 and the measured average leaf resistance rl for all the 12 orchards of about 202 s m we solved the a p equation for α and obtained a mean value of about 37 s m the micro sprinkler irrigated orchards had cover crops and weeds of varying densities between the tree rows these ranged from exotic species such as the tall fescues festuca arundinacea to various indigenous grasses such as the heart seed love grass eragrostis capensis etc to account for the cover crop transpiration the whole orchard kcb was estimated according to the a p method as 7 k c b k c b cov e r k d max k c b f u l l k c b cov e r k c b f u l l k c b cov e r 2 where kcbcover is the basal crop coefficient due to the cover crop the seasonal dynamics of the cover crop lai was monitored in at least five orchards at regular intervals throughout the season using a destructive sampling technique in this method plants in several 50 cm x 50 cm quadrants were harvested and their leaf area measured manually using a leaf area meter model li 3000 li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa estimates of cover crop transpiration tc were obtained using three to four miniature stem heat balance sap flow gauges model sga2 dynamax houston usa installed on straight portions of individual grass blades the sensors were installed during short window periods lasting a few days at a time to avoid damage by farm machinery the transpiration data to determine the maximum basal coefficient for the cover crops kcbfullc was collected in winter july 2017 when the trees were leafless and there was no shading of the cover crops if sfi is the sap flow in cm3 h of a single cover crop plant whose leaf area on the exposed part of the sap flow sensor is ai then the cover crop transpiration tc in mm h expressed over the full orchard surface was given by 8 t c i s f i a i l a i c where laic is the leaf area index of the cover crop the maximum cover crop basal crop coefficient kcbfullc was then determined using eq 9 9 k c b f u l l c t c e t o the density coefficient for the cover crops kdc was subsequently derived according to allen and pereira 2009 as 10 k d c 1 e 0 7 l a i c kcbcover was then determined by combining eqs 3 9 and 10 assuming kcmin of about 0 15 allen and pereira 2009 2 3 2 determining orchard crop coefficients kc the whole orchard kc values were determined also using the density coefficient as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 as 11 k c k s o i l k d max k c f u l l k s o i l k c f u l l k s o i l 2 where kcfull represents kc from a fully covered soil with some background evaporation and it was calculated as 12 k c f u l l max 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 k c b 0 05 ksoil in eq 11 represents the average kc from the non vegetated exposed portion of the surface and reflects the impact of wetting frequency and soil type this was determined taking into account evaporation from the wet and dry portions of the orchard floor as 13 k s o i l k e w e t k e d r y where kewet was calculated following allen et al 2005 as 14 k e w e t t e w t e w r e w exp t w e s o r e w t e w r e w t w e t o f w where tew is the total evaporable water which represents the depth of water that can be evaporated from the surface soil layer when the layer has been initially completely wetted rew represents the readily evaporable water which represents the cumulative evaporation during stage 1 drying allen et al 1998 tw is the average time between independent wetting events which was calculated to be on average 2 7 days for wetting due to irrigation eso is the potential evaporation rate from a wet soil surface as described in eq 17 and fw represents the fraction of the orchard floor that is wetted by irrigation or rain 0 1 k edry in this study was taken as a constant at 0 06 based on microlysimeter measurements of soil evaporation and also given that the study area receives very little rainfall during the fruit growing season tew was estimated as 15 t e w 1000 θ f c 0 5 θ w p z e where θfc and θwp represent the volumetric soil water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point respectively cm3 cm 3 and ze is the effective depth of soil evaporation which was taken as 0 15 m allen et al 1998 rew was calculated from soil texture data according to ritchie et al 1989 as 16 r e w 20 0 15 s a f o r s a 80 r e w 11 0 06 c c l f o r c l 50 r e w 8 0 06 c l f o r s a 80 a n d c l 50 where sa is the percentage fraction of sand in soil and cl is the percentage fraction of clay in the soil which were determined for the twelve orchards at a commercial laboratory to account for the presence of tree cover on soil evaporation eso used in eq 14 we used the expression proposed by allen et al 2005 wherein 17 e s o k c max k c b e t o where kcmax is the maximum crop coefficient for the surface under full vegetation and it is equal to kcfull eq 12 kcb is the basal crop coefficient calculated according to eq 7 3 results 3 1 water use dynamics of apple orchards with varying canopy cover there were clear differences in the water use patterns of the orchards with different canopy cover the typical seasonal dynamics of the reference evapotranspiration eto actual evapotranspiration et transpiration t and irrigation in young medium and high canopy cover orchards are shown in fig 2 a c in the young golden delicious reinders orchard fig 2a for example the measured et was lower than the eto but higher than the sap flow derived t as expected on warm days following irrigation the measured et was quite high exceeding 4 mm d due to high evaporation rates from the wet orchard floor this is clearly evident for the period october to november 2014 at this time orchard floor evaporation accounted for close to 60 of et in the young orchard fig 2a the orchard floor evaporative losses were exacerbated by the tall and dense cover crop and weeds that grew on the orchard floor at the beginning of the season september to late october however as the residual soil moisture from the winter and spring rains depleted the vegetation between the rows became patchy and less vigorous so periods of sustained water deficit e g from 08 february to 07 march 2015 resulted in the measured transpiration being of the same order of magnitude as the measured et see region marked with an oval circle in fig 2a water stress was deliberately imposed on the trees during this time by withholding irrigation in order to derive the soil water retention curve for the orchard the fact that the sap flow derived transpiration was close to the eddy covariance measured et when evaporation from the orchard floor was negligible confirms that the two techniques agreed well taylor et al 2015 reported a similar observation for mature drip irrigated citrus orchards in south africa the measured et in the medium fig 2b and the high canopy cover orchards fig 2c were comparable with the eto in most cases as expected tree transpiration contributed the most to the et of the older orchards the high et rates early in the growing season october 2014 for the mature cripps pink fig 2c were a result of transpiration by the dense cover crop and weeds and evaporation from the wet soil when tree canopy cover was still low the actual et measured ranged from 0 4 to 4 1 mm d in young orchards 1 3 5 7 mm d in the medium cover and 0 94 to around 6 6 mm d in the mature orchards the high et rates which were close to eto especially in mature orchards confirm that the orchards were well watered in most instances although periods of water stress were also observed on occasion the measured tree transpiration peaked at about 1 7 mm d for the young orchards 3 1 mm d for the medium cover orchards and 3 8 mm d for the mature cripps pink orchard the maximum contribution of evaporation from the orchard floor accounted for between 30 and 50 of et in medium cover orchards falling to between 18 and 32 in mature high canopy cover orchards 3 2 measured vs calculated basal crop coefficients the major advantage of the allen and pereira 2009 method is that the crop coefficients can be calculated from readily available information which makes the method very appealing for practical irrigation scheduling the kcb for example can be calculated from estimates of the fractional vegetation cover tree height and microclimatic data using eqs 3 7 in this way different crop coefficients for mature and young orchards are derived leading to more accurate irrigation decision making however using the parameters published by allen and pereira 2009 for apple orchards to derive the kcb values for orchards with varying canopy cover led to significant over estimates fig 3 a c illustrates typical trends of kcb for entire growing seasons for young medium and high canopy cover orchards in these examples the a p method over estimated kcb by 103 69 and 47 for the young medium and high canopy cover orchards respectively similar trends were observed for the remaining nine orchards whose data are not shown a possible source of uncertainty causing the poor fit resides in eq 6 in which the ratio of the leaf resistances is used to adjust kcb through the adjustment factor fr as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 for this reason we collected detailed data to further investigate how the tree water status and environmental factors influenced the leaf resistance of apple trees table 4 the measured stomatal resistance for the 12 apple orchards ranged from 100 to just over 500 s m the average resistance for the irrigation season november to april for all the orchards was around 202 s m an extremely high resistance of about 2 446 s m was observed once in the young rosy glow orchard when the irrigation system malfunctioned fig 4 a over the course of all the growing seasons the mean leaf resistance showed an exponentially decreasing trend with the rising midday stem water potential ψx as shown in fig 4a this confirms that the stomata opened as the tree water status increased less negative ψx using the leaf resistance measured for apple orchards and also using the value of α 37 s m derived in this study led to improved estimates of kcb for all the 12 orchards fig 5a f show examples of six orchards with different cultivars and canopy cover classes the improved a p approach predicted the kcb quite accurately for all the orchards this result suggests that using crop specific information improves the accuracy of the estimated crop coefficients derived using the a p approach this appears to be particularly the case especially for fruit trees whose physiology differs quite substantially from annual crops 3 3 estimating the orchard transpiration using improved kcb the improved basal crop coefficients were used to predict the monthly transpiration totals calculated as t kcb x eto fig 6 a c shows that the predicted transpiration was comparable with the sap flow measured values for orchards with low medium and high canopy cover a summary for all the 12 orchards is shown in table 5 in the high canopy cover cripps pink orchard the monthly transpiration was slightly underestimated in october but marginally overestimated from november to the end of the growing season fig 6a the good performance of the model was however confirmed by the statistical parameters mae 12 9 mm rmse 7 84 mm nse 0 68 and r2 0 92 nse is the nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated according to nash and sutcliffe 1970 in the medium canopy cover cripps pink and young golden delicious reinders orchards the monthly predicted transpiration was slightly underestimated throughout the growing season except for the month of may and april respectively nevertheless the model performance was still satisfactory with an mae of 5 36 and 5 07 mm rmse of 6 46 and 6 36 nse of 0 86 and 0 47 and r2 of 0 94 and 0 81 for medium canopy cover cripps pink and young golden delicious reinders orchards respectively fig 6b c 3 4 estimating orchard et using improved crop coefficients the eddy covariance energy balance closure varied with orchard canopy cover as illustrated for the young and mature orchards in fig 7 these calculations were done using hourly data collected over two to three clear days it is apparent that the closure ratio was higher for the mature 0 95 than the young 0 79 orchards these differences can be explained by among other things the more uniform vegetation cover in mature orchards while the orchard surface was more heterogeneous in young orchards the crop coefficients kc for all the orchards were fairly well predicted by the improved a p method and fig 8 a shows the data only for clear days cloudy days were excluded as these produced unrealistically high values due to the low reference evapotranspiration for the first time the contribution of the cover crop to the orchard kc is also included in this analysis as far as the authors are aware no studies have assessed the cover crop contribution in detail to the whole orchard crop coefficients the average leaf area index of the cover crops laic was about 0 24 which gave a density function kdc of 0 15 using eq 10 the daily total transpiration for a typical clear day in winter expressed over the full orchard surface was around 0 9 mm d while the reference evapotranspiration was around 4 0 mm d this gave a full cover kcb for the cover crops of about 0 225 and an average kcbcover of approx 0 034 as detailed in the methodology the maximum observed leaf area index for the cover crops was around 1 0 and following the above procedure this gave a kcbcover of about 0 08 therefore the following cover crop threshold values were used for estimating the kcb of microsprinkler irrigated apple orchards i e kcbcover 0 for bare orchard floor laic 0 1 kcbcover 0 03 for moderate density cover crop 0 1 laic 0 8 which was the most common cover type and kcbcover 0 1 for orchards with tall and density cover crops laic 0 8 the crop coefficients for the mature orchards in fig 8a tended to be high because most of the et data were collected when canopy cover had reached its maximum in summer see table 3 the larger spread of the kc values in the young orchards is a result of the high et observed early in the growing season when the orchards had dense cover crop and weeds while the atmospheric evaporative demand was still comparatively low orchard et calculated as et kc x eto where kc is the crop coefficients derived from the improved a p method closely matched the eddy covariance derived et values in fig 8b the data shown in fig 8b is for the three orchard classes i e low medium and high canopy cover for days when the eddy covariance data were collected the calculated orchard et was within 10 of the eddy covariance measured values 4 discussion the fao 56 crop coefficient approach for estimating crop water requirements under well watered conditions is a standard approach that has been widely adopted and used for irrigation management particularly irrigation scheduling girona et al 2011 volschenk 2017 gush et al 2019 however accurate estimates of crop water requirements with this method require accurate crop factors and this is the major limitation of the method as the published fao crop coefficients are not readily transferable between fields and growing regions casa et al 2000 allen 2000 lascano 2000 to address this challenge allen and pereira 2009 have advanced the original fao 56 approach by proposing a method whereby crop coefficients kcb and kc are estimated using readily available crops data such as the fraction of ground cover and crop height this method has a very high potential for improving irrigation management through improved crop coefficients given the simple inputs that are required to calculate the kc values for this reason the a p method has been the subject of research interest and several studies have evaluated its performance albeit with mixed results jiang et al 2014 paço et al 2019 taylor et al 2015 for example jiang et al 2014 applied the a p method on maize in the great plains of china they observed a close fit between the measured and calculated crop coefficients using the parameters published by allen and pereira 2009 for the maize crop observations from the present study indicate that the a p method significantly over estimates the crop coefficients for apple orchards under the mediterranean type growing conditions consistent with the conclusions by taylor et al 2015 on citrus orchards in south africa taylor et al 2015 however proposed using a variable leaf resistance term in eq 6 instead of a fixed one to improve the kcb estimates this was a logical step given that citrus trees are known to have a very strong stomatal control of leaf gas exchange cohen and cohen 1983 dzikiti et al 2011 they noted a strongly linear relationship between the leaf resistance and the reference evapotranspiration the leaf resistance for citrus had a much wider range than for apple trees varying from around 500 to close to 3 000 s m in contrast to citrus trees the rl eto relationship for apple trees was in fact non linear as shown in fig 4b these data exclude instances when the orchards were experiencing water stress the orchards were deemed to be under water stress when the midday stem water potential was lower than 2 0 mpa following dzikiti et al 2018a b with no water stress the rl eto relationship for apple trees suggests that the stomatal resistance increases sharply with the increasing atmospheric evaporative demand this trend is due to the high sensitivity of apple trees to high vapor pressure deficits of the air gush et al 2019 applying the rl eto relationship to the a p method as proposed by taylor et al 2015 also did not yield satisfactory results in this study likely because of the differences in the physiology of citrus and apple trees data not shown apple trees have a narrower range of leaf resistance 100 515 s m than citrus which lead to a higher fr ratio causing high kcb values in another study but on olive trees in portugal paço et al 2019 also observed inconsistencies between the a p crop factors and those determined from eddy covariance measurements they also adjusted the fr ratio but by trial and error to obtain accurate crop factors which also agreed with the simulations by the simdualkc model paço et al 2014 our study however provides a possible procedure for adjusting the fr term objectively based on the physiology of the crop without resorting to trial and error the fact that jiang et al 2014 obtained satisfactory results on an annual crop maize using the a p parameters as published yet applications on three different perennial crops citrus olive and apples required adjustments for stomatal sensitivity suggests that there is need to differentiate between annual and perennial crops in the a p approach here we demonstrate that using the rl for apple trees and replacing the leaf resistance of an annual crop 100 s m with the canopy resistance of well watered apple trees gave accurate results for 12 orchards comprising different cultivars and canopy cover fractions this observation is to some extent expected given the differences in the hydraulic properties of tree crops and annual crops which are dominated by non woody species e g maize wheat etc findings in this study support the use of an appropriate tree reference resistance in the a p method for fruit trees rather than the grass reference 100 s m being used for all crop types 5 conclusions while the need for a method to derive accurate crop coefficients using readily available information is essential for precise water resources management this study demonstrates that there is also a need for a more nuanced understanding of the physiology of the specific crops different crops regulate their stomatal aperture in different ways to regulate water use for apple trees in a semi arid mediterranean type climate typical of the western cape province of south africa replacing the annual crop resistance 100 s m with the unstressed canopy resistance for apple trees of 37 s m gave accurate estimates of crop coefficientss for apple orchards from our assessment the input data requirements to accurately determine the kc and kcb values of crops using the improved a p method include the fractional vegetation cover tree height average wind speed at 2 0 m minimum relative humidity and the bulk canopy resistance of the species concerned although we are yet to test this approach on other fruit tree species however the approach accurately predicted both the seasonal transpiration and daily evapotranspiration in 12 apple orchards under the mediterranean climatic conditions in the western cape province of south africa the contribution of the cover crops transpiration to the orchard crop coefficientss appeared to be quite small accurate crop coefficients information can be incorporated into precision irrigation management decision support systems leading to significant water savings which are critical for the sustainability and growth of the fruit industry while the a p method is potentially useful for deriving crop coefficients crop specific information is needed to improve accuracies declaration of
