11065,silicon is an increasingly important element in agriculture due to benefits on plant growth and development under stress conditions silicon uptake is facilitated by transpiration flow while plant resistance to drought and ultraviolet radiation are positively related thus we hypothesised that water shortage in barley hordeum vulgare l will hinder uptake of silicon and possibly other elements and that reduced ambient ultraviolet radiation will worsen these negative effects of water shortage barley plants were exposed to favourable and reduced water availability during growth under ambient and reduced ultraviolet exposure element composition and morphological biochemical physiological and optical traits of barley leaves growing under these four treatments were investigated water shortage affected the element composition of barley plants significantly silicon and chlorine levels were the most reduced by water shortage followed by calcium phosphorus and sulphur while potassium levels were not affected ultraviolet radiation did not have any significant effects on uptake of elements these plants did not undergo water shortage stress as photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii and pigment contents were similar across all treatments water shortage affected reflectance of light across the whole spectrum while ultraviolet radiation affected optical properties of the barley leaves in the uv region only keywords hordeum vulgare l water availability uv radiation element analysis accumulation 1 introduction biomineralisation is the process by which minerals are loaded into living organisms skinner and jahren 2003 this occurs in most plant tissues and across many plant species webb 1999 both silicon si and calcium ca can form biomineral structures in plants he et al 2014 si rich species usually have low ca concentrations and vice versa ma and takahashi 2002 golob et al 2018 in grasses si usually represents up to 4 of dry weight lewin and reimann 1969 while ca levels can vary significantly across species klančnik et al 2014a 2014b silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the soil where it is mainly in the form of silicic acid epstein 1994 si levels are comparable to those of many important nutrients such as potassium k and ca and they even greatly exceed phosphate levels epstein and bloom 2005 hydrated silicic acid is taken up via plant roots while si is transferred in its unpolymerised form across the plant by the apoplastic pathway through the xylem raven 1983 epstein 1994 this is driven by the transpiration flow ma and takahashi 2002 faisal et al 2012 which is under active transport liang et al 2006 silicon is deposited in plants in the form of solid amorphous si dioxide sio2 nh2o silica marschner et al 1990 epstein 1994 the extent of silica deposition depends on the mechanism of si uptake which varies across species ma and takahashi 2002 cooke and leishman 2011 silica is usually deposited in or near the epidermis yoshida et al 1962a prychid et al 2004 in grasses si is deposited in long and short epidermal cells bulliform cells guard cells and prickle hairs in the form of phytoliths kaufman et al 1985 once it is deposited in the target cells its relocation is no longer possible raven 1983 epstein 1994 silicon is considered to be a beneficial element for plants because it is important for successful growth of all plants tripathi et al 2016 its positive influence on growth was reported for a wide variety of crops including rice wheat barley and cucumber ma et al 2001 the beneficial effects of si on plants are based on a protective layer of silica that is deposited at the leaf surface the reactivity of the absorbed si with metal ions and other compounds and the metabolic functions of si in stressed plants tubaña and heckman 2015 silicification of leaf tissues prevents herbivory and pathogen infections and increases the rigidity of plant shoots ma and takahashi 2002 in grasses it is a key structural element as it prevents lodging and shading of leaves ma et al 2001 ma and takahashi 2002 moreover hosseini et al 2017 showed that si accumulation in shoots delays osmotic stress induced leaf senescence in barley studies have also investigated the importance of si in increased plant tolerance to enhanced ultraviolet uv radiation levels yao et al 2011 shen et al 2014b chen et al 2016b silicified epidermal structures have been shown to reduce the need for production of energy demanding protective phenolic uv absorbing substances schaller et al 2012 2013 although this has not been supported by all studies klančnik et al 2014a golob et al 2017 silicon also mitigates the negative effects of high temperatures on plants through maintenance of the integrity of cell membranes and increasing the levels of heat shock proteins and antioxidants agarie et al 1998 soundararajan et al 2014 moreover si has an important role in regulation of the nutrient balance in plant tissues and protects plants against toxic metals tripathi et al 2016 the presence of si and ca structures in leaves also affects the distribution of light which can be beneficial if this increases the availability of energy for the lower tissues and prevents photoinhibition in the upper mesophyll setoguchi et al 1989 multiple benefits of si fertilisation for cereals are summarised in artyszak 2018 studies have also described various si deficiency symptoms in plants these include lower shoot dry weight and yield occurrence of necroses and chloroses wilting of leaves susceptibility to various diseases disturbed development of generative organs and fruits and accelerated senescence processes ma and takahashi 2002 most soils are rich in si clayey soils containing from 200 g si kg to 300 g si kg and sandy soils 450 g si kg meena et al 2014 unlike many other elements accumulation of si in plants largely depends on environmental conditions such as water availability and the amount of plant available si in the soil dietrich et al 2003 plant available si levels in the soil depend on soil type generally young mineral soils contain more si than weathered acidic soils farooq and dietz 2015 in spite of the high si levels in soils crops such as wheat barley soybean and sugar beet will likely require si application in the future to maintain maximum yields haynes 2014 since centuries of continuous crop harvesting has resulted in depleted soil pools of bioavailable si vandevenne et al 2011 for example more than 40 of the total agricultural land soil in china is si deficient zhu and gong 2014 in recent decades extreme droughts have been one of the main factors for reduction of cereals production farooq et al 2009 lesk et al 2016 one of the reasons for this might also be related to reduced si uptake si accumulation is also affected by uv radiation levels golob et al 2018 reported a decreased si uptake in hybrid buckwheat under ambient uv radiation while a similar study with a si accumulator crop wheat revealed the opposite golob et al 2017 such uv effects are in line with some recent studies which have revealed that ambient uv radiation is not only a plant stressor but also an important regulator of plant growth and development björn 2015 indeed plant resistance to drought has been shown to be positively related to plant resistance to uv radiation and vice versa alexieva et al 2001 over recent decades our environment has been changing at a global level periods without rain are getting longer which can result in severe droughts on the other hand uv levels are variable due to ozone depletion chipperfield et al 2015 for crop plants uv levels can be greatly reduced through different management practices such as their growth under artificial light and in greenhouses or while protecting them against hail and herbivores using different covers wargent and jordan 2013 with its benefits for plant growth and development si has become an increasingly important element in agriculture cooke and degabriel 2016 tripathi et al 2016 seven out of the 10 most abundant crops in the world are si accumulators as their si tissue content is 1 guntzer et al 2012 these also include barley hordeum vulgare l ma and takahashi 2002 which is one of the oldest crops and has been grown for multiple purposes ullrich 2011 bonafaccia et al 2016 in the present study we aimed to analyse the effects of reduced water availability and reduced ambient uv radiation levels on accumulation of si and some other elements in barley as si uptake is facilitated by transpiration flow we hypothesised that water shortage will hinder the uptake of si and possibly of other elements while reduced ambient uv radiation will worsen any negative effects of such water shortage in addition we examined the reflectance and transmittance spectra of barley leaves as the presence of si and also ca can alter the optical properties and energy balance of leaves klančnik et al 2014a 2014b 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design winter barley hordeum vulgare l cv bingo was chosen as the test species for the present study barley seeds were sown on 19 october 2016 in 20 plastic pots 44 cm 44 cm 36 cm 64

stage all of these plants were well watered on 23 may 2017 the soil moisture levels were determined and from 24 may 2017 water shortage w was simulated for half of the uv and half of the uv pots these provided the four different treatments five pots treatment w uv well watered ambient uv control w uv w uv and w uv the w plants were watered every 2 days or 3 days until the end of the experimental period and the w plants received water five times during the experimental period overall the w plants received nearly 5 fold the water of the w plants to maintain these soil moisture levels as

usb connector using a u 4 hobo optic usb base station and a 2 d coupler onset computer corporation 2 5 statistical analysis normal distributions of the data were evaluated using shapiro wilk tests homogeneity of variance from the means was analysed using levene s tests one way analysis of variance anova according to duncanʼs post hoc multiple range tests was used to assess differences between the four treatments for each measured parameter factorial anova was carried out for the measured parameters to test the significance of water availability w and uv radiation uv alone and their interaction w uv to investigate the relationships between the selected leaf traits and environmental conditions or soil parameters pearson s correlation analysis was performed ibm spss statistics 25 0 was used for these statistical calculations with significance accepted at p 0 05 the figure for leaf element contents in barley leaves under the different treatments was drawn in microsoft excel 2016 detrended correspondence analysis was used for the exploratory data analysis using the canoco for windows 4 5 programme package due to the gradient lengths obtained 3 sd ter braak and šmilauer 2002 redundancy analysis was used to determine whether the variations in leaf element contents were related to water availability indicators the significance of the effects of the variables was determined using monte carlo tests with 999 permutations forward selection of the explanatory variables was used to avoid co linearity all of the variables used in the analysis were standardised 3 results 3 1 leaf traits and environmental conditions water availability w w and uv radiation uv uv affected many of the measured parameters for the barley leaves table 1 among the morphological leaf traits water shortage w significantly increased lower epidermis thickness specific leaf area was significantly decreased by low water availability as it was significantly higher under the w uv treatment compared to both w treatments i e w uv w uv reduced uv radiation uv significantly decreased leaf and mesophyll thickness along with stomata length on both leaf surfaces however for the lower leaf surface alone uv significantly increased stomata and prickle hair density the interaction between water availability and uv radiation only resulted in significant differences for cuticle thickness for both leaf surfaces and upper surface prickle hair length which all showed an opposite response to decreasing water availability under the two considered levels of ambient uv radiation with decreasing water availability cuticle thickness slightly increased when under reduced uv radiation and markedly decreased under ambient uv radiation for both leaf surfaces both upper and lower cuticle were thickest under the control treatment w uv while the thinnest cuticles were observed for the well watered plants under reduced uv radiation w uv upper surface prickle hair length also revealed distinct decreases under ambient uv radiation while it increased under reduced uv radiation with decreasing water availability significantly shorter upper surface prickle hairs compared to all the other treatments were found in the water deprived plants when under ambient uv radiation w uv the photosynthetic pigments i e chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids were all significantly affected by the interaction between water availability and uv radiation in a similar way table 1 namely with decreasing water availability their contents increased under reduced ambient uv radiation while they decreased under ambient uv radiation they were all lowest for the w uv group and highest for the w uv group anthocyanins were only significantly affected by water availability showing higher contents under reduced water availability the highest anthocyanin contents were observed for the w uv group on the other hand uv absorbing compounds showed no significant differences among the treatment groups nevertheless their contents were highest under the w uv treatment and lowest under the w uv treatment for the potential photochemical efficiency the lower water availability treatments i e w uv w uv did not significantly affect the barley plant vitality as also seen for the effective photochemical efficiency conversely under these water shortage conditions the stomatal conductance of the barley leaves was significantly decreased table 1 the reflectance and transmittance spectra of the barley leaves did not show pronounced differences between these four treatments although some colour regions differed significantly table 1 for reflectance water shortage w resulted in significant increase in the visible and nir regions while reduced uv radiation uv significantly increased the uv b region exclusively on the other hand transmittance was significantly decreased by water shortage w and significantly increased by reduced uv radiation uv in both uv regions moreover water shortage alone w significantly increased transmittance of light in the green region the interaction between water availability and uv radiation was only significant for transmittance in the nir region it showed an increase with decreasing water availability which was more pronounced in the case of reduced uv radiation the amount of transmitted light was thus significantly higher in the w uv treatment but did not differ from the control w uv under the remaining two treatments i e w uv w uv in general reflectance and transmittance were highest under the most stressful treatment w uv with the lowest transmittance under the control conditions w uv and the least light reflected under the w uv treatment measurements of the plant environmental conditions i e soil radiation showed the expected marked decreases in soil moisture from the w to w treatments as for the uv b radiation levels from the uv to uv treatments table 1 however the soil temperatures and par levels were not significantly affected by these two factors either alone or in terms of their interactions at the start of the experimental period the soil moisture levels ranged from 16 7 to 23 7 with no significant differences among these four treatments the element analysis of the barley leaves indicated marked and generally significant decreases with decreased water availability i e w vs w for almost all of the elements examined i e si p s cl ca with the exception of k fig 1 these reached significance for si cl and ca leaf p content was lower for w in comparison to both w treatments although significance was only reached for the w uv treatment versus the w treatments for the leaf s content the decrease from w to w treatments did not reach significance only for w uv versus w uv as indicated contrary to other elements examined k was not significantly affected by the reduced water availability under these treatments redundancy analysis revealed strong positive relationships between almost all of the elements determined in this study again with the exception of k and also for soil water content and stomatal conductance fig 2 here soil water content alone explained 43 and stomatal conductance alone 36 of the variability of the element composition of these barley leaves when considered together soil water content explained 43 p 0 002 variability and stomatal conductance included an additional 8 p 0 040 variability the samples formed two distinct groups according to the water availability 3 2 soil element composition and structure and plant available si levels in the soil total soil si and ca levels did not show any significant differences among the treatments table 2 plant available si cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil were significantly lower under the w uv treatment in comparison to all the other treatments the texture of the soil was 49 2 2 7 sand 37 2 2 7 silt and 13 6 0 3 clay and thus it was identified as loamy the further soil parameters were ph 7 1 0 1 available p 75 8 3

saturation 99 2 3 3 relationships between certain leaf and soil parameters pearson s correlation analysis was carried out to obtain a more detailed view of some of the relationships between certain leaf traits environmental conditions and some soil parameters the reflectance of light was significantly negatively related p 0 05 to leaf si content throughout the whole spectrum however the reflectance showed a significant and marked negative relationship p 0 01 with leaf ca content in the violet and blue regions of the spectrum only in addition reflectance was significantly negatively related p 0 05 to specific leaf area in the uv a uv b violet blue and nir regions and correlated positively p 0 05 with upper surface stomata as well as prickle hair densities in both uv regions for upper surface stomata density positive correlation p 0 05 with reflectance was also found in the violet blue and nir regions the transmittance of light in both of the uv regions was significantly positively related p 0 05 to both leaf si and ca contents moreover the transmittance in the nir region was significantly negatively related p 0 05 to leaf si and ca contents similar to the redundancy analysis pearson s correlation analysis revealed strong positive relationships between the leaf contents of almost all of the elements examined i e except for k and the soil moisture level p 0 01 and the stomatal conductance p 0 05 almost all of the elements considered in this study i e again with the exception of k showed significant positive correlations p 0 05 with one another leaf si contents did not correlate with total soil si levels while they showed weak positive correlation with plant available si cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil p 0 05 plant available si levels in the soil were significantly positively related to soil moisture levels p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 effects of water availability in terms of the effects of the water availability most were observed in both of the water deprived groups i e w uv w uv this was expected because water shortage directly affects plant growth through reduction of transpiration photosynthetic activity and cell division and growth rate larcher 2003 duman 2012 the present study also revealed a significant decrease in stomatal conductance although there were no significant changes in the potential and effective photochemical efficiencies of psii this thus indicates that stomatal regulation enabled the maintenance of a favourable water regime and that the photoprotective mechanisms such as the xanthophyll cycle bernal et al 2015 appeared to prevent photochemical stress the water shortage w also altered the morphological properties of these barley leaves with significantly decreased cuticle thickness and significantly increased epidermis thickness and significantly decreased specific leaf area the increase in anthocyanin content under reduced water availability on the other hand goes well in line with their important role in drought tolerance gould 2004 the thick cuticle and thin epidermal layer in the control well watered w plants were probably a consequence of their better si supply faisal et al 2012 si soluble fraction is redox and ph dependent ma and takahashi 2002 ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 mm in soil solutions epstein 2001 sommer et al 2006 miles et al 2014 examined the relation between cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil and soil ph for 112 soils and found that these levels ranged from about 10 mg kg of soil dm at ph 4 to about 100 mg kg of soil dm at ph 7 however in our study cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil ranged from 20 6 mg kg of soil dm to 23 6 mg kg of soil dm at soil ph 7 1 these values were positively related to soil moisture levels which is a consequence of the capillary rise of water containing dissolved si sio2 nh2o kozlowski 1987 comparison of a rainforest site with a sugarcane site in northern queensland australia showed that cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil were 13 1 mg kg and 5 3 mg kg respectively indicating that crops deplete si supplying ability of the soil haynes 2014 keller et al 2012 estimated that under a temperate climate the exportation of si due to straw removal would result in depletion of the initial phytogenic si in soils within a few decades although the degree of water shortage used in this study did not impose stress on these plants it significantly decreased the uptake of almost all of the elements studied here with the exception of k indeed k influences a number of physiological and biochemical processes in plants that are involved in their resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses wang et al 2013 k is also an important inorganic osmolyte in plants and it has a crucial role in osmotic adjustment under drought conditions hawkesford et al 2012 therefore the maintenance of the k levels in plants is crucial for plant survival during periods of water shortage chen et al 2016a water availability also affected the p content in these barley leaves the lowest p content was seen for the w uv treatment phosphate ions move through the soil by diffusion and therefore water shortage in the soil i e w will decrease their mobility da silva et al 2011 on the other hand high p availability increases the plant sensitivity to uv radiation murali and teramura 1985 he and dijkstra 2014 also reported that drought leads to decreased plant n and p levels with this effect greater for p moreover leaf p content appears to be related to leaf si content as also shown in the present study sufficient si availability can reduce the need of plants for p as si fertilisation of soils with insufficient p results in increased plant production ma and takahashi 2002 deren 1997 also reported increased p levels following application of si fertiliser silicon was the most affected element in terms of the water availability the negative effects of drought might be mitigated by si uptake maghsoudi et al 2015 ma et al 2016 marques et al 2016 the content of si in the leaves of the well watered barley plants w in this study reached 2 5 and when these plants were under water shortage w this remained relatively high 1 in comparison to other plant species ma and takahashi 2002 in an experiment with barley subjected to osmotic stress under low or high k supply and under two si regimes leaf si contents ranged from less than 1 mg si g dm to 6 5 mg si g dm hosseini et al 2017 by deposition of si in different plant parts the plants generally improve their water retention capacity and optimise their water use efficiency gao et al 2004 ma et al 2004 ahmed et al 2011 water loss by transpiration takes place not only through the stomata but also through the cuticle ma and takahashi 2002 therefore incrustation of the cuticle together with wax deposition reduces water loss yoshida et al 1962b postek 1981 ma and takahashi 2002 si also strengthens the cell walls of the root endodermis thereby preventing water loss from the roots when there is a decrease in soil water potential lux et al 2002 additionally si can improve the hydraulic conductivity of plant roots shi et al 2016 the role of si is also related to gene regulation as it can regulate water uptake by promotion of expression of the genes that code for aquaporins in water channels liu et al 2014 while also increasing the expression of certain transcription factors involved in drought acclimatisation khattab et al 2014 si also has a role in osmotic regulation through changes in the levels of osmotic regulators such as proline and soluble carbohydrates crusciol et al 2009 pereira et al 2013 mauad et al 2016 studies have also revealed interactions between si and ca with changes in ca and micronutrient levels in leaf tissues reported to be related to si availability during plant growth brackhage et al 2013 the study of greger et al 2018 showed that si fertilisation increased the uptake of mg ca s mn and mo and decreased the uptake of fe cu and zn while the uptake of k p n cl and b was not affected the effects were similar across different experimental plant species and soil types the positive relationship between si and ca s p and cl but not between si and k was observed in the present study it was reported that the amount of phosphate ions released into the soil solution increases with increasing levels of h4sio4 tubaña and heckman 2015 in comparison to si ca accumulation was less affected by water availability as well as si ca is involved in plant drought resistance xu et al 2013 through improved membrane integrity duman 2012 and its involvement in the signalling of drought resistance responses shao et al 2008 contrary to the positive correlation between si and ca in barley a study by liang 1999 did not reveal interactions between these two elements however brackhage et al 2013 investigated reeds and showed that ca levels decreased as si levels increased while a study of leaf water content of wheat showed that ca levels were positively related to si levels mali and aery 2008 as also shown in the present study 4 2 effects of uv radiation an impact of reduced uv radiation was expected as uv radiation is an important evolutionary factor that has shaped plant growth and development björn 2015 manipulating uv levels is becoming more and more important in agriculture wargent and jordan 2013 barley usually grows in areas with high light intensity in the present study the reduced uv radiation uv led to decreased leaf and cuticle thickness and prickle hair density and to increased chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents while showing no significant effects on element contents we did note here a small beneficial impact of ambient uv radiation on si content in the leaves of the barley plants exposed to water shortage i e w uv although this did not reach significance due to high inter sample variability here the si level in water deprived plants under ambient uv radiation i e w uv was 63 of that in the well watered plants i e w uv while it was only 48 under the reduced uv radiation w uv a reverse trend was observed for p studies using enhanced uv b radiation have revealed decreased p levels in plants yue et al 1998 while the combination of uv b radiation and drought can significantly increase the p k ca and mg contents in soybean leaves shen et al 2014a although this is not in line with the results of the present study the absence of negative effects under the present ambient uv radiation in barley was possibly the consequence of its efficient mechanisms to cope with such uv radiation levels and even to benefit from them jansen et al 2012 sen mandi 2016 4 3 combined effects of water availability and uv radiation high uv radiation levels and water shortage can often occur together in nature and the responses of plants to these parameters trigger similar changes in their leaf traits comont et al 2012 it has been shown that uv b radiation mitigates water shortage stress by lowering stomatal conductance and reducing leaf area by inhibition of cell division nogués et al 1998 this was not the case in the barley leaves in the present study as the reduced uv radiation and degree of water shortage used here did not impose stress on the experimental plants the only such observed combined effect of reduced water availability and reduced uv radiation was the reduction of leaf cuticle thickness 4 4 effects of treatments on the optical properties of barley leaves reflectance and transmittance showed some small effects under reduced water availability and reduced uv radiation water shortage w significantly increased the reflectance in the visible and nir regions while reduced uv radiation uv had the same effect in the uv b region only this appears to be due to the differences in si levels as the reflectance of light was negatively related to the leaf si content across all regions of the spectrum a negative relationship between reflectance and leaf ca content was seen for the violet and blue regions only in previous studies a protective role against strong light was ascribed to si structures at the leaf surface i e in the cuticle and prickle hairs that increased the reflection especially in the uv region and thereby reduced uv penetration into the deeper leaf tissues klančnik et al 2014a 2014b prickle hairs were also shown to have the same role in the present study increased tolerance to uv radiation due to si has been associated with expression of the lsi1 gene which encodes the transporter for si uptake in plants ma and yamaji 2008 expression of this gene also facilitates the expression of some other genes that are crucial for increased plant tolerance to uv radiation as they are involved in both repair of photodamage and detoxification mechanisms fang et al 2011 chen et al 2016b 5 conclusions the moderate water shortage and reduced uv radiation treatments used in the present study did not stress these barley plants as revealed by the photochemical efficiency of psii however the photosynthetic pigments and anthocyanins were significantly affected by either one of the two studied factors or their interaction other leaf traits were only slightly affected by these two factors which is also apparent from the minor differences in the leaf optical properties the differences in the reflectance and transmittance spectra of these barley leaves were related to the si and ca levels water shortage alone w significantly reduced the uptake of si ca p s and cl but not of k while reduced uv radiation resulted in slightly decreased si accumulation in the water deprived plants i e w uv vs w uv leaf si content was positively related to plant available si levels in the soil and these showed positive correlation with soil moisture levels the present study has thus revealed that barley plants have efficient mechanisms to resist this moderate water shortage w without undergoing stress and that ambient uv radiation uv contributes to this plant protection as reduced uv radiation uv decreases si uptake acknowledgements the authors are grateful to christopher berrie

11065,silicon is an increasingly important element in agriculture due to benefits on plant growth and development under stress conditions silicon uptake is facilitated by transpiration flow while plant resistance to drought and ultraviolet radiation are positively related thus we hypothesised that water shortage in barley hordeum vulgare l will hinder uptake of silicon and possibly other elements and that reduced ambient ultraviolet radiation will worsen these negative effects of water shortage barley plants were exposed to favourable and reduced water availability during growth under ambient and reduced ultraviolet exposure element composition and morphological biochemical physiological and optical traits of barley leaves growing under these four treatments were investigated water shortage affected the element composition of barley plants significantly silicon and chlorine levels were the most reduced by water shortage followed by calcium phosphorus and sulphur while potassium levels were not affected ultraviolet radiation did not have any significant effects on uptake of elements these plants did not undergo water shortage stress as photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii and pigment contents were similar across all treatments water shortage affected reflectance of light across the whole spectrum while ultraviolet radiation affected optical properties of the barley leaves in the uv region only keywords hordeum vulgare l water availability uv radiation element analysis accumulation 1 introduction biomineralisation is the process by which minerals are loaded into living organisms skinner and jahren 2003 this occurs in most plant tissues and across many plant species webb 1999 both silicon si and calcium ca can form biomineral structures in plants he et al 2014 si rich species usually have low ca concentrations and vice versa ma and takahashi 2002 golob et al 2018 in grasses si usually represents up to 4 of dry weight lewin and reimann 1969 while ca levels can vary significantly across species klančnik et al 2014a 2014b silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the soil where it is mainly in the form of silicic acid epstein 1994 si levels are comparable to those of many important nutrients such as potassium k and ca and they even greatly exceed phosphate levels epstein and bloom 2005 hydrated silicic acid is taken up via plant roots while si is transferred in its unpolymerised form across the plant by the apoplastic pathway through the xylem raven 1983 epstein 1994 this is driven by the transpiration flow ma and takahashi 2002 faisal et al 2012 which is under active transport liang et al 2006 silicon is deposited in plants in the form of solid amorphous si dioxide sio2 nh2o silica marschner et al 1990 epstein 1994 the extent of silica deposition depends on the mechanism of si uptake which varies across species ma and takahashi 2002 cooke and leishman 2011 silica is usually deposited in or near the epidermis yoshida et al 1962a prychid et al 2004 in grasses si is deposited in long and short epidermal cells bulliform cells guard cells and prickle hairs in the form of phytoliths kaufman et al 1985 once it is deposited in the target cells its relocation is no longer possible raven 1983 epstein 1994 silicon is considered to be a beneficial element for plants because it is important for successful growth of all plants tripathi et al 2016 its positive influence on growth was reported for a wide variety of crops including rice wheat barley and cucumber ma et al 2001 the beneficial effects of si on plants are based on a protective layer of silica that is deposited at the leaf surface the reactivity of the absorbed si with metal ions and other compounds and the metabolic functions of si in stressed plants tubaña and heckman 2015 silicification of leaf tissues prevents herbivory and pathogen infections and increases the rigidity of plant shoots ma and takahashi 2002 in grasses it is a key structural element as it prevents lodging and shading of leaves ma et al 2001 ma and takahashi 2002 moreover hosseini et al 2017 showed that si accumulation in shoots delays osmotic stress induced leaf senescence in barley studies have also investigated the importance of si in increased plant tolerance to enhanced ultraviolet uv radiation levels yao et al 2011 shen et al 2014b chen et al 2016b silicified epidermal structures have been shown to reduce the need for production of energy demanding protective phenolic uv absorbing substances schaller et al 2012 2013 although this has not been supported by all studies klančnik et al 2014a golob et al 2017 silicon also mitigates the negative effects of high temperatures on plants through maintenance of the integrity of cell membranes and increasing the levels of heat shock proteins and antioxidants agarie et al 1998 soundararajan et al 2014 moreover si has an important role in regulation of the nutrient balance in plant tissues and protects plants against toxic metals tripathi et al 2016 the presence of si and ca structures in leaves also affects the distribution of light which can be beneficial if this increases the availability of energy for the lower tissues and prevents photoinhibition in the upper mesophyll setoguchi et al 1989 multiple benefits of si fertilisation for cereals are summarised in artyszak 2018 studies have also described various si deficiency symptoms in plants these include lower shoot dry weight and yield occurrence of necroses and chloroses wilting of leaves susceptibility to various diseases disturbed development of generative organs and fruits and accelerated senescence processes ma and takahashi 2002 most soils are rich in si clayey soils containing from 200 g si kg to 300 g si kg and sandy soils 450 g si kg meena et al 2014 unlike many other elements accumulation of si in plants largely depends on environmental conditions such as water availability and the amount of plant available si in the soil dietrich et al 2003 plant available si levels in the soil depend on soil type generally young mineral soils contain more si than weathered acidic soils farooq and dietz 2015 in spite of the high si levels in soils crops such as wheat barley soybean and sugar beet will likely require si application in the future to maintain maximum yields haynes 2014 since centuries of continuous crop harvesting has resulted in depleted soil pools of bioavailable si vandevenne et al 2011 for example more than 40 of the total agricultural land soil in china is si deficient zhu and gong 2014 in recent decades extreme droughts have been one of the main factors for reduction of cereals production farooq et al 2009 lesk et al 2016 one of the reasons for this might also be related to reduced si uptake si accumulation is also affected by uv radiation levels golob et al 2018 reported a decreased si uptake in hybrid buckwheat under ambient uv radiation while a similar study with a si accumulator crop wheat revealed the opposite golob et al 2017 such uv effects are in line with some recent studies which have revealed that ambient uv radiation is not only a plant stressor but also an important regulator of plant growth and development björn 2015 indeed plant resistance to drought has been shown to be positively related to plant resistance to uv radiation and vice versa alexieva et al 2001 over recent decades our environment has been changing at a global level periods without rain are getting longer which can result in severe droughts on the other hand uv levels are variable due to ozone depletion chipperfield et al 2015 for crop plants uv levels can be greatly reduced through different management practices such as their growth under artificial light and in greenhouses or while protecting them against hail and herbivores using different covers wargent and jordan 2013 with its benefits for plant growth and development si has become an increasingly important element in agriculture cooke and degabriel 2016 tripathi et al 2016 seven out of the 10 most abundant crops in the world are si accumulators as their si tissue content is 1 guntzer et al 2012 these also include barley hordeum vulgare l ma and takahashi 2002 which is one of the oldest crops and has been grown for multiple purposes ullrich 2011 bonafaccia et al 2016 in the present study we aimed to analyse the effects of reduced water availability and reduced ambient uv radiation levels on accumulation of si and some other elements in barley as si uptake is facilitated by transpiration flow we hypothesised that water shortage will hinder the uptake of si and possibly of other elements while reduced ambient uv radiation will worsen any negative effects of such water shortage in addition we examined the reflectance and transmittance spectra of barley leaves as the presence of si and also ca can alter the optical properties and energy balance of leaves klančnik et al 2014a 2014b 2 material and methods

usb connector using a u 4 hobo optic usb base station and a 2 d coupler onset computer corporation 2 5 statistical analysis normal distributions of the data were evaluated using shapiro wilk tests homogeneity of variance from the means was analysed using levene s tests one way analysis of variance anova according to duncanʼs post hoc multiple range tests was used to assess differences between the four treatments for each measured parameter factorial anova was carried out for the measured parameters to test the significance of water availability w and uv radiation uv alone and their interaction w uv to investigate the relationships between the selected leaf traits and environmental conditions or soil parameters pearson s correlation analysis was performed ibm spss statistics 25 0 was used for these statistical calculations with significance accepted at p 0 05 the figure for leaf element contents in barley leaves under the different treatments was drawn in microsoft excel 2016 detrended correspondence analysis was used for the exploratory data analysis using the canoco for windows 4 5 programme package due to the gradient lengths obtained 3 sd ter braak and šmilauer 2002 redundancy analysis was used to determine whether the variations in leaf element contents were related to water availability indicators the significance of the effects of the variables was determined using monte carlo tests with 999 permutations forward selection of the explanatory variables was used to avoid co linearity all of the variables used in the analysis were standardised 3 results 3 1 leaf traits and environmental conditions water availability w w and uv radiation uv uv affected many of the measured parameters for the barley leaves table 1 among the morphological leaf traits water shortage w significantly increased lower epidermis thickness specific leaf area was significantly decreased by low water availability as it was significantly higher under the w uv treatment compared to both w treatments i e w uv w uv reduced uv radiation uv significantly decreased leaf and mesophyll thickness along with stomata length on both leaf surfaces however for the lower leaf surface alone uv significantly increased stomata and prickle hair density the interaction between water availability and uv radiation only resulted in significant differences for cuticle thickness for both leaf surfaces and upper surface prickle hair length which all showed an opposite response to decreasing water availability under the two considered levels of ambient uv radiation with decreasing water availability cuticle thickness slightly increased when under reduced uv radiation and markedly decreased under ambient uv radiation for both leaf surfaces both upper and lower cuticle were thickest under the control treatment w uv while the thinnest cuticles were observed for the well watered plants under reduced uv radiation w uv upper surface prickle hair length also revealed distinct decreases under ambient uv radiation while it increased under reduced uv radiation with decreasing water availability significantly shorter upper surface prickle hairs compared to all the other treatments were found in the water deprived plants when under ambient uv radiation w uv the photosynthetic pigments i e chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids were all significantly affected by the interaction between water availability and uv radiation in a similar way table 1 namely with decreasing water availability their contents increased under reduced ambient uv radiation while they decreased under ambient uv radiation they were all lowest for the w uv group and highest for the w uv group anthocyanins were only significantly affected by water availability showing higher contents under reduced water availability the highest anthocyanin contents were observed for the w uv group on the other hand uv absorbing compounds showed no significant differences among the treatment groups nevertheless their contents were highest under the w uv treatment and lowest under the w uv treatment for the potential photochemical efficiency the lower water availability treatments i e w uv w uv did not significantly affect the barley plant vitality as also seen for the effective photochemical efficiency conversely under these water shortage conditions the stomatal conductance of the barley leaves was significantly decreased table 1 the reflectance and transmittance spectra of the barley leaves did not show pronounced differences between these four treatments although some colour regions differed significantly table 1 for reflectance water shortage w resulted in significant increase in the visible and nir regions while reduced uv radiation uv significantly increased the uv b region exclusively on the other hand transmittance was significantly decreased by water shortage w and significantly increased by reduced uv radiation uv in both uv regions moreover water shortage alone w significantly increased transmittance of light in the green region the interaction between water availability and uv radiation was only significant for transmittance in the nir region it showed an increase with decreasing water availability which was more pronounced in the case of reduced uv radiation the amount of transmitted light was thus significantly higher in the w uv treatment but did not differ from the control w uv under the remaining two treatments i e w uv w uv in general reflectance and transmittance were highest under the most stressful treatment w uv with the lowest transmittance under the control conditions w uv and the least light reflected under the w uv treatment measurements of the plant environmental conditions i e soil radiation showed the expected marked decreases in soil moisture from the w to w treatments as for the uv b radiation levels from the uv to uv treatments table 1 however the soil temperatures and par levels were not significantly affected by these two factors either alone or in terms of their interactions at the start of the experimental period the soil moisture levels ranged from 16 7 to 23 7 with no significant differences among these four treatments the element analysis of the barley leaves indicated marked and generally significant decreases with decreased water availability i e w vs w for almost all of the elements examined i e si p s cl ca with the exception of k fig 1 these reached significance for si cl and ca leaf p content was lower for w in comparison to both w treatments although significance was only reached for the w uv treatment versus the w treatments for the leaf s content the decrease from w to w treatments did not reach significance only for w uv versus w uv as indicated contrary to other elements examined k was not significantly affected by the reduced water availability under these treatments redundancy analysis revealed strong positive relationships between almost all of the elements determined in this study again with the exception of k and also for soil water content and stomatal conductance fig 2 here soil water content alone explained 43 and stomatal conductance alone 36 of the variability of the element composition of these barley leaves when considered together soil water content explained 43 p 0 002 variability and stomatal conductance included an additional 8 p 0 040 variability the samples formed two distinct groups according to the water availability 3 2 soil element composition and structure and plant available si levels in the soil total soil si and ca levels did not show any significant differences among the treatments table 2 plant available si cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil were significantly lower under the w uv treatment in comparison to all the other treatments the texture of the soil was 49 2 2 7 sand 37 2 2 7 silt and 13 6 0 3 clay and thus it was identified as loamy the further soil parameters were ph 7 1 0 1 available p 75 8 3

leaf traits environmental conditions and some soil parameters the reflectance of light was significantly negatively related p 0 05 to leaf si content throughout the whole spectrum however the reflectance showed a significant and marked negative relationship p 0 01 with leaf ca content in the violet and blue regions of the spectrum only in addition reflectance was significantly negatively related p 0 05 to specific leaf area in the uv a uv b violet blue and nir regions and correlated positively p 0 05 with upper surface stomata as well as prickle hair densities in both uv regions for upper surface stomata density positive correlation p 0 05 with reflectance was also found in the violet blue and nir regions the transmittance of light in both of the uv regions was significantly positively related p 0 05 to both leaf si and ca contents moreover the transmittance in the nir region was significantly negatively related p 0 05 to leaf si and ca contents similar to the redundancy analysis pearson s correlation analysis revealed strong positive relationships between the leaf contents of almost all of the elements examined i e except for k and the soil moisture level p 0 01 and the stomatal conductance p 0 05 almost all of the elements considered in this study i e again with the exception of k showed significant positive correlations p 0 05 with one another leaf si contents did not correlate with total soil si levels while they showed weak positive correlation with plant available si cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil p 0 05 plant available si levels in the soil were significantly positively related to soil moisture levels p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 effects of water availability in terms of the effects of the water availability most were observed in both of the water deprived groups i e w uv w uv this was expected because water shortage directly affects plant growth through reduction of transpiration photosynthetic activity and cell division and growth rate larcher 2003 duman 2012 the present study also revealed a significant decrease in stomatal conductance although there were no significant changes in the potential and effective photochemical efficiencies of psii this thus indicates that stomatal regulation enabled the maintenance of a favourable water regime and that the photoprotective mechanisms such as the xanthophyll cycle bernal et al 2015 appeared to prevent photochemical stress the water shortage w also altered the morphological properties of these barley leaves with significantly decreased cuticle thickness and significantly increased epidermis thickness and significantly decreased specific leaf area the increase in anthocyanin content under reduced water availability on the other hand goes well in line with their important role in drought tolerance gould 2004 the thick cuticle and thin epidermal layer in the control well watered w plants were probably a consequence of their better si supply faisal et al 2012 si soluble fraction is redox and ph dependent ma and takahashi 2002 ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 mm in soil solutions epstein 2001 sommer et al 2006 miles et al 2014 examined the relation between cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil and soil ph for 112 soils and found that these levels ranged from about 10 mg kg of soil dm at ph 4 to about 100 mg kg of soil dm at ph 7 however in our study cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil ranged from 20 6 mg kg of soil dm to 23 6 mg kg of soil dm at soil ph 7 1 these values were positively related to soil moisture levels which is a consequence of the capillary rise of water containing dissolved si sio2 nh2o kozlowski 1987 comparison of a rainforest site with a sugarcane site in northern queensland australia showed that cacl2 extractable si levels in the soil were 13 1 mg kg and 5 3 mg kg respectively indicating that crops deplete si supplying ability of the soil haynes 2014 keller et al 2012 estimated that under a temperate climate the exportation of si due to straw removal would result in depletion of the initial phytogenic si in soils within a few decades although the degree of water shortage used in this study did not impose stress on these plants it significantly decreased the uptake of almost all of the elements studied here with the exception of k indeed k influences a number of physiological and biochemical processes in plants that are involved in their resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses wang et al 2013 k is also an important inorganic osmolyte in plants and it has a crucial role in osmotic adjustment under drought conditions hawkesford et al 2012 therefore the maintenance of the k levels in plants is crucial for plant survival during periods of water shortage chen et al 2016a water availability also affected the p content in these barley leaves the lowest p content was seen for the w uv treatment phosphate ions move through the soil by diffusion and therefore water shortage in the soil i e w will decrease their mobility da silva et al 2011 on the other hand high p availability increases the plant sensitivity to uv radiation murali and teramura 1985 he and dijkstra 2014 also reported that drought leads to decreased plant n and p levels with this effect greater for p moreover leaf p content appears to be related to leaf si content as also shown in the present study sufficient si availability can reduce the need of plants for p as si fertilisation of soils with insufficient p results in increased plant production ma and takahashi 2002 deren 1997 also reported increased p levels following application of si fertiliser silicon was the most affected element in terms of the water availability the negative effects of drought might be mitigated by si uptake maghsoudi et al 2015 ma et al 2016 marques et al 2016 the content of si in the leaves of the well watered barley plants w in this study reached 2 5 and when these plants were under water shortage w this remained relatively high 1 in comparison to other plant species ma and takahashi 2002 in an experiment with barley subjected to osmotic stress under low or high k supply and under two si regimes leaf si contents ranged from less than 1 mg si g dm to 6 5 mg si g dm hosseini et al 2017 by deposition of si in different plant parts the plants generally improve their water retention capacity and optimise their water use efficiency gao et al 2004 ma et al 2004 ahmed et al 2011 water loss by transpiration takes place not only through the stomata but also through the cuticle ma and takahashi 2002 therefore incrustation of the cuticle together with wax deposition reduces water loss yoshida et al 1962b postek 1981 ma and takahashi 2002 si also strengthens the cell walls of the root endodermis thereby preventing water loss from the roots when there is a decrease in soil water potential lux et al 2002 additionally si can improve the hydraulic conductivity of plant roots shi et al 2016 the role of si is also related to gene regulation as it can regulate water uptake by promotion of expression of the genes that code for aquaporins in water channels liu et al 2014 while also increasing the expression of certain transcription factors involved in drought acclimatisation khattab et al 2014 si also has a role in osmotic regulation through changes in the levels of osmotic regulators such as proline and soluble carbohydrates crusciol et al 2009 pereira et al 2013 mauad et al 2016 studies have also revealed interactions between si and ca with changes in ca and micronutrient levels in leaf tissues reported to be related to si availability during plant growth brackhage et al 2013 the study of greger et al 2018 showed that si fertilisation increased the uptake of mg ca s mn and mo and decreased the uptake of fe cu and zn while the uptake of k p n cl and b was not affected the effects were similar across different experimental plant species and soil types the positive relationship between si and ca s p and cl but not between si and k was observed in the present study it was reported that the amount of phosphate ions released into the soil solution increases with increasing levels of h4sio4 tubaña and heckman 2015 in comparison to si ca accumulation was less affected by water availability as well as si ca is involved in plant drought resistance xu et al 2013 through improved membrane integrity duman 2012 and its involvement in the signalling of drought resistance responses shao et al 2008 contrary to the positive correlation between si and ca in barley a study by liang 1999 did not reveal interactions between these two elements however brackhage et al 2013 investigated reeds and showed that ca levels decreased as si levels increased while a study of leaf water content of wheat showed that ca levels were positively related to si levels mali and aery 2008 as also shown in the present study 4 2 effects of uv radiation an impact of reduced uv radiation was expected as uv radiation is an important evolutionary factor that has shaped plant growth and development björn 2015 manipulating uv levels is becoming more and more important in agriculture wargent and jordan 2013 barley usually grows in areas with high light intensity in the present study the reduced uv radiation uv led to decreased leaf and cuticle thickness and prickle hair density and to increased chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents while showing no significant effects on element contents we did note here a small beneficial impact of ambient uv radiation on si content in the leaves of the barley plants exposed to water shortage i e w uv although this did not reach significance due to high inter sample variability here the si level in water deprived plants under ambient uv radiation i e w uv was 63 of that in the well watered plants i e w uv while it was only 48 under the reduced uv radiation w uv a reverse trend was observed for p studies using enhanced uv b radiation have revealed decreased p levels in plants yue et al 1998 while the combination of uv b radiation and drought can significantly increase the p k ca and mg contents in soybean leaves shen et al 2014a although this is not in line with the results of the present study the absence of negative effects under the present ambient uv radiation in barley was possibly the consequence of its efficient mechanisms to cope with such uv radiation levels and even to benefit from them jansen et al 2012 sen mandi 2016 4 3 combined effects of water availability and uv radiation high uv radiation levels and water shortage can often occur together in nature and the responses of plants to these parameters trigger similar changes in their leaf traits comont et al 2012 it has been shown that uv b radiation mitigates water shortage stress by lowering stomatal conductance and reducing leaf area by inhibition of cell division nogués et al 1998 this was not the case in the barley leaves in the present study as the reduced uv radiation and degree of water shortage used here did not impose stress on the experimental plants the only such observed combined effect of reduced water availability and reduced uv radiation was the reduction of leaf cuticle thickness 4 4 effects of treatments on the optical properties of barley leaves reflectance and transmittance showed some small effects under reduced water availability and reduced uv radiation water shortage w significantly increased the reflectance in the visible and nir regions while reduced uv radiation uv had the same effect in the uv b region only this appears to be due to the differences in si levels as the reflectance of light was negatively related to the leaf si content across all regions of the spectrum a negative relationship between reflectance and leaf ca content was seen for the violet and blue regions only in previous studies a protective role against strong light was ascribed to si structures at the leaf surface i e in the cuticle and prickle hairs that increased the reflection especially in the uv region and thereby reduced uv penetration into the deeper leaf tissues klančnik et al 2014a 2014b prickle hairs were also shown to have the same role in the present study increased tolerance to uv radiation due to si has been associated with expression of the lsi1 gene which encodes the transporter for si uptake in plants ma and yamaji 2008 expression of this gene also facilitates the expression of some other genes that are crucial for increased plant tolerance to uv radiation as they are involved in both repair of photodamage and detoxification mechanisms fang et al 2011 chen et al 2016b 5 conclusions the moderate water shortage and reduced uv radiation treatments used in the present study did not stress these barley plants as revealed by the photochemical efficiency of psii however the photosynthetic pigments and anthocyanins were significantly affected by either one of the two studied factors or their interaction other leaf traits were only slightly affected by these two factors which is also apparent from the minor differences in the leaf optical properties the differences in the reflectance and transmittance spectra of these barley leaves were related to the si and ca levels water shortage alone w significantly reduced the uptake of si ca p s and cl but not of k while reduced uv radiation resulted in slightly decreased si accumulation in the water deprived plants i e w uv vs w uv leaf si content was positively related to plant available si levels in the soil and these showed positive correlation with soil moisture levels the present study has thus revealed that barley plants have efficient mechanisms to resist this moderate water shortage w without undergoing stress and that ambient uv radiation uv contributes to this plant protection as reduced uv radiation uv decreases si uptake acknowledgements the authors are grateful to christopher berrie

alluvial valley lmav is the largest floodplain and one of the most productive agricultural regions in the united states irrigation is widely used in this region to improve crop production and resource use efficiency due to a mismatch between crop water requirements and precipitation timing and quantity during the growing season in the recent decades aquifer decline caused by groundwater withdrawals for irrigation has been recognized as a critical environmental issue threatening water security and agricultural sustainability in the lmav to improve agricultural water use efficiency and reduce groundwater withdrawals it is pivotal to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of crop irrigation water requirements iwr in this study we analyzed future climate changes over the lmav cropland areas and estimated future iwr changes for major crops in the 21st century using two climate scenarios i e rcp45 and rcp85 and two crop growth duration length gdl scenarios i e fixed gdl gdl does not change with time and varied gdl gdl changes with time results show that croplands in the lmav would experience continuous warming and either no significant change or a decreasing level of precipitation under the rcp45 and the rcp85 if keeping current cropland areas and cropping systems unchanged average crop iwr by the end of the 21st century would increase by 4 2 under the rcp45 varied gdl scenario 14 5 under the rcp45 fixed gdl scenario 9 2 under the rcp85 varied gdl scenario and 29 4 under the rcp85 fixed gdl scenario the greatest increases would occur in the summer months aquifer levels in the lmav therefore are expected to decline at an accelerated pace if no effective mitigation strategies are implemented this study made the first attempt to reveal the spatially explicit crop iwr and its future changes in the lmav which provides a scientific basis for developing management strategies that can enhance water use efficiency and improve agriculture sustainability keywords aquifer decline agricultural water management climate change water conservation groundwater withdrawal 1 introduction lower mississippi alluvial valley lmav is the largest floodplain in the u s jenkins et al 2010 it includes a part of seven states extending from southern illinois to the gulf of mexico with more than 85 of the land area situated in arkansas mississippi and louisiana the rich alluvial soils received from sediment additions from mississippi river support highly productive terrestrial ecosystems putnam et al 1960 bottomland forests and wetlands were once widely distributed across this region as a result of the flat terrain poorly drained soils and wet climate condition at present the lmav becomes one of the most important agricultural regions in the u s for rice soybean corn and cotton productions associated with the intensified agricultural activities multiple environmental issues have gradually emerged such as greenhouse gas emissions jenkins et al 2010 soil erosion and nutrient leaching alexander et al 2008 water quality degradation ouyang et al 2014 hypoxia in the gulf of mexico mcisaac et al 2001 rabalais et al 2002 turner and rabalais 1994 and groundwater depletion konikow 2015 ouyang et al 2018 reba et al 2017 scott et al 1998 at the global level irrigated cropland represents 20 of total cropland area but contributes 40 food production siebert et al 2005 and 70 freshwater withdrawals siebert et al 2010 in the u s irrigated cropland is about 22 6 million ha usda 2014 and irrigation water withdrawals account for 42 of total freshwater withdrawals dieter et al 2018 irrigation is one of the major management practices in the lmav to maintain optimum crop growth and high crop production because the timing and quantity of precipitation fail to meet crop growth requirement it is noted that the expansion of irrigated cropland has led to significant aquifer decline in the lower mississippi river basin over recent decades reba et al 2017 largely due to irrigation water withdrawals the mississippi embayment of gulf coastal plain aquifer shows the largest volumes of groundwater depletion in the u s konikow 2015 reba et al 2017 which threatens the sustainability of water supply and agricultural production aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gleeson et al 2012 to solve this problem numerous mitigation strategies have been suggested to enhance irrigation efficiency and reduce groundwater withdrawals such as on farm storage pond construction ouyang et al 2018 and irrigation technology improvement evans and sadler 2008 stubbs 2015 to design effective strategies for lessening irrigation water use we need a clear understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of crop irrigation water needs in the lmav massey et al 2017 estimated the irrigation rates for major crops through a power conversion coefficient approach and found a much higher irrigation rate in rice paddy than other crops however literature regarding irrigation water use in the lmav is very limited and it is still unclear how climate change and human management practices will affect regional crop irrigation water needs in the future this knowledge gap restricts our ability to project future water resources availability and design appropriate strategies to maintain or enhance crop production future climate changes play a critical role in affecting crop irrigation water use through altering crop evapotranspiration rate precipitation amount and crop growing season length evans and sadler 2008 according to general circulation model gcm projections the climate warming in the 21st century is very likely to continue or even be accelerated in the mississippi river basin e g knutti and sedláček 2013 melillo 2014 tao et al 2014 in contrast the pattern of precipitation changes in the southeast u s is subject to large uncertainties kunkel et al 2013 additionally it is not clear how the crop growing season will change in the future some previous studies reported that climate warming shortened crop growing season he et al 2015 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 while others reported that a change in crop cultivar could extend crop growth duration and partially counteracted the impact of climate warming liu et al 2012 2010 sacks and kucharik 2011 crop irrigation water requirement has been investigated previously by both simple crop

crop iwr in the lmav we included eight sets of future climate data simulated by four gcms under two climate scenarios i e the rcp45 and the rcp85 and designed two future crop growth season length scenarios for seven major crop types specific objectives of this study are to 1 understand the patterns of changing temperature and precipitation in the 21st century by analyzing the downscaled and bias corrected climate projections 2 quantify future patterns of regional and crop specific iwr under the impacts of climate change and cultivar change and 3 discuss potential mitigation strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawals for irrigation while improving water crop sustainability in the lmav 2 material and methods 2 1 study domain the lmav covers portions of seven states including illinois kentucky missouri tennessee arkansas mississippi and louisiana the fertile alluvial soils support highly productive ecosystems putnam et al 1960 landscape in the lmav is relatively flat elevation in the south is 0 20 meters and 80 100 meters in the north with an average of 41 m figure s1 in this study we used the united states environmental protection agency epa level iii ecoregion https www epa

ha land area prior to the 17th century 8 10 million ha bottomland hardwood forests were widely distributed across this region stanturf et al 2000 however since the european settlement a large fraction of wetlands were drained and vegetation types were substantially changed by human activities currently most of the bottomland forests have been cleared for agricultural use king et al 2006 according to the köppen geiger classification system peel et al 2007 the lmav is situated in a temperate rainy climate zone during the 20 years between 1991 and 2010 average temperature is 17 6 c and average precipitation is 1363 mm yr 1 figure s2 annual temperature decreases from 20 c in the south to 15 c in the north precipitation declines with distance from the gulf of mexico and annual precipitation decreases from 1600 mm yr 1 in the south to 1200 mm yr 1 in the north monthly temperatures are higher in summer months of june 26 1 c july 27 6 c august 27 3 c and september 23 9 c figure s3 the

crop type distribution in the lmav fig 1 as indicated by this dataset lmav cropland including fallow land is 6 million ha accounting for 53 of the lmav land area we selected seven major row crops and one double cropping system to assess crop iwr the selected row crops are corn cotton rice sorghum soybean sugarcane and winter wheat and the double cropping system is winter wheat paired with soybeans table 1 areas of selected crops represent 90 of the total cropland area including fallow land in the lmav crops with the largest cultivation areas include soybean 2 75 million ha rice 0 96 million ha corn 0 66 million ha and cotton 0 56 million ha which respectively represent 46 16 1 11 1 and 9 3 of the lmav cropland area we further aggregated the 30 m usgs cdl data to a spatial resolution of 1 16 latitude longitude fig 2 to be consistent with climate data section 2 2 2 for further analysis 2 2 2 climate data we used two types of daily climate datasets 1 observation based climate and 2 model simulated climate first we collected observation based daily climate data maximum minimum temperature and precipitation during 1991 2010 from the long term hydrologically based dataset of land surface fluxes and states livneh et al 2013 the livneh data hereinafter this dataset was developed from 20 000 noaa weather station observations and has been available from 1915 to 2011 at a spatial resolution of 1 16 latitude longitude we used the livneh data to show contemporary climate conditions in the lmav and estimate the phenological heat units phus required for crops to reach maturity second we collected a new statistically downscaled climate data maximum minimum temperature precipitation and wind speed over the period of 1991 2099 simulated by four gcms under the rcp45 and the rcp85 climatic scenarios https climate northwestknowledge net maca the four gcms are ccsm4 gent et al 2011 gfdl esm2g dunne et al 2012 ipsl cm5a lr dufresne et al 2013 and miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 gcm simulations had been corrected according to the observation based livneh data and downscaled to a spatial resolution of 1 16 latitude longitude using the method of multivariate adapted constructed analogs maca therefore the model simulated datasets are consistent with the observation based livneh dataset in terms of magnitude and spatial resolution advantages of the maca approach and detailed procedures of the maca downscaling and bias correction are described in abatzoglou and brown 2012 in total eight sets of downscaled climate simulations 4 gcms 2 scenarios were processed to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of crop iwr during 1991 2099 2 3 estimation of crop irrigation water requirement 2 3 1 irrigation water requirement equation unless stated otherwise crop iwr in this study refers to the net iwr which is the quantity of required water for optimum crop growth and does not include water transportation loss we used the equation in döll and siebert 2002 and smith 1992 to estimate daily crop iwr mm day 1 1 i w r m a x 0 k c e t 0 p e f f where e t 0 is crop specific daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 computed according to the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 k c is the crop coefficient to convert e t 0 to actual crop evapotranspiration and p e f f is effective precipitation mm day 1 available for crop use and can be stored in soil fao56 penman monteith equation is the most widely used algorithm to quantify crop reference evapotranspiration pereira et al 2015 differences in canopy resistance radiation reflection crop height canopy coverage and root depth lead to divergent evapotranspiration rates allen et al 1998 time varying k c was used to account for variations of these factors over different growth periods to estimate k c crop growing season is divided into four phenological stages which are initial s1 canopy development s2 mid season s3 and maturation s4 respectively usda 1993 fig 3 illustrates a conceptual diagram of crop phenological stages in this study k c out of crop growing season was set to 0 and k c in crop growing season was computed using the three k c parameters k c at initial stage kcini k c peak value kcp and k c at maturity kcm in table 2 in combination with the lengths of phenological stages fig 3 k c in mid season was equal to kcp and k c in canopy development stage and maturation stage were computed through linear interpolation p e f f is a part of precipitation available for crop use that does not run off döll and siebert 2002 in this study we estimated p e f f by following smith 1992

precipitation for crop use in the next few days döll and siebert 2002 and smith 1992 calculated the multi day average precipitation to represent the lag effect of high precipitation on soil moisture 10 day average was applied for crops except rice while 3 day period was used for rice because the soil in rice paddy is usually saturated and has low capacity to store precipitation döll and siebert 2002 found that the simulated crop iwr using eq 1 agreed well with the independent state level statistics in the u s solley et al 1998 giving us more confidence in using eq 1 to estimate crop iwr in the lmav uncertainties from this simplified algorithms of iwr and effective precipitation are discussed in section 4 4 2 3 2 crop phenology previous studies reported that crop growing season was shortened by climate warming e g he et al 2015 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 while some other studies found little or no change in crop growing season length as the improved crop cultivar lengthened vegetative growth period for biomass accumulation and counteracted the climate effect e g liu et al 2012 2010 sacks and kucharik 2011 as it is uncertain how crop cultivars would be changed in the future we designed two growth duration length gdl scenarios to estimate crop iwr in the first scenario we assumed crop cultivars change with time to maintain a similar growing season length as the historical level the fixed gdl scenario hereinafter in the second scenario we assumed crop cultivars do not change and gdl is determined by temperature and the accumulated phenological heat units the varied gdl scenario hereinafter we assumed that time fractions of s1 s2 s3 and s4 stages to the entire growing season fs1 fs2 fs3 and fs4 in fig 3 do not change with time although crop gdl may change in the future crop specific parameters of fs1 fs2 fs3 and fs4 table 2 were compiled from usda report usda 1993 allen et al 1998 and döll and siebert 2002 it is noted that fs1 for rice was set to 0 because rice initial stage is seedling nursery which happens before plantation rice iwr in the nursery stage was not considered in this study 2 3 2 1 observed growth duration length based on the usda report usda agricultural handbook usda 2010 provides the beginning date most active period and end date of crop planting and harvesting for major crops at the state level these dates were acquired from 20 year crop progress inventory data and specialists knowledge we used the mean day of the most active periods to denote the planting and harvesting dates for each selected crop in each state see figure s4 and s5 gdl was estimated by counting the days between crop planting date and harvesting date figure s6 it is noteworthy that sugarcane mostly in louisiana has usually been cultivated over a 4 year cycle greenland 2005 which is quite different from other selected field crops for sugarcane in louisiana the most active planting dates were between august 18 and september 21 and the most active harvesting dates were between october 18 and december 17 of the next year usda 2010 after the first harvest sugarcane root and lower above ground parts were left in the field and regrew to become ratoon crop during the 4 year cycle sugarcane is harvested three times 2 3 2 2 estimated growth duration length based on heat units we used the concept of phenological heat units phus in the agricultural module of the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 and the community land model clm drewniak et al 2013 to estimate inter annual variations of gdl for crops except sugarcane as sugarcane harvest in the u s is not determined by the accumulated temperature see explanation in the next paragraph for each 1 16 latitude longitude grid total phus in crop growing season to reach maturity tphus c was calculated by the 20 year average livneh daily temperature 3a t p h u s i p l a n t i n g d a t e h a r v e s t i n g d a t e h u i 3b h u i m a x 0 t m a x i t m i n i 2 t b a s e where i is the day between planting date and harvesting date planting and harvesting dates are from the usda 2010 report h u i is daily heat unit c t m a x i and t m i n i are daily maximum and minimum temperatures from the 20 year 1991 2010 average livneh data and t b a s e is base temperature required for crop growth which is set to 5 c as in the swat and clm in the varied gdl scenario we assumed that t p h u s are constant in both historical and future periods crop is harvested when the accumulated h u i based on the model simulated climate reaches the t p h u s obtained from the 20 year average livneh data one exception is sugarcane of which phenology and gdl had no correlation with temperature this is mainly because sugarcane in the u s is harvested before physiological maturity and the harvest date is controlled by the pre established contract with the sugar mill greenland 2005 thus we assumed that sugarcane gdl is fixed in both the varied gdl and the fixed gdl scenarios after the harvesting dates were determined we used parameters of fs1 fs2 fs3 and fs4 in table 2 to estimate the start and end of each phenological stage some global models simulate crop planting dates by air temperature e g bondeau et al 2007 stehfest et al 2007 however this climatically determined planting date has not been widely tested and validated sacks et al 2010 thus we assumed crop planting dates remain the same as that in the historical period for both the varied gdl and the fixed gdl scenarios 3 results 3 1 projected temperature and precipitation changes according to the average of four gcms future temperature would increase significantly mann kendall non parametric trend test p value 0 05 same hereafter under the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios fig 4 compared with the historical period of 1991 2005 lmav temperature in the middle of the 21st century mid period 2040 2059 would increase by 1 4 c and 1 7 c under the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively however by the end of the 21st century late period 2080 2099 the increased temperature is projected to be 1 8 c and 3 8 c under the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively spatial patterns of temperature changes show that the northern lmav would have a higher temperature increase than that in the southern lmav fig 5 we found that the trend in precipitation is not significant under the rcp45 scenario p value 0 05 and precipitation is projected to decrease significantly under the rcp85 scenario during the period of 1991 2099 p value 0 05 fig 4 compared with the historical period of 1991 2005 precipitation in the mid 21st century would decrease by 21 2 mm yr 1 1 4 under the rcp45 scenario but increase by 13 2 mm yr 1 0 8 under the rcp85 scenario in the late 21st century precipitation would decrease by 3 1 mm yr 1 0 2 and 102 4 mm yr 1 6 5 under the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively the largest precipitation decrease under the rcp45 would be in the northwest of the lmav while the largest precipitation reduction under the rcp85 would be in the central and southern parts fig 5 future climate change is projected to present distinct monthly variations under the rcp45 and the rcp85 temperature would show greater increases in spring march april and may summer june july and august and fall september october and november than in winter december january and february fig 6 for example in the late 21st century of the rcp85 temperature would increase by 4 1 c 3 9 c and 3 9 c in spring summer and fall and increase by 3 2 c in winter similarly the changes in precipitation would show apparent monthly variations summer is projected to have the largest precipitation reduction and fall would have the largest precipitation increase for example over the late 21st century of the rcp85 summer precipitation would decrease by 35 7 mm month 1 21 and fall precipitation would increase by 22 mm month 1 19 7 as summer is the major growing season for many crops in the lmav a reduced summer precipitation is likely to cause an increased crop iwr 3 2 growth duration length we estimated crop iwr under two gdl scenarios i e the varied gdl and the fixed gdl for the fixed gdl we used the gdl derived from the usda report usda 2010 to represent gdl over the entire study period of 1991 2099 for the varied gdl gdl was estimated based on the accumulated phus in this scenario gdl for all the selected crops is projected to show a continuous decline under both the rcp45 and the rcp85 figure s7 according to the averaged results from the four gcms crop gdl in the mid 21st century for the selected crops would decrease by 10 18 days under the rcp45 scenario and 14 24 days under the rcp85 scenario crop gdl in the late 21st century would be shortened by 14 23 days under the rcp45 and 24 38 days under the rcp85 table 3 3 3 reference evapotranspiration as estimated by the fao56 penman monteith equation future climate changes would lead to higher e t 0 under the rcp45 and the rcp85 fig 7 the averaged results from the four gcms show that annual e t 0 in the mid 21st century would increase by 62 7 mm yr 1 4 6 under the rcp45 and by 71 7 mm yr 1 5 3 under the rcp85 relative to the historical period 1991 2005 annual e t 0 in the late 21st century would increase by 76 mm yr 1 5 6 under the rcp45 and by 157 1 mm yr 1 11 6 under the rcp85 particularly monthly e t 0 in spring and summer would show a greater increase than in fall and winter figure s8 3 4 irrigation water requirement for the fixed gdl scenario crop iwr is projected to increase for all crops figure s9 s17 in the varied gdl scenario crop iwr would increase for all crops except winter wheat fig 8 we used the results in the varied gdl and the fixed gdl scenarios to represent the lower and upper boundaries of our estimates averaged results from four gcms show that crop iwr under the rcp45 would increase by 12 6 35 mm yr 1 avg 1 std dev same hereafter 4 2 in the varied gdl scenario and 44 3 41 1 mm yr 1 14 5 in the fixed gdl scenario over the late 21st century relative to the historical period 1991 2005 fig 8 under the rcp85 crop iwr would increase by 27 8 25 5 mm yr 1 9 2 in the varied gdl scenario and 89 7 28 5 mm yr 1 29 4 in the fixed gdl scenario in the late 21st century soybean iwr would increase by 5 7 15 1 under the rcp45 and by 12 4 30 2 under the rcp85 rice iwr would increase by 1 7 13 5 under the rcp45 and by 3 2 25 5 under the rcp85 however winter wheat iwr would diverge in changing directions between the varied gdl scenario and the fixed gdl scenario during the late 21st century winter wheat iwr would change between 10 1 and 23 under the rcp45 and between 17 8 and 51 4 under the rcp85 in the historical period 1991 2005 crops in the lmav require 16 2 109 varied gdl 16 3 109 fixed gdl m3 yr 1 water for irrigation use table 4 under the rcp45 scenario crop iwr in the late 21st century would be 16 9 109 18 7 109 m3 yr 1 which is 4 2 14 5 more water than in the historical period under the rcp85 scenario crops in the late 21st century would need 17 7 109 21 1 109 m3 yr 1 water for irrigation which is 9 2 29 4 more water than in the historical period in term of total irrigation amount soybeans require the most irrigation water as a result of its largest plantation area accounting for 43 of the total amount of crop iwr in the lmav rice corn and cotton account for approximately 29 11 and 10 respectively of the total amount of crop iwr fig 9 shows the spatial pattern of the changes in future iwr relative to the historical period over the late 21st century the increased iwr under the rcp45 fixed gdl scenario would be larger in the northern lmav which corresponds to a higher temperature increase and a greater precipitation reduction for the fixed gdl the rcp85 scenario the increased iwr in the late 21st century would be over 90 mm yr 1 across most cropland areas in the lmav except the northeast the greatest iwr increase would be in the northwest where rice is the major crop type contrasts between the upper panel and lower panel of fig 9 shows a lower increases in crop iwr under the varied gdl scenario than under the fixed gdl scenario indicating that if crop cultivars do not change in future the shortened crop growing season would partially offset the enhanced crop iwr crop iwr in the lmav presents distinct seasonal variations with the highest rate during may september fig 10 for the varied gdl scenario under the rcp45 and the rcp85 future crop iwr would increase substantially in june and july but decrease in september and october due to the shortened crop growing season in the late 21st century crop iwr in june and july is projected to increase by 11 5 mm month 1 and 21 mm month 1 in the rcp45 and 28 7 mm month 1 and 35 5 mm month 1 in the rcp85 respectively while crop iwr in september and october is projected to decrease by 19 9 mm month 1 and 9 mm month 1 in the rcp45 and 37 5 mm month 1 and 9 5 mm month 1 in the rcp85 respectively for the fixed gdl scenario under the rcp45 and the rcp85 future iwr would increase in each month of crop growing season july and august are the months with the largest crop iwr increase in the late 21st century crop iwr in july and august is projected to increase by 11 8 mm month 1 and 11 5 mm month 1 in the rcp45 and 27 4 mm month 1 and 26 2 mm month 1 in the rcp85 respectively the increased summer iwr could largely be attributed to the increased temperature and decreased precipitation during summer months fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of future climate change on crop irrigation water requirement investigation of future changes in crop irrigation requirement has been an important research topic in the scientific community for decades at the global level future climate change was found to largely increase average crop iwr if mitigation strategies are not applied fischer et al 2007 however the changed crop iwr would show significant regional differences due to the spatial variations of future climate changes for example crop iwr in zimbabwe was projected to increase by 17 205 in the 2090s nkomozepi and chung 2012 and maize in northeast china would demand more frequent irrigation xu et al 2019 while climate change would not cause appreciable changes in total irrigation water use in bangladesh rice paddy shahid 2011 our estimated iwr for major row crops in the historical period is consistent with the observation based estimates through a power conversion coefficient approach massey et al 2017 and model based estimates in the mississippi delta tang et al 2018 in the lmav climate warming would result in large increases in crop reference evapotranspiration by the end of the 21st century 5 6 under the rcp45 and 11 6 under the rcp85 meanwhile summer precipitation would decrease by 21 under the rcp85 the projected increase in temperature and reduction in precipitation together would result in a significant increase in future crop iwr in this region particularly for summer months the high warming climate condition the rcp85 would have a stronger influence in enhancing crop iwr than the relatively lower warming climate condition the rcp45 4 2 irrigation efficiency gross iwr is the total water withdrawals to maintain optimum crop growth a large fraction of water withdrawn from lakes rivers and aquifers is lost when water travels through canals and crop fields brouwer et al 1989 total water withdrawals therefore must be larger than the net iwr to cover water conveyance loss and soil evaporation loss the term of irrigation efficiency the ratio of net iwr to gross iwr represents the share of irrigation water that can be utilized by crops compared to total water withdrawal brouwer et al 1989 döll and siebert 2002 wisser et al 2008 according to döll and siebert 2002 average irrigation efficiency is 0 6 in the u s with significant variations among crop types and irrigation systems irrigation efficiency for rice is even lower because rice needs flooding irrigation method döll and siebert 2002 if irrigation efficiency in the lmav does not improve in the future or is maintained at 0 6 water withdrawal for crop irrigation in the late 21st century would increase by 1 2 109 4 2 109 m3 yr 1 under the rcp45 and 2 5 109 8 2 109 m3 yr 1 under the rcp85 compared with the historical period pressurized irrigation methods e g sprinklers and micro irrigation systems could substantially enhance water use efficiency and reduce environmental burdens compared to traditional gravity irrigation systems levidow et al 2014 since the 1980s u s farmers have started to shift from gravity irrigation systems to pressurized irrigation systems stubbs 2015 however gravity irrigation systems now are still widely utilized over a large percentage of irrigated cropland in the lmav in mississippi state for example gravity irrigation systems are still applied over 70 of irrigated croplands usda 2013 farm and ranch irrigation survey https www nass usda gov publications agcensus 2012 compared to 30 in western states stubbs 2015 this contrast between the lmav and western states indicates a large potential in the lmav to reduce water loss and improve irrigation efficiency through the adoption of newer pressurized irrigation systems 4 3 irrigation strategies to reduce irrigation water withdrawals results in this study show that future climate and crop cultivar change would enhance cropland evapotranspiration and consequently irrigation water requirement if no efficient mitigation strategies are designed and implemented aquifer decline in the future would occur at an accelerated pace to conserve water resources and improve agricultural sustainability in the lmav it is critical to reduce water withdrawals for irrigation use and improve crop production per unit water consumption irrigation optimization is a complicated process which requires the consideration of local weather soil crop phenological stage water delivery and application schemes evans and sadler 2008 gravity irrigation flooding is the necessary irrigation method for rice paddy stubbs 2015 water saving management practices in rice paddies such as intermittent drying less than full flooding direct seeding ground cover rice production and scheduling of irrigation using tensiometer have been studied previously and suggested to be applied in the field e g belder et al 2004 bouman et al 2005 bouman and tuong 2001 datta et al 2017 for crops that do not require gravity irrigation sprinkler and micro irrigation systems could be a better option to reduce water loss and conserve water resource in the lmav stubbs 2015 in recent years pressurized systems in combination with gps based precision irrigation technologies allow irrigators to know site specific soil condition plant status and the time and amount of water to be used to best match crop growth evans and sadler 2008 then irrigation could be applied at the right rate right time and right place with the help of new precision agricultural techniques on farm storage reservoir is another option to conserve water resources which have been constructed in the lmav and other regions in the world to collect rainfall and surface runoff for irrigation use carvajal et al 2014 ouyang et al 2018 by using a pond irrigation model ouyang et al 2018 found there is sufficient surface runoff water to be collected by on farm reservoirs for crop irrigation in the lmav on farm reservoirs have large potentials to reduce groundwater withdrawals for irrigation purpose 4 4 cultivation strategies to reduce irrigation water withdrawals observation based estimates show that irrigation water application rates in rice field are 3 times that of other crops in the lmav massey et al 2017 largely due the climate warming and drying the largest crop iwr increase at the end of the 21st century would be in the northwest where rice is widely planted fig 2 rice would consume much more water if the cultivation strategies have no improvement to reduce rice irrigation requirement it is necessary to improve rice cultivars in the recent years new rice cultivars with higher drought tolerance and water use efficiency have been developed by molecular biotechnology which could maintain high crop yield in non flooded conditions and require much less irrigation datta et al 2017 another option to reduce groundwater withdrawals could be the replacement of rice cultivation with other crops that require less irrigation such as wheat soybeans and corn in the lmav summer has a lower precipitation rate than the other seasons figure s3 and summer drought would get worse in the future fig 6 early crop sowing could result in early growth and early maturity to avoid drought stress in august and september olesen et al 2012 this plantation strategy could potentially reduce the iwr tang et al 2018 yau et al 2011 4 5 uncertainties and caveats in this study we estimated crop iwr for major crops in the lmav over historical and future periods under several climatic and growth duration length scenarios these results could be potentially important for designing regional water conservation policies and strategies we acknowledge uncertainties in our estimates resulting from input datasets simplified algorithms and assumptions although biases in gcm simulations have been corrected according to the observation based data in the historical period uncertainties still exist in climate inter annual variations and future trend abatzoglou and brown 2012 for the four selected gcms in this study during 2080 2099 annual precipitation ranges from 1425 mm yr 1 gfdl to 1618 mm yr 1 ccsm4 in the rcp45 and from 1293 mm yr 1 ipsl to 1674 mm yr 1 ccsm4 in the rcp85 meanwhile annual temperature ranges from 22 2 c gfdl to 22 8 c miroc5 in the rcp45 and from 24 1 c ccsm4 to 25 c ipsl in the rcp85 considering differences in gcm model structure we used results from four gcms to represent the cross model uncertainty range and the averaged results as our best estimate fig 4 another important source of uncertainty is the simplified algorithm to calculate effective precipitation through multi day average precipitation although eq 1 has been proved to be good enough in estimating crop iwr in the u s states döll and siebert 2002 this equation was designed for global application and does not consider the spatial variations of soil texture soil water holding capacity and topography on water runoff döll and siebert 2002 reported that the estimated iwr based on eq 1 is comparable with inventory data in the us and germany while iwr was overestimated by 40 and 44 in spain and india and underestimated by 13 in china eq 1 may lead to some uncertainties in the estimated spatial pattern of crop iwr in the lmav however this uncertainty is difficult to be quantified due to the lack of inventory data in this lmav region nevertheless in the future work spatial variations of soil and topography factors are necessary to be taken into consideration future climate change in combination with socioeconomic factors and human adaptation activities would have complex influences on cropping systems in the lmav howden et al 2007 tubiello et al 2000 crop phenology growth duration cropland area and even crop types might be significantly different from the contemporary patterns in this study we considered the variations of crop growth duration under the impacts of changing climate and human activities i e the varied gdl scenarios and the fixed gdl but other cropping management practices were kept unchanged in recent decades crops were found to be planted earlier across many regions of the world e g sacks and kucharik 2011 tao et al 2006 and the locations of planted crops have shifted cho and mccarl 2017 therefore we suggest future work of regional crop iwr to include human adaptation scenarios e g changes in crop sowing dates cropland area and crop types field experiments found that the rising ambient co2 concentration could reduce leaf stomatal conductance and then suppress transpiration rate at the leaf scale e g ainsworth and rogers 2007 medlyn et al 2001 however co2 effect on transpiration for cops was relatively small up to a few percents than other vegetation types due to the aerodynamically smooth canopy e g field et al 1995 kruijt et al 2008 on the contrary some studies piao et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 found that co2 fertilization effect could stimulate leaf growth and leaf area and then promote evapotranspiration rate rising co2 concentration reduces transpiration at the leaf scale through suppressing stomatal conductance but may result in higher evapotranspiration at the canopy and landscape scales though increasing leaf area as the mechanism of rising co2 influences on evapotranspiration has not been well understood yet this study did not include co2 impacts on crop iwr 5 conclusions aquifer decline due to groundwater withdrawals for agricultural use is one prominent environment issue in the lower mississippi alluvial valley this study made the first attempt to estimate spatial patterns of crop irrigation water requirement iwr and its future trend over the lmav under climate change and growth duration length scenarios we found that temperature in the lmav increases continuously over this region during the 21st century and summer drought would be aggravated as a result of reduced precipitation and increased temperature when keeping current crop planting area and sowing date unchanged regional crop iwr would show considerable increases ranging from 4 2 to 14 5 under the rcp45 and from 9 2 to 29 4 under the rcp85 respectively by the end of the 21st century we discussed uncertainties regarding climate projections and the simplified iwr algorithm and called for future research to consider local soil related parameters socioeconomic factors and the changes in cultivation strategies nevertheless this study gives an insight into agricultural water use as influenced by future climate conditions analysis of iwr for major crops provides a scientific basis for designing management

alluvial valley lmav is the largest floodplain and one of the most productive agricultural regions in the united states irrigation is widely used in this region to improve crop production and resource use efficiency due to a mismatch between crop water requirements and precipitation timing and quantity during the growing season in the recent decades aquifer decline caused by groundwater withdrawals for irrigation has been recognized as a critical environmental issue threatening water security and agricultural sustainability in the lmav to improve agricultural water use efficiency and reduce groundwater withdrawals it is pivotal to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of crop irrigation water requirements iwr in this study we analyzed future climate changes over the lmav cropland areas and estimated future iwr changes for major crops in the 21st century using two climate scenarios i e rcp45 and rcp85 and two crop growth duration length gdl scenarios i e fixed gdl gdl does not change with time and varied gdl gdl changes with time results show that croplands in the lmav would experience continuous warming and either no significant change or a decreasing level of precipitation under the rcp45 and the rcp85 if keeping current cropland areas and cropping systems unchanged average crop iwr by the end of the 21st century would increase by 4 2 under the rcp45 varied gdl scenario 14 5 under the rcp45 fixed gdl scenario 9 2 under the rcp85 varied gdl scenario and 29 4 under the rcp85 fixed gdl scenario the greatest increases would occur in the summer months aquifer levels in the lmav therefore are expected to decline at an accelerated pace if no effective mitigation strategies are implemented this study made the first attempt to reveal the spatially explicit crop iwr and its future changes in the lmav which provides a scientific basis for developing management strategies that can enhance water use efficiency and improve agriculture sustainability keywords aquifer decline agricultural water management climate change water conservation groundwater withdrawal 1 introduction lower mississippi alluvial valley lmav is the largest floodplain in the u s jenkins et al 2010 it includes a part of seven states extending from southern illinois to the gulf of mexico with more than 85 of the land area situated in arkansas mississippi and louisiana the rich alluvial soils received from sediment additions from mississippi river support highly productive terrestrial ecosystems putnam et al 1960 bottomland forests and wetlands were once widely distributed across this region as a result of the flat terrain poorly drained soils and wet climate condition at present the lmav becomes one of the most important agricultural regions in the u s for rice soybean corn and cotton productions associated with the intensified agricultural activities multiple environmental issues have gradually emerged such as greenhouse gas emissions jenkins et al 2010 soil erosion and nutrient leaching alexander et al 2008 water quality degradation ouyang et al 2014 hypoxia in the gulf of mexico mcisaac et al 2001 rabalais et al 2002 turner and rabalais 1994 and groundwater depletion konikow 2015 ouyang et al 2018 reba et al 2017 scott et al 1998 at the global level irrigated cropland represents 20 of total cropland area but contributes 40 food production siebert et al 2005 and 70 freshwater withdrawals siebert et al 2010 in the u s irrigated cropland is about 22 6 million ha usda 2014 and irrigation water withdrawals account for 42 of total freshwater withdrawals dieter et al 2018 irrigation is one of the major management practices in the lmav to maintain optimum crop growth and high crop production because the timing and quantity of precipitation fail to meet crop growth requirement it is noted that the expansion of irrigated cropland has led to significant aquifer decline in the lower mississippi river basin over recent decades reba et al 2017 largely due to irrigation water withdrawals the mississippi embayment of gulf coastal plain aquifer shows the largest volumes of groundwater depletion in the u s konikow 2015 reba et al 2017 which threatens the sustainability of water supply and agricultural production aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gleeson et al 2012 to solve this problem numerous mitigation strategies have been suggested to enhance irrigation efficiency and reduce groundwater withdrawals such as on farm storage pond construction ouyang et al 2018 and irrigation technology improvement evans and sadler 2008 stubbs 2015 to design effective strategies for lessening irrigation water use we need a clear understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of crop irrigation water needs in the lmav massey et al 2017 estimated the irrigation rates for major crops through a power conversion coefficient approach and found a much higher irrigation rate in rice paddy than other crops however literature regarding irrigation water use in the lmav is very limited and it is still unclear how climate change and human management practices will affect regional crop irrigation water needs in the future this knowledge gap restricts our ability to project future water resources availability and design appropriate strategies to maintain or enhance crop production future climate changes play a critical role in affecting crop irrigation water use through altering crop evapotranspiration rate precipitation amount and crop growing season length evans and sadler 2008 according to general circulation model gcm projections the climate warming in the 21st century is very likely to continue or even be accelerated in the mississippi river basin e g knutti and sedláček 2013 melillo 2014 tao et al 2014 in contrast the pattern of precipitation changes in the southeast u s is subject to large uncertainties kunkel et al 2013 additionally it is not clear how the crop growing season will change in the future some previous studies reported that climate warming shortened crop growing season he et al 2015 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 while others reported that a change in crop cultivar could extend crop growth duration and partially counteracted the impact of climate warming liu et al 2012 2010 sacks and kucharik 2011 crop irrigation water requirement has been investigated previously by both simple crop irrigation algorithms e g döll and siebert 2002 fischer et al 2007 shen et al 2013 xu et al 2019 and sophisticated process based crop models e g elliott et al 2014 konzmann et al 2013 of all these approaches crop irrigation water requirement iwr is a simple but effective index to estimate the water quantity and depth required for optimized crop growth and yield usda 1993 this index considers crop evapotranspiration and precipitation rates at daily or monthly scale and has been extensively utilized to evaluate regional and global irrigation water requirement under historical e g döll and siebert 2002 shen et al 2013 wriedt et al 2009 and future climate conditions e g fischer et al 2007 shahid 2011 xu et al 2019 in this study we aim to explore future climate changes and assess future crop iwr in the lmav we included eight sets of future climate data simulated by four gcms under two climate scenarios i e the rcp45 and the rcp85 and designed two future crop growth season length scenarios for seven major crop types specific objectives of this study are to 1 understand the patterns of changing temperature and precipitation in the 21st century by analyzing the downscaled and bias corrected climate projections 2 quantify future patterns of regional and crop specific iwr under the impacts of climate change and cultivar change and 3 discuss potential mitigation strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawals for irrigation while improving water crop sustainability in the lmav 2 material and methods 2 1 study domain the lmav covers portions of seven states including illinois kentucky missouri tennessee arkansas mississippi and louisiana the fertile alluvial soils support highly productive ecosystems putnam et al 1960 landscape in the lmav is relatively flat elevation in the south is 0 20 meters and 80 100 meters in the north with an average of 41 m figure s1 in this study we used the united states environmental protection agency epa level iii ecoregion https www epa gov eco research level iii and iv ecoregions continental united states to delineate the boundary of the lmav fig 1 epa ecoregion boundary shows that the lmav is comprised of approximately 11 3 million ha land area prior to the 17th century 8 10 million ha bottomland hardwood forests were widely distributed across this region stanturf et al 2000 however since the european settlement a large fraction of wetlands were drained and vegetation types were substantially changed by human activities currently most of the bottomland forests have been cleared for agricultural use king et al 2006 according to the köppen geiger classification system peel et al 2007 the lmav is situated in a temperate rainy climate zone during the 20 years between 1991 and 2010 average temperature is 17 6 c and average precipitation is 1363 mm yr 1 figure s2 annual temperature decreases from 20 c in the south to 15 c in the north precipitation declines with distance from the gulf of mexico and annual precipitation decreases from 1600 mm yr 1 in the south to 1200 mm yr 1 in the north monthly temperatures are higher in summer months of june 26 1 c july 27 6 c august 27 3 c and september 23 9 c figure s3 the lowest monthly precipitation is in august 89 mm month 1 and september 96 mm month 1 2 2 database 2 2 1 crop types cropland data layer cdl is a geo referenced crop classification product developed based on mid resolution satellite imageries 30 or 56 m and ground truth data for the continental u s and disseminated from the united states department of agriculture usda national agricultural statistics service nass boryan et al 2011 this data has been widely used by scientists policy and decision makers and farm producers to evaluate crop yield monitor land use change assess disaster consequences account regional carbon balance etc e g han et al 2012 kutz et al 2012 shao et al 2010 west et al 2010 in this study we analyzed the cdl 2010 data at a spatial resolution of 30 m to show crop type distribution in the lmav fig 1 as indicated by this dataset lmav cropland including fallow land is 6 million ha accounting for 53 of the lmav land area we selected seven major row crops and one double cropping system to assess crop iwr the selected row crops are corn cotton rice sorghum soybean sugarcane and winter wheat and the double cropping system is winter wheat paired with soybeans table 1 areas of selected crops represent 90 of the total cropland area including fallow land in the lmav crops with the largest cultivation areas include soybean 2 75 million ha rice 0 96 million ha corn 0 66 million ha and cotton 0 56 million ha which respectively represent 46 16 1 11 1 and 9 3 of the lmav cropland area we further aggregated the 30 m usgs cdl data to a spatial resolution of 1 16 latitude longitude fig 2 to be consistent with climate data section 2 2 2 for further analysis 2 2 2 climate data we used two types of daily climate datasets 1 observation based climate and 2 model simulated climate first we collected observation based daily climate data maximum minimum temperature and precipitation during 1991 2010 from the long term hydrologically based dataset of land surface fluxes and states livneh et al 2013 the livneh data hereinafter this dataset was developed from 20 000 noaa weather station observations and has been available from 1915 to 2011 at a spatial resolution of 1 16 latitude longitude we used the livneh data to show contemporary climate conditions in the lmav and estimate the phenological heat units phus required for crops to reach maturity second we collected a new statistically downscaled climate data maximum minimum temperature precipitation and wind speed over the period of 1991 2099 simulated by four gcms under the rcp45 and the rcp85 climatic scenarios https climate northwestknowledge net maca the four gcms are ccsm4 gent et al 2011 gfdl esm2g dunne et al 2012 ipsl cm5a lr dufresne et al 2013 and miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 gcm simulations had been corrected according to the observation based livneh data and downscaled to a spatial resolution of 1 16 latitude longitude using the method of multivariate adapted constructed analogs maca therefore the model simulated datasets are consistent with the observation based livneh dataset in terms of magnitude and spatial resolution advantages of the maca approach and detailed procedures of the maca downscaling and bias correction are described in abatzoglou and brown 2012 in total eight sets of downscaled climate simulations 4 gcms 2 scenarios were processed to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of crop iwr during 1991 2099 2 3 estimation of crop irrigation water requirement 2 3 1 irrigation water requirement equation unless stated otherwise crop iwr in this study refers to the net iwr which is the quantity of required water for optimum crop growth and does not include water transportation loss we used the equation in döll and siebert 2002 and smith 1992 to estimate daily crop iwr mm day 1 1 i w r m a x 0 k c e t 0 p e f f where e t 0 is crop specific daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 computed according to the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 k c is the crop coefficient to convert e t 0 to actual crop evapotranspiration and p e f f is effective precipitation mm day 1 available for crop use and can be stored in soil fao56 penman monteith equation is the most widely used algorithm to quantify crop reference evapotranspiration pereira et al 2015 differences in canopy resistance radiation reflection crop height canopy coverage and root depth lead to divergent evapotranspiration rates allen et al 1998 time varying k c was used to account for variations of these factors over different growth periods to estimate k c crop growing season is divided into four phenological stages which are initial s1 canopy development s2 mid season s3 and maturation s4 respectively usda 1993 fig 3 illustrates a conceptual diagram of crop phenological stages in this study k c out of crop growing season was set to 0 and k c in crop growing season was computed using the three k c parameters k c at initial stage kcini k c peak value kcp and k c at maturity kcm in table 2 in combination with the lengths of phenological stages fig 3 k c in mid season was equal to kcp and k c in canopy development stage and maturation stage were computed through linear interpolation p e f f is a part of precipitation available for crop use that does not run off döll and siebert 2002 in this study we estimated p e f f by following smith 1992 and döll and siebert 2002 2 p e f f p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 34 m m d a y 1 4 17 0 1 p p 8 34 m m d a y 1 where p is 10 day or 3 day average precipitation mm day 1 as soil is capable of storing precipitation for crop use in the next few days döll and siebert 2002 and smith 1992 calculated the multi day average precipitation to represent the lag effect of high precipitation on soil moisture 10 day average was applied for crops except rice while 3 day period was used for rice because the soil in rice paddy is usually saturated and has low capacity to store precipitation döll and siebert 2002 found that the simulated crop iwr using eq 1 agreed well with the independent state level statistics in the u s solley et al 1998 giving us more confidence in using eq 1 to estimate crop iwr in the lmav uncertainties from this simplified algorithms of iwr and effective precipitation are discussed in section 4 4 2 3 2 crop phenology previous studies reported that crop growing season was shortened by climate warming e g he et al 2015 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 while some other studies found little or no change in crop growing season length as the improved crop cultivar lengthened vegetative growth period for biomass accumulation and counteracted the climate effect e g liu et al 2012 2010 sacks and kucharik 2011 as it is uncertain how crop cultivars would be changed in the future we designed two growth duration length gdl scenarios to estimate crop iwr in the first scenario we assumed crop cultivars change with time to maintain a similar growing season length as the historical level the fixed gdl scenario hereinafter in the second scenario we assumed crop cultivars do not change and gdl is determined by temperature and the accumulated phenological heat units the varied gdl scenario hereinafter we assumed that time fractions of s1 s2 s3 and s4 stages to the entire growing season fs1 fs2 fs3 and fs4 in fig 3 do not change with time although crop gdl may change in the future crop specific parameters of fs1 fs2 fs3 and fs4 table 2 were compiled from usda report usda 1993 allen et al 1998 and döll and siebert 2002 it is noted that fs1 for rice was set to 0 because rice initial stage is seedling nursery which happens before plantation rice iwr in the nursery stage was not considered in this study 2 3 2 1 observed growth duration length based on the usda report usda agricultural handbook usda 2010 provides the beginning date most active period and end date of crop planting and harvesting for major crops at the state level these dates were acquired from 20 year crop progress inventory data and specialists knowledge we used the mean day of the most active periods to denote the planting and harvesting dates for each selected crop in each state see figure s4 and s5 gdl was estimated by counting the days between crop planting date and harvesting date figure s6 it is noteworthy that sugarcane mostly in louisiana has usually been cultivated over a 4 year cycle greenland 2005 which is quite different from other selected field crops for sugarcane in louisiana the most active planting dates were between august 18 and september 21 and the most active harvesting dates were between october 18 and december 17 of the next year usda 2010 after the first harvest sugarcane root and lower above ground parts were left in the field and regrew to become ratoon crop during the 4 year cycle sugarcane is harvested three times 2 3 2 2 estimated growth duration length based on heat units we used the concept of phenological heat units phus in the agricultural module of the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 and the community land model clm drewniak et al 2013 to estimate inter annual variations of gdl for crops except sugarcane as sugarcane harvest in the u s is not determined by the accumulated temperature see explanation in the next paragraph for each 1 16 latitude longitude grid total phus in crop growing season to reach maturity tphus c was calculated by the 20 year average livneh daily temperature 3a t p h u s i p l a n t i n g d a t e h a r v e s t i n g d a t e h u i 3b h u i m a x 0 t m a x i t m i n i 2 t b a s e where i is the day between planting date and harvesting date planting and harvesting dates are from the usda 2010 report h u i is daily heat unit c t m a x i and t m i n i are daily maximum and minimum temperatures from the 20 year 1991 2010 average livneh data and t b a s e is base temperature required for crop growth which is set to 5 c as in the swat and clm in the varied gdl scenario we assumed that t p h u s are constant in both historical and future periods crop is harvested when the accumulated h u i based on the model simulated climate reaches the t p h u s obtained from the 20 year average livneh data one exception is sugarcane of which phenology and gdl had no correlation with temperature this is mainly because sugarcane in the u s is harvested before physiological maturity and the harvest date is controlled by the pre established contract with the sugar mill greenland 2005 thus we assumed that sugarcane gdl is fixed in both the varied gdl and the fixed gdl scenarios after the harvesting dates were determined we used parameters of fs1 fs2 fs3 and fs4 in table 2 to estimate the start and end of each phenological stage some global models simulate crop planting dates by air temperature e g bondeau et al 2007 stehfest et al 2007 however this climatically determined planting date has not been widely tested and validated sacks et al 2010 thus we assumed crop planting dates remain the same as that in the historical period for both the varied gdl and the fixed gdl scenarios 3 results 3 1 projected temperature and precipitation changes according to the average of four gcms future temperature would increase significantly mann kendall non parametric trend test p value 0 05 same hereafter under the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios fig 4 compared with the historical period of 1991 2005 lmav temperature in the middle of the 21st century mid period 2040 2059 would increase by 1 4 c and 1 7 c under the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively however by the end of the 21st century late period 2080 2099 the increased temperature is projected to be 1 8 c and 3 8 c under the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively spatial patterns of temperature changes show that the northern lmav would have a higher temperature increase than that in the southern lmav fig 5 we found that the trend in precipitation is not significant under the rcp45 scenario p value 0 05 and precipitation is projected to decrease significantly under the rcp85 scenario during the period of 1991 2099 p value 0 05 fig 4 compared with the historical period of 1991 2005 precipitation in the mid 21st century would decrease by 21 2 mm yr 1 1 4 under the rcp45 scenario but increase by 13 2 mm yr 1 0 8 under the rcp85 scenario in the late 21st century precipitation would decrease by 3 1 mm yr 1 0 2 and 102 4 mm yr 1 6 5 under the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively the largest precipitation decrease under the rcp45 would be in the northwest of the lmav while the largest precipitation reduction under the rcp85 would be in the central and southern parts fig 5 future climate change is projected to present distinct monthly variations under the rcp45 and the rcp85 temperature would show greater increases in spring march april and may summer june july and august and fall september october and november than in winter december january and february fig 6 for example in the late 21st century of the rcp85 temperature would increase by 4 1 c 3 9 c and 3 9 c in spring summer and fall and increase by 3 2 c in winter similarly the changes in precipitation would show apparent monthly variations summer is projected to have the largest precipitation reduction and fall would have the largest precipitation increase for example over the late 21st century of the rcp85 summer precipitation would decrease by 35 7 mm month 1 21 and fall precipitation would increase by 22 mm month 1 19 7 as summer is the major growing season for many crops in the lmav a reduced summer precipitation is likely to cause an increased crop iwr 3 2 growth duration length we estimated crop iwr under two gdl scenarios i e the varied gdl and the fixed gdl for the fixed gdl we used the gdl derived from the usda report usda 2010 to represent gdl over the entire study period of 1991 2099 for the varied gdl gdl was estimated based on the accumulated phus in this scenario gdl for all the selected crops is projected to show a continuous decline under both the rcp45 and the rcp85 figure s7 according to the averaged results from the four gcms crop gdl in the mid 21st century for the selected crops would decrease by 10 18 days under the rcp45 scenario and 14 24 days under the rcp85 scenario crop gdl in the late 21st century would be shortened by 14 23 days under the rcp45 and 24 38 days under the rcp85 table 3 3 3 reference evapotranspiration as estimated by the fao56 penman monteith equation future climate changes would lead to higher e t 0 under the rcp45 and the rcp85 fig 7 the averaged results from the four gcms show that annual e t 0 in the mid 21st century would increase by 62 7 mm yr 1 4 6 under the rcp45 and by 71 7 mm yr 1 5 3 under the rcp85 relative to the historical period 1991 2005 annual e t 0 in the late 21st century would increase by 76 mm yr 1 5 6 under the rcp45 and by 157 1 mm yr 1 11 6 under the rcp85 particularly monthly e t 0 in spring and summer would show a greater increase than in fall and winter figure s8 3 4 irrigation water requirement for the fixed gdl scenario crop iwr is projected to increase for all crops figure s9 s17 in the varied gdl scenario crop iwr would increase for all crops except winter wheat fig 8 we used the results in the varied gdl and the fixed gdl scenarios to represent the lower and upper boundaries of our estimates averaged results from four gcms show that crop iwr under the rcp45 would increase by 12 6 35 mm yr 1 avg 1 std dev same hereafter 4 2 in the varied gdl scenario and 44 3 41 1 mm yr 1 14 5 in the fixed gdl scenario over the late 21st century relative to the historical period 1991 2005 fig 8 under the rcp85 crop iwr would increase by 27 8 25 5 mm yr 1 9 2 in the varied gdl scenario and 89 7 28 5 mm yr 1 29 4 in the fixed gdl scenario in the late 21st century soybean iwr would increase by 5 7 15 1 under the rcp45 and by 12 4 30 2 under the rcp85 rice iwr would increase by 1 7 13 5 under the rcp45 and by 3 2 25 5 under the rcp85 however winter wheat iwr would diverge in changing directions between the varied gdl scenario and the fixed gdl scenario during the late 21st century winter wheat iwr would change between 10 1 and 23 under the rcp45 and between 17 8 and 51 4 under the rcp85 in the historical period 1991 2005 crops in the lmav require 16 2 109 varied gdl 16 3 109 fixed gdl m3 yr 1 water for irrigation use table 4 under the rcp45 scenario crop iwr in the late 21st century would be 16 9 109 18 7 109 m3 yr 1 which is 4 2 14 5 more water than in the historical period under the rcp85 scenario crops in the late 21st century would need 17 7 109 21 1 109 m3 yr 1 water for irrigation which is 9 2 29 4 more water than in the historical period in term of total irrigation amount soybeans require the most irrigation water as a result of its largest plantation area accounting for 43 of the total amount of crop iwr in the lmav rice corn and cotton account for approximately 29 11 and 10 respectively of the total amount of crop iwr fig 9 shows the spatial pattern of the changes in future iwr relative to the historical period over the late 21st century the increased iwr under the rcp45 fixed gdl scenario would be larger in the northern lmav which corresponds to a higher temperature increase and a greater precipitation reduction for the fixed gdl the rcp85 scenario the increased iwr in the late 21st century would be over 90 mm yr 1 across most cropland areas in the lmav except the northeast the greatest iwr increase would be in the northwest where rice is the major crop type contrasts between the upper panel and lower panel of fig 9 shows a lower increases in crop iwr under the varied gdl scenario than under the fixed gdl scenario indicating that if crop cultivars do not change in future the shortened crop growing season would partially offset the enhanced crop iwr crop iwr in the lmav presents distinct seasonal variations with the highest rate during may september fig 10 for the varied gdl scenario under the rcp45 and the rcp85 future crop iwr would increase substantially in june and july but decrease in september and october due to the shortened crop growing season in the late 21st century crop iwr in june and july is projected to increase by 11 5 mm month 1 and 21 mm month 1 in the rcp45 and 28 7 mm month 1 and 35 5 mm month 1 in the rcp85 respectively while crop iwr in september and october is projected to decrease by 19 9 mm month 1 and 9 mm month 1 in the rcp45 and 37 5 mm month 1 and 9 5 mm month 1 in the rcp85 respectively for the fixed gdl scenario under the rcp45 and the rcp85 future iwr would increase in each month of crop growing season july and august are the months with the largest crop iwr increase in the late 21st century crop iwr in july and august is projected to increase by 11 8 mm month 1 and 11 5 mm month 1 in the rcp45 and 27 4 mm month 1 and 26 2 mm month 1 in the rcp85 respectively the increased summer iwr could largely be attributed to the increased temperature and decreased precipitation during summer months fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of future climate change on crop irrigation water requirement investigation of future changes in crop irrigation requirement has been an important research topic in the scientific community for decades at the global level future climate change was found to largely increase average crop iwr if mitigation strategies are not applied fischer et al 2007 however the changed crop iwr would show significant regional differences due to the spatial variations of future climate changes for example crop iwr in zimbabwe was projected to increase by 17 205 in the 2090s nkomozepi and chung 2012 and maize in northeast china would demand more frequent irrigation xu et al 2019 while climate change would not cause appreciable changes in total irrigation water use in bangladesh rice paddy shahid 2011 our estimated iwr for major row crops in the historical period is consistent with the observation based estimates through a power conversion coefficient approach massey et al 2017 and model based estimates in the mississippi delta tang et al 2018 in the lmav climate warming would result in large increases in crop reference evapotranspiration by the end of the 21st century 5 6 under the rcp45 and 11 6 under the rcp85 meanwhile summer precipitation would decrease by 21 under the rcp85 the projected increase in temperature and reduction in precipitation together would result in a significant increase in future crop iwr in this region particularly for summer months the high warming climate condition the rcp85 would have a stronger influence in enhancing crop iwr than the relatively lower warming climate condition the rcp45 4 2 irrigation efficiency gross iwr is the total water withdrawals to maintain optimum crop growth a large fraction of water withdrawn from lakes rivers and aquifers is lost when water travels through canals and crop fields brouwer et al 1989 total water withdrawals therefore must be larger than the net iwr to cover water conveyance loss and soil evaporation loss the term of irrigation efficiency the ratio of net iwr to gross iwr represents the share of irrigation water that can be utilized by crops compared to total water withdrawal brouwer et al 1989 döll and siebert 2002 wisser et al 2008 according to döll and siebert 2002 average irrigation efficiency is 0 6 in the u s with significant variations among crop types and irrigation systems irrigation efficiency for rice is even lower because rice needs flooding irrigation method döll and siebert 2002 if irrigation efficiency in the lmav does not improve in the future or is maintained at 0 6 water withdrawal for crop irrigation in the late 21st century would increase by 1 2 109 4 2 109 m3 yr 1 under the rcp45 and 2 5 109 8 2 109 m3 yr 1 under the rcp85 compared with the historical period pressurized irrigation methods e g sprinklers and micro irrigation systems could substantially enhance water use efficiency and reduce environmental burdens compared to traditional gravity irrigation systems levidow et al 2014 since the 1980s u s farmers have started to shift from gravity irrigation systems to pressurized irrigation systems stubbs 2015 however gravity irrigation systems now are still widely utilized over a large percentage of irrigated cropland in the lmav in mississippi state for example gravity irrigation systems are still applied over 70 of irrigated croplands usda 2013 farm and ranch irrigation survey https www nass usda gov publications agcensus 2012 compared to 30 in western states stubbs 2015 this contrast between the lmav and western states indicates a large potential in the lmav to reduce water loss and improve irrigation efficiency through the adoption of newer pressurized irrigation systems 4 3 irrigation strategies to reduce irrigation water withdrawals results in this study show that future climate and crop cultivar change would enhance cropland evapotranspiration and consequently irrigation water requirement if no efficient mitigation strategies are designed and implemented aquifer decline in the future would occur at an accelerated pace to conserve water resources and improve agricultural sustainability in the lmav it is critical to reduce water withdrawals for irrigation use and improve crop production per unit water consumption irrigation optimization is a complicated process which requires the consideration of local weather soil crop phenological stage water delivery and application schemes evans and sadler 2008 gravity irrigation flooding is the necessary irrigation method for rice paddy stubbs 2015 water saving management practices in rice paddies such as intermittent drying less than full flooding direct seeding ground cover rice production and scheduling of irrigation using tensiometer have been studied previously and suggested to be applied in the field e g belder et al 2004 bouman et al 2005 bouman and tuong 2001 datta et al 2017 for crops that do not require gravity irrigation sprinkler and micro irrigation systems could be a better option to reduce water loss and conserve water resource in the lmav stubbs 2015 in recent years pressurized systems in combination with gps based precision irrigation technologies allow irrigators to know site specific soil condition plant status and the time and amount of water to be used to best match crop growth evans and sadler 2008 then irrigation could be applied at the right rate right time and right place with the help of new precision agricultural techniques on farm storage reservoir is another option to conserve water resources which have been constructed in the lmav and other regions in the world to collect rainfall and surface runoff for irrigation use carvajal et al 2014 ouyang et al 2018 by using a pond irrigation model ouyang et al 2018 found there is sufficient surface runoff water to be collected by on farm reservoirs for crop irrigation in the lmav on farm reservoirs have large potentials to reduce groundwater withdrawals for irrigation purpose 4 4 cultivation strategies to reduce irrigation water withdrawals observation based estimates show that irrigation water application rates in rice field are 3 times that of other crops in the lmav massey et al 2017 largely due the climate warming and drying the largest crop iwr increase at the end of the 21st century would be in the northwest where rice is widely planted fig 2 rice would consume much more water if the cultivation strategies have no improvement to reduce rice irrigation requirement it is necessary to improve rice cultivars in the recent years new rice cultivars with higher drought tolerance and water use efficiency have been developed by molecular biotechnology which could maintain high crop yield in non flooded conditions and require much less irrigation datta et al 2017 another option to reduce groundwater withdrawals could be the replacement of rice cultivation with other crops that require less irrigation such as wheat soybeans and corn in the lmav summer has a lower precipitation rate than the other seasons figure s3 and summer drought would get worse in the future fig 6 early crop sowing could result in early growth and early maturity to avoid drought stress in august and september olesen et al 2012 this plantation strategy could potentially reduce the iwr tang et al 2018 yau et al 2011 4 5 uncertainties and caveats in this study we estimated crop iwr for major crops in the lmav over historical and future periods under several climatic and growth duration length scenarios these results could be potentially important for designing regional water conservation policies and strategies we acknowledge uncertainties in our estimates resulting from input datasets simplified algorithms and assumptions although biases in gcm simulations have been corrected according to the observation based data in the historical period uncertainties still exist in climate inter annual variations and future trend abatzoglou and brown 2012 for the four selected gcms in this study during 2080 2099 annual precipitation ranges from 1425 mm yr 1 gfdl to 1618 mm yr 1 ccsm4 in the rcp45 and from 1293 mm yr 1 ipsl to 1674 mm yr 1 ccsm4 in the rcp85 meanwhile annual temperature ranges from 22 2 c gfdl to 22 8 c miroc5 in the rcp45 and from 24 1 c ccsm4 to 25 c ipsl in the rcp85 considering differences in gcm model structure we used results from four gcms to represent the cross model uncertainty range and the averaged results as our best estimate fig 4 another important source of uncertainty is the simplified algorithm to calculate effective precipitation through multi day average precipitation although eq 1 has been proved to be good enough in estimating crop iwr in the u s states döll and siebert 2002 this equation was designed for global application and does not consider the spatial variations of soil texture soil water holding capacity and topography on water runoff döll and siebert 2002 reported that the estimated iwr based on eq 1 is comparable with inventory data in the us and germany while iwr was overestimated by 40 and 44 in spain and india and underestimated by 13 in china eq 1 may lead to some uncertainties in the estimated spatial pattern of crop iwr in the lmav however this uncertainty is difficult to be quantified due to the lack of inventory data in this lmav region nevertheless in the future work spatial variations of soil and topography factors are necessary to be taken into consideration future climate change in combination with socioeconomic factors and human adaptation activities would have complex influences on cropping systems in the lmav howden et al 2007 tubiello et al 2000 crop phenology growth duration cropland area and even crop types might be significantly different from the contemporary patterns in this study we considered the variations of crop growth duration under the impacts of changing climate and human activities i e the varied gdl scenarios and the fixed gdl but other cropping management practices were kept unchanged in recent decades crops were found to be planted earlier across many regions of the world e g sacks and kucharik 2011 tao et al 2006 and the locations of planted crops have shifted cho and mccarl 2017 therefore we suggest future work of regional crop iwr to include human adaptation scenarios e g changes in crop sowing dates cropland area and crop types field experiments found that the rising ambient co2 concentration could reduce leaf stomatal conductance and then suppress transpiration rate at the leaf scale e g ainsworth and rogers 2007 medlyn et al 2001 however co2 effect on transpiration for cops was relatively small up to a few percents than other vegetation types due to the aerodynamically smooth canopy e g field et al 1995 kruijt et al 2008 on the contrary some studies piao et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 found that co2 fertilization effect could stimulate leaf growth and leaf area and then promote evapotranspiration rate rising co2 concentration reduces transpiration at the leaf scale through suppressing stomatal conductance but may result in higher evapotranspiration at the canopy and landscape scales though increasing leaf area as the mechanism of rising co2 influences on evapotranspiration has not been well understood yet this study did not include co2 impacts on crop iwr 5 conclusions aquifer decline due to groundwater withdrawals for agricultural use is one prominent environment issue in the lower mississippi alluvial valley this study made the first attempt to estimate spatial patterns of crop irrigation water requirement iwr and its future trend over the lmav under climate change and growth duration length scenarios we found that temperature in the lmav increases continuously over this region during the 21st century and summer drought would be aggravated as a result of reduced precipitation and increased temperature when keeping current crop planting area and sowing date unchanged regional crop iwr would show considerable increases ranging from 4 2 to 14 5 under the rcp45 and from 9 2 to 29 4 under the rcp85 respectively by the end of the 21st century we discussed uncertainties regarding climate projections and the simplified iwr algorithm and called for future research to consider local soil related parameters socioeconomic factors and the changes in cultivation strategies nevertheless this study gives an insight into agricultural water use as influenced by future climate conditions analysis of iwr for major crops provides a scientific basis for designing management

11067,the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river present high rainfall and always have a high water table recently drip fertigation has been introduced and widely used for vegetable production in this area to investigate the effect of shallow groundwater and the newly developed fertigation on the cucumber water and nitrogen n requirement experiments were carried out in plastic tunnels in yangzhou jiangsu china during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons using a randomized block design with three replicates four n rates 4 irrigation amounts and 2 irrigation intervals 2 d and 4 d were applied in this experiment the results showed that irrigation amount of 75 of estimated plant evapotranspiration etc was optimal to obtain the highest yield indicating shallow groundwater had a considerable contribution to the cucumber plant evapotranspiration in this condition fertigation technology improved the irrigation water use efficiency iwue and n use efficiency nue and 75 of the recommended n rate calculated according to a traditional local nutrient balance method optimized cucumber yield frequent irrigation with low water volume had a beneficial impact on the improvement of cucumber yield iwue nue and reduced the n leaching according to this work the recommended fertigation strategy is 0 75 of recommended n 0 75 estimated etc and 2 d irrigation interval in this experiment in which cucumber yield of 105 4 mg ha 1 iwue of 41 1 kg m 3 and nue of 356 4 kg kg 1 were achieved keywords high groundwater table fertigation irrigation interval crop evapotranspiration water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction walk in plastic tunnels are the most common facilities for vegetable production in china according to the official statistics there were about 1 7 million hectares of walk in tunnels in china in 2013 among which about 26 percent were located in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river ministry of agriculture of the p r china 2014 these tunnels are always 6 8 m wide 2 3 3 5 m high and 30 60 m long warm season vegetables such as cucurbits beans and solanaceous crops are always forcing cultured in the spring or retarding cultured in the autumn in these un heated plastic tunnels in recent years due to the rising labor cost surface drip fertigation coupled with plastic film mulching has been widely adopted in this vegetable production system cucumber is one of the most important vegetable crops grown in these tunnels in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river due to its high yield and sparse root system cucumber always needs adequate water and nutrient supply and is very sensitive to the content of water and available nitrogen n in the soil yuan et al 2006 the response of cucumber yield water use efficiency wue and n use efficiency nue to different irrigation and fertilization strategies has been studied in detail in the past decades in different regions of the world beyaert et al 2007 grewal et al 2011 kotsiras et al 2002 mao et al 2003 ruiz and romero 2002 sánchez guerrero et al 2009 şimşek et al 2005 yan et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 in these studies the irrigation schedule was determined using either data of class a pan evaporation or soil moisture sensors while the nitrogen rate was determined according to the local growers conventional rate or calculated using the soil n balance method always less than the conventional rate the optimal treatment varied among different researches depending on the climatic conditions the soil properties and the cultivation methods up to date most research about the water and n management of cucumber were carried out in arid or semi arid regions the water resources in these regions were scarce and the researchers tried to improve the wue of cucumber and cope with the water shortage in the local areas abdalhi et al 2016 liang et al 2014 xiao et al 2013 yaghi et al 2013 unlike the regions mentioned above the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river is rich in precipitation and high in groundwater table according to the official statistics the annual precipitation in this region normally varied from 1000 mm to 1400 mm and mostly happens in the spring and the summer season china meteorological administration 2018 according to our measurements the depth of the water table is commonly less than 0 5 m in vegetable tunnels during the summer at different sites in this region in some fields which have drainage problems the waterlogging always happens during the rainy season due to the increasing global warming and the sea level rise there are more and more areas suffering from similar high water table condition or even waterlogging stress all over the world ipcc 2013 unfortunately up to date the n and water movements and optimal irrigation and nitrogen management of vegetable crops in plastic tunnels have not been well studied in these areas the contribution of groundwater towards crop evapotranspiration has been investigated by many researchers han et al 2015 liu et al 2006 ramos et al 2017 wu et al 2015 satchithanantham et al 2014 reported that in some conditions up to 92 of the potato water demand was met by capillary rise from the shallow groundwater in our trials we installed some lysimeters in unirrigated areas in the tunnels and always found there were leachates in the container during the whole season although in most cases the water table was not over the collecting surface of the lysimeters unpublished data this phenomenon indicated that the upward water may have a contribution to the crop evapotranspiration and the drainage collected by lysimeters under high water table conditions may be the mix of the real drainage and the upward water on the other hand the leaching patterns of irrigated water and applied n should be different between the humid and arid soil tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 thus the irrigation and fertilization strategies of vegetable crops should be quite different between the two types of regions however the effect of these differences on the n and water management have not been investigated in detail the experimental data from arid or semi arid regions such as from the north china plain region were always applied directly in the cultivation practice of most plastic tunnel vegetables in humid areas in china in this experiment we investigated the effect of different irrigation approaches volume and frequency and n fertilization rates on cucumber yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and the n leaching of plastic tunnel cucumber production in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of shallow groundwater on the crop water requirement and collect information to improve the fertigation technology in high water table areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil properties the experimental was conducted on a vegetable farm 32 68 82 n 119 59 10 e in yangzhou jiangsu province during the 2016 and 2017 spring summer seasons the farm was located in a typical area of the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river according to the local meteorological office the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1021 mm of which about 22 precipitation occurs from march to may and 47 from june to august mean annual evaporation from the free water surface is 937 7 mm the average annual temperature in the study area is approximately 16 2 c soil texture at the experiment site was silt loam the soil physical and chemical characteristics are shown in table 1 2 2 crop management and treatments the experiments were carried out in the typical walk in plastic tunnels the tunnels were 50 m long and 8 m wide and oriented south north in 2016 and 2017 cucumber seedlings at 4 leaf stage were planted in these tunnels on march 1 st before planting dairy manure 45 m3 ha 1 containing 32 84 kg n ha 1 64 92 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 80 42 kg ha 1 k2o was applied in the soil the drip irrigation system and a transparent plastic mulch were also set up before planting the spacing between rows and plants is shown in fig 1 the tunnels were covered with 0 06 mm polyethylene film during the experiment and the ventilation was carried out every day according to the temperature inside the tunnel the vents were closed during raining events pest and disease control was performed if necessary all branches of plants were removed according to local practices fruits were harvested every day when they reached the market standards the last harvest was at july 1 st in 2016 and july 4th in 2017 the experiments consisted of a factorial design of 4 n doses 4 irrigation water amounts and 2 irrigation intervals d1 4d and d2 2d totally 32 treatments table 2 and 3 the nr chemical n recommended was calculated as crop n requirements minus the mineral n supply from the soil and organic fertilizers a method widely used in the local region in this calculation the expected parameters are as follows cucumber yield 90 mg ha 1 crop nutrients requirements per 1000 kg cucumber fruit 3 4 kg n 1 3 kg p2o5 4 5 kg k2o soil available nue 45 the soil mineral n content at planting was shown in table1 organic fertilizer nue 20 chemical fertilizer nue 50 these parameters were according to experimental results under traditional fertilization conditions conducted by local agricultural office in recent years and widely used to guide tunnel cucumber production of local farmers and then 4 n doses were calculated as n1 0 5 nr n2 0 75 nr n3 nr and n4 1 25 nr the detailed data of chemical fertilization is shown in table 2 chemical n phosphorus and potassium were provided as urea calcium superphosphate and potassium sulfate respectively the calcium superphosphate was applied before soil preparation as a base fertilizer while urea and potassium sulfate were applied by the fertigation system during the experiment to meet the plant requirement 20 n was applied during 0 to 40 days after planting 40 n and 40 potassium were applied during 40 to 80 days after planting and 40 n and 60 potassium were applied during 80 days after planting to the end according to n and potassium accumulation patterns of cucumber plants in previous work unpublished data at each growth stage the calculated amounts of soluble urea and potassium sulfate were applied on average in each irrigation event etc crop evapotranspiration was estimated as etc et0 kc where et0 reference crop evapotranspiration was calculated using the cropwat software version 8 0 smith 1992 using climate data collected from the experimental tunnels while kc is the crop coefficient the values and durations of kc were according to our observation during the experiment and the data of sun et al 2012 a study of cucumber water and n management in the greenhouse in shandong province china 36 68 37 32 n 118 53 119 17 e specially the kc initial middle and end were set to be 0 8 1 1 and 1 1 and the durations of initial development middle and end were 7 d 18 d 88 d 10 d in 2016 and 7 d 23 d 86 d 10 d in 2017 respectively thus 4 irrigation amounts were set as i1 0 5 etc i2 0 75 etc i3 etc and i4 1 25 etc plants were irrigated with 45 mm on march 1 and 45 mm on march 2 for a better plant establishment prior to the beginning of the irrigation treatments according to the common practice of local farmers the exact data of irrigation amount and time of the treatments were shown in table 3 the dates of last irrigation were june 22 in 2016 and june 26 in 2017 in this experiment 8 plots were arranged in each tunnel as shown in fig 1 each plot was separated by pvc plates to 0 5 m depth to prevent cross movement of water and nutrients the fertigation system of each plot was independently controlled which allowed us to perform the trials in a randomized block experimental design the experiment included 3 replicate plots per treatment thus each replicate included 4 tunnels and the total experiment used 12 tunnels per year 2 3 measurements weather data for et0 calculation were collected using a fully equipped weather station nhqxz601 wuhan zhongke nenghui technology development co ltd china located in one of the experiment tunnels at 1 5 m height the ventilated aspirated psychcrometer nh121ws r for air temperature and relative humidity measurement the pyranometer nhfs15b for solar radiation measurement and the cup anemometer nhfs45bp at 0 5 m for wind velocity measurement were also provided by the same manufacturer the precipitation was measured by another weather station located outside the tunnels with a tipping bucket rain sensor nhjyl42bp water level sensors ykkt 1e xian xingyi yibiao technology co ltd china were used to continuously monitor the groundwater level one sensor per tunnel was used soil samples were taken from 0 to 30 cm layer for parameter analysis listed in table 1 soil analysis was conducted following documented methods lu 1999 the volume of irrigation applied to each treatment was controlled using flow meters one flow meter per plot fruit yield was the total weight of fruits that were harvested through each season converted into kg ha 1 at the end of crop dry weight of leaves stems fruits and roots of 5 randomly selected plants in each replicated plot including the pruned branches and harvested fruits were determined by oven drying representative samples at 65 c until constant weight and total dry matter was determined as the sum of dry matter in all organs the n concentrations of leaves stems fruits and roots was determined individually by the micro kjeldahl protocol of digestion and titration bremner and mulvaney 1982 the total n uptake was calculated using the n concentration of each tissue and the dry matter self made lysimeters were installed before the experiment in each replicated plot 5 per plot at a 30 cm depth collecting surface the collecting surface of the lysimeter is a circle with 25 cm diameter pvc net in combination with geotextile fleece were applied as the collecting surface the exact dimensions of the lysimeter is shown in fig 2 soil water samples from lysimeters were collected and the volumes were measured every 5 days using a syringe with a long needle fig 2 the container of the lysimeter was big enough to avoid the overflow n concentrations of soil water samples were determined using a continuous flow analyzer futura alliance france the amount of n in each sample was calculated as the volume times the n concentration although the n amount in the sample was the mix of the n leaching and the n upflux in this occasion the amount of n leaching was approximatively estimated as the n amount in the sample since the n concentration in the groundwater was negligible 20 30 times less than those of leachates data not shown thus the total n leaching kg ha 1 of each treatment was calculated as total n leaching collected in the lysimeters times the ratio of one hectare to the area of the collecting surface of lysimeters 5 lysimeters per plot in this experiment irrigation iwue was defined as fruit yield divided by the volume of irrigation applied kg mm 1 and the n use efficiency nue was calculated as fruit weight divided by total mineral n applied kg kg 1 2 4 statistical analysis multi way anovas were used to determine significances among n rates irrigation water amounts irrigation intervals and cultivated years in spss statistics 18 the significance of the treatment effect and their interactions was determined using the f test and comparisons of means were carried out using the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level 3 results 3 1 rainfall and underground water table daily precipitation and the depth of water table at the experimental site are shown in fig 3 the rainfall during the cropping cycle was 592 1 mm in 2016 and 274 9 mm in 2017 in both years a large amount of precipitation was observed in june 49 in 2016 and 46 in 2017 during the cropping cycle although the precipitation in 2016 was much more than that in 2017 the depth of the water table was similar between two years ranging from 10 to 72 cm in 2016 and 11 to 77 cm in 2017 indicating abundant groundwater resources in this region as shown in fig 3 although the vent of tunnels was closed during rain events the depth of the water table in these plastic sheds was closely related to the precipitation indicating a fast horizontal groundwater movement in this region 3 2 cucumber yield the cucumber yield response to different treatments is shown in table 4 over two years study cucumber yield ranged from 61 2 n1i1d1 2016 to 107 5 mg ha 1 n4i2d2 2017 each year cucumber yields of n2 n3 and n4 treatment were significantly higher than that of the n1 treatment and there was no significant yield difference among n2 n3 and n4 in both years there was a significant irrigation n interaction effect on cucumber yield in treatments n1 and n2 cucumber yield increased when the irrigation volume increased from i1 to i2 and then declined in treatments i3 and i4 implying that the irrigation water exceeded the demand of the cucumber growth when the applied volume was larger than i2 as in treatments n3 and n4 no significant differences in cucumber yield were observed between treatments i2 and i3 irrigation frequency also had a remarkable effect on the cucumber yield d1 d2 in addition statistical analysis of the experimental data indicated significant differences in the yields in terms of the experimental year 2016 2017 probably due to the higher rain in 2016 than in 2017 statistically n2i2d2 was the best treatment for achieving the highest yield of cucumber in these experimental conditions 3 3 dry matter production the total plant dry matter of different treatments is shown table 5 the response of plant dry matter to different levels of n and water application was similar to that of the crop fresh yield i e crop dry matter increased when n rate increased from n1 to n2 whereas more n application had no effect on improving the crop dry matter among 4 irrigation treatments i2 always achieved the highest dry matter unlike the fresh yield pattern in 2 experimental years the plant dry matter was not significantly different between 2016 and 2017 3 4 n uptake as shown in table 6 the crop n uptake increased with the increase of n applied from n1 to n3 when extra n fertilizer was applied n4 no increases in n uptake were observed a similar irrigation n interaction was also detected in terms of n uptake in treatments n1 and n2 the highest n uptake was observed in irrigation treatment i2 and the lowest n uptake was in treatment i1 the n uptake of irrigation treatments i3 and i4 were between the maximum and minimum values as in treatments n3 and n4 the amount of n uptake of treatments i2 and i3 were similar the impact of irrigation frequency and experimental year on the crop n uptake was also significant d1 d2 2016 2017 comparing with n2 treatment n3 had a higher n uptake which had no beneficial effect on cucumber yield table 4 indicating that a luxury n consumption occurred in treatment n3 3 5 n leaching the response of n leaching to different irrigation and n treatments is shown in table 7 the n leached significantly increased with the increase of irrigation water and n fertilizer applied n4 n3 n2 n1 i4 i3 i2 i1 there were no significant differences of n leaching between the 2016 and 2017 experiments the seasonal evolution of n leaching of treatment n2i2d1 and n2i2d2 in 2016 was shown in fig 4 basically the amount of n leaching showed a declining trend during plant growth other treatments also revealed similar tendency data not shown comparing with the 4 d interval irrigation schedule the 2 d interval strategy had a beneficial impact on the reduction of the n leaching the results also indicated that the great amount of water application at the first and second day after planting caused serious n leaching 3 6 iwue of different treatments iwue was significantly affected by the n dose across the 2 years table 8 higher iwues were observed in plots that received more n fertilizer n2 n3 and n4 indicating the water utility in the n1 treatment was limited by the available n the differences in iwue were not significant among n2 n3 and n4 treatments in the 4 irrigation treatments the iwue data followed the pattern i4 i3 i2 i1 statistically as expected higher iwue was achieved in d2 than in d1 treatment indicating smaller volume but more frequent irrigation is beneficial to improve the iwue there was no significant irrigation n interaction on iwue in both years of the experiment in addition the iwue was significantly higher in 2016 than that of 2017 mostly due to the lower irrigation volume of water applied in 2016 than in 2017 3 7 nue of different treatments in both years the nue decreased significantly with the increased in n fertilizer rate table 9 the effect of irrigation water amount on the nue was significant and there was an irrigation n interaction on nue similar to the yield and n uptake response in treatments n1 and n2 the nue increased significantly from treatment i1 to i2 but decreased if more water was applied i3 and i4 in treatment n3 and n4 the nues of i2 and i3 were higher than those of i1 and i4 and the nue was similar between treatments i2 and i3 regarding the

11067,the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river present high rainfall and always have a high water table recently drip fertigation has been introduced and widely used for vegetable production in this area to investigate the effect of shallow groundwater and the newly developed fertigation on the cucumber water and nitrogen n requirement experiments were carried out in plastic tunnels in yangzhou jiangsu china during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons using a randomized block design with three replicates four n rates 4 irrigation amounts and 2 irrigation intervals 2 d and 4 d were applied in this experiment the results showed that irrigation amount of 75 of estimated plant evapotranspiration etc was optimal to obtain the highest yield indicating shallow groundwater had a considerable contribution to the cucumber plant evapotranspiration in this condition fertigation technology improved the irrigation water use efficiency iwue and n use efficiency nue and 75 of the recommended n rate calculated according to a traditional local nutrient balance method optimized cucumber yield frequent irrigation with low water volume had a beneficial impact on the improvement of

water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction walk in plastic tunnels are the most common facilities for vegetable production in china according to the official statistics there were about 1 7 million hectares of walk in tunnels in china in 2013 among which about 26 percent were located in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river ministry of agriculture of the p r china 2014 these tunnels are always 6 8 m wide 2 3 3 5 m high and 30 60 m long warm season vegetables such as cucurbits beans and solanaceous crops are always forcing cultured in the spring or retarding cultured in the autumn in these un heated plastic tunnels in recent years due to the rising labor cost surface drip fertigation coupled with plastic film mulching has been widely adopted in this vegetable production system cucumber is one of the most important vegetable crops grown in these tunnels in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river due to its high yield and sparse root system cucumber always needs adequate water and nutrient supply and is very sensitive to the content of water and available nitrogen n in the soil yuan et al 2006 the response of cucumber yield water use efficiency wue and n use efficiency nue to different irrigation and fertilization strategies has been studied in detail in the past decades in different regions of the world beyaert et al 2007 grewal et al 2011 kotsiras et al 2002 mao et al 2003 ruiz and romero 2002 sánchez guerrero et al 2009 şimşek et al 2005 yan et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 in these studies the irrigation schedule was determined using either data of class a pan evaporation or soil moisture sensors while the nitrogen rate was determined according to the local growers conventional rate or calculated using the soil n balance method always less than the conventional rate the optimal treatment varied among different researches depending on the climatic conditions the soil properties and the cultivation methods up to date most research about the water and n management of cucumber were carried out in arid or semi arid regions the water resources in these regions were scarce and the researchers tried to improve the wue of cucumber and cope with the water shortage in the local areas abdalhi et al 2016 liang et al 2014 xiao et al 2013 yaghi et al 2013 unlike the regions mentioned above the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river is rich in precipitation and high in groundwater table according to the official statistics the annual precipitation in this region normally varied from 1000 mm to 1400 mm and mostly happens in the spring and the summer season china meteorological administration 2018 according to our measurements the depth of the water table is commonly less than 0 5 m in vegetable tunnels during the summer at different sites in this region in some fields which have drainage problems the waterlogging always happens during the rainy season due to the increasing global warming and the sea level rise there are more and more areas suffering from similar high water table condition or even waterlogging stress all over the world ipcc 2013 unfortunately up to date the n and water movements and optimal irrigation and nitrogen management of vegetable crops in plastic tunnels have not been well studied in these areas the contribution of groundwater towards crop evapotranspiration has been investigated by many researchers han et al 2015 liu et al 2006 ramos et al 2017 wu et al 2015 satchithanantham et al 2014 reported that in some conditions up to 92 of the potato water demand was met by capillary rise from the shallow groundwater in our trials we installed some lysimeters in unirrigated areas in the tunnels and always found there were leachates in the container during the whole season although in most cases the water table was not over the collecting surface of the lysimeters unpublished data this phenomenon indicated that the upward water may have a contribution to the crop evapotranspiration and the drainage collected by lysimeters under high water table conditions may be the mix of the real drainage and the upward water on the other hand the leaching patterns of irrigated water and applied n should be different between the humid and arid soil tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 thus the irrigation and fertilization strategies of vegetable crops should be quite different between the two types of regions however the effect of these differences on the n and water management have not been investigated in detail the experimental data from arid or semi arid regions such as from the north china plain region were always applied directly in the cultivation practice of most plastic tunnel vegetables in humid areas in china in this experiment we investigated the effect of different irrigation approaches volume and frequency and n fertilization rates on cucumber yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and the n leaching of plastic tunnel cucumber production in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of shallow groundwater on the crop water requirement and collect information to improve the fertigation technology in high water table areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil properties the experimental was conducted on a vegetable farm 32 68 82 n 119 59 10 e in yangzhou jiangsu province during the 2016 and 2017 spring summer seasons the farm was located in a typical area of the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river according to the local meteorological office the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1021 mm of which about 22 precipitation occurs from march to may and 47 from june to august mean annual evaporation from the free water surface is 937 7 mm the average annual temperature in the study area is approximately 16 2 c soil texture at the experiment site was silt loam the soil physical and chemical characteristics are shown in table 1 2 2 crop management and treatments the experiments were carried out in the typical walk in plastic tunnels the tunnels were 50 m long and 8 m wide and oriented south north in 2016 and 2017 cucumber seedlings at 4 leaf stage were planted in these tunnels on march 1 st before planting dairy manure 45 m3 ha 1 containing 32 84 kg n ha 1 64 92 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 80 42 kg ha 1 k2o was applied in the soil the drip irrigation system and a transparent plastic mulch were also set up before planting the spacing between rows and plants is shown in fig 1 the tunnels were covered with 0 06 mm polyethylene film during the experiment and the ventilation was carried out every day according to the temperature inside the tunnel the vents were closed during raining events pest and disease control was performed if necessary all branches of plants were removed according to local practices fruits were harvested every day when they reached the market standards the last harvest was at july 1 st in 2016 and july 4th in 2017 the experiments consisted of a factorial design of 4 n doses 4 irrigation water amounts and 2 irrigation intervals d1 4d and d2 2d totally 32 treatments table 2 and 3 the nr chemical n recommended was calculated as crop n requirements minus the mineral n supply from the soil and organic fertilizers a method widely used in the local region in this calculation the expected parameters are as follows cucumber yield 90 mg ha 1 crop nutrients requirements per 1000 kg cucumber fruit 3 4 kg n 1 3 kg p2o5 4 5 kg k2o soil available nue 45 the soil mineral n content at planting was shown in table1 organic fertilizer nue 20 chemical fertilizer nue 50 these parameters were according to experimental results under traditional fertilization conditions conducted by local agricultural office in recent years and widely used to guide tunnel cucumber production of local farmers and then 4 n doses were calculated as n1 0 5 nr n2 0 75 nr n3 nr and n4 1 25 nr the detailed data of chemical fertilization is shown in table 2 chemical n phosphorus and potassium were provided as urea calcium superphosphate and potassium sulfate respectively the calcium superphosphate was applied before soil preparation as a base fertilizer while urea and potassium sulfate were applied by the fertigation system during the experiment to meet the plant requirement 20 n was applied during 0 to 40 days after planting 40 n and 40 potassium were applied during 40 to 80 days after planting and 40 n and 60 potassium were applied during 80 days after planting to the end according to n and potassium accumulation patterns of cucumber plants in previous work unpublished data at each growth stage the calculated amounts of soluble urea and potassium sulfate were applied on average in each irrigation event etc crop evapotranspiration was estimated as etc et0 kc where et0 reference crop evapotranspiration was calculated using the cropwat software version 8 0 smith 1992 using climate data collected from the experimental tunnels while kc is the crop coefficient the values and durations of kc were according to our observation during the experiment and the data of sun et al 2012 a study of cucumber water and n management in the greenhouse in shandong province china 36 68 37 32 n 118 53 119 17 e specially the kc initial middle and end were set to be 0 8 1 1 and 1 1 and the durations of initial development middle and end were 7 d 18 d 88 d 10 d in 2016 and 7 d 23 d 86 d 10 d in 2017 respectively thus 4 irrigation amounts were set as i1 0 5 etc i2 0 75 etc i3 etc and i4 1 25 etc plants were irrigated with 45 mm on march 1 and 45 mm on march 2 for a better plant establishment prior to the beginning of the irrigation treatments according to the common practice of local farmers the exact data of irrigation amount and time of the treatments were shown in table 3 the dates of last irrigation were june 22 in 2016 and june 26 in 2017 in this experiment 8 plots were arranged in each tunnel as shown in fig 1 each plot was separated by pvc plates to 0 5 m depth to prevent cross movement of water and nutrients the fertigation system of each plot was independently controlled which allowed us to perform the trials in a randomized block experimental design the experiment included 3 replicate plots per treatment thus each replicate included 4 tunnels and the total experiment used 12 tunnels per year 2 3 measurements weather data for et0 calculation were collected using a fully equipped weather station nhqxz601 wuhan zhongke nenghui technology development co ltd china located in one of the experiment tunnels at 1 5 m height the ventilated aspirated psychcrometer nh121ws r for air temperature and relative humidity measurement the pyranometer nhfs15b for solar radiation measurement and the cup anemometer nhfs45bp at 0 5 m for wind velocity measurement were also provided by the same manufacturer the precipitation was measured by another weather station located outside the tunnels with a tipping bucket rain sensor nhjyl42bp water level sensors ykkt 1e xian xingyi yibiao technology co ltd china were used to continuously monitor the groundwater level one sensor per tunnel was used soil samples were taken from 0 to 30 cm layer for parameter analysis listed in table 1 soil analysis was conducted following documented methods lu 1999 the volume of irrigation applied to each treatment was controlled using flow meters one flow meter per plot fruit yield was the total weight of fruits that were harvested through each season converted into kg ha 1 at the end of crop dry weight of leaves stems fruits and roots of 5 randomly selected plants in each replicated plot including the pruned branches and harvested fruits were determined by oven drying representative samples at 65 c until constant weight and total dry matter was determined as the sum of dry matter in all organs the n concentrations of leaves stems fruits and roots was determined individually by the micro kjeldahl protocol of digestion and titration bremner and mulvaney 1982 the total n uptake was calculated using the n concentration of each tissue and the dry matter self made lysimeters were installed before the experiment in each replicated plot 5 per plot at a 30 cm depth collecting surface the collecting surface of the lysimeter is a circle with 25 cm diameter pvc net in combination with geotextile fleece were applied as the collecting surface the exact dimensions of the lysimeter is shown in fig 2 soil water samples from lysimeters were collected and the volumes were measured every 5 days using a syringe with a long needle fig 2 the container of the lysimeter was big enough to avoid the overflow n concentrations of soil water samples were determined using a continuous flow analyzer futura alliance france the amount of n in each sample was calculated as the volume times the n concentration although the n amount in the sample was the mix of the n leaching and the n upflux in this occasion the amount of n leaching was approximatively estimated as the n amount in the sample since the n concentration in the groundwater was negligible 20 30 times less than those of leachates data not shown thus the total n leaching kg ha 1 of each treatment was calculated as total n leaching collected in the lysimeters times the ratio of one hectare to the area of the collecting surface of lysimeters 5 lysimeters per plot in this experiment irrigation iwue was defined as fruit yield divided by the volume of irrigation applied kg mm 1 and the n use efficiency nue was calculated as fruit weight divided by total mineral n applied kg kg 1 2 4 statistical analysis multi way anovas were used to determine significances among n rates irrigation water amounts irrigation intervals and cultivated years in spss statistics 18 the significance of the treatment effect and their interactions was determined using the f test and comparisons of means were carried out using the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level 3 results 3 1 rainfall and underground water table daily precipitation and the depth of water table at the experimental site are shown in fig 3 the rainfall during the cropping cycle was 592 1 mm in 2016 and 274 9 mm in 2017 in both years a large amount of precipitation was observed in june 49 in 2016 and 46 in 2017 during the cropping cycle although the precipitation in 2016 was much more than that in 2017 the depth of the water table was similar between two years ranging from 10 to 72 cm in 2016 and 11 to 77 cm in 2017 indicating abundant groundwater resources in this region as shown in fig 3 although the vent of tunnels was closed during rain events the depth of the water table in these plastic sheds was closely related to the precipitation indicating a fast horizontal groundwater movement in this region 3 2 cucumber yield the cucumber yield response to different treatments is shown in table 4 over two years study cucumber yield ranged from 61 2 n1i1d1 2016 to 107 5 mg ha 1 n4i2d2 2017 each year cucumber yields of n2 n3 and n4 treatment were significantly higher than that of the n1 treatment and there was no significant yield difference among n2 n3 and n4 in both years there was a significant irrigation n interaction effect on cucumber yield in treatments n1 and n2 cucumber yield increased when the irrigation volume increased from i1 to i2 and then declined in treatments i3 and i4 implying that the irrigation water exceeded the demand of the cucumber growth when the applied volume was larger than i2 as in treatments n3 and n4 no significant differences in cucumber yield were observed between treatments i2 and i3 irrigation frequency also had a remarkable effect on the cucumber yield d1 d2 in addition statistical analysis of the experimental data indicated significant differences in the yields in terms of the experimental year 2016 2017 probably due to the higher rain in 2016 than in 2017 statistically n2i2d2 was the best treatment for achieving the highest yield of cucumber in these experimental conditions 3 3 dry matter production the total plant dry matter of different treatments is shown table 5 the response of plant dry matter to different levels of n and water application was similar to that of the crop fresh yield i e crop dry matter increased when n rate increased from n1 to n2 whereas more n application had no effect on improving the crop dry matter among 4 irrigation treatments i2 always achieved the highest dry matter unlike the fresh yield pattern in 2 experimental years the plant dry matter was not significantly different between 2016 and 2017 3 4 n uptake as shown in table 6 the crop n uptake increased with the increase of n applied from n1 to n3 when extra n fertilizer was applied n4 no increases in n uptake were observed a similar irrigation n interaction was also detected in terms of n uptake in treatments n1 and n2 the highest n uptake was observed in irrigation treatment i2 and the lowest n uptake was in treatment i1 the n uptake of irrigation treatments i3 and i4 were between the maximum and minimum values as in treatments n3 and n4 the amount of n uptake of treatments i2 and i3 were similar the impact of irrigation frequency and experimental year on the crop n uptake was also significant d1 d2 2016 2017 comparing with n2 treatment n3 had a higher n uptake which had no beneficial effect on cucumber yield table 4 indicating that a luxury n consumption occurred in treatment n3 3 5 n leaching the response of n leaching to different irrigation and n treatments is shown in table 7 the n leached significantly increased with the increase of irrigation water and n fertilizer applied n4 n3 n2 n1 i4 i3 i2 i1 there were no significant differences of n leaching between the 2016 and 2017 experiments the seasonal evolution of n leaching of treatment n2i2d1 and n2i2d2 in 2016 was shown in fig 4 basically the amount of n leaching showed a declining trend during plant growth other treatments also revealed similar tendency data not shown comparing with the 4 d interval irrigation schedule the 2 d interval strategy had a beneficial impact on the reduction of the n leaching the results also indicated that the great amount of water application at the first and second day after planting caused serious n leaching 3 6 iwue of different treatments iwue was significantly affected by the n dose across the 2 years table 8 higher iwues were observed in plots that received more n fertilizer n2 n3 and n4 indicating the water utility in the n1 treatment was limited by the available n the differences in iwue were not significant among n2 n3 and n4 treatments in the 4 irrigation treatments the iwue data followed the pattern i4 i3 i2 i1 statistically as expected higher iwue was achieved in d2 than in d1 treatment indicating smaller volume but more frequent irrigation is beneficial to improve the iwue there was no significant irrigation n interaction on iwue in both years of the experiment in addition the iwue was significantly higher in 2016 than that of 2017 mostly due to the lower irrigation volume of water applied in 2016 than in 2017 3 7 nue of different treatments in both years the nue decreased significantly with the increased in n fertilizer rate table 9 the effect of irrigation water amount on the nue was significant and there was an irrigation n interaction on nue similar to the yield and n uptake response in treatments n1 and n2 the nue increased significantly from treatment i1 to i2 but decreased if more water was applied i3 and i4 in treatment n3 and n4 the nues of i2 and i3 were higher than those of i1 and i4 and the nue was similar between treatments i2 and i3 regarding the irrigation interval treatments the nue of d2 was significantly higher than that of d1 there was no significant differences in nue between 2016 and 2017 experiments according to the data list above the recommended fertigation strategy in the experimental condition was the combination of 75 of the estimated crop etc 75 of the recommended n and 2d interval in which the cucumber yield of 105 4 mg ha 1

11068,soil evaporation es is quite challenging to measure directly and researchers most commonly resort to using mini lysimeter s to measure es from both bare soil and from soil beneath the crop canopy however this technique is unable to measure es during and shortly after periods of irrigation or rain and an approach to fill data gaps during these periods would be valuable one possible approach is the use of the relationship between es pan evaporation ep and gravimetric soil water content θg to this end a mini lysimeter field study was carried out during periods of low evaporative demand ep 3 mm and high evaporative demand ep 3 mm to determine the relationship between es ep and θg there was a highly significant multi linear relationship between es ep θg and time after wetting r2 0 78 p 0 001 direct measurement using mini lysimeters and gap filling using ep on days of irrigation or rainfall and the multi linear relationship for up to 6 d following wetting events showed that significant amounts of water were lost as es from both wheat 168 mm and dry seeded rice 455 mm crops this study suggested that both θg and evaporative demand influence es collectively and are not separate influences as has been implied by ritchie s two stage evaporation model ritchie 1972 the high significance and high r2 of the relationship between es θg ep and time suggests that θg can be used to calculate es after irrigation or rainfall when empirical measurements of es are unavailable further the strong significance of regression between θg and ep suggests that water content and energy potential are important components of es during both stage 1 and stage 2 evaporation keywords zero till wheat dry seeded rice model simulation apsim 1 introduction understanding how water

interception becomes more prominent eberbach and pala 2005 knowledge of et is useful in evaluating the probable soil water status of field crops and in aiding irrigation scheduling of crops several methods to determine et of field crops exist et is most commonly estimated using a water balance approach where et is assumed to be the product of the change in soil water content over the soil root depth taking into account rainfall and predicted drainage while knowledge of et is useful to improve the efficiency by which crops use water knowledge of es and t are valuable es and t are not fixed quotients of et but vary as the crop develops early in the life of a crop es predominates but as the crop canopy develops t becomes increasingly important simpson et al 1992 eberbach and pala 2005 balwinder singh et al 2011a alberto et al 2014 both es and t are difficult to estimate and methods to quantify t directly are complex and error associated with scaling from point to field estimates is fraught with issues as a consequence t is usually estimated by subtracting es from et as measured over a predetermined time interval cooper et al 1983 balwinder singh et al 2011a evaporation from the soil surface of non flooded crops and from the surface of ponded water in rice fields is a major source of water loss over the period of the crop es accounts for 30 40 of et in transplanted and direct seeded rice uchijima 1961 bouman et al 2005 alberto et al 2011 hossen et al 2012 and 26 30 of et in irrigated wheat zhang et al 1998 balwinder singh et al 2011a es is difficult to measure directly and while several approaches have been developed e g al khafaf et al 1978 sakuratani 1987 ham et al 1990 researchers most commonly use mini lysimeters to determine es from both bare soil and from beneath the crop canopy e g walker 1983 allen 1990 batchelor 1992 yunusa et al 1993 eberbach and pala 2005 balwinder singh et al 2011a the use of mini lysimetry to determine es has been comprehensively reviewed e g boast and robertson 1982 and despite being time consuming and labour intensive mini lysimeters are acknowledged as a reliable method to determine es empirically and precisely but this technique is unable to determine es during or shortly after rain or irrigation thompson et al 1997 eberbach and pala 2005 flumignan et al 2011 the importance of the correct measurement of es cannot be underestimated as any mistake in measuring es particularly where interventions to manipulate crop water use efficiency are being investigated can compound the error in estimating t allen 1990 emphasized the importance of es during rainy days and reported that 24 rainy days constituted 40 of total es during the 100 days of es measurement in a fertilised barley crop several approaches have been attempted to estimate es during and shortly after rain or irrigation balwinder singh et al 2011a estimated es during periods of inundation using pan evaporation ep and for the period immediately after inundation ceased they used the ratio es ep from the next empirical measurement event in combination with ep for the missing period to predict es for that period eberbach and pala 2005 showed a significant relationship between soil water content θv and es ep over several rainless periods and used this relationship to estimate es using θv and ep on rainy days as ep and soil water content are comparatively easy to measure the use of these two indices to reliably estimate es warrants further investigation numerical modelling has also been used to estimate es and several approaches have been developed which require minimal data input ritchie 1972 cooper et al 1983 boesten and stroosnijder 1986 ritchie s 1972 2 stage model is an adaptation of the approach proposed by philip 1957 and ascribes evaporation from soil as occurring in two stages stage 1 depends on the drying potential of the air evaporative demand while stage 2 depends mainly on soil hydraulic properties lemon 1956 philip 1957 ritchie 1972 idso et al 1974 this approach is probably the most widely consulted conceptual model used at present to simulate es and is used in sophisticated crop growth models such as dssat and apsim ines et al 2001 jones et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 but several studies indicate that the process driving es may not fit into two discrete stages balwinder singh et al 2014 showed that ritchie s 1972 model did not adequately match empirically determined stage 2 es under the canopy of a wheat crop and that stage 2 es was strongly influenced by evaporative demand determined as ep as well as soil hydraulic properties this implies that the use of simulation models based on ritchie s function to predict es after wetting events may be less than ideal thus the search for alternative approaches to determine es should continue in order to fill data gaps during periods when direct measurement is prevented by rainfall or irrigation with these points in mind a study was initiated to develop a data gap filling procedure similar to the method suggested by eberbach and pala 2005 and to apply this procedure to datasets obtained from a rice wheat cropping system experiment conducted in punjab state india the specific aims of the work presented here were to 1 determine the relationship between es ep and gravimetric soil water content θg after soil wetting and 2 examine the use of the relationship between es ep and θg in estimating es after wetting events and seasonal cumulative es in wheat and dry seeded rice crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 site the study was conducted on a sandy loam soil representative of the major soils used for the irrigated wheat rice cropping systems of the state of punjab in north west india the climate is semi arid tropical with average annual rainfall of 734 mm 80 of which falls during the rainy season late june to september rice is grown from june to october and wheat from november to april 2 2 experiments two experiments were conducted at the one site 1 a large plot rice wheat cropping system experiment was conducted over 2 5 years and 2 a mini lysimeter experiment was conducted in buffer areas of the large plot experiment over a period of 6 months during the latter stages of the large plot experiment 2 2 1 large plot experiment a rice wheat cropping system experiment was conducted during 2011 14 commencing with wheat sown in november 2011 and concluding with wheat sown in november 2014 this was a 3 factor experiment with two tillage treatments for both wheat and rice conventional dry tillage ct zero tillage zt and two rice residue management treatments removed m retained on the soil surface as a mulch in wheat table 1 the main plots were combinations of wheat tillage x mulch treatments with rice tillage treatments in sub plots 9 3 m x 6 5 m in a split plot design with three replicates all rice crops were dry seeded and both the wheat and rice crops were drill sown with a row spacing of 20 cm the wheat was irrigated when soil matric potential at 32 5 cm declined below 35 kpa and the rice was irrigated when soil matric potential at 17 5 cm fell below 15 kpa full crop management and experimental details are provided in naveen gupta et al 2016 together with results of the effects of the treatments on crop performance details pertinent to the determination of es from the 2011 non mulched zt wheat treatment and the subsequent zt rice treatment cropping system 6 in table 1 are presented here es was determined in mini lysimeters which were placed in silos installed between the plant rows within all plots of the wheat and rice crops in the ztw ztdsr system the methods of construction of the mini lysimeters and silos and the determination of es are provided in section 2 3 below however mini lysimeters were unable to be used on days of rain or irrigation nor for the first few days thereafter resulting in data gaps 2 2 2 mini lysimeter experiment the purpose of the mini lysimeter experiment was to determine the relationship between es ep and gravimetric soil water content θg after soil wetting and to use this relationship to calculate es on days when es could not be determined using mini lysimeters this was a 2 factor experiment with two tillage treatments ct zt and two mulch treatments m m with three replicates the mini lysimeter experiment was conducted in non cropped buffer areas of the large plot experiment after harvest of the fourth crop rice the mini lysimeter experiment was repeated over three drying cycles during periods of low ep 3 mm and high ep 3 mm evaporative demand between november 2013 and june 2014 multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the combined influence of mulch treatment m m tillage treatment ct zt gravimetric soil moisture θg at the start of the day 9 a m daily ep and time days after irrigation on es the analysis was performed using genstat 18th edition vsni 2 3 the determination of es using mini lysimeters 2 3 1 construction and collection of mini lysimeters the mini lysimeters comprised intact soil cores encased in pvc cylinders each mini lysimeter casing was 0 20 m long with 0 10 m outer diameter and 2 5 mm wall thickness pvc was chosen to minimise heat conduction from the atmosphere to the soil within the core and because the material is light cheap and easy to handle for the determination of es in the zt wheat and rice crops of the large plot experiment soil cores were collected from between the crop rows in the buffer areas adjacent to the treatment plots taking care not to damage the crop the buffer areas had been cropped treated and managed in the same way as the adjacent plots throughout the duration of the experiment for the mini lysimeter experiment cores were collected from the buffer areas of the double conventional till and double zero till treatments with and without mulch systems 1 3 6 and 8 in table 1 24 h after irrigation collection of the soil cores involved the insertion of the pvc cylinders 0 2 m into the soil which were then carefully removed to minimise disturbance to the plots any soil protruding from the bottoms of the cylinders was trimmed the outsides of the cylinders were cleaned and dried and a clean pvc cap was fitted to the bottom of each cylinder the soil filled cylinders mini lysimeters were then weighed and installed in silos in the cropped plots large plot experiment or non cropped buffer area mini lysimeter experiment 2 3 2 construction of silos to house the mini lysimeters each silo was prepared by excavating a cylindrical hole in the soil using an auger and inserting a pvc cylinder 0 125 m diameter 0 20 m long which acted as a sleeve to house the mini lysimeters each sleeve had a perforated cap on the base to allow drainage in case of rain or irrigation in the large plot experiment one silo was installed in each plot of the selected treatments between the plant rows following the approach of balwinder singh et al 2011a in the mini lysimeter experiment twelve silos to house mini lysimeters were installed in one buffer area this buffer area was not cropped and the silos were arranged in 2 rows of 6 with spacing of 0 20 m between the rows and between the silos within the rows after placement of the mini lysimeters in the silos chopped 5 cm length rice straw mulch was applied in the zt m and ct m mini lysimeters at a rate equivalent to 3 t ha 1 while the soil surface of the zt m and ct m mini lysimeters remained bare 2 3 3 measurement of es using mini lysimeters to measure es each mini lysimeter was removed from its silo every morning at around 9 a m weighed and immediately returned to the silo weighing was done using a digital field balance with an accuracy of 0 001 g giving the capacity to resolve evaporation from each mini lysimeter to 0 0001 mm the mini lysimeters were replaced with fresh mini lysimeters every 5 d consistent with the approach of eberbach and pala 2005 and as soon as possible following irrigation or rainfall in the large plot experiment mini lysimeters were installed 3 d after sowing das of the wheat and 36 das of the rice and measurements were continued throughout each season until harvest in the mini lysimeter experiment the measurements were conducted for 15 d meaning that there were three changes of mini lysimeters after completion of the first 15 d cycle avg daily ep 2 2 mm on 27th november 2013 the buffer areas were irrigated on 30th december 2013 and a second 15 d cycle was implemented from 31st december 2013 to 15th january 2014 avg daily ep 1 2 mm on 21st may 2014 the buffer areas were again irrigated prior to the conduct of a third cycle starting on 22nd may 2014 during a period of high evaporative demand avg daily ep 9 3 mm there was no rainfall during the first two drying cycles and 10 mm in one event on the fourth day of the third cycle table 2 2 4 measurement of rainfall and ep rainfall was measured at 9 a m daily using a manual rain gauge installed at the experimental site daily class a pan evaporation ep was measured at 9 a m each day using a class a pan located at the punjab agricultural university weather station approximately 2 km from the experimental site 2 5 gap filling es after wetting events in wheat and rice crops in the large plot experiment gap filling was required on days of rainfall or irrigation and for a few days after these wetting events until fresh mini lysimeters could be installed without damaging the plots on days of irrigation or rain 10 mm and of inundation on subsequent days as a result of these events es was assumed to be equal to ep in both the wheat and rice crops consistent with the approach of balwinder singh et al 2011a but for the few days after inundation ceased and before mini lysimeter data became available again es was derived from ep θg and time after wetting using the multiple regression equation developed in the mini lysimeter experiment sections 2 2 2 3 1 2 5 1 determination of θg in the larger experiment daily values of soil water tension and the relationship between soil tension and θg were used to estimate θg as direct determination of θg was not possible shortly after irrigation or heavy rainfall the relationship was developed using soil tension and gravimetric soil water content measured during the 2011 12 wheat crop of the larger experiment soil tension and gravimetric soil water content were determined in each plot of each treatment i e ct m ct m zt m and zt m soil tension was measured daily using tube tensiometers with the centre of the ceramic cups at 10 and 20 cm the tensiometers were installed in tight fitting holes in each plot of selected treatments as described in naveen gupta et al 2016 gravimetric soil water content was determined on soil samples collected from the 0 15 cm depth using a soil auger diameter 5 cm samples were collected twice weekly and shortly before irrigation the soil was mixed well and a weighed subsample was dried for 48 h at 105 c and then reweighed to determine θg regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between θg and soil water tension mean of values at 10 cm and 20 cm the regressions were conducted for m and m separately as it was considered that mulch would likely affect the distribution of soil moisture throughout the profile as well as the total amount the relationships were best described using a power function and variation in θg accounted for 65 77 of the variation in soil water tension eqs 1 2 t test were performed to compare the measured and predicted values of θg for non mulched and mulched soil using eqs 1 and 2 the t tests indicated that predicted θg was not significantly different from the measured values a comparison of eqs 1 and 2 using the tukey kramer method howell 2013 showed that the relationships were significantly different p 0 001 therefore separate regressions were used for mulched and non mulched soil as follows 1 non mulched soilθg 19 889 swt 0 172 n 92 r2 0 65 2 mulched soilθg 19 607 swt 0 174 n 115 r2 0 77 where swt is the mean of soil water tension determined at 10 and 20 cm eq 1 was used to estimate θg 0 20 cm after irrigation or rain when mini lysimeter data were not available in the 2011 12 zt m wheat crop and in the subsequent 2012 zt rice crop from 36 das to harvest 2 5 2 determination of es from rice during the first 36 days after sowing neither mini lysimeters nor the regression equation could be used for estimation of es during the first 36 das of the 2012 zt rice crop as soil tension measurements and the installation of mini lysimeters did not commence until 36 das due to frequent wetting from rain and irrigation after sowing however daily soil volumetric water content 0 7 5 cm and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat were available therefore during the period 1 36 das es was determined using the following procedures during periods of inundation between sowing and 36 das es was assumed to be equal to ep on days when the site was not inundated es was assumed to be equal to the decrease in volumetric water content in the 0 7 5 cm layer experienced over that particular day taking into account any drainage that was estimated to have occurred on that day volumetric soil water content was determined daily using a hand held time domain reflectometer field scout tdr 300 soil moisture meter with 7 5 cm long probes once ponding had ceased the tdr was calibrated by taking measurements in water and in air product manual spectrum technologies inc volumetric water content was converted to soil water content in millimetres by multiplying by the probe length 7 5 cm and dividing by 10 drainage on the day after inundation was determined from the product of the soil matric potential smp gradient and saturated hydraulic conductivity using darcy s law eq 3 the smp gradient was estimated from measurements of soil water tension at 10 and 15 cm made on the first day after each irrigation of the 2011 12 wheat between 41 and 76 das naveen gupta et al 2016 3 d r a i n a g e c m h 1 ψ 10 ψ 15 d i s t a n c e b e t w e e n t e n s i o m e t e r t i p s c m k s a t where ψ 10 and ψ 15 are the soil matric potential cm at soil depths of 10 and 15 cm respectively the ksat 10 cm h 1 was determined in situ at 10 cm depth using a guelph permeameter 0 kpa soil matric suction in this free draining soil it was assumed that all drainage from the top 7 5 cm occurred within one day after inundation 2 6 whole season es in wheat and rice from combining mini lysimeter and gap filled data the mini lysimeter and gap filled data were combined to produce whole of season es data sets for the zt m wheat crop in 2011 12 and the subsequent zt rice crop in 2012 to test the validity of the gap filled data 2 7 simulation of es in rice and wheat using apsim wheat and rice daily gap filled values of es derived using the regression of es on ep θg and time eq 4 section 3 1 were compared with apsim simulated values cumulative simulated es for the same wheat and rice crops from sowing to maturity was also compared with the empirically derived cumulative es the apsim cropping system simulation model and the wheat and rice modules used in the model are described in asseng et al 1998 2002 wang et al 2003 and bouman and van laar 2006 apsim was parameterized and validated for rice and wheat grown on a sandy loam soil at the same location using the same varieties as the present study by balwinder singh et al 2015a b their validated model was used in the present study to simulate es for the 2011 12 zt m wheat and 2012 zt rice crops 3 results 3 1 the multilinear relationship between es and ep θg tillage mulch and time the multilinear regression showed that neither tillage nor mulch had a significant influence on es while the effects of θg ep and time t after wetting were highly significant table 3 the multiple regression model was therefore rerun by excluding the non significant parameters viz tillage and mulch this also showed es to be highly dependent on soil moisture content θg ep and time p 0 001 and together these three factors accounted for 78 of the variation in es 4 es 0 7446 14 07 θg 0 2788 ep 0 0958 t n 136 r2 0 78 where t is the number days after the wetting event in this study θg varied from 0 1 to 0 2 g water per 100 g soil ep varied from 0 2 to 10 mm and time varied from 1 to 15 days thus variation in θg ep and t would vary es by maxima of 1 4 2 7 and 1 3 mm respectively indicating that variation in ep has about twice the effect of variation in θg and t on es 3 2 estimation of es over the wheat and rice cropping seasons the non mulched zt wheat crop in 2011 12 and the subsequent 2012 zt rice crop received 4 and 18 irrigations respectively and experienced 9 and 24 rainy days fig 1 determination of es using mini lysimeters was therefore not possible on those days and for the following 3 4 days the plots of daily es for the whole season combining the mini lysimeter data and gap filled data derived using ep on days of inundation and eq 4 suggest that the derived data provide a good fit with the trends in measured es for both the wheat fig 2 and rice crops fig 3 using the mini lysimeter and gap filled data cumulative es during the wheat season was 168 mm with 69 115 mm of the daily es obtained from direct measurement using the mini lysimeters the gap filled data derived from eq 4 accounted for 19 of total es equivalent to 31 mm of cumulative es while 22 mm 13 was from using ep on days when the site was inundated similarly cumulative es during the rice season was calculated to be 455 mm this included 228 mm 50 of the total from sowing to 36 das as calculated using the tdr and drainage data 112 mm and using ep on days when the site was inundated 116 mm from 37 das until harvest es of 58 mm 13 of the total seasonal es was measured directly using mini lysimeters 88 mm 19 was gap filled data derived from eq 4 and 81 mm 18 was gap filled using ep on days when the plots were inundated 3 3 comparison of es derived from the regression and apsim simulated es agreement between values of daily gap filled es derived using eq 4 and simulated values using apsim was poor in both wheat fig 4 a and rice fig 4b paired t test analyses indicated that there were significant differences p 0 05 between es determined using the two methods for both crops values of es derived using eq 4 were on average 1 4 mm lower than the simulated values for each crop during the days of gap filling using the regression ep ranged from 1 to 5 mm in the wheat and from 0 5 to 8 mm in the rice 3 4 comparison of measured and gap filled cumulative es and simulated cumulative es there was poor agreement between cumulative es determined using mini lyismeter and gap filled data and simulated apsim cumulative es during the wheat crop with the values diverging as the season progressed fig 5 a the divergence was due to higher values from both the mini lysimeters and gap filling using eq 4 or ep on days of inundation than the simulated values the mini lysimeter and gap fill regression data accounted for 29 and 22 mm of the total divergence respectively while the higher values of ep accounted for 13 mm of the divergence paired t test analyses indicated that there were significant differences p 0 05 between es measured using mini lysimeter and simulated es as well as between es estimated using eq 4 or ep on days of inundation and simulated es the net result was that cumulative es calculated from empirical and gap filled data exceeded es by 64 mm or 61 compared to simulated es the agreement between simulated and observed mini lysimeter and gap filled cumulative es in rice was very good during the first 42 das after which the values steadily diverged with observed es higher than simulated es fig 5b during the first 36 das when es was estimated from tdr and soil matric potential data and from ep on days of inundation observed cumulative es was 228 mm compared to the simulated value of 229 mm from 37 das to harvest observed cumulative es was 228 mm compared with simulated es of 98 mm a difference of 130 mm paired t test analyses indicated that there were significant differences p 0 05 between observed es mini lysimeter or estimated using eq 4 or ep on days of inundation and simulated es the higher cumulative es was mainly due to higher es estimated from the regression by 50 mm and using ep on days of inundation by 59 mm the contribution to the divergence from higher es observed using the mini lyismeters was much lower at 20 mm noting that mini lysimeters could only be used occasionally throughout most of the season and at the end of the season when es was low 4 discussion 4 1 the relationship between es ep and θg given the highly significant multi linear relationship between es and θg ep and time eq 4 provided a useful tool to estimate es during periods after soil wetting when mini lysimeters data were not available the relationship accounted for 78 of the total variation in es and suggests that other factors may also contribute to the variation in es but which were unaccounted for in the present study the highly significant influence of θg ep and time after wetting on es in the present study appears to be the converse of the discrete two stage evaporation model as proposed by philip 1957 the mutual dependence of es on θg ep and time after wetting suggests that radiant energy and soil water content are both important contributors to es and that their influences are not mutually exclusive this is the first known quantitative evidence demonstrating the collective influence of θg and evaporative demand on es other authors too have provided evidence in support of this theorem for example johns 1982 jalota and prihar 1986 1991 prihar et al 1996 and balwinder singh et al 2014 all provided evidence suggesting that stage 2 evaporation is not solely dependent on the hydraulic properties of the soil but is also influenced by atmospheric evaporative demand the relationship here eq 4 provides unequivocal evidence in support of these findings wythers et al 1999 also reported the mutual dependence of es on the energy balance and gravimetric moisture content they reported that daily es was high during the early stage and decreased to zero with time johns 1982 also reported that es declined with time as moisture content in the surface soil layer 0 0 01 m decreased below a threshold value work by others e g balwinder singh et al 2014 suggests that es is more likely to be a single stage process which features a reciprocal relationship between energy input and soil water content affecting daily es and the development of an algorithm to reflect this relationship in contrast to the philip 1957 two stage model is justified while eq 4 provided evidence showing the undeniable relationship between θg ep and time after wetting on es 22 of variance remained unexplained we suggest that part of this unexplained variance could be the contribution from surface crop residue management mulch while 3 t ha 1 of mulch as used in the present study did not provide 100 ground cover an analysis of the effect of mulched versus non mulched treatments within each drying cycle indicated that mulch significantly reduced total es by about 5 mm 25 of total es without mulch in cycles 1 ep 2 3 mm and 3 ep 6 14 mm but that there was no reduction in cycle 2 ep 1 2 mm data not presented the duration of the effect of mulch in suppressing es was greatest at ep 2 3 mm and least at ep 6 14 mm similarly ai darby et al 1989 found that chopped wheat straw applied at 3 t ha 1 suppressed es for a longer period of time at lower levels of evaporative demand in their growth chamber study 3 t ha 1 chopped wheat straw 2 5 cm lengths provided 100 ground cover but this was not the case in our study with rice straw chopped into 5 cm lengths heavier surface applications of wheat straw 4 6 or 10 t ha 1 while also providing 100 ground cover provided substantially suppression of es over the entire study period ai darby et al 1989 similarly balwinder singh et al 2011a showed significant suppression of es in wheat crops by the surface application of 8 9 t ha 1 rice straw compared to plots where no residues were applied the lack of a significant effect of mulch in the multilinear regression eq 4 was probably due to the dominating effects of ep and θg on es and the low rate of mulch experience gained in the present study shows that the use of θg ep and time after rainfall or irrigation is a convenient way to estimate es when empirical measurements are unavailable and has advantages over modelling as most models have high data requirements e g daily weather soil hydraulic parameters crop phenology yield yield attributes and irrigation data to calculate es for any day of interest balwinder singh et al 2011b li et al 2014 however the universality of the present approach particularly in relation to soil and crop type would benefit from further research conducted at a range of sites over a number of seasons 4 2 estimation of whole of season es total measured es for wheat 168 mm was similar to the findings of balwinder singh et al 2011a 135 161 mm in the same environment with a similar variety and crop management the present study shows a less than ideal agreement between apsim simulated and observed cumulative es for wheat with apsim predicting lower cumulative es fig 5a this was partly associated with higher gap filled values during and after 41 mm rainfall 75 76 das and all irrigations at 102 121 and 137 das except for the first irrigation at 25 das during a total of 22 gap filled days 22 of the es measurement period following these four wetting events the difference between observed es accounted for 32 mm or 51 of the total divergence there are several reason why this may have occurred the discrepancy could be accounted for by apsim simulating es beneath a crop canopy while eq 4 and ep on days of inundation do not consider the effect of a crop canopy and therefore may tend to overestimate es increasingly as the canopy develops another possible contribution to lower simulated es using apsim could be the stage 2 wind down in the model along with error associated with electing the change between stage 1 and 2 evaporation the philip s 1957 approach to model stage 2 evaporation uses a reciprocal square root function whereas substantial evidence now exists which indicates that evaporation after rainfall or irrigation declines according to a reciprocal exponential function jalota and prihar 1991 yunusa et al 1994 prihar et al 1996 balwinder singh et al 2014 similarly johns 1982 showed the appropriateness of the exponential relationship to explain the decline in stage 2 evaporation with time however balwinder singh et al 2014 also found that apsim tends to underestimate stage 2 es after irrigation during the latter part of the wheat season but showed good agreement after the an early irrigation at crown root initiation they found stage 2 es to be better described by an exponential function than the philip 1957 square root of time function total measured es for rice in the present study is the first attempt to undertake a rigorous determination of es in a dsr crop under field conditions globally total measured es for rice 455 mm in the present study exceeded that of rice grown over a similar duration grown under sprinkler irrigation during the dry season in philippines 216 mm using the eddy covariance technique alberto et al 2014 however the growing conditions of the two crops were quite different with higher solar radiation by 3 mj m 2d 1 and mean air temperature by 3 0 c in the present study es increased with even a slight increase 0 32 mj m 2d 1 in average daily solar radiation alberto et al 2014 and increasing evaporative demand cui et al 2005 evaporative demand ep at the present study started off very high 6 12 mm d 1 at a time when there was no or very little crop canopy and decreased to 1 4 5 6 mm d 1 once the rainy season commenced about 30 das in contrast in the dry season in the philippines evaporative demand started at about 4 mm d 1 and gradually increased to a maximum of 6 7 mm d 1 cumulative es for first 28 days in the present study was 195 mm compared to 79 mm observed by alberto et al 2014 in the philippines there was good agreement between apsim simulated and measured cumulative total es for dsr for the first 40 das after which measured es was higher than values simulated by apsim however most of the divergence between measured and simulated es took place between about 60 and 100 das due to misalignment between empirical and simulated es and the use of ep values further the discrepancy between simulated and measured data was progressive and indicated that the square root function used in apsim could also be contributing to the discrepancy the difference between measured and simulated cumulative es was higher in rice 127 mm than wheat 64 mm this might be due to more irrigations and rainy days in rice than wheat crop fig 1a b which resulted in more gap filling days in rice in the present study inundation prevented the direct measurement of es using mini lysimeters on those actual days and for the following 3 4 days on a sandy loam soil while balwinder singh et al 2011a reported a 7 day gap before lysimeter measurements could resume on a clay loam soil in a wheat crop in the present study the use of ep on days of inundation probably resulted in the overestimation of es more so as the crop canopy developed this probably resulted in greater overestimation of es in rice than wheat due to the much higher number of wetting events in rice fig 1 5 conclusions soil evaporation from wheat has previously been reported but this study represents the first known determination of es from dry seeded rice globally this study suggests that both θg and ep influence es collectively and are not separate influences as suggested by the two stage model of philip 1957 the multiple regression relationship between es and θg ep and time suggests that these can be used collectively as a tool to calculate es after irrigation or rainfall when empirical measurements are unavailable this can act as a gap filling technique during periods of rain or irrigation and enable the complete collection of es data to allow cumulative evaporation to be obtained and which will provide a tool to enable users to split et into es and t however as this relationship is empirical it may not apply everywhere as soil texture structure and probably level of organic matter may influence the availability of water for evaporation hence there is need to study the relationship over a range of soil types of contrasting texture structure and organic matter to develop a universal equation that can be applied in the presence and absence of a crop canopy these findings conducted on a single soil type by considering θg ep and time enable determination of es for gap filling following rain or irrigation however

11068,soil evaporation es is quite challenging to measure directly and researchers most commonly resort to using mini lysimeter s to measure es from both bare soil and from soil beneath the crop canopy however this technique is unable to measure es during and shortly after periods of irrigation or rain and an approach to fill data gaps during these periods would be valuable one possible approach is the use of the relationship between es pan evaporation ep and gravimetric soil water content θg to this end a mini lysimeter field study was carried out during periods of low evaporative demand ep 3 mm and high evaporative demand ep 3 mm to determine the relationship between es ep and θg there was a highly significant multi linear relationship between es ep θg and time after wetting r2 0 78 p 0 001 direct measurement using mini lysimeters and gap filling using ep on days of irrigation or rainfall and the multi linear relationship for up to 6 d following wetting events showed that significant amounts of water were lost as es from both wheat 168 mm and dry seeded rice 455 mm crops this study suggested that both θg and evaporative demand influence es collectively and are not separate influences as has been implied by ritchie s two stage evaporation model ritchie 1972 the high significance and high r2 of the relationship between es θg ep and time suggests that θg can be used to calculate es after irrigation or rainfall when empirical measurements of es are unavailable further the strong significance of regression between θg and ep suggests that water content and energy potential are important components of es during both stage 1 and stage 2 evaporation keywords zero till wheat dry seeded rice model simulation apsim 1 introduction understanding how water partitions through the life of a crop is fundamental to the identification and design of interventions aimed at improving crop water productivity precipitation and irrigation water move from the soil to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration et comprising evaporation of water from the soil surface es transpiration t and evaporation from the surface of green plant tissue typically leaves as a result of surface wetting interception i jalota and arora 2002 eberbach and pala 2005 in most cases t and es are the major contributors to et except in areas subject to frequent small rain events where interception becomes more prominent eberbach and pala 2005 knowledge of et is useful in evaluating the probable soil water status of field crops and in aiding irrigation scheduling of crops several methods to determine et of field crops exist et is most commonly estimated using a water balance approach where et is assumed to be the product of the change in soil water content over the soil root depth taking into account rainfall and predicted drainage while knowledge of et is useful to improve the efficiency by which crops use water knowledge of es and t are valuable es and t are not fixed quotients of et but vary as the crop develops early in the life of a crop es predominates but as the crop canopy develops t becomes increasingly important simpson et al 1992 eberbach and pala 2005 balwinder singh et al 2011a alberto et al 2014 both es and t are difficult to estimate and methods to quantify t directly are complex and error associated with scaling from point to field estimates is fraught with issues as a consequence t is usually estimated by subtracting es from et as measured over a predetermined time interval cooper et al 1983 balwinder singh et al 2011a evaporation from the soil surface of non flooded crops and from the surface of ponded water in rice fields is a major source of water loss over the period of the crop es accounts for 30 40 of et in transplanted and direct seeded rice uchijima 1961 bouman et al 2005 alberto et al 2011 hossen et al 2012 and 26 30 of et in irrigated wheat zhang et al 1998 balwinder singh et al 2011a es is difficult to measure directly and while several approaches have been developed e g al khafaf et al 1978 sakuratani 1987 ham et al 1990 researchers most commonly use mini lysimeters to determine es from both bare soil and from beneath the crop canopy e g walker 1983 allen 1990 batchelor 1992 yunusa et al 1993 eberbach and pala 2005 balwinder singh et al 2011a the use of mini lysimetry to determine es has been comprehensively reviewed e g boast and robertson 1982 and despite being time consuming and labour intensive mini lysimeters are acknowledged as a reliable method to determine es empirically and precisely but this technique is unable to determine es during or shortly after rain or irrigation thompson et al 1997 eberbach and pala 2005 flumignan et al 2011 the importance of the correct measurement of es cannot be underestimated as any mistake in measuring es particularly where interventions to manipulate crop water use efficiency are being investigated can compound the error in estimating t allen 1990 emphasized the importance of es during rainy days and reported that 24 rainy days constituted 40 of total es during the 100 days of es measurement in a fertilised barley crop several approaches have been attempted to estimate es during and shortly after rain or irrigation balwinder singh et al 2011a estimated es during periods of inundation using pan evaporation ep and for the period immediately after inundation ceased they used the ratio es ep from the next empirical measurement event in combination with ep for the missing period to predict es for that period eberbach and pala 2005 showed a significant relationship between soil water content θv and es ep over several rainless periods and used this relationship to estimate es using θv and ep on rainy days as ep and soil water content are comparatively easy to measure the use of these two indices to reliably estimate es warrants further investigation numerical modelling has also been used to estimate es and several approaches have been developed which require minimal data input ritchie 1972 cooper et al 1983 boesten and stroosnijder 1986 ritchie s 1972 2 stage model is an adaptation of the approach proposed by philip 1957 and ascribes evaporation from soil as occurring in two stages stage 1 depends on the drying potential of the air evaporative demand while stage 2 depends mainly on soil hydraulic properties lemon 1956 philip 1957 ritchie 1972 idso et al 1974 this approach is probably the most widely consulted conceptual model used at present to simulate es and is used in sophisticated crop growth models such as dssat and apsim ines et al 2001 jones et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 but several studies indicate that the process driving es may not fit into two discrete stages balwinder singh et al 2014 showed that ritchie s 1972 model did not adequately match empirically determined stage 2 es under the canopy of a wheat crop and that stage 2 es was strongly influenced by evaporative demand determined as ep as well as soil hydraulic properties this implies that the use of simulation models based on ritchie s function to predict es after wetting events may be less than ideal thus the search for alternative approaches to determine es should continue in order to fill data gaps during periods when direct measurement is prevented by rainfall or irrigation with these points in mind a study was initiated to develop a data gap filling procedure similar to the method suggested by eberbach and pala 2005 and to apply this procedure to datasets obtained from a rice wheat cropping system experiment conducted in punjab state india the specific aims of the work presented here were to 1 determine the relationship between es ep and gravimetric soil water content θg after soil wetting and 2 examine the use of the relationship between es ep and θg in estimating es after wetting events and seasonal cumulative es in wheat and dry seeded rice crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 site the study was conducted on a sandy loam soil representative of the major soils used for the irrigated wheat rice cropping systems of the state of punjab in north west india the climate is semi arid tropical with average annual rainfall of 734 mm 80 of which falls during the rainy season late june to september rice is grown from june to october and wheat from november to april 2 2 experiments two experiments were conducted at the one site 1 a large plot rice wheat cropping system experiment was conducted over 2 5 years and 2 a mini lysimeter experiment was conducted in buffer areas of the large plot experiment over a period of 6 months during the latter stages of the large plot experiment 2 2 1 large plot experiment a rice wheat cropping system experiment was conducted during 2011 14 commencing with wheat sown in november 2011 and concluding with wheat sown in november 2014 this was a 3 factor experiment with two tillage treatments for both wheat and rice conventional dry tillage ct zero tillage zt and two rice residue management treatments removed m retained on the soil surface as a mulch in wheat table 1 the main plots were combinations of wheat tillage x mulch treatments with rice tillage treatments in sub plots 9 3 m x 6 5 m in a split plot design with three replicates all rice crops were dry seeded and both the wheat and rice crops were drill sown with a row spacing of 20 cm the wheat was irrigated when soil matric potential at 32 5 cm declined below 35 kpa and the rice was irrigated when soil matric potential at 17 5 cm fell below 15 kpa full crop management and experimental details are provided in naveen gupta et al 2016 together with results of the effects of the treatments on crop performance details pertinent to the determination of es from the 2011 non mulched zt wheat treatment and the subsequent zt rice treatment cropping system 6 in table 1 are presented here es was determined in mini lysimeters which were placed in silos installed between the plant rows within all plots of the wheat and rice crops in the ztw ztdsr system the methods of construction of the mini lysimeters and silos and the determination of es are provided in section 2 3 below however mini lysimeters were unable to be used on days of rain or irrigation nor for the first few days thereafter resulting in data gaps 2 2 2 mini lysimeter experiment the purpose of the mini lysimeter experiment was to determine the relationship between es ep and gravimetric soil water content θg after soil wetting and to use this relationship to calculate es on days when es could not be determined using mini lysimeters this was a 2 factor experiment with two tillage treatments ct zt and two mulch treatments m m with three replicates the mini lysimeter experiment was conducted in non cropped buffer areas of the large plot experiment after harvest of the fourth crop rice the mini lysimeter experiment was repeated over three drying cycles during periods of low ep 3 mm and high ep 3 mm evaporative demand between november 2013 and june 2014 multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the combined influence of mulch treatment m m tillage treatment ct zt gravimetric soil moisture θg at the start of the day 9 a m daily ep and time days after irrigation on es the analysis was performed using genstat 18th edition vsni 2 3 the determination of es using mini lysimeters 2 3 1 construction and collection of mini lysimeters the mini lysimeters comprised intact soil cores encased in pvc cylinders each mini lysimeter casing was 0 20 m long with 0 10 m outer diameter and 2 5 mm wall thickness pvc was chosen to minimise heat conduction from the atmosphere to the soil within the core and because the material is light cheap and easy to handle for the determination of es in the zt wheat and rice crops of the large plot experiment soil cores were collected from between the crop rows in the buffer areas adjacent to the treatment plots taking care not to damage the crop the buffer areas had been cropped treated and managed in the same way as the adjacent plots throughout the duration of the experiment for the mini lysimeter experiment cores were collected from the buffer areas of the double conventional till and double zero till treatments with and without mulch systems 1 3 6 and 8 in table 1 24 h after irrigation collection of the soil cores involved the insertion of the pvc cylinders 0 2 m into the soil which were then carefully removed to minimise disturbance to the plots any soil protruding from the bottoms of the cylinders was trimmed the outsides of the cylinders were cleaned and dried and a clean pvc cap was fitted to the bottom of each cylinder the soil filled cylinders mini lysimeters were then weighed and installed in silos in the cropped plots large plot experiment or non cropped buffer area mini lysimeter experiment 2 3 2 construction of silos to house the mini lysimeters each silo was prepared by excavating a cylindrical hole in the soil using an auger and inserting a pvc cylinder 0 125 m diameter 0 20 m long which acted as a sleeve to house the mini lysimeters each sleeve had a perforated cap on the base to allow drainage in case of rain or irrigation in the large plot experiment one silo was installed in each plot of the selected treatments between the plant rows following the approach of balwinder singh et al 2011a in the mini lysimeter experiment twelve silos to house mini lysimeters were installed in one buffer area this buffer area was not cropped and the silos were arranged in 2 rows of 6 with spacing of 0 20 m between the rows and between the silos within the rows after placement of the mini lysimeters in the silos chopped 5 cm length rice straw mulch was applied in the zt m and ct m mini lysimeters at a rate equivalent to 3 t ha 1 while the soil surface of the zt m and ct m mini lysimeters remained bare 2 3 3 measurement of es using mini lysimeters to measure es each mini lysimeter was removed from its silo every morning at around 9 a m weighed and immediately returned to the silo weighing was done using a digital field balance with an accuracy of 0 001 g giving the capacity to resolve evaporation from each mini lysimeter to 0 0001 mm the mini lysimeters were replaced with fresh mini lysimeters every 5 d consistent with the approach of eberbach and pala 2005 and as soon as possible following irrigation or rainfall in the large plot experiment mini lysimeters were installed 3 d after sowing das of the wheat and 36 das of the rice and measurements were continued throughout each season until harvest in the mini lysimeter experiment the measurements were conducted for 15 d meaning that there were three changes of mini lysimeters after completion of the first 15 d cycle avg daily ep 2 2 mm on 27th november 2013 the buffer areas were irrigated on 30th december 2013 and a second 15 d cycle was implemented from 31st december 2013 to 15th january 2014 avg daily ep 1 2 mm on 21st may 2014 the buffer areas were again irrigated prior to the conduct of a third cycle starting on 22nd may 2014 during a period of high evaporative demand avg daily ep 9 3 mm there was no rainfall during the first two drying cycles and 10 mm in one event on the fourth day of the third cycle table 2 2 4 measurement of rainfall and ep rainfall was measured at 9 a m daily using a manual rain gauge installed at the experimental site daily class a pan evaporation ep was measured at 9 a m each day using a class a pan located at the punjab agricultural university weather station approximately 2 km from the experimental site 2 5 gap filling es after wetting events in wheat and rice crops in the large plot experiment gap filling was required on days of rainfall or irrigation and for a few days after these wetting events until fresh mini lysimeters could be installed without damaging the plots on days of irrigation or rain 10 mm and of inundation on subsequent days as a result of these events es was assumed to be equal to ep in both the wheat and rice crops consistent with the approach of balwinder singh et al 2011a but for the few days after inundation ceased and before mini lysimeter data became available again es was derived from ep θg and time after wetting using the multiple regression equation developed in the mini lysimeter experiment sections 2 2 2 3 1 2 5 1 determination of θg in the larger experiment daily values of soil water tension and the relationship between soil tension and θg were used to estimate θg as direct determination of θg was not possible shortly after irrigation or heavy rainfall the relationship was developed using soil tension and gravimetric soil water content measured during the 2011 12 wheat crop of the larger experiment soil tension and gravimetric soil water content were determined in each plot of each treatment i e ct m ct m zt m and zt m soil tension was measured daily using tube tensiometers with the centre of the ceramic cups at 10 and 20 cm the tensiometers were installed in tight fitting holes in each plot of selected treatments as described in naveen gupta et al 2016 gravimetric soil water content was determined on soil samples collected from the 0 15 cm depth using a soil auger diameter 5 cm samples were collected twice weekly and shortly before irrigation the soil was mixed well and a weighed subsample was dried for 48 h at 105 c and then reweighed to determine θg regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between θg and soil water tension mean of values at 10 cm and 20 cm the regressions were conducted for m and m separately as it was considered that mulch would likely affect the distribution of soil moisture throughout the profile as well as the total amount the relationships were best described using a power function and variation in θg accounted for 65 77 of the variation in soil water tension eqs 1 2 t test were performed to compare the measured and predicted values of θg for non mulched and mulched soil using eqs 1 and 2 the t tests indicated that predicted θg was not significantly different from the measured values a comparison of eqs 1 and 2 using the tukey kramer method howell 2013 showed that the relationships were significantly different p 0 001 therefore separate regressions were used for mulched and non mulched soil as follows 1 non mulched soilθg 19 889 swt 0 172 n 92 r2 0 65 2 mulched soilθg 19 607 swt 0 174 n 115 r2 0 77 where swt is the mean of soil water tension determined at 10 and 20 cm eq 1 was used to estimate θg 0 20 cm after irrigation or rain when mini lysimeter data were not available in the 2011 12 zt m wheat crop and in the subsequent 2012 zt rice crop from 36 das to harvest 2 5 2 determination of es from rice during the first 36 days after sowing neither mini lysimeters nor the regression equation could be used for estimation of es during the first 36 das of the 2012 zt rice crop as soil tension measurements and the installation of mini lysimeters did not commence until 36 das due to frequent wetting from rain and irrigation after sowing however daily soil volumetric water content 0 7 5 cm and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat were available therefore during the period 1 36 das es was determined using the following procedures during periods of inundation between sowing and 36 das es was assumed to be equal to ep on days when the site was not inundated es was assumed to be equal to the decrease in volumetric water content in the 0 7 5 cm layer experienced over that particular day taking into account any drainage that was estimated to have occurred on that day volumetric soil water content was determined daily using a hand held time domain reflectometer field scout tdr 300 soil moisture meter with 7 5 cm long probes once ponding had ceased the tdr was calibrated by taking measurements in water and in air product manual spectrum technologies inc volumetric water content was converted to soil water content in millimetres by multiplying by the probe length 7 5 cm and dividing by 10 drainage on the day after inundation was determined from the product of the soil matric potential smp gradient and saturated hydraulic conductivity using darcy s law eq 3 the smp gradient was estimated from measurements of soil water tension at 10 and 15 cm made on the first day after each irrigation of the 2011 12 wheat between 41 and 76 das naveen gupta et al 2016 3 d r a i n a g e c m h 1 ψ 10 ψ 15 d i s t a n c e b e t w e e n t e n s i o m e t e r t i p s c m k s a t where ψ 10 and ψ 15 are the soil matric potential cm at soil depths of 10 and 15 cm respectively the ksat 10 cm h 1 was determined in situ at 10 cm depth using a guelph permeameter 0 kpa soil matric suction in this free draining soil it was assumed that all drainage from the top 7 5 cm occurred within one day after inundation 2 6 whole season es in wheat and rice from combining mini lysimeter and gap filled data the mini lysimeter and gap filled data were combined to produce whole of season es data sets for the zt m wheat crop in 2011 12 and the subsequent zt rice crop in 2012 to test the validity of the gap filled data 2 7 simulation of es in rice and wheat using apsim wheat and rice daily gap filled values of es derived using the regression of es on ep θg and time eq 4 section 3 1 were compared with apsim simulated values cumulative simulated es for the same wheat and rice crops from sowing to maturity was also compared with the empirically derived cumulative es the apsim cropping system simulation model and the wheat and rice modules used in the model are described in asseng et al 1998 2002 wang et al 2003 and bouman and van laar 2006 apsim was parameterized and validated for rice and wheat grown on a sandy loam soil at the same location using the same varieties as the present study by balwinder singh et al 2015a b their validated model was used in the present study to simulate es for the 2011 12 zt m wheat and 2012 zt rice crops 3 results 3 1 the multilinear relationship between es and ep θg tillage mulch and time the multilinear regression showed that neither tillage nor mulch had a significant influence on es while the effects of θg ep and time t after wetting were highly significant table 3 the multiple regression model was therefore rerun by excluding the non significant parameters viz tillage and mulch this also showed es to be highly dependent on soil moisture content θg ep and time p 0 001 and together these three factors accounted for 78 of the variation in es 4 es 0 7446 14 07 θg 0 2788 ep 0 0958 t n 136 r2 0 78 where t is the number days after the wetting event in this study θg varied from 0 1 to 0 2 g water per 100 g soil ep varied from 0 2 to 10 mm and time varied from 1 to 15 days thus variation in θg ep and t would vary es by maxima of 1 4 2 7 and 1 3 mm respectively indicating that variation in ep has about twice the effect of variation in θg and t on es 3 2 estimation of es over the wheat and rice cropping seasons the non mulched zt wheat crop in 2011 12 and the subsequent 2012 zt rice crop received 4 and 18 irrigations respectively and experienced 9 and 24 rainy days fig 1 determination of es using mini lysimeters was therefore not possible on those days and for the following 3 4 days the plots of daily es for the whole season combining the mini lysimeter data and gap filled data derived using ep on days of inundation and eq 4 suggest that the derived data provide a good fit with the trends in measured es for both the wheat fig 2 and rice crops fig 3 using the mini lysimeter and gap filled data cumulative es during the wheat season was 168 mm with 69 115 mm of the daily es obtained from direct measurement using the mini lysimeters the gap filled data derived from eq 4 accounted for 19 of total es equivalent to 31 mm of cumulative es while 22 mm 13 was from using ep on days when the site was inundated similarly cumulative es during the rice season was calculated to be 455 mm this included 228 mm 50 of the total from sowing to 36 das as calculated using the tdr and drainage data 112 mm and using ep on days when the site was inundated 116 mm from 37 das until harvest es of 58 mm 13 of the total seasonal es was measured directly using mini lysimeters 88 mm 19 was gap filled data derived from eq 4 and 81 mm 18 was gap filled using ep on days when the plots were inundated 3 3 comparison of es derived from the regression and apsim simulated es agreement between values of daily gap filled es derived using eq 4 and simulated values using apsim was poor in both wheat fig 4 a and rice fig 4b paired t test analyses indicated that there were significant differences p 0 05 between es determined using the two methods for both crops values of es derived using eq 4 were on average 1 4 mm lower than the simulated values for each crop during the days of gap filling using the regression ep ranged from 1 to 5 mm in the wheat and from 0 5 to 8 mm in the rice 3 4 comparison of measured and gap filled cumulative es and simulated cumulative es there was poor agreement between cumulative es determined using mini lyismeter and gap filled data and simulated apsim cumulative es during the wheat crop with the values diverging as the season progressed fig 5 a the divergence was due to higher values from both the mini lysimeters and gap filling using eq 4 or ep on days of inundation than the simulated values the mini lysimeter and gap fill regression data accounted for 29 and 22 mm of the total divergence respectively while the higher values of ep accounted for 13 mm of the divergence paired t test analyses indicated that there were significant differences p 0 05 between es measured using mini lysimeter and simulated es as well as between es estimated using eq 4 or ep on days of inundation and simulated es the net result was that cumulative es calculated from empirical and gap filled data exceeded es by 64 mm or 61 compared to simulated es the agreement between simulated and observed mini lysimeter and gap filled cumulative es in rice was very good during the first 42 das after which the values steadily diverged with observed es higher than simulated es fig 5b during the first 36 das when es was estimated from tdr and soil matric potential data and from ep on days of inundation observed cumulative es was 228 mm compared to the simulated value of 229 mm from 37 das to harvest observed cumulative es was 228 mm compared with simulated es of 98 mm a difference of 130 mm paired t test analyses indicated that there were significant differences p 0 05 between observed es mini lysimeter or estimated using eq 4 or ep on days of inundation and simulated es the higher cumulative es was mainly due to higher es estimated from the regression by 50 mm and using ep on days of inundation by 59 mm the contribution to the divergence from higher es observed using the mini lyismeters was much lower at 20 mm noting that mini lysimeters could only be used occasionally throughout most of the season and at the end of the season when es was low 4 discussion 4 1 the relationship between es ep and θg given the highly significant multi linear relationship between es and θg ep and time eq 4 provided a useful tool to estimate es during periods after soil wetting when mini lysimeters data were not available the relationship accounted for 78 of the total variation in es and suggests that other factors may also contribute to the variation in es but which were unaccounted for in the present study the highly significant influence of θg ep and time after wetting on es in the present study appears to be the converse of the discrete two stage evaporation model as proposed by philip 1957 the mutual dependence of es on θg ep and time after wetting suggests that radiant energy and soil water content are both important contributors to es and that their influences are not mutually exclusive this is the first known quantitative evidence demonstrating the collective influence of θg and evaporative demand on es other authors too have provided evidence in support of this theorem for example johns 1982 jalota and prihar 1986 1991 prihar et al 1996 and balwinder singh et al 2014 all provided evidence suggesting that stage 2 evaporation is not solely dependent on the hydraulic properties of the soil but is also influenced by atmospheric evaporative demand the relationship here eq 4 provides unequivocal evidence in support of these findings wythers et al 1999 also reported the mutual dependence of es on the energy balance and gravimetric moisture content they reported that daily es was high during the early stage and decreased to zero with time johns 1982 also reported that es declined with time as moisture content in the surface soil layer 0 0 01 m decreased below a threshold value work by others e g balwinder singh et al 2014 suggests that es is more likely to be a single stage process which features a reciprocal relationship between energy input and soil water content affecting daily es and the development of an algorithm to reflect this relationship in contrast to the philip 1957 two stage model is justified while eq 4 provided evidence showing the undeniable relationship between θg ep and time after wetting on es 22 of variance remained unexplained we suggest that part of this unexplained variance could be the contribution from surface crop residue management mulch while 3 t ha 1 of mulch as used in the present study did not provide 100 ground cover an analysis of the effect of mulched versus non mulched treatments within each drying cycle indicated that mulch significantly reduced total es by about 5 mm 25 of total es without mulch in cycles 1 ep 2 3 mm and 3 ep 6 14 mm but that there was no reduction in cycle 2 ep 1 2 mm data not presented the duration of the effect of mulch in suppressing es was greatest at ep 2 3 mm and least at ep 6 14 mm similarly ai darby et al 1989 found that chopped wheat straw applied at 3 t ha 1 suppressed es for a longer period of time at lower levels of evaporative demand in their growth chamber study 3 t ha 1 chopped wheat straw 2 5 cm lengths provided 100 ground cover but this was not the case in our study with rice straw chopped into 5 cm lengths heavier surface applications of wheat straw 4 6 or 10 t ha 1 while also providing 100 ground cover provided substantially suppression of es over the entire study period ai darby et al 1989 similarly balwinder singh et al 2011a showed significant suppression of es in wheat crops by the surface application of 8 9 t ha 1 rice straw compared to plots where no residues were applied the lack of a significant effect of mulch in the multilinear regression eq 4 was probably due to the dominating effects of ep and θg on es and the low rate of mulch experience gained in the present study shows that the use of θg ep and time after rainfall or irrigation is a convenient way to estimate es when empirical measurements are unavailable and has advantages over modelling as most models have high data requirements e g daily weather soil hydraulic parameters crop phenology yield yield attributes and irrigation data to calculate es for any day of interest balwinder singh et al 2011b li et al 2014 however the universality of the present approach particularly in relation to soil and crop type would benefit from further research conducted at a range of sites over a number of seasons 4 2 estimation of whole of season es total measured es for wheat 168 mm was similar to the findings of balwinder singh et al 2011a 135 161 mm in the same environment with a similar variety and crop management the present study shows a less than ideal agreement between apsim simulated and observed cumulative es for wheat with apsim predicting lower cumulative es fig 5a this was partly associated with higher gap filled values during and after 41 mm rainfall 75 76 das and all irrigations at 102 121 and 137 das except for the first irrigation at 25 das during a total of 22 gap filled days 22 of the es measurement period following these four wetting events the difference between observed es accounted for 32 mm or 51 of the total divergence there are several reason why this may have occurred the discrepancy could be accounted for by apsim simulating es beneath a crop canopy while eq 4 and ep on days of inundation do not consider the effect of a crop canopy and therefore may tend to overestimate es increasingly as the canopy develops another possible contribution to lower simulated es using apsim could be the stage 2 wind down in the model along with error associated with electing the change between stage 1 and 2 evaporation the philip s 1957 approach to model stage 2 evaporation uses a reciprocal square root function whereas substantial evidence now exists which indicates that evaporation after rainfall or irrigation declines according to a reciprocal exponential function jalota and prihar 1991 yunusa et al 1994 prihar et al 1996 balwinder singh et al 2014 similarly johns 1982 showed the appropriateness of the exponential relationship to explain the decline in stage 2 evaporation with time however balwinder singh et al 2014 also found that apsim tends to underestimate stage 2 es after irrigation during the latter part of the wheat season but showed good agreement after the an early irrigation at crown root initiation they found stage 2 es to be better described by an exponential function than the philip 1957 square root of time function total measured es for rice in the present study is the first attempt to undertake a rigorous determination of es in a dsr crop under field conditions globally total measured es for rice 455 mm in the present study exceeded that of rice grown over a similar duration grown under sprinkler irrigation during the dry season in philippines 216 mm using the eddy covariance technique alberto et al 2014 however the growing conditions of the two crops were quite different with higher solar radiation by 3 mj m 2d 1 and mean air temperature by 3 0 c in the present study es increased with even a slight increase 0 32 mj m 2d 1 in average daily solar radiation alberto et al 2014 and increasing evaporative demand cui et al 2005 evaporative demand ep at the present study started off very high 6 12 mm d 1 at a time when there was no or very little crop canopy and decreased to 1 4 5 6 mm d 1 once the rainy season commenced about 30 das in contrast in the dry season in the philippines evaporative demand started at about 4 mm d 1 and gradually increased to a maximum of 6 7 mm d 1 cumulative es for first 28 days in the present study was 195 mm compared to 79 mm observed by alberto et al 2014 in the philippines there was good agreement between apsim simulated and measured cumulative total es for dsr for the first 40 das after which measured es was higher than values simulated by apsim however most of the divergence between measured and simulated es took place between about 60 and 100 das due to misalignment between empirical and simulated es and the use of ep values further the discrepancy between simulated and measured data was progressive and indicated that the square root function used in apsim could also be contributing to the discrepancy the difference between measured and simulated cumulative es was higher in rice 127 mm than wheat 64 mm this might be due to more irrigations and rainy days in rice than wheat crop fig 1a b which resulted in more gap filling days in rice in the present study inundation prevented the direct measurement of es using mini lysimeters on those actual days and for the following 3 4 days on a sandy loam soil while balwinder singh et al 2011a reported a 7 day gap before lysimeter measurements could resume on a clay loam soil in a wheat crop in the present study the use of ep on days of inundation probably resulted in the overestimation of es more so as the crop canopy developed this probably resulted in greater overestimation of es in rice than wheat due to the much higher number of wetting events in rice fig 1 5 conclusions soil evaporation from wheat has previously been reported but this study represents the first known determination of es from dry seeded rice globally this study suggests that both θg and ep influence es collectively and are not separate influences as suggested by the two stage model of philip 1957 the multiple regression relationship between es and θg ep and time suggests that these can be used collectively as a tool to calculate es after irrigation or rainfall when empirical measurements are unavailable this can act as a gap filling technique during periods of rain or irrigation and enable the complete collection of es data to allow cumulative evaporation to be obtained and which will provide a tool to enable users to split et into es and t however as this relationship is empirical it may not apply everywhere as soil texture structure and probably level of organic matter may influence the availability of water for evaporation hence there is need to study the relationship over a range of soil types of contrasting texture structure and organic matter to develop a universal equation that can be applied in the presence and absence of a crop canopy these findings conducted on a single soil type by considering θg ep and time enable determination of es for gap filling following rain or irrigation however

11069,contour levee irrigation system is commonly used for rice cultivation in latin american and caribbean countries but its water dynamics in commercial farm field settings are yet to be fully determined this study aimed to investigate the water dynamics of the contour levee irrigation system by analyzing conventional irrigation practices and by quantifying water balance and additionally to examine potential toposequential effects field experiments with different irrigation intervals were conducted on three commercial farms in ibagué colombia for two seasons from 2017 to 2018 irrigation and runoff water flows were constantly measured during the crop cycle using parshall flumes with water level sensors percolation rate and field water table were measured using percolators and piezometers installed along the toposequence the results showed that conventional irrigation management was highly flexible depending on soil permeability rainfall and agronomic factors not particularly paying attention to ensure the flooded conditions during flowering period the water balance resulted in the irrigation accounting for 76 of the total water input whereas the runoff et and percolation accounted for 40 21 and 31 on overall average with considerable variation among the three farms percolation rates and duration with standing water did not show a clear and consistent tendency among the toposequential positions but the percolation rate was significantly different among the farms corresponding to soil permeability consequently clear toposequential effects on the water dynamics or on grain yield were not observed at the study site to our knowledge this study is the first to elucidate detailed water dynamics of contour levee irrigation system in farm fields including toposequential difference keywords colombia rice contour levee irrigation system water balance toposequential effects 1 introduction rice is one of the most important food crop providing 19 of the global human per capita energy but there are concerns regarding the sustainability of its production because of the large water requirement of up to 2 3 times more than that required by other cereals mclean et al 2013 therefore various water saving rice cultivation systems such as saturated soil culture the soil is maintained at saturated water conditions and alternate drying and wetting awd the soil is allowed to dry out for a few days after disappearance of standing water before the next irrigation instead of continuously flooding have been developed and adopted by farmers tabbal et al 2002 among the rice producing countries those in the latin american and caribbean lac region have relatively recently started rice cultivation nevertheless their production has been increasing remarkably from 7 986 000 mg in 1961 to 28 092 000 mg in 2009 zorrilla et al 2012 and is expected to rise with an annual yield increase of around 2 by 2050 ray et al 2013 rice cultivation in the region has highly intensified irrigated cultivation system accounts for 59 of the total rice production and the larger 15 50 ha on average mechanized farms accounts for 94 mclean et al 2013 thus along with the expansion of rice production highly relying on irrigation further efficient use of irrigation water would be necessary for sustainable rice production in the lac region contour levee irrigation system is a common land management and irrigation practice for lowland rice cultivation in sloped fields for example in colombia the cultivation system accounts for 70 1 of the irrigated rice area according to national federation of rice producers fedearroz in spanish fedearroz 2017 rice farmers construct levees bunds along the contour lines to hold water within the plot pineda and montaña 2015 irrigation is started after sowing and is intermittently applied from an inlet at the highest side of the plot and the water flows down and drains out through an outlet at the lowest side as runoff fig 1 similar practices of the contour levee irrigation system are adopted in other major irrigated rice producing areas in the lac region such as those in argentina marano and filippi 2015 brazil takamiya and tsutsui 2000 and uruguay battallo et al 2013 although the construction of contour levees holds irrigation water within the plot to a certain extent the runoff through the outlet due to the slope of the field might generally cause significant water loss from the plot leading to high irrigation water requirement the contour levee irrigation system is also practiced in arkansas and mississippi in the us and the irrigation water input was reported to range widely from 406 to 1430 mm henry et al 2016 in uruguay 1250 mm is considered to be the standard volume allotted for irrigation in the rice sector but the actual average irrigation water amount applied at the farm scale is uncertain pittelkow et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge no studies have examined the detailed water balance and dynamics of the contour levee irrigation system on farm fields since observations in experimental fields do not encompass farmers economic behavior and agricultural practices can differ from those in commercial farms takahashi et al 2018 agricultural strategies must be evaluated at the scale reflecting the commercial producers decision makings mcgonigle et al 2014 therefore it is essential to reveal the water dynamics of the contour levee irrigation system in farm fields to elucidate efficient irrigation strategies applicable to actual farms apart from the topographical conditions and construction of contour levees the intermittent flush irrigation practice under the contour levee irrigation system is close to awd irrigation management chirinda et al 2017 awd was developed by the international rice research institution irri and has been used in irrigated lowlands mainly in asia as a water saving crop management strategy for lowland rice bouman and lampayan 2009 in many cases the irrigation water requirement of awd is lower than that of continuous flooding cf by approximately 30 bouman and tuong 2001 chapagain et al 2011 or even less than half of that of cf sudhir yadav et al 2011 a reduction in both irrigation time and percolation loss could contribute to lowering the irrigation requirement tan et al 2013 the grain yield with awd was similar to or slightly higher than that with cf belder et al 2004 belder et al 2005 cabangon et al 2004 although a relatively small yield reduction was also observed in other cases chapagain et al 2011 tabbal et al 2002 furthermore it was reported that in cf 45 of the water input was productively used by transpiration and 10 and 45 lost by evaporation and percolation respectively bouman et al 2007 however for awd under flat lowland conditions et percolation and runoff loss account for 40 60 30 50 and 0 15 of the total water input respectively cabangon et al 2004 lu et al 2016 sudhir yadav et al 2011 consequently water loss via percolation which is affected mainly by soil permeability and groundwater table is usually the focus in awd to adjust site specific irrigation management and avoid yield reduction by saving water since a high runoff amount is anticipated percolation might be less important with the contour levee irrigation system quantification of the water balance in the contour levee irrigation system has not been conducted yet and it would be important to identify the aspects of conventional irrigation practices that need to be improved to enhance water use efficiency in addition there are potential concerns that positions along a sloped field might be different in soil fertility and water availability and the variability of resources may lead to within field variations in plant growth this spatial heterogeneity along the slope is called toposequential effects and has been reported mainly for a series of flat paddy fields located along the slope in asia boling et al 2008 tsubo et al 2006 and in rice fields of inland valleys in africa touré et al 2009 the runoff transporting sediments over the toposequence often results in more fertile soil conditions in the lower than in the higher positions boling et al 2008 homma et al 2003 in addition the lower positions tend to store more water and thus have higher water availability than the higher positions do hseu and chen 1996 samson et al 2004 tsubo et al 2005 which was demonstrated as more days with standing water on the soil surface boling et al 2008 tsubo et al 2006 in the lower position of the slope tsubo et al 2005 2006 also reported that the higher percolation rates at higher positions were due to the lighter soil texture consequently variations in crop growth have been observed along the toposequence and lower positions tend to have higher yields boling et al 2008 samson et al 2004 tsubo et al 2006 the timing of the disappearance of standing water around flowering period was reported to considerably affect the rice productivity samson et al 2004 tsubo et al 2006 and therefore adjustment of crop management strategies according to the toposequential positions would be necessary which have not been conducted so far therefore in this study the water dynamics of the contour levee irrigation system were investigated by analyzing the characteristics of farmers irrigation practices and by quantifying the water balance in commercial farms with different soil properties and wide range of irrigation practices additionally the significance of the toposequential effects was examined by measuring percolation rates field water table and grain yield across the toposequence ibagué the capital of the department of tolima colombia was chosen as the target site because it is an intensive rice producing regions in colombia owing to its fertile alluvial soils where the contour levee irrigation system is commonly practiced fedearroz 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field experiments were conducted on three commercial farms farm a 4 22ʹn 75 09ʹw 940 m farm b 4 19ʹn 75 04ʹw 719 m and farm c 4 25ʹn 75 09ʹw 992 m in ibagué municipality of the department of tolima in colombia for two growing seasons from 2017 to 2018 2017a and 2017b rice fields in the region are generally sloped and that of the targeted farms was approximately 1 3 ibagué features a tropical rainforest climate under the köppen climate system leading to 1691 mm of annual rainfall with bimodal rainfall pattern as well as to 24 0 28 8 and 19 1 c of the daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures on 20 year average weather data was also collected over the period of the experiments by a weather station climate station vantage pro 2 davis instruments ca usa installed in each farm field shown in fig 2 the typical soil type of the farmlands in the region is oxisol or ultisol which is characterized by moderate levels of organic matter low levels of phosphorous nitrogen and ph and high natural fertility due to its alluvial fan sediments castro gonzález and lima 2016 intact soil samples were collected by creating a soil pit 1 1 1 m3 at the center of each farm and then using a soil core sampler 100 cm3 at the middle depth of the 0 15 15 30 30 45 45 60 60 85 and 85 110 cm soil layers with two replications in 2016 the soil samples were analyzed using constant head permeability test saturated hydraulic conductivity ks pressure chamber method volumetric water content at different water potential and walkley black method organic carbon content the inorganic nitrogen content was obtained as the sum of nh4 n and no3 n extracted using 2n kcl solution and nh4 n content was measured using indophenol blue method after reduction by cadmium coil using a technicon autoanalyzer ii seal analytical southampton uk the soil properties analyzed are summarized in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiments were conducted in a plot of each farm with irrigation treatments consisting of three different intervals between irrigations a vertical bund of approximately 30 cm height was constructed along the slope to separate the irrigation treatments in the experimental plots the total area of the experimental plot in each farm ranged approximately from 1 to 2 ha while the distance across the slope and degree of the slope were 373 m and 1 9 for farm a 205 m and 2 9 for farm b and 165 m and 3 0 for farm c respectively a popular rice variety in this region fedearroz60 was directly dry seeded into the soil at a 130 kg ha 1 sowing rate by using a non till drill seeder with a fertilizer applicator the seeding was performed at 19 cm between rows and 12 kg n ha 1 basal fertilizer application sowing dates and other phenological events are summarized in table 2 irrigation management in each farm was conducted based on three intervals in days between irrigations as the irrigation treatments 2 4 days a short 4 7 days b conventional and 6 10 days c long as shown in table 3 n fertilizer application followed the conventional practice of each farm consisting of 6 splits including basal application summarized in table 4 fertilizers for nutrient elements other than nitrogen were applied according to the conventional management practice of each farm 2 3 irrigation and runoff measurement the irrigation and runoff water flow at the outlet were also measured at the inlet and outlet of each irrigation management by using a hand made parshall flume and water level sensor etape liquid level sensor milone technologies nj usa for both 2017a and 2017b fig 3 the parshall flume is an open channel equipment in which water flows horizontally the water level sensor is a ruler shaped sensor with a resistive output that varies with the water level the water flow rate q in l s 1 can be determined by the water table in the parshall flume h in cm using eq 1 under the assumption of flat and horizontal water movement nevada state engineer s office 1986 the equation was determined based on a preliminary experiment on another farm near ibague data not shown the water table in the parshall flume was measured using a water level sensor attached to the side wall of the parshall flume with a 10 minute recording interval 1 q 0 2578 h2 0 0052 h the water table in the parshall flume was assumed to be the same during the 10 minute intervals and daily irrigation and runoff amounts were obtained by summing up values for the day the results were analyzed to calculate the seasonal amount of irrigation and runoff by summing up the values obtained over the growth season the number of irrigation events over the crop cycle was also counted based on the recording 2 4 field water table and percolation rate measurement the field water table depth cm in relation to the soil surface and the rate of percolation were measured in irrigation b in the three farms in 2017b at different positions along the toposequence upper middle and lower perforated pvc tubes to measure the field water table both above and below the soil surface piezometer and pvc tubes without perforation and with a lid to measure the percolation percolator were installed at a representative point halfway between the contour levees for each position all the pvc tubes had a diameter of 6 cm and the lengths were 40 80 cm for the piezometers and 50 cm for the percolators the water table inside the piezometers and percolators was measured using a water level sensor mentioned above with a 10 min recording interval the piezometer and the percolator at each location were installed close to each other within a 50 cm distance for the percolator water was refilled to the level of field water table occasionally when the field had standing water the installation method is shown in fig 4 and is similar to the setting of tsubo et al 2005 except for the sensors the daily percolation rate mm day 1 under saturated water conditions was then estimated from the recordings of the percolator as the daily difference in the water table within the percolator the difference was estimated only when the field water table shown in the piezometer was higher than 25 cm to confirm that the soil at a depth of 30 cm the depth at which percolators were installed is saturated then the average of the daily percolation rates was calculated as the percolation rate at each toposequential position to analyze the field water availability across the slope cumulative duration with standing water the field water table above the soil surface 0 cm was calculated by multiplying the number of observations by the interval of observation 10 min as the number of days for each piezometer in each farm 2 5 water balance analysis seasonal water balance was analyzed using irrigation runoff and rainfall data in 2017a and additionally using evapotranspiration and percolation data in 2017b the evapotranspiration was estimated as follows the reference evapotranspiration eto was first calculated using the makkink method makkink 1957 from the weather data at each farm daily crop evapotranspiration etc was then calculated by multiplying eto by the rice crop coefficients kc derived by allen et al 1998 initial growth 0 55 dae kc initial 1 05 mid season growth stage 55 95 dae kc mid 1 20 and late season growth stage 95 120 dae kc end 0 75 seasonal etc et was then calculated as the water balance component over the crop cycle the seasonal total percolation was calculated in two ways first it was estimated by subtracting the seasonal runoff and et from the total water input for each irrigation treatment percolation from the balance assuming changes in the water stored in the soil and net horizontal seepage flows are negligible second sum of the daily percolation rate measured using the percolator section 2 4 was calculated over the crop cycle and averaged across the toposequential positions as water balance component percolation observed for 2017b these two seasonal percolation estimates were compared to confirm whether the components were balanced 2 6 grain yield measurement gain yield was measured at harvest by threshing rice plants from an area of 2 2 m2 at four positions along the toposequence t1 t2 t3 and t4 positions t1 was the highest elevation and t4 the lowest for each irrigation treatment the grain samples were dried in a forced air circulation oven at 70 c for 72 h and the dry weight was measured grain yield was then calculated at 14 grain moisture content 2 7 statistical analysis to examine the significance of toposequential effects following statistical tests were conducted using r statistical software version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 with the significant level set at p 0 05 analysis of variance anova was conducted across the farms on the percolation rate and on the duration with standing water with factors of farm and toposequence for grain yield anova was performed in each farm and each season with a factor of toposequence subsequently fisher s least significant difference lsd test was conducted for the significant factors in those anova analyses using a package agricolae felipe de mendiburu 2017 3 results 3 1 characteristics of conventional irrigation managements the timing and amount of irrigation managements and changes of field water table depth throughout the growing season 2017b in irrigation treatment b conventional are shown in fig 5 the observed irrigation schedule coincided well with the timing when the field water table dropped below the soil surface in all the farms both the frequency and amount of water for each irrigation event were higher in farm b than in other two farms the irrigation schedules in farm a and farm c were relatively similar except for the intense irrigation immediately before 30 dae in farm c in terms of the irrigation schedule associated with phenological stages it was observed that the irrigation pattern did not change even in the flowering period the changes in the field water table revealed a faster drying rate for the soil and a larger fluctuation of the water table in farm b slower and smaller fluctuations in farm c and intermediate fluctuations in farm a the water table at middle position in farm a showed extremely dried conditions during the crop cycle because the small spot where the equipment was installed resulted in exceptionally dry prone conditions due to imperfect leveling based on our field observation the average irrigation amount mm and duration hours of each irrigation event and the number of irrigation events during the cropping season are summarized in table 5 since the irrigation treatment was based on the frequency the seasonal total irrigation amounts did not always follow the order of the irrigation treatments nevertheless the number of irrigation events and the cumulative duration of irrigation throughout the season indicated that the irrigation treatments were correctly implemented in most cases however the differences between b and c in farm b 2017a and between a and b in farm c 2017b were small and the orders were reversed the average irrigation amount of each event was slightly less and the duration of each irrigation was shorter in farm a than in the other two farms farm b had the highest number of irrigation events the longest duration of each irrigation at mostly 10 h and the largest irrigation amount for each event of the three farms resulting in a considerably higher total irrigation amount throughout the season which reached around 3000 mm in farm c the irrigation amount was obviously higher in 2017 a than it was in 2017b despite the similar seasonal rainfall probably because of the overestimation of the water depth inside the parshall flume caused by the sedimentation at the bottom in 2017a however the irrigation duration and number of events were similar between seasons in farm c 3 2 seasonal water balance the measured and estimated components of the water balance and their ratio over the total water input are summarized in table 6 the seasonal irrigation amount was considerably different among the farms ranging from 468 to 3835 mm with an average of 1930 mm together with the rainfall during the cropping season the total water input was 1000 mm for all the observations and reached 4637 mm in farm b with an overall average of 2539 mm a larger portion of the water input was from irrigation accounting for 76 of the total water input on average than from rainfall the irrigation water input was considerably higher in farm b than it was in the other two farms in addition to the high variation in the total water input the seasonal runoff amount also varied considerably ranging from 227 to 2610 mm and was much higher in farm b than it was in the other two farms table 6 in farm a and farm c the seasonal runoff was mostly 1000 mm it should be noted that the measured runoff volume in farm b in 2017a for irrigation treatments b and c were particularly unreliable because of the unexpected cut inflows of irrigation water from the plot next to our experimental plot which was measured only at the outlets of irrigation treatments b and c the unexpected flows only increased the runoff resulting in a runoff ratio higher than 100 highlighted in grey which is completely unrealistic and thus was excluded from the calculation of the average water balance components of the farms therefore the seasonal runoff amount was 1009 170 mm mean se across the farms subsequently the seasonal observed and calculated percolation amounts were compared based on the water balance with the estimated et in 2017b table 6 the estimated et was relatively stable compared to the other water balance components ranging narrowly from 483 to 571 mm the seasonal percolation from the water balance varied considerably among the irrigation treatments in each farm and did not always correspond with the observed volume in irrigation b the observed seasonal percolation volume was highest in farm b at 2026 mm followed by farm a and farm c at 618 and 117 mm respectively on average over the toposequential positions consequently runoff et and percolation accounted for 40 21 and 31 of the average total water input respectively in the contour levee irrigation system the averages were not exactly balanced because of the number of observations for each item 3 3 toposequential effects on water dynamics and on grain yield the toposequential positions did not have a significant effect on percolation rates across the farms but the percolation rates averaged over the toposequence were significantly different among the farms with the highest rate in farm b table 7 as a result farm average percolation rates ranged 2 3 62 8 mm day 1 even though the difference in percolation rate among toposequential positions was not significant lower position had the lowest rate in each farm the duration with standing water widely ranged 1 6 89 2 days across the toposequence and the farms table 7 as mentioned in section 3 1 middle position in farm a had exceptionally dried conditions and resulted in the extremely short duration there was no significant difference or consistent tendency in the duration with standing water over the toposequence across the farms moreover the duration was not significantly different among the farms unlike the percolation rate though that in farm c was relatively longer than in the other two farms despite that the total observation period was shortest among the farms relationships between the percolation rate and the duration with standing water were not very clear across the toposequence nevertheless smaller percolation rates corresponded with longer duration with standing water as farm averaged values though farm b had a similar duration to farm a despite of its much higher percolation rate finally the grain yield associated with the toposequential positions ranged 3 8 6 6 t ha 1 across the farms and seasons fig 7 the toposequential positions showed a significant difference in grain yield only in farm b 2017a and farm a 2017b where the upper positions tended to have higher grain yield than did the lower positions however the grain yield was not clearly or consistently different among toposequential positions across the farms and seasons 4 discussions 4 1 conventional irrigation management affected by soil property rainfall and agronomic factors this study included three farms with different soil water permeability as seen in the ks values varying from zero to over 100 mm day 1 table 1 and we discovered that the conventional irrigation practices were diverse among the farms fig 5 the more frequent irrigation with larger water amounts for individual irrigation events observed in farm b 2017b can be explained by its highly permeable soil which was demonstrated by both the ks and high fluctuation of the field water table depth in contrast farm c 2017b was less frequently irrigated because the farm soil showed lower permeability than that of the other farms the soil in farm a had medium permeability and therefore demonstrated an intermediate field water table pattern but was more frequently irrigated than was farm c naturally rainfall events would reduce irrigation application generally the number of irrigation was negatively correlated with the seasonal rainfall amount when it is compared between the seasons in each farm though irrigation b in farm c exceptional table 5 in addition the reduction in the number of irrigation in relation to the increment in the seasonal rainfall amount was largest in farm c and lowest in farm b indicating the similar effect of the soil water permeability as mentioned above it is rational that a rainfall event is more influential on irrigation practice in an impermeable soil since the rainfall water would keep the soil saturation for a longer period therefore it was demonstrated that their decision on irrigation application could be affected by rainfall as well as by its interaction with the soil property although soil permeability and rainfall were the main factors affecting irrigation management the interview with the irrigation managers revealed other agronomic factors that influenced their decision on irrigation for instance the intensive irrigation before 30 dae in farm c 2017b fig 5 was performed to suppress weeds personal communication with the irrigation manager of farm c in accordance with the recommendation of awd practice richards and sander 2014 in addition depending on the weather one or two irrigations were applied between the sowing and emergence periods to aid emergence which were not measured in this study furthermore the flowering period was not a particular focus as shown in fig 5 although rice is known to be susceptible to drought stress especially during that period boonjung and fukai 1996 davatgar et al 2009 lilley and fukai 1994 therefore the rice crop was probably exposed to drought stress around the flowering period to some extent under the conventional irrigation management judging from the chart of the field water table for awd 10 kpa soil water potential in the root zone has been reported as the safe threshold for re irrigation to avoid yield reduction bouman and tuong 2001 and it is recommended that flooded conditions should be maintained particularly around the flowering period richards and sander 2014 thus protecting rice from exposure to drought stress by allocating additional irrigation water during the flowering period would improve the irrigation efficiency of the target site 4 2 water balance of contour levee irrigation system characterized by large irrigation and runoff to our knowledge the water balance of the actual contour levee irrigation system was revealed for the first time and exhibited different characteristics compared to the awd practices in flat fields the absolute values and ratios of each water balance component compared with those reported in previous studies as well as the whole water balance of the contour levee irrigation system are discussed below the contour levee irrigation system exhibited a considerably high total water input of 2539 mm including 1930 mm of irrigation which accounted for 76 of the total input table 6 previous studies have shown that the total water input including rainfall typically ranged from 600 to 1500 mm and irrigation accounted for 200 1000 mm in awd practices in lowland puddled and transplanted conditions belder et al 2005 cabangon et al 2004 de vries et al 2010 sudhir yadav et al 2011 tabbal et al 2002 the ratio of irrigation to total water input also varies widely from approximately 10 to up to 100 depending on the amount of seasonal rainfall but the ratio usually decreases rapidly following a certain amount of rainfall typically leading to 50 with rainfall over 500 mm cabangon et al 2004 lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 focusing on farm a and farm c farms the total water input was mostly similar to that of awd but the irrigation water requirement of the contour levee irrigation system was high even when rainfall was not scarce regarding water outflows the high runoff ratio that accounted for 40 of the total input was remarkable compared to that of the awd practices in other regions table 6 the average seasonal runoff in this study was much higher than that of awd normally the runoff of awd in flat fields is less than 200 mm over a crop cycle cabangon et al 2004 sudhir yadav et al 2011 although an experiment in brazil with intermittent irrigation management recorded 215 449 mm de avila et al 2015 the observed high runoff amount was expectedly caused by the sloped conditions and closely agrees with studies conducted in arkansas and mississippi in the us which reported that the contour levee irrigation system required twice as much or more irrigation water than that required for the zero grade irrigation system in flat fields similar to the irrigated lowland system in asia massey et al 2014 smith et al 2007 et is reported to be affected by numerous factors but mainly by climatic conditions and it ranges from approximately 350 700 mm over the crop cycle belder et al 2005 lu et al 2016 sudhir yadav et al 2011 the et in in this study 483 571 mm table 6 was lower but not much different from that reported in a humid sub tropical zone in brazil under intermittent irrigation management 559 627 mm de avila et al 2015 the estimated seasonal percolation from the water balance was the highest in farm b and the lowest in farm c which agreed with the soil characteristics of the three farms the seasonal percolation amount is known to be highly affected by soil permeability belder et al 2007 for instance an average percolation of 274 mm under awd was reported in silty clay soil in california usa linquist et al 2015 369 mm in clay loam soil in tuanlin china tan et al 2013 and 422 mm in sandy loam soil in jilin china lu et al 2016 compared to the above studies in this study the estimated percolation amounts of the water balance were relatively higher which could be attributed to the lack of puddling practice which significantly reduces percolation sudhir yadav et al 2011 tuong et al 1994 farm b in particular showed higher percolation than that in the other farms because of its highly permeable soil without puddling and longer irrigation period which maintained the saturation for a relatively long period despite the soil permeability the amount of percolation measured using the percolator was roughly in agreement with the amounts estimated from the water balance in farm a underestimated in farm c and overestimated in farm b for farm c some cracks were observed in the field during some periods in the season that could have increased the seasonal percolation amount of the entire field which did not occur in the percolator in farm b the soil layer immediately below the bottom of the percolator often contained many rocks and therefore the water could have percolated more easily than did the water in the entire plot possibly leading to the higher observed than estimated amount from the balance generally the large variation in the seasonal percolation amount from the balance could have been derived partly from measurement errors in the observation of irrigation and runoff water flows which likely caused the discrepancy with the observed amounts to a certain extent nevertheless the magnitude of the relationship of the seasonal percolation amounts among the farms was similar and the averages across the farms were close between the values of the water balance and those of the percolator indicating that the components were acceptably balanced finally overall water balance of contour levee irrigation system was compared with that of awd and also of cf fig 6 resulted in remarkably higher irrigation input and runoff water loss since the other components rainfall et and percolation were not largely different the high irrigation input was applied mainly to compensate the large runoff water loss it should be noted that the irrigation and runoff components in contour levee irrigation system had large variability due to the small sample size as well as to the diverse soil properties and thus investigating further contour levee irrigation systems is demanded in order to compare the irrigation systems more precisely nevertheless avoiding runoff water loss by revising the irrigation management would essentially contribute to reducing the high irrigation input leading to improved water use efficiency of the contour levee irrigation system at the plot scale 4 3 insignificant toposequential effects within a plot under contour levee irrigation system the observed percolation rates along the toposequence were not clearly different among the positions in this study but agreed to a certain extent with a lower percolation rate in lower positions reported in the previous studies tsubo et al 2005 2006 the result showed that although a relatively high variation in the percolation rates occurred among the toposequential positions a significant and consistent difference was observed only among the farms the tendency in percolation rates among the farms was coinciding with that in the permeability of the soil shown as ks in table 1 thus the toposequential effects influenced the percolation rate a little but the soil permeability did much more clearly in this study consequently the duration with standing water did not show a clear tendency over the toposequence table 7 percolation rates would negatively affect the duration from the perspective of water balance but did not clearly exhibit such an expected negative correlation the presence of the intermittent flush irrigation in this study might have mitigated the difference in the duration among the toposequential positions or among the farms for instance the relatively long duration in farm b compared to its considerably high percolation rate can be attributed to the long duration of irrigation itself table 5 under rainfed conditions disappearance of standing water were often observed was often earlier in the upper positions than in the lower positions inthavong et al 2011 tsubo et al 2006 resulting in longer days without standing water boling et al 2008 tsubo et al 2006 or lower mean levels of the field water table in the upper positions inthavong et al 2011 touré et al 2009 tsubo et al 2006 in general the number of days with standing water has been reported to range from 22 to 44 days with flush irrigation management depending on the severity of the irrigation threshold and weather in china cabangon et al 2003 the range of duration in the present study 36 3 51 2 days on farm average was longer than the previous study but still compatible the lack of clear toposequential effects on the water dynamics in this study could be explained by the following reasons first both the toposequence scale and slope degree were considered as factors determining the extent of toposequential effects with the scale exerting a higher influence a steeper slope of over 5 with similar length along the toposequence of up to 100 m did not cause clear toposequential effects in previous studies either boling et al 2008 oo et al 2012 on the other hand toposequential effects were more commonly observed with a longer distance along the toposequence ranging from several hundred meters to kilometers despite a gentle slope of approximately 1 2 similar to this study boling et al 2008 hseu and chen 1996 tsubo et al 2006 therefore with the contour levee system in gently sloped fields around ibague plots of similar scales to those in this study 1 2 ha are less likely to have toposequential effects but larger plots of 1 km or more along the toposequence would have significant effects second the location of the fields in this study was relatively far from a river at the bottom of a valley which might have alleviated toposequential effects on the water dynamics typical areas where toposequential differences in water dynamics were reported were located at lower positions in a river valley or close to water sources such as a river or the sea homma et al 2003 hseu and chen 1996 touré et al 2009 yamauchi 1992 worou et al 2013 in such situations irrigation water might not adequately drain out of the plot but stay at the lower part of the plots with sediments and percolation might also be smaller because of a shallow groundwater table ultimately the grain yield was not significantly affected by the toposequential positions except for two cases farm a 2017b and farm b 2017a or did not correspond to the toposequence consistently across the farms and seasons fig 7 this finding disagreed with the previous studies reporting higher yields together with the higher water availability in lower positions boling et al 2008 samson et al 2004 but agreed with the insignificant difference in the water dynamics among the toposequential positions in this study the two cases with significant effects of the toposequence in this study had large seasonal rainfall amounts and resulted in higher grain yields in the upper positions tsubo et al 2006 also partly observed similar higher grain yields in upper positions and attributed them to flooding damages in lower positions since well drained conditions in the contour levee irrigation system in this study were demonstrated by the high seasonal runoff table 6 and the field water table frequently reaching below the soil surface fig 5 such negative effects of excessive water in the lower positions are not likely to have occurred in this study nevertheless observation of the water dynamics focusing on the period between sowing and emergence together with plant emergence rate along the toposequence might provide further clues since soil water conditions during that period particularly affect crop establishment in conclusion clear toposequential effects on water dynamics or on grain yield were not confirmed in this study 4 4 implications for whole farm irrigation management the medium to large farms in the central rice growing region in colombia consist of multiple plots typically 5 20 usually only a few plots are irrigated from the irrigation canal directly and the remaining plots receive the excess water from adjustment plots slightly higher than the recipient plots this plot to plot irrigation seems to be the common practice of the contour levee irrigation system it is arguable whether the high ratio of runoff water in each plot could be justified in such conventional water management in fact long duration is required for each irrigation in the conventional plot to plot management table 5 and presumably contributed to larger water loss via percolation section 4 2 flexible and precise irrigation management of each plot for the amount and timing of the irrigation could only be possible if each plot was independently connected by an irrigation canal which is particularly important for the further water saving technologies on a plot scale guerra et al 1998 for example the sparse irrigation during the flowering period in this study section 4 1 cannot be easily overcome using the plot to plot irrigation practice therefore it is recommended that irrigation should be individually managed among the plots of the whole farm by minimizing the runoff from each plot to optimally allocate water depending on the crop growth stage in the plot 5 conclusion aiming at revealing water dynamics of contour levee irrigation system field experiments were conducted in three commercial farms in ibagué colombia with different irrigation intervals the conventional irrigation management in each farm was analyzed and found to be highly affected by soil permeability and rainfall but also by agronomic factors the result of this analysis indicated that allocating more irrigation water during the flowering period would enhance productivity water balance of the contour levee irrigation system was quantified and resulted in remarkably high irrigation input it reached an average of 1930 mm and the considerable water loss via runoff accounted for approximately 40 of the total water input duration with standing water and percolation rate were additionally compared along the toposequence but not significantly different or consistent among the farms in this study this observation was probably due to the relatively small scale of the plots and the large distance between the location and water sources such as rivers or the bottom of inland valleys furthermore clear toposequential effects on the grain yield were not confirmed either this study elucidated the detailed water dynamics of contour levee irrigation system at plot scale in commercial farms in ibagué colombia including the characteristics of the conventional irrigation management and the water balance together not accompanied with significant toposequential effects which have not been reported to date to improve the irrigation management and thus water use efficiency individual irrigation management of each plot of the whole farm is recommended by minimizing the runoff from each plot furthermore water should be allocated optimally depending on the crop growth stage in the plot rather than the currently followed whole farm plot to plot irrigation management over sequential plots acknowledgments part of this research was

11069,contour levee irrigation system is commonly used for rice cultivation in latin american and caribbean countries but its water dynamics in commercial farm field settings are yet to be fully determined this study aimed to investigate the water dynamics of the contour levee irrigation system by analyzing conventional irrigation practices and by quantifying water balance and additionally to examine potential toposequential effects field experiments with different irrigation intervals were conducted on three commercial farms in ibagué colombia for two seasons from 2017 to 2018 irrigation and runoff water flows were constantly measured during the crop cycle using parshall flumes with water level sensors percolation rate and field water table were measured using percolators and piezometers installed along the toposequence the results showed that conventional irrigation management was highly flexible depending on soil permeability rainfall and agronomic factors not particularly paying attention to ensure the flooded conditions during flowering period the water balance resulted in the irrigation accounting for 76 of the total water input whereas the runoff et and percolation accounted for 40 21 and 31 on overall average with considerable variation among the three farms percolation rates and duration with standing water did not show a clear and consistent tendency among the toposequential positions but the percolation rate was significantly different among the farms corresponding to soil permeability consequently clear toposequential effects on the water dynamics or on grain yield were not observed at the study site to our knowledge this study is the first to elucidate detailed water dynamics of contour levee irrigation system in farm fields including toposequential difference keywords colombia rice contour levee irrigation system water balance toposequential effects 1 introduction rice is one of the most important food crop providing 19 of the global human per capita energy but there are concerns regarding the sustainability of its production because of the large water requirement of up to 2 3 times more than that required by other cereals mclean et al 2013 therefore various water saving rice cultivation systems such as saturated soil culture the soil is maintained at saturated water conditions and alternate drying and wetting awd the soil is allowed to dry out for a few days after disappearance of standing water before the next irrigation instead of continuously flooding have been developed and adopted by farmers tabbal et al 2002 among the rice producing countries those in the latin american and caribbean lac region have relatively recently started rice cultivation nevertheless their production has been increasing remarkably from 7 986 000 mg in 1961 to 28 092 000 mg in 2009 zorrilla et al 2012 and is expected to rise with an annual yield increase of around 2 by 2050 ray et al 2013 rice cultivation in the region has highly intensified irrigated cultivation system accounts for 59 of the total rice production and the larger 15 50 ha on average mechanized farms accounts for 94 mclean et al 2013 thus along with the expansion of rice production highly relying on irrigation further efficient use of irrigation water would be necessary for sustainable rice production in the lac region contour levee irrigation system is a common land management and irrigation practice for lowland rice cultivation in sloped fields for example in colombia the cultivation system accounts for 70 1 of the irrigated rice area according to national federation of rice producers fedearroz in spanish fedearroz 2017 rice farmers construct levees bunds along the contour lines to hold water within the plot pineda and montaña 2015 irrigation is started after sowing and is intermittently applied from an inlet at the highest side of the plot and the water flows down and drains out through an outlet at the lowest side as runoff fig 1 similar practices of the contour levee irrigation system are adopted in other major irrigated rice producing areas in the lac region such as those in argentina marano and filippi 2015 brazil takamiya and tsutsui 2000 and uruguay battallo et al 2013 although the construction of contour levees holds irrigation water within the plot to a certain extent the runoff through the outlet due to the slope of the field might generally cause significant water loss from the plot leading to high irrigation water requirement the contour levee irrigation system is also practiced in arkansas and mississippi in the us and the irrigation water input was reported to range widely from 406 to 1430 mm henry et al 2016 in uruguay 1250 mm is considered to be the standard volume allotted for irrigation in the rice sector but the actual average irrigation water amount applied at the farm scale is uncertain pittelkow et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge no studies have examined the detailed water balance and dynamics of the contour levee irrigation system on farm fields since observations in experimental fields do not encompass farmers economic behavior and agricultural practices can differ from those in commercial farms takahashi et al 2018 agricultural strategies must be evaluated at the scale reflecting the commercial producers decision makings mcgonigle et al 2014 therefore it is essential to reveal the water dynamics of the contour levee irrigation system in farm fields to elucidate efficient irrigation strategies applicable to actual farms apart from the topographical conditions and construction of contour levees the intermittent flush irrigation practice under the contour levee irrigation system is close to awd irrigation management chirinda et al 2017 awd was developed by the international rice research institution irri and has been used in irrigated lowlands mainly in asia as a water saving crop management strategy for lowland rice bouman and lampayan 2009 in many cases the irrigation water requirement of awd is lower than that of continuous flooding cf by approximately 30 bouman and tuong 2001 chapagain et al 2011 or even less than half of that of cf sudhir yadav et al 2011 a reduction in both irrigation time and percolation loss could contribute to lowering the irrigation requirement tan et al 2013 the grain yield with awd was similar to or slightly higher than that with cf belder et al 2004 belder et al 2005 cabangon et al 2004 although a relatively small yield reduction was also observed in other cases chapagain et al 2011 tabbal et al 2002 furthermore it was reported that in cf 45 of the water input was productively used by transpiration and 10 and 45 lost by evaporation and percolation respectively bouman et al 2007 however for awd under flat lowland conditions et percolation and runoff loss account for 40 60 30 50 and 0 15 of the total water input respectively cabangon et al 2004 lu et al 2016 sudhir yadav et al 2011 consequently water loss via percolation which is affected mainly by soil permeability and groundwater table is usually the focus in awd to adjust site specific irrigation management and avoid yield reduction by saving water since a high runoff amount is anticipated percolation might be less important with the contour levee irrigation system quantification of the water balance in the contour levee irrigation system has not been conducted yet and it would be important to identify the aspects of conventional irrigation practices that need to be improved to enhance water use efficiency in addition there are potential concerns that positions along a sloped field might be different in soil fertility and water availability and the variability of resources may lead to within field variations in plant growth this spatial heterogeneity along the slope is called toposequential effects and has been reported mainly for a series of flat paddy fields located along the slope in asia boling et al 2008 tsubo et al 2006 and in rice fields of inland valleys in africa touré et al 2009 the runoff transporting sediments over the toposequence often results in more fertile soil conditions in the lower than in the higher positions boling et al 2008 homma et al 2003 in addition the lower positions tend to store more water and thus have higher water availability than the higher positions do hseu and chen 1996 samson et al 2004 tsubo et al 2005 which was demonstrated as more days with standing water on the soil surface boling et al 2008 tsubo et al 2006 in the lower position of the slope tsubo et al 2005 2006 also reported that the higher percolation rates at higher positions were due to the lighter soil texture consequently variations in crop growth have been observed along the toposequence and lower positions tend to have higher yields boling et al 2008 samson et al 2004 tsubo et al 2006 the timing of the disappearance of standing water around flowering period was reported to considerably affect the rice productivity samson et al 2004 tsubo et al 2006 and therefore adjustment of crop management strategies according to the toposequential positions would be necessary which have not been conducted so far therefore in this study the water dynamics of the contour levee irrigation system were investigated by analyzing the characteristics of farmers irrigation practices and by quantifying the water balance in commercial farms with different soil properties and wide range of irrigation practices additionally the significance of the toposequential effects was examined by measuring percolation rates field water table and grain yield across the toposequence ibagué the capital of the department of tolima colombia was chosen as the target site because it is an intensive rice producing regions in colombia owing to its fertile alluvial soils where the contour levee irrigation system is commonly practiced fedearroz 2017 2 materials and methods

department of tolima in colombia for two growing seasons from 2017 to 2018 2017a and 2017b rice fields in the region are generally sloped and that of the targeted farms was approximately 1 3 ibagué

and minimum temperatures on 20 year average weather data was also collected over the period of the experiments by a weather station climate station vantage pro 2 davis instruments ca usa installed in each farm field shown in fig 2 the typical soil type of the farmlands in the region is oxisol or ultisol which is characterized by moderate levels of organic matter low levels of phosphorous nitrogen and ph and high natural fertility due to its alluvial fan sediments castro gonzález and lima 2016 intact soil samples were collected by creating a soil pit 1 1 1 m3 at the center of each farm and then using a soil core sampler 100 cm3 at the middle depth of the 0 15 15 30 30 45 45 60 60 85 and 85 110 cm soil layers with two replications in 2016 the soil samples were analyzed using constant head permeability test saturated hydraulic conductivity ks pressure chamber method volumetric water content at different water potential and walkley black method organic carbon content the inorganic nitrogen content was obtained as the sum of nh4 n and no3 n extracted using 2n kcl solution and nh4 n content was measured using indophenol blue method after reduction by cadmium coil using a technicon autoanalyzer ii seal analytical southampton uk the soil properties analyzed are summarized in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiments were conducted in a plot of each farm with irrigation treatments consisting of three different intervals between irrigations a vertical bund of approximately 30 cm height was constructed along the slope to separate the irrigation treatments in the experimental plots the total area of the experimental plot in each farm ranged approximately from 1 to 2 ha while the distance across the slope and degree of the slope were 373 m and 1 9 for farm a 205 m and 2 9 for farm b and 165 m and 3 0 for farm c respectively a popular rice variety in this region fedearroz60 was directly dry seeded into the soil at a 130 kg ha 1 sowing rate by using a non till drill seeder with a fertilizer applicator the seeding was performed at 19 cm between rows and 12 kg n ha 1 basal fertilizer application sowing dates and other phenological events are summarized in table 2 irrigation management in each farm was conducted based on three intervals in days between irrigations as the irrigation treatments 2 4 days a short 4 7 days b conventional and 6 10 days c long as shown in table 3 n fertilizer application followed the conventional practice of each farm consisting of 6 splits including basal application summarized in table 4 fertilizers for nutrient elements other than nitrogen were applied according to the conventional management practice of each farm 2 3 irrigation and runoff measurement the irrigation and runoff water flow at the outlet were also measured at the inlet and outlet of each irrigation management by using a hand made parshall flume and water level sensor etape liquid level sensor milone technologies nj usa for both 2017a and 2017b fig 3 the parshall flume is an open channel equipment in which water flows horizontally the water level sensor is a ruler shaped sensor with a resistive output that varies with the water level the water flow rate q in l s 1 can be determined by the water table in the parshall flume h in cm using eq 1 under the assumption of flat and horizontal water movement nevada state engineer s office 1986 the equation was determined based on a preliminary experiment on another farm near ibague data not shown the water table in the parshall flume was measured using a water level sensor attached to the side wall of the parshall flume with a 10 minute recording interval 1 q 0 2578 h2 0 0052 h the water table in the parshall flume was assumed to be the same during the 10 minute intervals and daily irrigation and runoff amounts were obtained by summing up values for the day the results were analyzed to calculate the seasonal amount of irrigation and runoff by summing up the values obtained over the growth season the number of irrigation events over the crop cycle was also counted based on the recording 2 4 field water table and percolation rate measurement the field water table depth cm in relation to the soil surface and the rate of percolation were measured in irrigation b in the three farms in 2017b at different positions along the toposequence upper middle and lower perforated pvc tubes to measure the field water table both above and below the soil surface piezometer and pvc tubes without perforation and with a lid to measure the percolation percolator were installed at a representative point halfway between the contour levees for each position all the pvc tubes had a diameter of 6 cm and the lengths were 40 80 cm for the piezometers and 50 cm for the percolators the water table inside the piezometers and percolators was measured using a water level sensor mentioned above with a 10 min recording interval the piezometer and the percolator at each location were installed close to each other within a 50 cm distance for the percolator water was refilled to the level of field water table occasionally when the field had standing water the installation method is shown in fig 4 and is similar to the setting of tsubo et al 2005 except for the sensors the daily percolation rate mm day 1 under saturated water conditions was then estimated from the recordings of the percolator as the daily difference in the water table within the percolator the difference was estimated only when the field water table shown in the piezometer was higher than 25 cm to confirm that the soil at a depth of 30 cm the depth at which percolators were installed is saturated then the average of the daily percolation rates was calculated as the percolation rate at each toposequential position to analyze the field water availability across the slope cumulative duration with standing water the field water table above the soil surface 0 cm was calculated by multiplying the number of observations by the interval of observation 10 min as the number of days for each piezometer in each farm 2 5 water balance analysis seasonal water balance was analyzed using irrigation runoff and rainfall data in 2017a and additionally using evapotranspiration and percolation data in 2017b the evapotranspiration was estimated as follows the reference evapotranspiration eto was first calculated using the makkink method makkink 1957 from the weather data at each farm daily crop evapotranspiration etc was then calculated by multiplying eto by the rice crop coefficients kc derived by allen et al 1998 initial growth 0 55 dae kc initial 1 05 mid season growth stage 55 95 dae kc mid 1 20 and late season growth stage 95 120 dae kc end 0 75 seasonal etc et was then calculated as the water balance component over the crop cycle the seasonal total percolation was calculated in two ways first it was estimated by subtracting the seasonal runoff and et from the total water input for each irrigation treatment percolation from the balance assuming changes in the water stored in the soil and net horizontal seepage flows are negligible second sum of the daily percolation rate measured using the percolator section 2 4 was calculated over the crop cycle and averaged across the toposequential positions as water balance component percolation observed for 2017b these two seasonal percolation estimates were compared to confirm whether the components were balanced 2 6 grain yield measurement gain yield was measured at harvest by threshing rice plants from an area of 2 2 m2 at four positions along the toposequence t1 t2 t3 and t4 positions t1 was the highest elevation and t4 the lowest for each irrigation treatment the grain samples were dried in a forced air circulation oven at 70 c for 72 h and the dry weight was measured grain yield was then calculated at 14 grain moisture content 2 7 statistical analysis to examine the significance of toposequential effects following statistical tests were conducted using r statistical software version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 with the significant level set at p 0 05 analysis of variance anova was conducted across the farms on the percolation rate and on the duration with standing water with factors of farm and toposequence for grain yield anova was performed in each farm and each season with a factor of toposequence subsequently fisher s least significant difference lsd test was conducted for the significant factors in those anova analyses using a package agricolae felipe de mendiburu 2017 3 results 3 1 characteristics of conventional irrigation managements the timing and amount of irrigation managements and changes of field water table depth throughout the growing season 2017b in irrigation treatment b conventional are shown in fig 5 the observed irrigation schedule coincided well with the timing when the field water table dropped below the soil surface in all the farms both the frequency and amount of water for each irrigation event were higher in farm b than in other two farms the irrigation schedules in farm a and farm c were relatively similar except for the intense irrigation immediately before 30 dae in farm c in terms of the irrigation schedule associated with phenological stages it was observed that the irrigation pattern did not change even in the flowering period the changes in the field water table revealed a faster drying rate for the soil and a larger fluctuation of the water table in farm b slower and smaller fluctuations in farm c and intermediate fluctuations in farm a the water table at middle position in farm a showed extremely dried conditions during the crop cycle because the small spot where the equipment was installed resulted in exceptionally dry prone conditions due to imperfect leveling based on our field observation the average irrigation amount mm and duration hours of each irrigation event and the number of irrigation events during the cropping season are summarized in table 5 since the irrigation treatment was based on the frequency the seasonal total irrigation amounts did not always follow the order of the irrigation treatments nevertheless the number of irrigation events and the cumulative duration of irrigation throughout the season indicated that the irrigation treatments were correctly implemented in most cases however the differences between b and c in farm b 2017a and between a and b in farm c 2017b were small and the orders were reversed the average irrigation amount of each event was slightly less and the duration of each irrigation was shorter in farm a than in the other two farms farm b had the highest number of irrigation events the longest duration of each irrigation at mostly 10 h and the largest irrigation amount for each event of the three farms resulting in a considerably higher total irrigation amount throughout the season which reached around 3000 mm in farm c the irrigation amount was obviously higher in 2017 a than it was in 2017b despite the similar seasonal rainfall probably because of the overestimation of the water depth inside the parshall flume caused by the sedimentation at the bottom in 2017a however the irrigation duration and number of events were similar between seasons in farm c 3 2 seasonal water balance the measured and estimated components of the water balance and their ratio over the total water input are summarized in table 6 the seasonal irrigation amount was considerably different among the farms ranging from 468 to 3835 mm with an average of 1930 mm together with the rainfall during the cropping season the total water input was 1000 mm for all the observations and reached 4637 mm in farm b with an overall average of 2539 mm a larger portion of the water input was from irrigation accounting for 76 of the total water input on average than from rainfall the irrigation water input was considerably higher in farm b than it was in the other two farms in addition to the high variation in the total water input the seasonal runoff amount also varied considerably ranging from 227 to 2610 mm and was much higher in farm b than it was in the other two farms table 6 in farm a and farm c the seasonal runoff was mostly 1000 mm it should be noted that the measured runoff volume in farm b in 2017a for irrigation treatments b and c were particularly unreliable because of the unexpected cut inflows of irrigation water from the plot next to our experimental plot which was measured only at the outlets of irrigation treatments b and c the unexpected flows only increased the runoff resulting in a runoff ratio higher than 100 highlighted in grey which is completely unrealistic and thus was excluded from the calculation of the average water balance components of the farms therefore the seasonal runoff amount was 1009 170 mm mean se across the farms subsequently the seasonal observed and calculated percolation amounts were compared based on the water balance with the estimated et in 2017b table 6 the estimated et was relatively stable compared to the other water balance components ranging narrowly from 483 to 571 mm the seasonal percolation from the water balance varied considerably among the irrigation treatments in each farm and did not always correspond with the observed volume in irrigation b the observed seasonal percolation volume was highest in farm b at 2026 mm followed by farm a and farm c at 618 and 117 mm respectively on average over the toposequential positions consequently runoff et and percolation accounted for 40 21 and 31 of the average total water input respectively in the contour levee irrigation system the averages were not exactly balanced because of the number of observations for each item 3 3 toposequential effects on water dynamics and on grain yield the toposequential positions did not have a significant effect on percolation rates across the farms but the percolation rates averaged over the toposequence were significantly different among the farms with the highest rate in farm b table 7 as a result farm average percolation rates ranged 2 3 62 8 mm day 1 even though the difference in percolation rate among toposequential positions was not significant lower position had the lowest rate in each farm the duration with standing water widely ranged 1 6 89 2 days across the toposequence and the farms table 7 as mentioned in section 3 1 middle position in farm a had exceptionally dried conditions and resulted in the extremely short duration there was no significant difference or consistent tendency in the duration with standing water over the toposequence across the farms moreover the duration was not significantly different among the farms unlike the percolation rate though that in farm c was relatively longer than in the other two farms despite that the total observation period was shortest among the farms relationships between the percolation rate and the duration with standing water were not very clear across the toposequence nevertheless smaller percolation rates corresponded with longer duration with standing water as farm averaged values though farm b had a similar duration to farm a despite of its much higher percolation rate finally the grain yield associated with the toposequential positions ranged 3 8 6 6 t ha 1 across the farms and seasons fig 7 the toposequential positions showed a significant difference in grain yield only in farm b 2017a and farm a 2017b where the upper positions tended to have higher grain yield than did the lower positions however the grain yield was not clearly or consistently different among toposequential positions across the farms and seasons 4 discussions 4 1 conventional irrigation management affected by soil property rainfall and agronomic factors this study included three farms with different soil water permeability as seen in the ks values varying from zero to over 100 mm day 1 table 1 and we discovered that the conventional irrigation practices were diverse among the farms fig 5 the more frequent irrigation with larger water amounts for individual irrigation events observed in farm b 2017b can be explained by its highly permeable soil which was demonstrated by both the ks and high fluctuation of the field water table depth in contrast farm c 2017b was less frequently irrigated because the farm soil showed lower permeability than that of the other farms the soil in farm a had medium permeability and therefore demonstrated an intermediate field water table pattern but was more frequently irrigated than was farm c naturally rainfall events would reduce irrigation application generally the number of irrigation was negatively correlated with the seasonal rainfall amount when it is compared between the seasons in each farm though irrigation b in farm c exceptional table 5 in addition the reduction in the number of irrigation in relation to the increment in the seasonal rainfall amount was largest in farm c and lowest in farm b indicating the similar effect of the soil water permeability as mentioned above it is rational that a rainfall event is more influential on irrigation practice in an impermeable soil since the rainfall water would keep the soil saturation for a longer period therefore it was demonstrated that their decision on irrigation application could be affected by rainfall as well as by its interaction with the soil property although soil permeability and rainfall were the main factors affecting irrigation management the interview with the irrigation managers revealed other agronomic factors that influenced their decision on irrigation for instance the intensive irrigation before 30 dae in farm c 2017b fig 5 was performed to suppress weeds personal communication with the irrigation manager of farm c in accordance with the recommendation of awd practice richards and sander 2014 in addition depending on the weather one or two irrigations were applied between the sowing and emergence periods to aid emergence which were not measured in this study furthermore the flowering period was not a particular focus as shown in fig 5 although rice is known to be susceptible to drought stress especially during that period boonjung and fukai 1996 davatgar et al 2009 lilley and fukai 1994 therefore the rice crop was probably exposed to drought stress around the flowering period to some extent under the conventional irrigation management judging from the chart of the field water table for awd 10 kpa soil water potential in the root zone has been reported as the safe threshold for re irrigation to avoid yield reduction bouman and tuong 2001 and it is recommended that flooded conditions should be maintained particularly around the flowering period richards and sander 2014 thus protecting rice from exposure to drought stress by allocating additional irrigation water during the flowering period would improve the irrigation efficiency of the target site 4 2 water balance of contour levee irrigation system characterized by large irrigation and runoff to our knowledge the water balance of the actual contour levee irrigation system was revealed for the first time and exhibited different characteristics compared to the awd practices in flat fields the absolute values and ratios of each water balance component compared with those reported in previous studies as well as the whole water balance of the contour levee irrigation system are discussed below the contour levee irrigation system exhibited a considerably high total water input of 2539 mm including 1930 mm of irrigation which accounted for 76 of the total input table 6 previous studies have shown that the total water input including rainfall typically ranged from 600 to 1500 mm and irrigation accounted for 200 1000 mm in awd practices in lowland puddled and transplanted conditions belder et al 2005 cabangon et al 2004 de vries et al 2010 sudhir yadav et al 2011 tabbal et al 2002 the ratio of irrigation to total water input also varies widely from approximately 10 to up to 100 depending on the amount of seasonal rainfall but the ratio usually decreases rapidly following a certain amount of rainfall typically leading to 50 with rainfall over 500 mm cabangon et al 2004 lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 focusing on farm a and farm c farms the total water input was mostly similar to that of awd but the irrigation water requirement of the contour levee irrigation system was high even when rainfall was not scarce regarding water outflows the high runoff ratio that accounted for 40 of the total input was remarkable compared to that of the awd practices in other regions table 6 the average seasonal runoff in this study was much higher than that of awd normally the runoff of awd in flat fields is less than 200 mm over a crop cycle cabangon et al 2004 sudhir yadav et al 2011 although an experiment in brazil with intermittent irrigation management recorded 215 449 mm de avila et al 2015 the observed high runoff amount was expectedly caused by the sloped conditions and closely agrees with studies conducted in arkansas and mississippi in the us which reported that the contour levee irrigation system required twice as much or more irrigation water than that required for the zero grade irrigation system in flat fields similar to the irrigated lowland system in asia massey et al 2014 smith et al 2007 et is reported to be affected by numerous factors but mainly by climatic conditions and it ranges from approximately 350 700 mm over the crop cycle belder et al 2005 lu et al 2016 sudhir yadav et al 2011 the et in in this study 483 571 mm table 6 was lower but not much different from that reported in a humid sub tropical zone in brazil under intermittent irrigation management 559 627 mm de avila et al 2015 the estimated seasonal percolation from the water balance was the highest in farm b and the lowest in farm c which agreed with the soil characteristics of the three farms the seasonal percolation amount is known to be highly affected by soil permeability belder et al 2007 for instance an average percolation of 274 mm under awd was reported in silty clay soil in california usa linquist et al 2015 369 mm in clay loam soil in tuanlin china tan et al 2013 and 422 mm in sandy loam soil in jilin china lu et al 2016 compared to the above studies in this study the estimated percolation amounts of the water balance were relatively higher which could be attributed to the lack of puddling practice which significantly reduces percolation sudhir yadav et al 2011 tuong et al 1994 farm b in particular showed higher percolation than that in the other farms because of its highly permeable soil without puddling and longer irrigation period which maintained the saturation for a relatively long period despite the soil permeability the amount of percolation measured using the percolator was roughly in agreement with the amounts estimated from the water balance in farm a underestimated in farm c and overestimated in farm b for farm c some cracks were observed in the field during some periods in the season that could have increased the seasonal percolation amount of the entire field which did not occur in the percolator in farm b the soil layer immediately below the bottom of the percolator often contained many rocks and therefore the water could have percolated more easily than did the water in the entire plot possibly leading to the higher observed than estimated amount from the balance generally the large variation in the seasonal percolation amount from the balance could have been derived partly from measurement errors in the observation of irrigation and runoff water flows which likely caused the discrepancy with the observed amounts to a certain extent nevertheless the magnitude of the relationship of the seasonal percolation amounts among the farms was similar and the averages across the farms were close between the values of the water balance and those of the percolator indicating that the components were acceptably balanced finally overall water balance of contour levee irrigation system was compared with that of awd and also of cf fig 6 resulted in remarkably higher irrigation input and runoff water loss since the other components rainfall et and percolation were not largely different the high irrigation input was applied mainly to compensate the large runoff water loss it should be noted that the irrigation and runoff components in contour levee irrigation system had large variability due to the small sample size as well as to the diverse soil properties and thus investigating further contour levee irrigation systems is demanded in order to compare the irrigation systems more precisely nevertheless avoiding runoff water loss by revising the irrigation management would essentially contribute to reducing the high irrigation input leading to improved water use efficiency of the contour levee irrigation system at the plot scale 4 3 insignificant toposequential effects within a plot under contour levee irrigation system the observed percolation rates along the toposequence were not clearly different among the positions in this study but agreed to a certain extent with a lower percolation rate in lower positions reported in the previous studies tsubo et al 2005 2006 the result showed that although a relatively high variation in the percolation rates occurred among the toposequential positions a significant and consistent difference was observed only among the farms the tendency in percolation rates among the farms was coinciding with that in the permeability of the soil shown as ks in table 1 thus the toposequential effects influenced the percolation rate a little but the soil permeability did much more clearly in this study consequently the duration with standing water did not show a clear tendency over the toposequence table 7 percolation rates would negatively affect the duration from the perspective of water balance but did not clearly exhibit such an expected negative correlation the presence of the intermittent flush irrigation in this study might have mitigated the difference in the duration among the toposequential positions or among the farms for instance the relatively long duration in farm b compared to its considerably high percolation rate can be attributed to the long duration of irrigation itself table 5 under rainfed conditions disappearance of standing water were often observed was often earlier in the upper positions than in the lower positions inthavong et al 2011 tsubo et al 2006 resulting in longer days without standing water boling et al 2008 tsubo et al 2006 or lower mean levels of the field water table in the upper positions inthavong et al 2011 touré et al 2009 tsubo et al 2006 in general the number of days with standing water has been reported to range from 22 to 44 days with flush irrigation management depending on the severity of the irrigation threshold and weather in china cabangon et al 2003 the range of duration in the present study 36 3 51 2 days on farm average was longer than the previous study but still compatible the lack of clear toposequential effects on the water dynamics in this study could be explained by the following reasons first both the toposequence scale and slope degree were considered as factors determining the extent of toposequential effects with the scale exerting a higher influence a steeper slope of over 5 with similar length along the toposequence of up to 100 m did not cause clear toposequential effects in previous studies either boling et al 2008 oo et al 2012 on the other hand toposequential effects were more commonly observed with a longer distance along the toposequence ranging from several hundred meters to kilometers despite a gentle slope of approximately 1 2 similar to this study boling et al 2008 hseu and chen 1996 tsubo et al 2006 therefore with the contour levee system in gently sloped fields around ibague plots of similar scales to those in this study 1 2 ha are less likely to have toposequential effects but larger plots of 1 km or more along the toposequence would have significant effects second the location of the fields in this study was relatively far from a river at the bottom of a valley which might have alleviated toposequential effects on the water dynamics typical areas where toposequential differences in water dynamics were reported were located at lower positions in a river valley or close to water sources such as a river or the sea homma et al 2003 hseu and chen 1996 touré et al 2009 yamauchi 1992 worou et al 2013 in such situations irrigation water might not adequately drain out of the plot but stay at the lower part of the plots with sediments and percolation might also be smaller because of a shallow groundwater table ultimately the grain yield was not significantly affected by the toposequential positions except for two cases farm a 2017b and farm b 2017a or did not correspond to the toposequence consistently across the farms and seasons fig 7 this finding disagreed with the previous studies reporting higher yields together with the higher water availability in lower positions boling et al 2008 samson et al 2004 but agreed with the insignificant difference in the water dynamics among the toposequential positions in this study the two cases with significant effects of the toposequence in this study had large seasonal rainfall amounts and resulted in higher grain yields in the upper positions tsubo et al 2006 also partly observed similar higher grain yields in upper positions and attributed them to flooding damages in lower positions since well drained conditions in the contour levee irrigation system in this study were demonstrated by the high seasonal runoff table 6 and the field water table frequently reaching below the soil surface fig 5 such negative effects of excessive water in the lower positions are not likely to have occurred in this study nevertheless observation of the water dynamics focusing on the period between sowing and emergence together with plant emergence rate along the toposequence might provide further clues since soil water conditions during that period particularly affect crop establishment in conclusion clear toposequential effects on water dynamics or on grain yield were not confirmed in this study 4 4 implications for whole farm irrigation management the medium to large farms in the central rice growing region in colombia consist of multiple plots typically 5 20 usually only a few plots are irrigated from the irrigation canal directly and the remaining plots receive the excess water from adjustment plots slightly higher than the recipient plots this plot to plot irrigation seems to be the common practice of the contour levee irrigation system it is arguable whether the high ratio of runoff water in each plot could be justified in such conventional water management in fact long duration is required for each irrigation in the conventional plot to plot management table 5 and presumably contributed to larger water loss via percolation section 4 2 flexible and precise irrigation management of each plot for the amount and timing of the irrigation could only be possible if each plot was independently connected by an irrigation canal which is particularly important for the further water saving technologies on a plot scale guerra et al 1998 for example the sparse irrigation during the flowering period in this study section 4 1 cannot be easily overcome using the plot to plot irrigation practice therefore it is recommended that irrigation should be individually managed among the plots of the whole farm by minimizing the runoff from each plot to optimally allocate water depending on the crop growth stage in the plot 5 conclusion aiming at revealing water dynamics of contour levee irrigation system field experiments were conducted in three commercial farms in ibagué colombia with different irrigation intervals the conventional irrigation management in each farm was analyzed and found to be highly affected by soil permeability and rainfall but also by agronomic factors the result of this analysis indicated that allocating more irrigation water during the flowering period would enhance productivity water balance of the contour levee irrigation system was quantified and resulted in remarkably high irrigation input it reached an average of 1930 mm and the considerable water loss via runoff accounted for approximately 40 of the total water input duration with standing water and percolation rate were additionally compared along the toposequence but not significantly different or consistent among the farms in this study this observation was probably due to the relatively small scale of the plots and the large distance between the location and water sources such as rivers or the bottom of inland valleys furthermore clear toposequential effects on the grain yield were not confirmed either this study elucidated the detailed water dynamics of contour levee irrigation system at plot scale in commercial farms in ibagué colombia including the characteristics of the conventional irrigation management and the water balance together not accompanied with significant toposequential effects which have not been reported to date to improve the irrigation management and thus water use efficiency individual irrigation management of each plot of the whole farm is recommended by minimizing the runoff from each plot furthermore water should be allocated optimally depending on the crop growth stage in the plot rather than the currently followed whole farm plot to plot irrigation management over sequential plots acknowledgments part of this research was
