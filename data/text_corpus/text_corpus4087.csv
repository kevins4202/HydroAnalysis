20435,the rigid body force rbf generated by fluid movement inside a partially filled tank is of great importance for many tank structures transporting liquid under dynamic conditions however accurate prediction of such forces presents a challenge for the designer due to the high level of nonlinearities involved in this paper three fundamentally different approaches eulerian volume of fluid vof approach with three common turbulence models smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale are used to simulate liquid sloshing responses the three approaches are implemented across two commercial simulation packages ansys fluent and ls dyna and evaluated using the experimental measurement from yan 2008 a detailed quantitative comparative study on the rbf among various numerical methods are carried out while a good agreement is found among the converged solution of using the les turbulence model in ansys fluent sph and ale in ls dyna while the icfd model presents slower convergence to the experiment result compared to the other solvers on other hand all the numerical approaches fail to accurately predict the maximum absolute rbf while the wave is sharply separated from the main domain and this force overprediction underprediction is dependent on element size time step size and fluid model impulse rather than absolute maximum rbf is proposed as the main computational characteristic to validate the performance of the baffled unbaffled transport tanks under fluid sloshing keywords turbulence liquid sloshing smooth particle hydrodynamics volume of fluid arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ls dyna ansys fluent 1 introduction the directional responses of vessels carrying liquid cargo are known to be strongly affected by liquid slosh caused by wave disturbances the particular sort of the change in weight distribution onboard is liquid sloshing taking place in partly filled tanks moving masses need to be avoided on board though it is impossible to evade them at all the cargo securing procedures ensure a lack of loose cargo onboard but some free surfaces of liquids in ships tanks are inevitable as a result the time dependent rigid body force rbf and local surface fluid contact force lsfcf are generally measured experimentally or simulated numerically to help design engineers to deliver a reliable transport tank in general rbf is the resultant force of the sum of all internal lsfcf the accurate prediction of rbf significantly impacts the structural design of tank walls vessel securement points and the integration of physical features into the vessel on the other hand the reliable prediction of lsfcf helps to determine the structural design of local features inside the tank such as deciding the shape of anti fluid sloshing baffle and manways at present fluid sloshing motion can be modeled as laminar or turbulent while the fluid domain can be discretized by either the stationary mesh deformable mesh and particles due to the wide range of available turbulence models and discretization approaches it is essential for the presented study to identify the performance of various numerical methods for the simulation of liquid sloshing on the other hand the amplitude of the maximum absolute rbf is significantly impacted by the element size the number of particles and time step size this paper will also investigate the mesh and time size sensitivities of several numerical methods and the development of a viable method for evaluating fluid forces the development of analytical methods for the analysis of liquid sloshing is challenging due to its strong nonlinearity and discontinuity from the 1960s to the 2000s most of the numerical methods developed to solve liquid sloshing problems are mainly based on two approaches the lagrangian approach and the eulerian approach in the lagrangian approach the mesh is deformable and attaches tightly to the fluid material points which makes this methodology easy to predict the location of the fluid free surface however the loss in numerical accuracy is generally expected due to the requirement of adaptive re meshing algorithms the eulerian approach discretizes the full domain through a stationary mesh which makes this numerical approach naturally adopted for the study of turbulence flow however the identification of the fluid free surface using the eulerian method is not straightforward consequently a highly refined mesh is generally required to capture the location of the fluid by combining the lagrangian and the eulerian approach the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale formulation uses a moving mesh with a mesh velocity defined through the structure motion this approach has been more commonly used in the past two decades to replace traditional fe methods to simulate fluid structure interaction problems involving large structures such as sloshing in fuel tanks and bird strikes in aircraft over the past decade mesh free methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph method have been widely used in the field of fluid dynamics to study complex systems characterized by turbulence and multiphase flow this numerical methodology is widely used to address the difficulties encountered by grid based numerical methods in the study of physical systems that exhibit very large deformations such as liquid sloshing li et al 2018 and wave breaking under very high acceleration longshaw and rogers 2015 from the 2010s to the 2020s there are more comparison studies implementing ale and sph to simulate the fluid slosh problems fong 2011 simulated the yacht slamming problem through ale and sph method and concluded that the water splashing and slamming phenomenon is more severe and demonstrates more details in ale than in sph while the computational cost of sph is at least 25 lower than that of ale with similar element sizes brizzolara et al 2011 simulated the fluid movement inside a rectangular tank with two commercial rans solvers flow 3d and ls dyna and an in house sph model with the conclusion that the rans model predicted better results compared to the sph model while the author also argued that the lack of precise properties for water in the equation of state eos could be the main cause for this difference xu et al 2016 simulated the water slosh inside a rectangular tank via the ale and sph method and stated that the sph method may need the finer resolution to achieve accuracy comparable to the ale approach however sph simulation can be utilized by using finer particle spacing for applications where mesh based methods cannot be used for simulations that require remeshing due to high mesh distortion recently atif et al 2019 compared the sph method with the finite element absolute nodal coordinate formula ancf and concluded that sph formulation can capture the severe sloshing scenarios better compared to the ancf method there are other mesh free numerical approaches that have been developed recently to simulate sloshing problems in tanks boroomand et al 2016 used a 3d mesh free exponential basis functions ebfs method for simulating the fluid sloshing in rectangular and cylindrical tanks bazazzadeh et al 2018 applied the peri dynamic differential operator pddo approach to simulate incompressible inviscid fluid flow within 2d and 3d rectangular and square tanks this method has the potential to calculate the derivatives of the potential flow near the singular points such as the tip of the baffle with suitable accuracy on the other hand several authors observed the over prediction of maximum rbf in a moving tank in the past 20 years by using multiple fluid models and discretization methods for example the over prediction of maximum rbf was presented by using the laminar model kim 2001 hwang et al 2016 chen and xue 2018 kim et al 2018 the rans turbulence model hsiao and lin 2010 liu et al 2017 arora and vasudevan 2017 and in sph model brizzolara et al 2011 some authors reported that the over prediction of maximum rbf increase with the mesh refinement liu et al 2017 and the point average method was generally recommended to filter the overpredicted force recently liu et al 2016 compared maximum rbf in a moving rectangular tank with rans les and les turbulence model and concluded that under the same mesh level there were 2 overprediction by using the vles method while the laminar flow over predict the maximum rbf by 55 it is essential to identify the performance of laminar frequently used turbulence models ale and sph models for simulations of liquid sloshing within a wide range of the model selection in the present study based on the experiment carried out by yan 2008 the laminar flow model rans des les turbulence model ale method and sph approach are used to capture the motion of fluid slosh inside a sealed tank the present study demonstrates that turbulence effects mesh size and time step size can play a significant role and the prediction accuracy can depend crucially on the selected setting for simulating the sharp separation of sloshing flows furthermore the results observed from the sph method will be compared against more established cfd methods used in this works the sph approach is generally suited for simulating flow scenarios with the flow with large movements and separations however the current study proves that when a small amount of fluid is separated from the main domain with high velocity all four solvers including the sph solver fails to correctly predict the rbf and an error up to 200 may occur depending on the selected mesh and time step size without experimental data it is difficult to calibrate such rbf curves in traditional transport tank designs the maximum rbf is normally used as the key computational characteristic to validate the design of the baffled and unbaffled tank within the baffled tank the fluid becomes turbulent and the fluid separation will occur more frequently compared to the unbaffled tank which results in the possibility to overpredict the rbf and may lead to an incorrect design of the baffle geometry since the force peak generally occurs during a small duration of time impulse rather than maximum rbf is recommended by the author as the main computational characteristic to judge the performance of the partially filled tank with and without baffle under fluid sloshing 2 mathematical methodology the equations in sections 2 1 to 2 2 are taken from ansys theory guide ansys inc 2020 while the equations in sections 2 3 to 2 4 are from the ls dyna keyword manual livermore software technology lstc 2020 and ls dyna theory manual livermore software technology lstc 2019 2 1 laminar flow model in ansys fluent the motion of the incompressible fluid inside a moving tank is governed by the continuity equation 1 ρ t u i x i 0 and the momentum equation 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i τ i j x j s m while τ is the stress tensor and u ρ t p ν τ i j and s m are the velocity component the fluid density time pressure component fluid viscosity stress tensor and source term respectively 2 2 turbulence model and volume of fluid method vof three typical turbulence models including the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model the large eddy simulation model les and the detached eddy simulation model des are used in the present study the reynolds averaged fitted navier stokes equation is expressed as 3 ρ t u i x i 0 4 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i ρ ν u i x j u j x i τ i j x j s m in the rans model u and p denotes the time averaged components whereas in les it defines the resolved scales τ is the turbulence stress tensor which arises as a result of the time averaging rans or spatial fileting les procedure and it is used to minimize the momentum transport due to turbulence motion in the des approach the unsteady rans models are employed in the boundary layer while the les wale treatment is applied in the core turbulent region where large unsteady turbulence scales play a dominant role the interested reader can refer to chapter 4 3 4 12 and 4 15 of ansys theory guide ansys inc 2020 for further details the vof model is a surface tracking technique for locating the interface between two or more immiscible fluid in ansys fluent and icfd in ls dyna it belongs to the class of eulerian methods which are characterized by a mesh that is stationary in a certain prescribed manner to accommodate the evolving shape of the interface the momentum and mass conservation equations are discretized using finite volume technique considering each cell as a control volume the interested reader can refer to chapter 18 of ansys theory guide ansys inc 2020 for further details 2 3 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method in ls dyna the sph method is based on the lagrangian formulation with the intention of avoiding mesh restrictions when large deformations appear within the finite element method the main difference between the standard methods and the sph methods is the absence of the mesh the momentum equation is sph can be written as 5 d v i d t j m j σ i ρ i 2 σ j ρ j 2 π i j w i j at particle i σ i is the stress tensor in voigt notation v i is the velocity tensor and w i j is the gradient of kernel function associated with particle j evaluated at particle i π i j is the artificial viscosity and was normally set by keyword control bulk viscosity or hourglass card in ls dyna to enforce the quasi incompressibility of the water three equation of state eos has been implemented in the paper the linear polynomial eos is expressed as 6 p c 0 c 1 μ c 2 μ 2 c 3 μ 3 c 4 c 5 μ c 6 μ 2 e where p is the fluid pressure and e is the internal energy and c 1 to c 6 are the user defined polynomials constant the gruneisen eos is defined as 7 p ρ c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 3 μ 1 2 γ 0 a μ e where c is the intercept of the particle velocity curve s 1 to s 6 are the user defined coefficient of the slope of the particle velocity curve γ 0 is the gruneisen gamma and a is the first order volume correction to γ 0 finally the murnaghan eos was solely designed to model incompressible fluid flow with sph or ale elements and the pressure is represented as 8 p k 0 ρ ρ 0 γ 1 to model the fluid flow accurately γ is often set to 7 and k 0 is chosen such that 9 c 0 γ k 0 ρ 0 10 v m a x where v m a x is the maximum expected fluid flow velocity 2 4 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method in ls dyna the ale method in ls dyna combines lagrangian and eulerian approaches the fluid domain is modeled using a lagrangian mesh and can partially deform whereas the solid domain in eulerian formulation flows through the fluid mesh the moved nodes liquid domain in the ale formulation are calculated according to the average distance to the neighboring nodes the velocity of an incompressible viscous fluid in a domain is characterized by the mass and momentum conservation law as 10 u i j 0 11 u i t u j u j m u i j 1 ρ τ i j s m 0 where u is the velocity component ρ is the fluid density τ i j is the stress tensor and s m is the source term u j m represents the velocity of the mesh if u j m 0 the eulerian formulation is obtained because the convective velocity of mesh is null if u j m u j the lagrangian formulation is obtained the quantity of u j u j m is the relative velocity 2 5 derivation of rbf on the full tank the resultant rigid body forces component are computed from the distributed pressure on the wall the integration over the wetted area of the wall cells are calculated from the following equation 12 f i 0 w e t t e d p i a i where f i is the rbf component acting on the tank a i is the effective area component of the tank walls p i is the fluid pressure component at the center of the cell and the wetted defines the regions of tank wall with fluid contact 3 model geometry and boundary conditions 3 1 experiment setup of the benchmark an experiment was carried out by yan in 2008 yan 2008 where a 1 85 m long tank fig 1a was fixed on an aluminum plate and mounted on a horizontal shaker table through three axis force dynamometers to measure the dynamic forces developed along lateral y and vertical z directions the tank was 30 filled with 0 21 m 3 water with filling height equals 0 159 m the model tank was designed with sufficiently large dimensions to reduce the effects of boundary constraints on the fluid slosh the total length and cross section area of the test tank were 1 85 m and 0 426 m2 respectively the tank was made of 12 7 mm thick transparent plexiglass material to facilitate flow visualization three dynamometers d 1 to d 3 were installed in a triangular setup to measure transient rbf due to fluid motion data acquisition rate was set at 256 hz for the experiment a single cycle sinusoidal acceleration was synthesized to study the transient lateral slosh behavior using the following piecewise functions 13 a c c e l e r a t i o n 0 5 a 1 c o s 4 π f t t 0 25 t a s i n 2 π f t 0 25 t 0 0 75 t 0 5 a 1 c o s 4 π f t 0 75 t 0 t 0 t t where t 2 3 s is the period f 1 5 hz is the frequency and a 4 34 m s 2 is the acceleration amplitude the acceleration amplitudes and frequencies are selected to limit the peak displacement of the tank assembly within the stroke of the actuator the transient acceleration is plotted in fig 2 3 2 details of mesh as shown in fig 3 two sets of mesh sizes h 40 mm to h 20 mm were implemented in ls dyna ale three sets mesh sizes h 40 mm to h 10 mm were implemented in ansys fluent and four sets h 40 mm to h 5 mm of mesh were used in ls dyna icfd a structured mesh was generated in ls dyna while the sph particles were created at the element node as shown in fig 4 consequently the number of sph elements raised with the reduction of element size of the structured mesh the detailed total element and particle numbers were shown in table 1 the variation of the selected smallest mesh size in different solvers are dependent on the required calculation time as discussed in section 4 4 3 3 boundary conditions two different approaches were suggested by arora and vasudevan 2017 to apply the acceleration on the fluid domain 1 in ansys fluent only the liquid domain was modeled the non slip boundary conditions were implemented on all the external walls while the sinusoidal acceleration shown in fig 2 was provided as a momentum source term in addition to this applied acceleration gravitational acceleration was also present 2 in ls dyna icfd ale and sph the tank geometry was modeled as a shell and the acceleration is applied as a rigid body motion on the tank shell elements in addition three water eos were tested in the sph and ale models in ls dyna to present the relationship between pressure and density details of the coefficients for these eos are presented in table 2 4 numerical results 4 1 velocity contour and overprediction on rbf prior to commencing the discussion on mesh and time refinement and various turbulence models it is pertinent to present liquid movement inside the tank within the first 1 5 s the velocity contour and the transient rbf on the lateral direction between 0 5 s and 2 s when using the sph method in ls dyna are presented in fig 5 from fig 5a the transient rbf matched well with the experimental data from 0 s to 1 s and divergence occurred when the fluid hits the right wall and created the first wave shown in fig 5c the fluid then moved with high velocity to the left side wall between 1 s to 1 32 s fig 5d and at 1 34 s the fluid impacted the left tank wall with a small amount of liquid separated from the main domain with high positive velocity fig 5e the kinetic energy was transformed to force on the tank and created the highest divergence of the simulated rbf the complete process occurred within 0 02 s and the sph solver failed to predict the resultant force accurately at that particular point demonstrating an error of 32 4 in comparison to the experimental result this force overprediction is observed in various time step sizes mesh sizes and turbulence models presented in this paper 4 2 time refinement adaptive time stepping method was implemented in all four solvers the automatic determination of the time step size is based on the estimation of the truncation error associated with the time integration scheme if the truncation error is smaller than a specified tolerance the size of the time step is increased if the truncation error is greater the time step size is decreased in all four solvers d t standards for the maximum allowed time step size and the minimum allowed time step size is set to 0 01 d t all four solvers were initiated with the maximum allowed time step size that can maintain stability of the solving process therefore the same d t could not be used in all the solvers as discussed in section 4 3 the icfd solver presented slower convergence in space compared to the other three solvers ideally h 10 mm mesh was supposed to be used in all four solvers to perform the time refinement study however due to the high computational cost required by the ale fluent and sph solver it is unrealistic to run a time refinement study on these three solvers under h 10 mm mesh consequently the mesh in each solver was refined up to the limitation of the pc finally h 20 mm mesh was chosen in ansys fluent and ls dyna sph solver h 10 mm mesh was chosen in icfd in ls dyna and h 40 mm mesh was chosen in the ale model in ls dyna for the later time refinement study the laminar model was implemented in ansys fluent and the default multi scale turbulence model was used in ls dyna eos of murnaghan was selected in ls dyna sph and ale model the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment result and the simulation results in all four solvers are presented in figs 6 a and 7 a respectively the percentage of overprediction of the maximum absolute lateral rbf is shown in table 3 the icfd and ale models presented an underprediction of the maximum absolute lateral rbf between 1 3 s and 1 5 s while both ansys fluent and ls dyna sph models overpredicted the maximum absolute l lateral rbf expect the maximum absolute rbf between 1 3 s and 1 5 s time convergence was observed in all four solvers in both lateral and vertical force vectors the overpredicted rbf varies as the time is refined while there is limited shape change been observed to understand the physics to cause the instability d t 2 0 e 3 s and d t 1 0 e 3 s in ansys fluent were selected the absolute maximum rbf occurred at 1 34 s for both cases the lateral velocity contour for both cases at t 1 33 s t 1 34 s and t 1 35 s are presented in fig 8 similar to the trend observed in sph solver in section 4 1 the fluid hit the left wall of the tank and started to sharply separate between 1 33 s to 1 35 s which was the time the fluent solver struggled to convergence during time refinement fluid separated at a similar time with the refinement of time step size reflecting on the transient rbf the value of the peak lateral rbf dramatically changed between 1 3 s to 1 5 s while the shape of the curve maintained the same since the unconvergence normally occurs at a small duration of time the alternative approach is to use impulse rather than peak force to compare the time averaging change among different configurations the impulse is calculated from the following equations 14 i m p o t f d t where t is the end time and t is the fluid time and f is the rgb in the longitudinal direction compared to the experiment result the percentage of overprediction of the impulse of rbf of time refinement results of all four solvers is shown in table 4 compared to the absolute maximum rbf as shown in table 3 the impulse of the rbf presented a better convergence trend fluent solver presented the best matching with the experiment data and less than 0 5 is observed in impulse from the presented figures and table the maximum absolute rbf was not converged in time within all four solvers while impulse presented a much better convergence trend the divergence of the rbf curve mainly occurred between 1 3 s to 1 5 s and the rest of the curve convergenced well with time refinement since further time refinement will significantly increase the physical calculation time the time step size for each model is selected as 1 ansys fluent d t 1 0 e 3 s 2 ls dyna icfd d t 5 0 e 3 s 3 ls dyna sph d t 1 75 e 2 s 4 ls dyna ale d t 4 5 e 6 s 4 3 mesh refinement with the selected time step size as discussed in section 4 2 the mesh refinement h refinement study is presented in this section three sets of mesh were used in the ansys fluent and ls dyna sph solvers four sets of mesh were used in the ls dyna icfd model and two sets of mesh were used in ls dyna ale model the details of different mesh sets are summarized in section 3 2 the mesh in ale model cannot be refined further due to the unfeasible computational cost comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment result and the simulation results in all three solvers are presented in figs 9 a and 10 a the percentage of overprediction of the lateral maximum absolute rbf and impulse is shown in table 5 the major divergence of rbf curve occurred between 1 3 s and 1 5 s in general the overpredicted maximum rbf increased as the mesh was refined except the h 20 mm to h 10 mm case when using the sph method different from the time refinement results the shape of the rbf curve significantly changed with refined mesh in all four solvers to investigate the root cause of such shape change the velocity contour plot near the time step while peak rbf occurred in ls dyna sph fluent icfd and ale solver under various mesh sizes are presented from figs 11 to 14 respectively for the sph solver as presented in fig 11b h 40 mm particles were too coarse to detect sharp wave separation consequently the transient rbf curve in the h 40 mm case was much smoother than the curve in the h 10 mm case a similar trend could be observed in ansys fluent and ls dyna icfd and ale solver another key observation was for the fluent solver even 20 mm mesh presented less than 0 5 of error in impulse further decreased the mesh to 10 mm increased the error impulse to 2 17 the corresponding error in rbf increased from 46 40 to 181 90 this trend clearly indicated that space was not convergent on predicting the sharp fluid separation in general compared to the time refinement mesh size refinement was more sensitive to capture the rbf during the wave separation between 1 3 s to 1 5 s furthermore finer mesh did not have a direct link to more accurate results on rbf for both impulse and maximum rbf the convergence trend could not be observed in both space and time for all four solvers while impulse presented a significantly better performance on convergence in comparison to the maximum absolute rbf consequently impulse rather than maximum absolute rbf is recommended by authors to judge the performance of the tank under acceleration finally the icfd model presented slower convergence in mesh compared to the other three solvers further refining the mesh in icfd solver increased the run time by a factor of 30 thus further refinement was not performed since the h 20 mm in fluent presented less than 0 5 error compared to the experimental result to maintain similar calculation times among all chosen solvers the mesh size for the latter study was fixed as 1 ansys fluent h 20 mm 2 ls dyna icfd h 10 mm 3 ls dyna sph h 20 mm 4 ls dyna ale h 20 mm 4 4 turbulence model and eos laminar flow rans des and les turbulence models were investigated in ansys fluent comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment results under various turbulence models are presented in fig 15 h 20 mm mesh was used in all simulations and the time step size was selected to be d t 1 0 e 3 s the percentage of overprediction of the impulse is shown in table 6 the laminar flow and the les model provided the best correlation to the experimental results however when comparing with the further mesh refinement results on the laminar flow and les model in fig 16 the laminar flow model overpredicted the maximum absolute rbf significantly more than the les model when mesh size was refined to 10 mm consequently the les wale model is proposed as the best turbulence model to simulate the fluid sloshing in ansys fluent the rans des and les turbulence models were also compared in ls dyna icfd the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment result under various turbulence models are presented in fig 17 the percentage of overprediction of the impulse is shown in table 7 h 10 mm mesh was used in all dimensions and the time step size was selected to be d t 5 0 e 3 s although there were slight over predictions of maximum absolute rbf the les turbulence model matched with the experimental observations better than the results obtained from rans and des turbulence models consequently les turbulence model is proposed as the best turbulence model to model the fluid slosh in icfd the gruneisen murnaghan and linear polynomial eos of water were compared in the ls dyna sph method the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experimental result under various eos are presented in fig 18 the particles were converted from h 20 mm mesh and time step size was selected as d t 1 75 e 2 s all three eos methods demonstrated a good correlation to the experimental measurements similarly trend could be observed from the impulse is shown in table 8 however from table 9 the calculation time required by the murnaghan eos was significantly lower compared to the gruneisen and linear polynomial eos consequently murnaghan eos is proposed as the best equation of state to model the fluid slosh in the sph model in ls dyna similar to the sph model the gruneisen murnaghan linear polynomial eos of water were compared in the ls dyna ale method the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between experiment results under various eos are presented in fig 19 h 20 mm mesh was implemented and time step size is selected as d t 4 5 e 6 s the percentage of overprediction of the impulse is shown in table 10 the murnaghan eos demonstrated marginally better results compared to all the other two methods with significantly less computational time table 9 consequently the murnaghan eos is proposed as the best equation of state to model the fluid slosh in the ale model in ls dyna by fixing the mesh size to be h 20 mm the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment result among ansys fluent les wale icfd les wale sph murnaghan and ale murnaghan are shown in fig 20 due to the slower mesh convergence in the icfd model the mesh size in the icfd was fixed to h 10 mm the required calculation time for the cases as shown in fig 20 are presented in table 9 simulations were performed using a desktop pc with a 3 0 ghz cpu and 16 gb ram by ignoring the maximum absolute rbf between 1 3 s and 1 5 s time stamp the percentage of overprediction of the impulse is shown in table 11 the ale model in ls dyna presented the best prediction compared to the experiment result out of all four solvers however the ale model also consumed 400 to 500 more computational time compared to other solvers by balancing the model accuracy with the required computational resources sph model with murnaghan eos or ansys fluent with les turbulence model is proposed to be a more viable option compared to the ale method for engineers to predict fluid slosh of a dynamic fluid body such as inside a moving tank 5 conclusion there is a wide range of available turbulence models and numerical modeling methods to simulate fluid sloshing this study investigated and compared the predictive capabilities of laminar flow rans des les sph and ale by performing numerical predictions of liquid sloshing in a tank the simulation results were compared to experimental measurements carried out in yan 2008 the present study focuses on the evaluation of rbf generated by the sloshing wave in lateral and vertical directions based on the analysis of numerical results the following conclusions can be made for resonant sloshing problems with breaking and impacting waves the flow fields are highly turbulent discontinuous and inhomogeneous both underprediction and overprediction of the rbf were observed in all the four solvers when a small amount of fluid separated from the main domain with high speed figs 11 to 14 when overprediction underprediction of rbf occurred there was no clear trend of change of the predicted rbf when time and mesh were refined in the majority of the simulation cases the maximum absolute rbf increased as mesh time was refined however there were also a few cases where maximum rbf decreased as a result of time and mesh refinement consequently there is no straightforward filtering method as proposed by liu et al 2017 that can be used to mitigate the sudden increases in rbf using impulse rather than maximum absolute rbf is proposed to be a more practical way to characterize the performance of a tank with and without baffle under fluid sloshing tables 3 and 5 under the same size of the mesh the ale method presents the best match with the experiment result compared to all the other solvers however the ale method also consumed significantly more computational resources due to its re meshing method tables 9 and 11 by balancing the model accuracy with the required computational resources sph model with murnaghan eos or ansys fluent with les turbulence model is proposed to be a better solution compared to the ale method to predict fluid slosh in a moving tank tables 9 and 11 in summary the sph model with murnaghan eos or ansys fluent with les turbulence model is recommended for predicting the rbf caused by fluid sloshing inside a moving tank while a parametric study is required for simulating the tank with different geometries or under various levels of acceleration time and mesh refinement is recommended to be implemented on a baseline model to determine the required element and time step size which can be implemented in the cases with similar tank size and acceleration level for any case with the simulated rbf increasing sharply in a short duration time a finer level of time mesh refinement is recommended to determine whether the maximum absolute rbf is overpredicted in general estimation of an impulse rather than maximum absolute rbf is proposed to be implemented to validate the performance of a tank under fluid sloshing credit

20435,the rigid body force rbf generated by fluid movement inside a partially filled tank is of great importance for many tank structures transporting liquid under dynamic conditions however accurate

disturbances the particular sort of the change in weight distribution onboard is liquid sloshing taking place in partly filled tanks moving masses need to be avoided on board though it is impossible to evade them at all the cargo securing procedures ensure a lack of loose cargo onboard but some free surfaces of liquids in ships tanks are inevitable as a result the time dependent rigid body force rbf and local surface fluid contact force lsfcf are generally measured experimentally or simulated numerically to help design engineers to deliver a reliable transport tank in general rbf is the resultant force of the sum of all internal lsfcf the accurate prediction of rbf significantly impacts the structural design of tank walls vessel securement points and the integration of physical features into the vessel on the other hand the reliable prediction of lsfcf helps to determine the structural design of local features inside the tank such as deciding the shape of anti fluid sloshing baffle and manways at present fluid sloshing motion can be modeled as laminar or turbulent while the fluid domain can be discretized by either the stationary mesh deformable mesh and particles due to the wide range of available turbulence models and discretization approaches it is essential for the presented study to identify the performance of various numerical methods for the simulation of liquid sloshing on the other hand the amplitude of the maximum absolute rbf is significantly impacted by the element size the number of particles and time step size this paper will also investigate the mesh and time size sensitivities of several numerical methods and the development of a viable method for evaluating fluid forces the development of analytical methods for the analysis of liquid sloshing is challenging due to its strong nonlinearity and discontinuity from the 1960s to the 2000s most of the numerical methods developed to solve liquid sloshing problems are mainly based on two approaches the lagrangian approach and the eulerian approach in the lagrangian approach the mesh is deformable and attaches tightly to the fluid material points which makes this methodology easy to predict the location of the fluid free surface however the loss in numerical accuracy is generally expected due to the requirement of adaptive re meshing algorithms the eulerian approach discretizes the full domain through a stationary mesh which makes this numerical approach naturally adopted for the study of turbulence flow however the identification of the fluid free surface using the eulerian method is not straightforward consequently a highly refined mesh is generally required to capture the location of the fluid by combining the lagrangian and the eulerian approach the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale formulation uses a moving mesh with a mesh velocity defined through the structure motion this approach has been more commonly used in the past two decades to replace traditional fe methods to simulate fluid structure interaction problems involving large structures such as sloshing in fuel tanks and bird strikes in aircraft over the past decade mesh free methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph method have been widely used in the field of fluid dynamics to study complex systems characterized by turbulence and multiphase flow this numerical methodology is widely used to address the difficulties encountered by grid based numerical methods in the study of physical systems that exhibit very large deformations such as liquid sloshing li et al 2018 and wave breaking under very high acceleration longshaw and rogers 2015 from the 2010s to the 2020s there are more comparison studies implementing ale and sph to simulate the fluid slosh problems fong 2011 simulated the yacht slamming problem through ale and sph method and concluded that the water splashing and slamming phenomenon is more severe and demonstrates more details in ale than in sph while the computational cost of sph is at least 25 lower than that of ale with similar element sizes brizzolara et al 2011 simulated the fluid movement inside a rectangular tank with two commercial rans solvers flow 3d and ls dyna and an in house sph model with the conclusion that the rans model predicted better results compared to the sph model while the author also argued that the lack of precise properties for water in the equation of state eos could be the main cause for this difference xu et al 2016 simulated the water slosh inside a rectangular tank via the ale and sph method and stated that the sph method may need the finer resolution to achieve accuracy comparable to the ale approach however sph simulation can be utilized by using finer particle spacing for applications where mesh based methods cannot be used for simulations that require remeshing due to high mesh distortion recently atif et al 2019 compared the sph method with the finite element absolute nodal coordinate formula ancf and concluded that sph formulation can capture the severe sloshing scenarios better compared to the ancf method there are other mesh free numerical approaches that have been developed recently to simulate sloshing problems in tanks boroomand et al 2016 used a 3d mesh free exponential basis functions ebfs method for simulating the fluid sloshing in rectangular and cylindrical tanks bazazzadeh et al 2018 applied the peri dynamic differential operator pddo approach to simulate incompressible inviscid fluid flow within 2d and 3d rectangular and square tanks this method has the potential to calculate the derivatives of the potential flow near the singular points such as the tip of the baffle with suitable accuracy on the other hand several authors observed the over prediction of maximum rbf in a moving tank in the past 20 years by using multiple fluid models and discretization methods for example the over prediction of maximum rbf was presented by using the laminar model kim 2001 hwang et al 2016 chen and xue 2018 kim et al 2018 the rans turbulence model hsiao and lin 2010 liu et al 2017 arora and vasudevan 2017 and in sph model brizzolara et al 2011 some authors reported that the over prediction of maximum rbf increase with the mesh refinement liu et al 2017 and the point average method was generally recommended to filter the overpredicted force recently liu et al 2016 compared maximum rbf in a moving rectangular tank with rans les and les turbulence model and concluded that under the same mesh level there were 2 overprediction by using the vles method while the laminar flow over predict the maximum rbf by 55 it is essential to identify the performance of laminar frequently used turbulence models ale and sph models for simulations of liquid sloshing within a wide range of the model selection in the present study based on the experiment carried out by yan 2008 the laminar flow model rans des les turbulence model ale method and sph approach are used to capture the motion of fluid slosh inside a sealed tank the present study demonstrates that turbulence effects mesh size and time step size can play a significant role and the prediction accuracy can depend crucially on the selected setting for simulating the sharp separation of sloshing flows furthermore the results observed from the sph method will be compared against more established cfd methods used in this works the sph approach is generally suited for simulating flow scenarios with the flow with large movements and separations however the current study proves that when a small amount of fluid is separated from the main domain with high velocity all four solvers including the sph solver fails to correctly predict the rbf and an error up to 200 may occur depending on the selected mesh and time step size without experimental data it is difficult to calibrate such rbf curves in traditional transport tank designs the maximum rbf is normally used as the key computational characteristic to validate the design of the baffled and unbaffled tank within the baffled tank the fluid becomes turbulent and the fluid separation will occur more frequently compared to the unbaffled tank which results in the possibility to overpredict the rbf and may lead to an incorrect design of the baffle geometry since the force peak generally occurs during a small duration of time impulse rather than maximum rbf is recommended by the author as the main computational characteristic to judge the performance of the partially filled tank with and without baffle under fluid sloshing 2 mathematical methodology the equations in sections 2 1 to 2 2 are taken from ansys theory guide ansys inc 2020 while the equations in sections 2 3 to 2 4 are from the ls dyna keyword manual livermore software technology lstc 2020 and ls dyna theory manual livermore software technology lstc 2019 2 1 laminar flow model in ansys fluent the motion of the incompressible fluid inside a moving tank is governed by the continuity equation 1 ρ t u i x i 0 and the momentum equation 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i τ i j x j s m while τ is the stress tensor and u ρ t p ν τ i j and s m are the velocity component the fluid density time pressure component fluid viscosity stress tensor and source term respectively 2 2 turbulence model and volume of fluid method vof three typical turbulence models including the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model the large eddy simulation model les and the detached eddy simulation model des are used in the present study the reynolds averaged fitted navier stokes equation is expressed as 3 ρ t u i x i 0 4 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i ρ ν u i x j u j x i τ i j x j s m in the rans model u and p denotes the time averaged components whereas in les it defines the resolved scales τ is the turbulence stress tensor which arises as a result of the time averaging rans or spatial fileting les procedure and it is used to minimize the momentum transport due to turbulence motion in the des approach the unsteady rans models are employed in the boundary layer while the les wale treatment is applied in the core turbulent region where large unsteady turbulence scales play a dominant role the interested reader can refer to chapter 4 3 4 12 and 4 15 of ansys theory guide ansys inc 2020 for further details the vof model is a surface tracking technique for locating the interface between two or more immiscible fluid in ansys fluent and icfd in ls dyna it belongs to the class of eulerian methods which are characterized by a mesh that is stationary in a certain prescribed manner to accommodate the evolving shape of the interface the momentum and mass conservation equations are discretized using finite volume technique considering each cell as a control volume the interested reader can refer to chapter 18 of ansys theory guide ansys inc 2020 for further details 2 3 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method in ls dyna the sph method is based on the lagrangian formulation with the intention of avoiding mesh restrictions when large deformations appear within the finite element method the main difference between the standard methods and the sph methods is the absence of the mesh the momentum equation is sph can be written as 5 d v i d t j m j σ i ρ i 2 σ j ρ j 2 π i j w i j at particle i σ i is the stress tensor in voigt notation v i is the velocity tensor and w i j is the gradient of kernel function associated with particle j evaluated at particle i π i j is the artificial viscosity and was normally set by keyword control bulk viscosity or hourglass card in ls dyna to enforce the quasi incompressibility of the water three equation of state eos has been implemented in the paper the linear polynomial eos is expressed as 6 p c 0 c 1 μ c 2 μ 2 c 3 μ 3 c 4 c 5 μ c 6 μ 2 e where p is the fluid pressure and e is the internal energy and c 1 to c 6 are the user defined polynomials constant the gruneisen eos is defined as 7 p ρ c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 3 μ 1 2 γ 0 a μ e where c is the intercept of the particle velocity curve s 1 to s 6 are the user defined coefficient of the slope of the particle velocity curve γ 0 is the gruneisen gamma and a is the first order volume correction to γ 0 finally the murnaghan eos was solely designed to model incompressible fluid flow with sph or ale elements and the pressure is represented as 8 p k 0 ρ ρ 0 γ 1 to model the fluid flow accurately γ is often set to 7 and k 0 is chosen such that 9 c 0 γ k 0 ρ 0 10 v m a x where v m a x is the maximum expected fluid flow velocity 2 4 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method in ls dyna the ale method in ls dyna combines lagrangian and eulerian approaches the fluid domain is modeled using a lagrangian mesh and can partially deform whereas the solid domain in eulerian formulation flows through the fluid mesh the moved nodes liquid domain in the ale formulation are calculated according to the average distance to the neighboring nodes the velocity of an incompressible viscous fluid in a domain is characterized by the mass and momentum conservation law as 10 u i j 0 11 u i t u j u j m u i j 1 ρ τ i j s m 0 where u is the velocity component ρ is the fluid density τ i j is the stress tensor and s m is the source term u j m represents the velocity of the mesh if u j m 0 the eulerian formulation is obtained because the convective velocity of mesh is null if u j m u j the lagrangian formulation is obtained the quantity of u j u j m is the relative velocity 2 5 derivation of rbf on the full tank the resultant rigid body forces component are computed from the distributed pressure on the wall the integration over the wetted area of the wall cells are calculated from the following equation 12 f i 0 w e t t e d p i a i where f i is the rbf component acting on the tank a i is the effective area component of the tank walls p i is the fluid pressure component at the center of the cell and the wetted defines the regions of tank wall with fluid contact 3 model geometry and boundary conditions 3 1 experiment setup of the benchmark an experiment was carried out by yan in 2008 yan 2008 where a 1 85 m long tank fig 1a was fixed on an aluminum plate and mounted on a horizontal shaker table through three axis force dynamometers to measure the dynamic forces developed along lateral y and vertical z directions the tank was 30 filled with 0 21 m 3 water with filling height equals 0 159 m the model tank was designed with sufficiently large dimensions to reduce the effects of boundary constraints on the fluid slosh the total length and cross section area of the test tank were 1 85 m and 0 426 m2 respectively the tank was made of 12 7 mm thick transparent plexiglass material to facilitate flow visualization three dynamometers d 1 to d 3 were installed in a triangular setup to measure transient rbf due to fluid motion data acquisition rate was set at 256 hz for the experiment a single cycle sinusoidal acceleration was synthesized to study the transient lateral slosh behavior using the following piecewise functions 13 a c c e l e r a t i o n 0 5 a 1 c o s 4 π f t t 0 25 t a s i n 2 π f t 0 25 t 0 0 75 t 0 5 a 1 c o s 4 π f t 0 75 t 0 t 0 t t where t 2 3 s is the period f 1 5 hz is the frequency and a 4 34 m s 2 is the acceleration amplitude the acceleration amplitudes and frequencies are selected to limit the peak displacement of the tank assembly within the stroke of the actuator the transient acceleration is plotted in fig 2 3 2 details of mesh as shown in fig 3 two sets of mesh sizes h 40 mm to h 20 mm were implemented in ls dyna ale three sets mesh sizes h 40 mm to h 10 mm were implemented in ansys fluent and four sets h 40 mm to h 5 mm of mesh were used in ls dyna icfd a structured mesh was generated in ls dyna while the sph particles were created at the element node as shown in fig 4 consequently the number of sph elements raised with the reduction of element size of the structured mesh the detailed total element and particle numbers were shown in table 1 the variation of the selected smallest mesh size in different solvers are dependent on the required calculation time as discussed in section 4 4 3 3 boundary conditions two different approaches were suggested by arora and vasudevan 2017 to apply the acceleration on the fluid domain 1 in ansys fluent only the liquid domain was modeled the non slip boundary conditions were implemented on all the external walls while the sinusoidal acceleration shown in fig 2 was provided as a momentum source term in addition to this applied acceleration gravitational acceleration was also present 2 in ls dyna icfd ale and sph the tank geometry was modeled as a shell and the acceleration is applied as a rigid body motion on the tank shell elements in addition three water eos were tested in the sph and ale models in ls dyna to present the relationship between pressure and density details of the coefficients for these eos are presented in table 2 4 numerical results 4 1 velocity contour and overprediction on rbf prior to commencing the discussion on mesh and time refinement and various turbulence models it is pertinent to present liquid movement inside the tank within the first 1 5 s the velocity contour and the transient rbf on the lateral direction between 0 5 s and 2 s when using the sph method in ls dyna are presented in fig 5 from fig 5a the transient rbf matched well with the experimental data from 0 s to 1 s and divergence occurred when the fluid hits the right wall and created the first wave shown in fig 5c the fluid then moved with high velocity to the left side wall between 1 s to 1 32 s fig 5d and at 1 34 s the fluid impacted the left tank wall with a small amount of liquid separated from the main domain with high positive velocity fig 5e the kinetic energy was transformed to force on the tank and created the highest divergence of the simulated rbf the complete process occurred within 0 02 s and the sph solver failed to predict the resultant force accurately at that particular point demonstrating an error of 32 4 in comparison to the experimental result this force overprediction is observed in various time step sizes mesh sizes and turbulence models presented in this paper 4 2 time refinement adaptive time stepping method was implemented in all four solvers the automatic determination of the time step size is based on the estimation of the truncation error associated with the time integration scheme if the truncation error is smaller than a specified tolerance the size of the time step is increased if the truncation error is greater the time step size is decreased in all four solvers d t standards for the maximum allowed time step size and the minimum allowed time step size is set to 0 01 d t all four solvers were initiated with the maximum allowed time step size that can maintain stability of the solving process therefore the same d t could not be used in all the solvers as discussed in section 4 3 the icfd solver presented slower convergence in space compared to the other three solvers ideally h 10 mm mesh was supposed to be used in all four solvers to perform the time refinement study however due to the high computational cost required by the ale fluent and sph solver it is unrealistic to run a time refinement study on these three solvers under h 10 mm mesh consequently the mesh in each solver was refined up to the limitation of the pc finally h 20 mm mesh was chosen in ansys fluent and ls dyna sph solver h 10 mm mesh was chosen in icfd in ls dyna and h 40 mm mesh was chosen in the ale model in ls dyna for the later time refinement study the laminar model was implemented in ansys fluent and the default multi scale turbulence model was used in ls dyna eos of murnaghan was selected in ls dyna sph and ale model the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment result and the simulation results in all four solvers are presented in figs 6 a and 7 a respectively the percentage of overprediction of the maximum absolute lateral rbf is shown in table 3 the icfd and ale models presented an underprediction of the maximum absolute lateral rbf between 1 3 s and 1 5 s while both ansys fluent and ls dyna sph models overpredicted the maximum absolute l lateral rbf expect the maximum absolute rbf between 1 3 s and 1 5 s time convergence was observed in all four solvers in both lateral and vertical force vectors the overpredicted rbf varies as the time is refined while there is limited shape change been observed to understand the physics to cause the instability d t 2 0 e 3 s and d t 1 0 e 3 s in ansys fluent were selected the absolute maximum rbf occurred at 1 34 s for both cases the lateral velocity contour for both cases at t 1 33 s t 1 34 s and t 1 35 s are presented in fig 8 similar to the trend observed in sph solver in section 4 1 the fluid hit the left wall of the tank and started to sharply separate between 1 33 s to 1 35 s which was the time the fluent solver struggled to convergence during time refinement fluid separated at a similar time with the refinement of time step size reflecting on the transient rbf the value of the peak lateral rbf dramatically changed between 1 3 s to 1 5 s while the shape of the curve maintained the same since the unconvergence normally occurs at a small duration of time the alternative approach is to use impulse rather than peak force to compare the time averaging change among different configurations the impulse is calculated from the following equations 14 i m p o t f d t where t is the end time and t is the fluid time and f is the rgb in the longitudinal direction compared to the experiment result the percentage of overprediction of the impulse of rbf of time refinement results of all four solvers is shown in table 4 compared to the absolute maximum rbf as shown in table 3 the impulse of the rbf presented a better convergence trend fluent solver presented the best matching with the experiment data and less than 0 5 is observed in impulse from the presented figures and table the maximum absolute rbf was not converged in time within all four solvers while impulse presented a much better convergence trend the divergence of the rbf curve mainly occurred between 1 3 s to 1 5 s and the rest of the curve convergenced well with time refinement since further time refinement will significantly increase the physical calculation time the time step size for each model is selected as 1 ansys fluent d t 1 0 e 3 s 2 ls dyna icfd d t 5 0 e 3 s 3 ls dyna sph d t 1 75 e 2 s 4 ls dyna ale d t 4 5 e 6 s 4 3 mesh refinement with the selected time step size as discussed in section 4 2 the mesh refinement h refinement study is presented in this section three sets of mesh were used in the ansys fluent and ls dyna sph solvers four sets of mesh were used in the ls dyna icfd model and two sets of mesh were used in ls dyna ale model the details of different mesh sets are summarized in section 3 2 the mesh in ale model cannot be refined further due to the unfeasible computational cost comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment result and the simulation results in all three solvers are presented in figs 9 a and 10 a the percentage of overprediction of the lateral maximum absolute rbf and impulse is shown in table 5 the major divergence of rbf curve occurred between 1 3 s and 1 5 s in general the overpredicted maximum rbf increased as the mesh was refined except the h 20 mm to h 10 mm case when using the sph method different from the time refinement results the shape of the rbf curve significantly changed with refined mesh in all four solvers to investigate the root cause of such shape change the velocity contour plot near the time step while peak rbf occurred in ls dyna sph fluent icfd and ale solver under various mesh sizes are presented from figs 11 to 14 respectively for the sph solver as presented in fig 11b h 40 mm particles were too coarse to detect sharp wave separation consequently the transient rbf curve in the h 40 mm case was much smoother than the curve in the h 10 mm case a similar trend could be observed in ansys fluent and ls dyna icfd and ale solver another key observation was for the fluent solver even 20 mm mesh presented less than 0 5 of error in impulse further decreased the mesh to 10 mm increased the error impulse to 2 17 the corresponding error in rbf increased from 46 40 to 181 90 this trend clearly indicated that space was not convergent on predicting the sharp fluid separation in general compared to the time refinement mesh size refinement was more sensitive to capture the rbf during the wave separation between 1 3 s to 1 5 s furthermore finer mesh did not have a direct link to more accurate results on rbf for both impulse and maximum rbf the convergence trend could not be observed in both space and time for all four solvers while impulse presented a significantly better performance on convergence in comparison to the maximum absolute rbf consequently impulse rather than maximum absolute rbf is recommended by authors to judge the performance of the tank under acceleration finally the icfd model presented slower convergence in mesh compared to the other three solvers further refining the mesh in icfd solver increased the run time by a factor of 30 thus further refinement was not performed since the h 20 mm in fluent presented less than 0 5 error compared to the experimental result to maintain similar calculation times among all chosen solvers the mesh size for the latter study was fixed as 1 ansys fluent h 20 mm 2 ls dyna icfd h 10 mm 3 ls dyna sph h 20 mm 4 ls dyna ale h 20 mm 4 4 turbulence model and eos laminar flow rans des and les turbulence models were investigated in ansys fluent comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment results under various turbulence models are presented in fig 15 h 20 mm mesh was used in all simulations and the time step size was selected to be d t 1 0 e 3 s the percentage of overprediction of the impulse is shown in table 6 the laminar flow and the les model provided the best correlation to the experimental results however when comparing with the further mesh refinement results on the laminar flow and les model in fig 16 the laminar flow model overpredicted the maximum absolute rbf significantly more than the les model when mesh size was refined to 10 mm consequently the les wale model is proposed as the best turbulence model to simulate the fluid sloshing in ansys fluent the rans des and les turbulence models were also compared in ls dyna icfd the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment result under various turbulence models are presented in fig 17 the percentage of overprediction of the impulse is shown in table 7 h 10 mm mesh was used in all dimensions and the time step size was selected to be d t 5 0 e 3 s although there were slight over predictions of maximum absolute rbf the les turbulence model matched with the experimental observations better than the results obtained from rans and des turbulence models consequently les turbulence model is proposed as the best turbulence model to model the fluid slosh in icfd the gruneisen murnaghan and linear polynomial eos of water were compared in the ls dyna sph method the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experimental result under various eos are presented in fig 18 the particles were converted from h 20 mm mesh and time step size was selected as d t 1 75 e 2 s all three eos methods demonstrated a good correlation to the experimental measurements similarly trend could be observed from the impulse is shown in table 8 however from table 9 the calculation time required by the murnaghan eos was significantly lower compared to the gruneisen and linear polynomial eos consequently murnaghan eos is proposed as the best equation of state to model the fluid slosh in the sph model in ls dyna similar to the sph model the gruneisen murnaghan linear polynomial eos of water were compared in the ls dyna ale method the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between experiment results under various eos are presented in fig 19 h 20 mm mesh was implemented and time step size is selected as d t 4 5 e 6 s the percentage of overprediction of the impulse is shown in table 10 the murnaghan eos demonstrated marginally better results compared to all the other two methods with significantly less computational time table 9 consequently the murnaghan eos is proposed as the best equation of state to model the fluid slosh in the ale model in ls dyna by fixing the mesh size to be h 20 mm the comparison of the lateral and vertical rbf between the experiment result among ansys fluent les wale icfd les wale sph murnaghan and ale murnaghan are shown in fig 20 due to the slower mesh convergence in the icfd model the mesh size in the icfd was fixed to h 10 mm the required calculation time for the cases as shown in fig 20 are presented in table 9 simulations were performed using a desktop pc with a 3 0 ghz cpu and 16 gb ram by ignoring the maximum absolute rbf between 1 3 s and 1 5 s time stamp the percentage of overprediction of the impulse is shown in table 11 the ale model in ls dyna presented the best prediction compared to the experiment result out of all four solvers however the ale model also consumed 400 to 500 more computational time compared to other solvers by balancing the model accuracy with the required computational resources sph model with murnaghan eos or ansys fluent with les turbulence model is proposed to be a more viable option compared to the ale method for engineers to predict fluid slosh of a dynamic fluid body such as inside a moving tank 5 conclusion there is a wide range of available turbulence models and numerical modeling methods to simulate fluid sloshing this study investigated and compared the predictive capabilities of laminar flow rans des les sph and ale by performing numerical predictions of liquid sloshing in a tank the simulation results were compared to experimental measurements carried out in yan 2008 the present study focuses on the evaluation of rbf generated by the sloshing wave in lateral and vertical directions based on the analysis of numerical results the following conclusions can be made for resonant sloshing problems with breaking and impacting waves the flow fields are highly turbulent discontinuous and inhomogeneous both underprediction and overprediction of the rbf were observed in all the four solvers when a small amount of fluid separated from the main domain with high speed figs 11 to 14 when overprediction underprediction of rbf occurred there was no clear trend of change of the predicted rbf when time and mesh were refined in the majority of the simulation cases the maximum absolute rbf increased as mesh time was refined however there were also a few cases where maximum rbf decreased as a result of time and mesh refinement consequently there is no straightforward filtering method as proposed by liu et al 2017 that can be used to mitigate the sudden increases in rbf using impulse rather than maximum absolute rbf is proposed to be a more practical way to characterize the performance of a tank with and without baffle under fluid sloshing tables 3 and 5 under the same size of the mesh the ale method presents the best match with the experiment result compared to all the other solvers however the ale method also consumed significantly more computational resources due to its re meshing method tables 9 and 11 by balancing the model accuracy with the required computational resources sph model with murnaghan eos or ansys fluent with les turbulence model is proposed to be a better solution compared to the ale method to predict fluid slosh in a moving tank tables 9 and 11 in summary the sph model with murnaghan eos or ansys fluent with les turbulence model is recommended for predicting the rbf caused by fluid sloshing inside a moving tank while a parametric study is required for simulating the tank with different geometries or under various levels of acceleration time and mesh refinement is recommended to be implemented on a baseline model to determine the required element and time step size which can be implemented in the cases with similar tank size and acceleration level for any case with the simulated rbf increasing sharply in a short duration time a finer level of time mesh refinement is recommended to determine whether the maximum absolute rbf is overpredicted in general estimation of an impulse rather than maximum absolute rbf is proposed to be implemented to validate the performance of a tank under fluid sloshing credit

20436,a circulating water channel cwc generates a stable flow field for prolonged experiments the main challenge in common cwc design lies in how to achieve the flow field uniformity and the free surface flatness in the test section in this paper a thorough investigation on the hydrodynamic performance of the cwc is reported using numerical methods with test validations flow rate measurement and steady wave measurement are conducted in the cwc a numerical cwc based on the rans method is established to simulate the flow field and the free surface the moving reference frame mrf method and the volume of fluid vof method are applied to simulate the impeller rotation and capture the free surface respectively the accuracy of the numerical results is verified by comparing them with the experimental data according to the numerical results the numerical cwc reproduces the same high quality flow field as the physical one the relationship between the impeller rotation and the incoming flow velocity in the observation section is established as for surface flow characteristics the wavelength of steady waves varies with the incoming flow velocity while the steady wave height can be significantly reduced by slightly adjusting the water level in the test section the rotor type surface flow accelerator obviously improves the surface flow velocity moreover the detailed flow field inside the numerical cwc is extracted to show the effect of each rectifying section honeycombs strongly straighten swirling flows with the result that the flow uniformity downstream of the porous plate is significantly improved in addition without a honeycomb downstream of the diffusion section the residual rectifying section is sufficient for the test section to obtain a high quality flow

water channel cwc occupies smaller space but produces a stable flow field used for measurement and observation for a long period of time with these advantages cwcs are widely utilized in ocean engineering feng et al 2020 bai et al 2017 however the performance of cwcs is still influenced by hydrodynamic problems among which velocity non uniformity and steady waves are two critical ones therefore assessments of them are crucial during cwc design uniformity of velocity distribution in the test section is a basic requirement therefore researches have been carried out to improve it ogura et al 1974 developed a twin impeller driven cwc its twin impellers produced more stable flow at the exit of the diffusers than a single impeller besides the rectifying section including punched metal and honeycomb were also adjusted moreover a rotor type surface flow accelerator was arranged in a water filled casing compensating the surface flow velocity more adequately the velocity deflection in the test section was reduced to 2 based on these enhancements steady waves which have almost constant troughs and crests are generated on a free surface due to the pressure jump between a close region and an open region they cause test error in experiments influenced by free surfaces such as ship resistance measurement takahei et al 1975 in the test section of which both theoretical and experimental methods were applied to reduce steady waves himeno et al 1974 discussed the relationship between the steady waves and the form of the suppressing plate the experimental pressure distribution on the suppressing plate was almost identical to the calculated result from the hydroplane theory however the relationship between the steady wave height and the suppressing plate was not in good agreement with the theoretical value kawashima 1993 conducted systematical experiments to study the steady wave height under different water levels and suppressing plate angles it was concluded that a tiny change of the water level or the suppressing plate angle strongly affects the steady wave height and that at a constant incoming flow velocity there exists an optimal combination of the water level and the plate angle that minimizes the steady wave height although the technical equipment has been developed in recent decades the mechanism of cwcs has not been discussed thoroughly with the development of computers cfd provides detailed visualization of flow fields to reveal the mechanism and optimize the design chen et al 2006 simulated a series of hydrodynamic problems of a cwc in the simulations on water flow produced by a surface flow accelerator the numerical results of the velocity distribution agreed with the experimental results the optimized design on the number and the configuration of the guide vanes in no 4 corner was obtained besides the vof method was also employed to explore the relationship between the formation of bubbles and the configuration of the rear of the test section moreover simulations on the whole domain of the cwc without punched metal showed the effect of swirling flow on non uniformity of field flow in the test section hence it is necessary to simulate the cwc including a sufficiently functioning rectifying section li et al 2012 applied cfd to wind tunnel and cwc design the quality of flow fields in a wind tunnel with and without a partition plate was compared the partition plate in the diffuser effectively reduced flow separation and improved the quality of the flow field in the test section the effect of cwc installation inclination on the free surface was also assessed the results showed that wave surges and bubbles appeared at 1 and did not appear at a smaller inclination on a solid foundation to further save time and costs jiang and chen 2020 developed a cwc design program based on simulations of various rectifying sections the program assembled 3d parametric modeling grid auto generation viscous flow field solution and cfd post processing the cwc numerical model established by the program was validated by measured data to show the reliability of the program all of the aforementioned work about cfd methods has proven the feasibility of simulations on a cwc to the best of our knowledge simulations on a whole circuit of a cwc with a free surface are rarely reported indeed rectification mechanisms and steady wave elimination are also necessary for the design of a cwc with homogenous flow and a flat surface therefore the main purpose of this study is to assess comprehensive cwc hydrodynamic problems including velocity distribution and steady waves via experimental and numerical methods simulations on the whole cwc in shanghai jiao tong university sjtu are performed in this paper the outline of this paper is as follows section 2 introduces the objective cwc and tests of cwc performances including measurement of flow rates and steady waves section 3 describes the details of the numerical methods including the cfd solver the computational domain the boundary conditions the mesh generation technique and the grid convergence study in section 4 the numerical results are presented and discussed first the numerical results are validated by comparison with the test data then the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cwc are divided into main flow and surface flow ones the main flow characteristics include velocity uniformity and turbulence intensity in the observation section the surface flow characteristics include steady waves and the flow field influenced by the surface flow accelerator moreover detailed flow patterns inside the cwc are displayed to show the effect of rectifying sections key results of this study are summarized in section 5 2 cwc performance tests 2 1 test object the cwc in sjtu which is shown in fig 1 is selected as the study object it has a total length of 26 7 m and a height of 8 2 m and is sited in a two story building the test section is 8000 mm long and 3000 mm wide and has a water depth of 1600 mm the middle part of the test section which is 7200 mm long and glassed in the bottom and sides is called the observation section in the paper the dimensions of the test section are detailed in table 1 the circuit consists of a set of impellers a diffuser corners with guide vanes punched metal honeycombs a contraction nozzle and the test section flow velocity in the test section is adjusted by controlling impeller rotation speed after flowing through the set of impellers water flows into the diffuser and its velocity becomes slow to reduce energy loss then with rectification by the corners with guide vanes the punched metal the honeycombs and the nozzle the flow becomes uniform in the test section some of the important devices used to enhance performances of the cwc are shown in fig 2 due to the boundary layer effect velocity deficit happens near the water surface a rotor type surface flow accelerator shown in fig 2 a compensates the surface flow rate thus further improving the uniformity of the velocity in the observation section in fig 2 b a water level control system consisting of two water tanks that are controlled in height is connected with the cwc by modification of the height of the water tanks the water level in the test section can be adjusted to reduce the steady wave height in fig 2 c bubble removal equipment is installed above no 1 corner to absorb the bubbles 2 2 flow rate measurement test a flow rate measurement test is carried out to calibrate the velocity uniformity in the observation section the relationship between the impeller rotation speed and the flow rate is also established fig 3 presents the schematic diagram of the experimental arrangements and the definition of the coordinate system the origin is located at the midpoint of the underside of the suppressing plate the positive directions of x y z axes are illustrated in fig 3 in this test the flow velocities at a sampling point 1800 0 110 under different impeller rotation speeds are measured to represent the main flow velocity u moreover the velocity distribution on the measuring cross section l ob 4 downstream from the suppressing plate at u 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m s is measured sampling points of the local velocity u are shown in fig 4 most of the sampling points are spaced 200 mm apart in the width direction and 100 mm apart in the depth direction the sampling points are slightly denser on both sides and near the water surface the measurement devices are shown in fig 5 the flow velocity measurement equipment consists of a pressure gauge and a pitot tube in order to avoid error from different equipment the same equipment is employed for all the sampling points therefore a motion control mechanism is applied to move the pitot tube 2 3 steady wave measurement test a steady wave measurement test is conducted to obtain the steady wave profile along the center line of the observation section fig 6 presents the schematic diagram of the experimental arrangements on the center line section the incoming flow velocity u in the observation section is 2 0 m s the initial water level z i is 1 6 mm above the underside of the suppressing plate before the test note that the z axis points up in this measurement after the flow velocity in the test section is stable the wave profile along the center line is measured by the same wave gauge to exclude the influence of surface oscillation the average water level at a sampling point over a period of 60 s is taken as the water level at this location results of the above experiments are detailed in section 4 3 numerical simulation 3 1 numerical method and computational domain the commercial cfd code fluent is employed for numerical simulations the three dimensional incompressible viscous flow field is solved based on the steady continuity equations and the rans equations the shear stress transport k ω sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 is utilized to close the set of equations the standard wall function launder and spalding 1974 is used to satisfy the physics of the flow in the region near the wall the second order upwind scheme is applied for convective discretization simulations are carried out by the steady volume of fluid method vof hirt and nichols 1981 for the smooth free surface in the computation in order to accelerate the convergence the coupling method is employed for the velocity pressure coupling the numerical computational domain and the boundary conditions are depicted in fig 7 the dimensions of the numerical model are the same as those of the sjtu cwc the half cwc model is constructed for simulations and the mid longitudinal section is treated as a symmetry boundary the surfaces of the honeycombs and the guide vanes are set to zero thickness to reduce the total number of elements the two sets of punched metal are simplified as a porous jump model note that the pressure loss coefficient of the porous jump model is set to be 1 7 in case the water level should rise due to bubbles an extra computational domain is added over the first corner for degassing pressure outlet boundary conditions are set at the top of the test section and the degassing tube numerical simulations on the main flow the steady waves and the surface flow are carried out in this paper simulations on the main flow characteristics are performed in impeller rotation speed n i to establish the relationship between u p and n i based on the relationship the value of n i can be estimated by a desired incoming flow velocity in further simulations then the surface flow field characteristics are analyzed under a typical flow rate u 2 0 m s one characteristic is the steady waves based on different initial water levels the other is the enhancement of the free surface accelerator on the surface flow field under a suitable initial water level based on steady wave simulations finally with the exception of the honeycomb downstream of the diffuser the circuit is simulated to analyze the effect of the rectifying section on flow 3 2 mesh generation and grid convergence study the whole cwc numerical model is shown in detail in fig 8 the entity of the mesh is composed by a static domain and a rotation domain the former is further divided into a main domain and a stator domain and the latter into a impeller domain and a rotor domain polyhedral mesh is constructed in the impeller domain the residual mesh is constructed by structured mesh to ensure computational efficiency the information of the mesh is listed in table 2 joint faces between each region of the mesh are set to interfaces for data exchanging in fig 8 a a finer mesh is generated in the vicinity of the water surface and around the surface flow accelerator to capture the steady waves and the surface flow field more accurately a mesh transition method shown in fig 8 d is applied to connect the upstream and downstream of the honeycombs the numerical model predictions are considerably influenced by mesh density therefore the grid convergence study is conducted under impeller rotation speed n i 260 rpm rotor rotation speed n r 770 rpm and initial water level z i 1 6 mm three sets of grids are generated based on different mesh sizes the number of different grids increases by almost 2 times the total elements and numerical results for different grids are listed in table 3 an uncertainty analysis based on the verification and validation methodology ittc 1999 is conducted the verification and validation results are shown in table 4 and table 5 respectively solution changes ε for medium fine and coarse medium solutions and the convergence ratio r g are defined by 1 ε 21 s g 2 s g 1 ε 32 s g 3 s g 2 r g ε 21 ε 32 the solution convergences monotonically with grid number since the convergence ratio r g is between 0 and 1 for the correction factor c g is sufficiently greater than 1 and lacking confidence the grid uncertainty u g is estimated as follow 2 u g c g δ r e 1 c g δ r e hence the ratio between u g and the main flow velocity s g1 based on grid 1 is about 1 5 the level of verification is below 2 as for the validation procedure the test data uncertainty u d is about 1 3 d feng et al 2018 then the validation uncertainty u v and the comparison error e are estimated as follow 3 u v u s n 2 u d 2 4 e d s g 1 hence e is less than u v in summary the simulation results are verified and validated besides the numerical results based on different sets of grids are illustrated in fig 9 the numerical accuracy of the finest mesh is not significantly enhanced compared to that of the medium one overall the medium mesh is optimal for simulations and the total element of the mesh is 7 26 106 4 results and discussions 4 1 accuracy validation of cfd simulations in this section numerical calculation accuracy is validated by the comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data the sampling point velocity comparison is shown in fig 10 since the sampling point velocity is slightly lower than previously planned the impeller rotation speed is slightly improved before the simulations it can be seen that the calculated values of the sampling point velocity at high impeller rotate speed are slightly larger than the experimental values the calculated fitting line coincides considerably with the test data based on the calculated fitting line the accurate value of n i can be estimated by the main flow velocity u before simulation in order to compare u p at the same impeller rotation speed the interpolated value based on the calculated fitting line is obtained and compared with test data the comparison is shown in table 6 the mean relative error of u p is 2 84 and the maximum error is 3 78 as u p increases the numerical value tends to the test value overall the numerical results of the inflow velocity are consistent with the test results in this study the coefficient of variation of velocity represents the velocity uniformity on a cross section the smaller the value the higher the flow field uniformity the coefficient of variation of velocity is defined as follows 5 c v s u 100 6 s 1 n 1 j 1 n u j u 2 where s is the sample standard deviation u j is the local velocity at the jth sampling point u is the mean velocity of all the sampling points and n is the amount of sampling points table 7 shows the velocity non uniformity on the sampling faces the size of the sampling faces is consistent with that of the test sampling face excluding the influence of the boundary layer both numerical and test results show low non uniformity on the sampling cross section the velocity distributions on the sampling face are shown in fig 11 in the test results the local velocity near z 800 mm is relatively low due to a horizontal partition plate upstream of the test section the assembling difference at the two sides of the horizontal partition plate leads to the asymmetry along the y axis at different flow velocities the numerical results of the velocity distribution on the sampling section show similarity with the experimental results regardless of the assembly difference in the physical cwc the numerical results are almost consistent with the test results the simulation under u 2 m s and z i 1 6 mm is calculated to validate the steady wave height with the test result under the same conditions the definition of the steady wave height h w is as follows 7 h w z max z min where z max and z min are the highest and the lowest water levels along the measurement range respectively the iso surface when vof 0 5 is extracted as the water surface fig 12 shows the computed water surface the accumulation of water under the ceiling causes the water level to drop steady waves near the wall are smaller than those at y 0 mm due to the influence of the wall the wave profile from x 0 mm to x 6500 mm at y 0 mm is extracted for further analysis of steady waves in the paper the comparison of the wave profiles between the numerical and the test results is shown in fig 13 the numerical results show similar wave height along the whole sampling range it also reflects that the wave profile is slightly smaller than the test results at the beginning of the observation section moreover the calculated wave profile is smoother than the experimental wave profile overall the numerical results of the steady wave height are basically consistent with the test results in summary the numerical results of u p are sufficiently accurate the numerical results of the steady wave height are basically consistent with the test results at the preset water level as a result cfd simulations are employed in the following studies 4 2 main flow characteristics for a cwc one of the most basic characteristics is the velocity uniformity in the test section therefore the main flow characteristics in the test section are studied in order to exclude the influence of the boundary layer each cross section is excised at the margin all of the cross sections have the same width and depth as the sampling face in the test fig 5 in general the velocity distribution along the observation section is uniform as shown in fig 14 a in fig 14 b under the same velocity the velocity distribution on the last cross section is a little worse than those on other cross sections but still maintains the uniformity fig 16 shows the turbulence intensity i along the observation section whose average value is 1 0 1 1 at different velocities the turbulence intensity of the same type of cwc was measured to be about 1 0 2 0 ogura 1985 the value of i tends to be high when the main flow velocity is low in fig 16 the turbulence intensity abruptly tends to be large near the wall and the free surface the phenomenon is also consistent with the measured results of the same type of cwc in figs 15 and 16 the velocity and the turbulence intensity distributions are basically similar along the observation section at a constant flow velocity hence it is also reasonable to choose a representative cross section to analyze flow characteristics in the whole observation section the downstream partition plate and extended boundary layer result in slight velocity deficit in the rear of the observation section based on the above analysis the calibration of the velocity distribution along the observation section proves the flow uniformity in the whole observation section the turbulence intensity obtained by simulations reflects a similar tendency with that obtained by previous tests regardless of the slightly higher value in the rear of the test section the numerical results of the velocity non uniformity along the test section maintain well therefore the single sampling face at x 1800 mm is chosen for the following analysis when it comes to the velocity distribution in the observation section 4 3 surface flow characteristics this section focuses on the steady waves and the velocity distributions near the surface flow since the surface velocity distribution is strongly affected by surface flatness a relatively smooth surface needs to be produced before the distribution is analyzed simulations on the water surface reflect the relationship between the wavelength of the steady waves and the incoming flow velocity fig 17 shows the variation of the wavelength λ of the steady waves under different main flow velocities u according to the dispersion relation the deep water wavelength is estimated by the following formula 8 λ e q u 2 π u 2 g where g denotes the gravitational acceleration and is taken as 9 81 m s2 the numerical results of the wavelength λ of the steady waves are consistent with the values obtained by the dispersion relation equation this relationship agrees with a previous experiment with steady waves tamashima 1983 based on the numerical results the wavelength of the steady waves is decided by the incoming flow velocity with the adjustment of the water level in the observation section the steady wave height can be reduced in the physical cwc in order to obtain an optimal water level simulations on the steady waves under different initial wave levels are performed fig 18 shows the waveforms of the steady waves under different initial water levels z i steady wave heights at the ends are higher than those in the middle of the observation section the wavelength and the height of each waveform of steady waves are extracted in table 8 a slight modification of the water level significantly affects the steady wave height but has no effect on the wavelength of the steady waves fig 19 a shows the linear relationship between the terminal mean water level and the initial water level due to the accumulation of water under the ceiling the value of z mean is lower than that of z i but the plot still indicates that a basically accurate water level can be obtained by setting different initial water levels in the simulation hence the relationship between z mean and z i is established in practice the suppressing plate is efficient to flat the steady waves when the terminal water level is aligned with the height of the steady waves in this situation the value of z i calculated by the fitting curve is about 1 00 mm fig 19 b shows the relationship fit by a parabola between the steady wave height h w and the initial water level z i it is difficult to eliminate the steady waves completely however the trend of the steady wave height is obtained based on the results when the terminal water level is aligned with the suppressing plate height the value of h w estimated by the fitting curve is basically close to the minimum based on the above analysis the steady wave height close to the test data is obtained via simulation hence the case where h w is the lowest at the initial water level z i 1 6 mm is analyzed when it comes to the surface distribution fig 20 a shows the flow field on the sampling cross section without rotor revolution while fig 20 b shows the flow field with the same n r as the test without the surface flow accelerating the velocity deflection is over 10 near the surface while the velocity deflection is almost improved to within 5 with rotor revolution moreover these two cases have roughly similar velocity distributions below 100 mm depth that is to say the surface flow velocity is compensated via the surface flow accelerator while the main flow velocity distribution is decided by the rectifying section in summary although the mechanism of steady waves is not clear they can still be reduced by adjusting the water level during the simulation the simulation results show that at a certain flow velocity the wavelength of the steady waves is consistent and that there exists an optimal water level that minimizes the constant wave the surface flow acceleration device greatly improves the surface flow velocity uniformity and the main flow uniformity is independent of the surface flow acceleration device which is seen to depend on the rectification effect of the combination of the rectifying devices 4 4 influence of the rectifying section the rectification effect of the rectifying section is a main contributor to the uniformity of the main flow velocity distribution in the observation section it is necessary to analyze the cross sections inside the cwc to show the mechanism of each rectifying section the locations of the cross sections along the circuit are shown in fig 21 fig 22 is the velocity distribution and the vector diagram at different cross sections at n i 260 rpm note that the vector length per velocity magnitude is the same for each image and that the ranges represented by the colors vary with the cross sectional area the changes from cs1 to cs3 and from cs11 to cs12 reflect the effect of the honeycombs swirling flow is abruptly straightened by the honeycombs after the flow goes past the corners the velocity distribution is stratified by the guide vanes and then the flow comes to the punched metal based on the changes from cs8 to cs9 and from cs10 to cs11 the punched metal significantly improves the uniformity of the velocity distribution however the vorticity of the anterior and the posterior sections is essentially unchanged from cs12 to cs14 the nozzle and its extension further homogenizes the velocity distribution the local lateral velocity on cs13 the nozzle exit is slightly suppressed by the nozzle after the water flows through the nozzle extension the local lateral velocity is substantially eliminated on cs14 which is the test section entrance as for the objective cwc studied here a honeycomb is installed downstream of the diffusion section fig 1 though it is also believed that a qualified flow field can be generated without this honeycomb tamashima 1983 hence this honeycomb abbreviated to hc1 is removed to assess the cwc performance the sampling cross section mentioned in section 4 1 is chosen as the objective cross section table 9 lists the comparison of parameters on the sampling cross section without hc1 the main flow velocity slightly increases while the non uniformity and the turbulence intensity remain nearly unchanged similar velocity distributions on the sampling cross section are shown in fig 23 the numerical results show that the cwc also performs well without hc1 the detailed flow field in the cwc without hc1 is analyzed as follows through the comparison of streamline diagrams in the first row of fig 24 swirling flow remains in the straight section but gradually disappears downstream of no 3 corner in the cwc without hc1 the residual rectifying section is sufficient to make the flow uniform in the observation section there are no significant differences between the velocity distributions on the cross section downstream of no 3 corner this is mainly due to the fact that the well distributed guide vanes cause the swirling flow to be basically straight the velocity distributions across the cross sections along the straight section without hc1 are shown in fig 25 with the swirling flow developing along the straight section the flow vorticity and the velocity distributions become more uniform from cs1 to cs7 compared with the velocity distribution on cs7 in the original cwc fig 22 a more uniform velocity distribution on cs7 is observed in the cwc without hc1 therefore in subsequent cwc design the detachment of hc1 can be considered base on the above analysis it can be concluded that honeycombs are efficient to straighten swirling flow and improve velocity uniformity somewhat punched metal has a significant effect on the velocity uniformity but does not obviously reduces the vorticity similar phenomena about honeycombs and punched metal are found in other experimental researches these phenomena prove the validation of the simulation on the rectifying section besides the simulation on the cwc without hc1 obtains the same high quality flow field as the original cwc cfd methods can give advice in cwc design 5 conclusion we report a comprehensive investigation on the hydrodynamic performance of a cwc via numerical methods and test validations the flow rate under different impeller revolutions the uniformity of velocity distribution and the steady wave height are measured a numerical model of the whole cwc is established to study multiple hydrodynamic performances numerical simulations are performed under the same conditions and their accuracy is verified by comparing the numerical results with the test results in consideration of the effect of a free surface performances are further divided into main flow and surface flow ones for the former velocity distribution and turbulence intensity are focused on for the latter the effects of the water level on steady waves and of a surface flow accelerator on the flow field are discussed besides flow patterns in the cwc are also analyzed to show the mechanism of each rectifying section the main conclusions are as follows 1 numerical simulations have sufficient accuracy in predicting the flow velocity and are basically accurate in predicting steady waves the relationship between the incoming flow velocity in the observation section and the impeller rotation speed is established based on the relationship the impeller rotation speed can be estimated for a desired incoming flow velocity in further simulation 2 based on the calibration of the velocity and the turbulence intensity distributions in the numerical cwc both distributions are similar in the observation section therefore the numerical cwc generates the same high quality flow field as the physical one 3 the steady wave height is significantly reduced by slightly adjusting the water level when the terminal mean water level is aligned with the suppressing plate the minimum steady wave height may be obtained moreover the wavelength of the steady waves is decided by the flow velocity 4 the rotor type surface flow accelerator obviously improves the surface flow velocity and enhances the velocity uniformity of the flow field in the test section it has no significant effect on the main flow field at a depth of about 200 mm below the water surface 5 honeycombs have a strong effect on the suppression of swirling flow and punched metal significantly improves the uniformity but does not change the vorticity of the anterior and posterior sections therefore it is necessary to combine honeycombs and punched metal to generate a straight and uniform flow 6 the honeycomb downstream of the diffuser has no significant effect on the quality of the flow field in the test section numerical results show the rest of the rectifying section are sufficient to obtain a high quality flow field the numerical simulation of the cwc and the visualization and analysis of the simulation results make it feasible to evaluate the influence of each device on the hydrodynamic performance of the circulating water tank based on the whole domain of the cwc simulations a wider range of hydrodynamic performances can be taken into evaluation which will also set the stage for subsequent optimizations credit authorship contribution statement zhu gucheng software investigation formal analysis

20436,a circulating water channel cwc generates a stable flow field for prolonged experiments the main challenge in common cwc design lies in how to achieve the flow field uniformity and the free surface flatness in the test section in this paper a thorough investigation on the hydrodynamic performance of the cwc is reported using numerical methods with test validations flow rate measurement and steady wave measurement are conducted in the cwc a numerical cwc based on the rans method is established to simulate the flow field and the free surface the moving reference frame mrf method and the volume of fluid vof method are applied to simulate the impeller rotation and capture the free surface respectively the accuracy of the numerical results is verified by comparing them with the experimental data according to the numerical results the numerical cwc reproduces the same high quality flow field as the physical one the relationship between the impeller rotation and the incoming flow velocity in the observation section is established as for surface flow characteristics the wavelength of steady waves varies with the incoming flow velocity while the steady wave height can be significantly reduced by slightly adjusting the water level in the test section the rotor type surface flow accelerator obviously improves the surface flow velocity moreover the detailed flow field inside the numerical cwc is extracted to show the effect of each rectifying section honeycombs strongly straighten swirling flows with the result that the flow uniformity downstream of the porous plate is significantly improved in addition without a honeycomb downstream of the diffusion section the residual rectifying section is sufficient for the test section to obtain a high quality flow field based on the above analysis the whole domain of cwc simulations can evaluate comprehensive hydrodynamic performances and then set the stage for subsequent optimizations keywords cwc numerical

water channel cwc occupies smaller space but produces a stable flow field used for measurement and observation for a long period of time with these advantages cwcs are widely utilized in ocean engineering feng et al 2020 bai et al 2017 however the performance of cwcs is still influenced by hydrodynamic problems among which velocity non uniformity and steady waves are two critical ones therefore assessments of them are crucial during cwc design uniformity of velocity distribution in the test section is a basic requirement therefore researches have been carried out to improve it ogura et al 1974 developed a twin impeller driven cwc its twin impellers produced more stable flow at the exit of the diffusers than a single impeller besides the rectifying section including punched metal and honeycomb were also adjusted moreover a rotor type surface flow accelerator was arranged in a water filled casing compensating the surface flow velocity more adequately the velocity deflection in the test section was reduced to 2 based on these enhancements steady waves which have almost constant troughs and crests are generated on a free surface due to the pressure jump between a close region and an open region they cause test error in experiments influenced by free surfaces such as ship resistance measurement takahei et al 1975 in the test section of which both theoretical and experimental methods were applied to reduce steady waves himeno et al 1974 discussed the relationship between the steady waves and the form of the suppressing plate the experimental pressure distribution on the suppressing plate was almost identical to the calculated result from the hydroplane theory however the relationship between the steady wave height and the suppressing plate was not in good agreement with the theoretical value kawashima 1993 conducted systematical experiments to study the steady wave height under different water levels and suppressing plate angles it was concluded that a tiny change of the water level or the suppressing plate angle strongly affects the steady wave height and that at a constant incoming flow velocity there exists an optimal combination of the water level and the plate angle that minimizes the steady wave height although the technical equipment has been developed in recent decades the mechanism of cwcs has not been discussed thoroughly with the development of computers cfd provides detailed visualization of flow fields to reveal the mechanism and optimize the design chen et al 2006 simulated a series of hydrodynamic problems of a cwc in the simulations on water flow produced by a surface flow accelerator the numerical results of the velocity distribution agreed with the experimental results the optimized design on the number and the configuration of the guide vanes in no 4 corner was obtained besides the vof method was also employed to explore the relationship between the formation of bubbles and the configuration of the rear of the test section moreover simulations on the whole domain of the cwc without punched metal showed the effect of swirling flow on non uniformity of field flow in the test section hence it is necessary to simulate the cwc including a sufficiently functioning rectifying section li et al 2012 applied cfd to wind tunnel and cwc design the quality of flow fields in a wind tunnel with and without a partition plate was compared the partition plate in the diffuser effectively reduced flow separation and improved the quality of the flow field in the test section the effect of cwc installation inclination on the free surface was also assessed the results showed that wave surges and bubbles appeared at 1 and did not appear at a smaller inclination on a solid foundation to further save time and costs jiang and chen 2020 developed a cwc design program based on simulations of various rectifying sections the program assembled 3d parametric modeling grid auto generation viscous flow field solution and cfd post processing the cwc numerical model established by the program was validated by measured data to show the reliability of the program all of the aforementioned work about cfd methods has proven the feasibility of simulations on a cwc to the best of our knowledge simulations on a whole circuit of a cwc with a free surface are rarely reported indeed rectification mechanisms and steady wave elimination are also necessary for the design of a cwc with homogenous flow and a flat surface therefore the main purpose of this study is to assess comprehensive cwc hydrodynamic problems including velocity distribution and steady waves via experimental and numerical methods simulations on the whole cwc in shanghai jiao tong university sjtu are performed in this paper the outline of this paper is as follows section 2 introduces the objective cwc and tests of cwc performances including measurement of flow rates and steady waves section 3 describes the details of the numerical methods including the cfd solver the computational domain the boundary conditions the mesh generation technique and the grid convergence study in section 4 the numerical results are presented and discussed first the numerical results are validated by comparison with the test data then the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cwc are divided into main flow and surface flow ones the main flow characteristics include velocity uniformity and turbulence intensity in the observation section the surface flow characteristics include steady waves and the flow field influenced by the surface flow accelerator moreover detailed flow patterns inside the cwc are displayed to show the effect of rectifying sections key results of this study are summarized in section 5 2 cwc performance tests 2 1 test object the cwc in sjtu which is shown in fig 1 is selected as the study object it has a total length of 26 7 m and a height of 8 2 m and is sited in a two story building the test section is 8000 mm long and 3000 mm wide and has a water depth of 1600 mm the middle part of the test section which is 7200 mm long and glassed in the bottom and sides is called the observation section in the paper the dimensions of the test section are detailed in table 1 the circuit consists of a set of impellers a diffuser corners with guide vanes punched metal honeycombs a contraction nozzle and the test section flow velocity in the test section is adjusted by controlling impeller rotation speed after flowing through the set of impellers water flows into the diffuser and its velocity becomes slow to reduce energy loss then with rectification by the corners with guide vanes the punched metal the honeycombs and the nozzle the flow becomes uniform in the test section some of the important devices used to enhance performances of the cwc are shown in fig 2 due to the boundary layer effect velocity deficit happens near the water surface a rotor type surface flow accelerator shown in fig 2 a compensates the surface flow rate thus further improving the uniformity of the velocity in the observation section in fig 2 b a water level control system consisting of two water tanks that are controlled in height is connected with the cwc by modification of the height of the water tanks the water level in the test section can be adjusted to reduce the steady wave height in fig 2 c bubble removal equipment is installed above no 1 corner to absorb the bubbles 2 2 flow rate measurement test a flow rate measurement test is carried out to calibrate the velocity uniformity in the observation section the relationship between the impeller rotation speed and the flow rate is also established fig 3 presents the schematic diagram of the experimental arrangements and the definition of the coordinate system the origin is located at the midpoint of the underside of the suppressing plate the positive directions of x y z axes are illustrated in fig 3 in this test the flow velocities at a sampling point 1800 0 110 under different impeller rotation speeds are measured to represent the main flow velocity u moreover the velocity distribution on the measuring cross section l ob 4 downstream from the suppressing plate at u 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m s is measured sampling points of the local velocity u are shown in fig 4 most of the sampling points are spaced 200 mm apart in the width direction and 100 mm apart in the depth direction the sampling points are slightly denser on both sides and near the water surface the measurement devices are shown in fig 5 the flow velocity measurement equipment consists of a pressure gauge and a pitot tube in order to avoid error from different equipment the same equipment is employed for all the sampling points therefore a motion control mechanism is applied to move the pitot tube 2 3 steady wave measurement test a steady wave measurement test is conducted to obtain the steady wave profile along the center line of the observation section fig 6 presents the schematic diagram of the experimental arrangements on the center line section the incoming flow velocity u in the observation section is 2 0 m s the initial water level z i is 1 6 mm above the underside of the suppressing plate before the test note that the z axis points up in this measurement after the flow velocity in the test section is stable the wave profile along the center line is measured by the same wave gauge to exclude the influence of surface oscillation the average water level at a sampling point over a period of 60 s is taken as the water level at this location results of the above experiments are detailed in section 4 3 numerical simulation 3 1 numerical method and computational domain the commercial cfd code fluent is employed for numerical simulations the three dimensional incompressible viscous flow field is solved based on the steady continuity equations and the rans equations the shear stress transport k ω sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 is utilized to close the set of equations the standard wall function launder and spalding 1974 is used to satisfy the physics of the flow in the region near the wall the second order upwind scheme is applied for convective discretization simulations are carried out by the steady volume of fluid method vof hirt and nichols 1981 for the smooth free surface in the computation in order to accelerate the convergence the coupling method is employed for the velocity pressure coupling the numerical computational domain and the boundary conditions are depicted in fig 7 the dimensions of the numerical model are the same as those of the sjtu cwc the half cwc model is constructed for simulations and the mid longitudinal section is treated as a symmetry boundary the surfaces of the honeycombs and the guide vanes are set to zero thickness to reduce the total number of elements the two sets of punched metal are simplified as a porous jump model note that the pressure loss coefficient of the porous jump model is set to be 1 7 in case the water level should rise due to bubbles an extra computational domain is added over the first corner for degassing pressure outlet boundary conditions are set at the top of the test section and the degassing tube numerical simulations on the main flow the steady waves and the surface flow are carried out in this paper simulations on the main flow characteristics are performed in impeller rotation speed n i to establish the relationship between u p and n i based on the relationship the value of n i can be estimated by a desired incoming flow velocity in further simulations then the surface flow field characteristics are analyzed under a typical flow rate u 2 0 m s one characteristic is the steady waves based on different initial water levels the other is the enhancement of the free surface accelerator on the surface flow field under a suitable initial water level based on steady wave simulations finally with the exception of the honeycomb downstream of the diffuser the circuit is simulated to analyze the effect of the rectifying section on flow 3 2 mesh generation and grid convergence study the whole cwc numerical model is shown in detail in fig 8 the entity of the mesh is composed by a static domain and a rotation domain the former is further divided into a main domain and a stator domain and the latter into a impeller domain and a rotor domain polyhedral mesh is constructed in the impeller domain the residual mesh is constructed by structured mesh to ensure computational efficiency the information of the mesh is listed in table 2 joint faces between each region of the mesh are set to interfaces for data exchanging in fig 8 a a finer mesh is generated in the vicinity of the water surface and around the surface flow accelerator to capture the steady waves and the surface flow field more accurately a mesh transition method shown in fig 8 d is applied to connect the upstream and downstream of the honeycombs the numerical model predictions are considerably influenced by mesh density therefore the grid convergence study is conducted under impeller rotation speed n i 260 rpm rotor rotation speed n r 770 rpm and initial water level z i 1 6 mm three sets of grids are generated based on different mesh sizes the number of different grids increases by almost 2 times the total elements and numerical results for different grids are listed in table 3 an uncertainty analysis based on the verification and validation methodology ittc 1999 is conducted the verification and validation results are shown in table 4 and table 5 respectively solution changes ε for medium fine and coarse medium solutions and the convergence ratio r g are defined by 1 ε 21 s g 2 s g 1 ε 32 s g 3 s g 2 r g ε 21 ε 32 the solution convergences monotonically with grid number since the convergence ratio r g is between 0 and 1 for the correction factor c g is sufficiently greater than 1 and lacking confidence the grid uncertainty u g is estimated as follow 2 u g c g δ r e 1 c g δ r e hence the ratio between u g and the main flow velocity s g1 based on grid 1 is about 1 5 the level of verification is below 2 as for the validation procedure the test data uncertainty u d is about 1 3 d feng et al 2018 then the validation uncertainty u v and the comparison error e are estimated as follow 3 u v u s n 2 u d 2 4 e d s g 1 hence e is less than u v in summary the simulation results are verified and validated besides the numerical results based on different sets of grids are illustrated in fig 9 the numerical accuracy of the finest mesh is not significantly enhanced compared to that of the medium one overall the medium mesh is optimal for simulations and the total element of the mesh is 7 26 106 4 results and discussions 4 1 accuracy validation of cfd simulations in this section numerical calculation accuracy is validated by the comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data the sampling point velocity comparison is shown in fig 10 since the sampling point velocity is slightly lower than previously planned the impeller rotation speed is slightly improved before the simulations it can be seen that the calculated values of the sampling point velocity at high impeller rotate speed are slightly larger than the experimental values the calculated fitting line coincides considerably with the test data based on the calculated fitting line the accurate value of n i can be estimated by the main flow velocity u before simulation in order to compare u p at the same impeller rotation speed the interpolated value based on the calculated fitting line is obtained and compared with test data the comparison is shown in table 6 the mean relative error of u p is 2 84 and the maximum error is 3 78 as u p increases the numerical value tends to the test value overall the numerical results of the inflow velocity are consistent with the test results in this study the coefficient of variation of velocity represents the velocity uniformity on a cross section the smaller the value the higher the flow field uniformity the coefficient of variation of velocity is defined as follows 5 c v s u 100 6 s 1 n 1 j 1 n u j u 2 where s is the sample standard deviation u j is the local velocity at the jth sampling point u is the mean velocity of all the sampling points and n is the amount of sampling points table 7 shows the velocity non uniformity on the sampling faces the size of the sampling faces is consistent with that of the test sampling face excluding the influence of the boundary layer both numerical and test results show low non uniformity on the sampling cross section the velocity distributions on the sampling face are shown in fig 11 in the test results the local velocity near z 800 mm is relatively low due to a horizontal partition plate upstream of the test section the assembling difference at the two sides of the horizontal partition plate leads to the asymmetry along the y axis at different flow velocities the numerical results of the velocity distribution on the sampling section show similarity with the experimental results regardless of the assembly difference in the physical cwc the numerical results are almost consistent with the test results the simulation under u 2 m s and z i 1 6 mm is calculated to validate the steady wave height with the test result under the same conditions the definition of the steady wave height h w is as follows 7 h w z max z min where z max and z min are the highest and the lowest water levels along the measurement range respectively the iso surface when vof 0 5 is extracted as the water surface fig 12 shows the computed water surface the accumulation of water under the ceiling causes the water level to drop steady waves near the wall are smaller than those at y 0 mm due to the influence of the wall the wave profile from x 0 mm to x 6500 mm at y 0 mm is extracted for further analysis of steady waves in the paper the comparison of the wave profiles between the numerical and the test results is shown in fig 13 the numerical results show similar wave height along the whole sampling range it also reflects that the wave profile is slightly smaller than the test results at the beginning of the observation section moreover the calculated wave profile is smoother than the experimental wave profile overall the numerical results of the steady wave height are basically consistent with the test results in summary the numerical results of u p are sufficiently accurate the numerical results of the steady wave height are basically consistent with the test results at the preset water level as a result cfd simulations are employed in the following studies 4 2 main flow characteristics for a cwc one of the most basic characteristics is the velocity uniformity in the test section therefore the main flow characteristics in the test section are studied in order to exclude the influence of the boundary layer each cross section is excised at the margin all of the cross sections have the same width and depth as the sampling face in the test fig 5 in general the velocity distribution along the observation section is uniform as shown in fig 14 a in fig 14 b under the same velocity the velocity distribution on the last cross section is a little worse than those on other cross sections but still maintains the uniformity fig 16 shows the turbulence intensity i along the observation section whose average value is 1 0 1 1 at different velocities the turbulence intensity of the same type of cwc was measured to be about 1 0 2 0 ogura 1985 the value of i tends to be high when the main flow velocity is low in fig 16 the turbulence intensity abruptly tends to be large near the wall and the free surface the phenomenon is also consistent with the measured results of the same type of cwc in figs 15 and 16 the velocity and the turbulence intensity distributions are basically similar along the observation section at a constant flow velocity hence it is also reasonable to choose a representative cross section to analyze flow characteristics in the whole observation section the downstream partition plate and extended boundary layer result in slight velocity deficit in the rear of the observation section based on the above analysis the calibration of the velocity distribution along the observation section proves the flow uniformity in the whole observation section the turbulence intensity obtained by simulations reflects a similar tendency with that obtained by previous tests regardless of the slightly higher value in the rear of the test section the numerical results of the velocity non uniformity along the test section maintain well therefore the single sampling face at x 1800 mm is chosen for the following analysis when it comes to the velocity distribution in the observation section 4 3 surface flow characteristics this section focuses on the steady waves and the velocity distributions near the surface flow since the surface velocity distribution is strongly affected by surface flatness a relatively smooth surface needs to be produced before the distribution is analyzed simulations on the water surface reflect the relationship between the wavelength of the steady waves and the incoming flow velocity fig 17 shows the variation of the wavelength λ of the steady waves under different main flow velocities u according to the dispersion relation the deep water wavelength is estimated by the following formula 8 λ e q u 2 π u 2 g where g denotes the gravitational acceleration and is taken as 9 81 m s2 the numerical results of the wavelength λ of the steady waves are consistent with the values obtained by the dispersion relation equation this relationship agrees with a previous experiment with steady waves tamashima 1983 based on the numerical results the wavelength of the steady waves is decided by the incoming flow velocity with the adjustment of the water level in the observation section the steady wave height can be reduced in the physical cwc in order to obtain an optimal water level simulations on the steady waves under different initial wave levels are performed fig 18 shows the waveforms of the steady waves under different initial water levels z i steady wave heights at the ends are higher than those in the middle of the observation section the wavelength and the height of each waveform of steady waves are extracted in table 8 a slight modification of the water level significantly affects the steady wave height but has no effect on the wavelength of the steady waves fig 19 a shows the linear relationship between the terminal mean water level and the initial water level due to the accumulation of water under the ceiling the value of z mean is lower than that of z i but the plot still indicates that a basically accurate water level can be obtained by setting different initial water levels in the simulation hence the relationship between z mean and z i is established in practice the suppressing plate is efficient to flat the steady waves when the terminal water level is aligned with the height of the steady waves in this situation the value of z i calculated by the fitting curve is about 1 00 mm fig 19 b shows the relationship fit by a parabola between the steady wave height h w and the initial water level z i it is difficult to eliminate the steady waves completely however the trend of the steady wave height is obtained based on the results when the terminal water level is aligned with the suppressing plate height the value of h w estimated by the fitting curve is basically close to the minimum based on the above analysis the steady wave height close to the test data is obtained via simulation hence the case where h w is the lowest at the initial water level z i 1 6 mm is analyzed when it comes to the surface distribution fig 20 a shows the flow field on the sampling cross section without rotor revolution while fig 20 b shows the flow field with the same n r as the test without the surface flow accelerating the velocity deflection is over 10 near the surface while the velocity deflection is almost improved to within 5 with rotor revolution moreover these two cases have roughly similar velocity distributions below 100 mm depth that is to say the surface flow velocity is compensated via the surface flow accelerator while the main flow velocity distribution is decided by the rectifying section in summary although the mechanism of steady waves is not clear they can still be reduced by adjusting the water level during the simulation the simulation results show that at a certain flow velocity the wavelength of the steady waves is consistent and that there exists an optimal water level that minimizes the constant wave the surface flow acceleration device greatly improves the surface flow velocity uniformity and the main flow uniformity is independent of the surface flow acceleration device which is seen to depend on the rectification effect of the combination of the rectifying devices 4 4 influence of the rectifying section the rectification effect of the rectifying section is a main contributor to the uniformity of the main flow velocity distribution in the observation section it is necessary to analyze the cross sections inside the cwc to show the mechanism of each rectifying section the locations of the cross sections along the circuit are shown in fig 21 fig 22 is the velocity distribution and the vector diagram at different cross sections at n i 260 rpm note that the vector length per velocity magnitude is the same for each image and that the ranges represented by the colors vary with the cross sectional area the changes from cs1 to cs3 and from cs11 to cs12 reflect the effect of the honeycombs swirling flow is abruptly straightened by the honeycombs after the flow goes past the corners the velocity distribution is stratified by the guide vanes and then the flow comes to the punched metal based on the changes from cs8 to cs9 and from cs10 to cs11 the punched metal significantly improves the uniformity of the velocity distribution however the vorticity of the anterior and the posterior sections is essentially unchanged from cs12 to cs14 the nozzle and its extension further homogenizes the velocity distribution the local lateral velocity on cs13 the nozzle exit is slightly suppressed by the nozzle after the water flows through the nozzle extension the local lateral velocity is substantially eliminated on cs14 which is the test section entrance as for the objective cwc studied here a honeycomb is installed downstream of the diffusion section fig 1 though it is also believed that a qualified flow field can be generated without this honeycomb tamashima 1983 hence this honeycomb abbreviated to hc1 is removed to assess the cwc performance the sampling cross section mentioned in section 4 1 is chosen as the objective cross section table 9 lists the comparison of parameters on the sampling cross section without hc1 the main flow velocity slightly increases while the non uniformity and the turbulence intensity remain nearly unchanged similar velocity distributions on the sampling cross section are shown in fig 23 the numerical results show that the cwc also performs well without hc1 the detailed flow field in the cwc without hc1 is analyzed as follows through the comparison of streamline diagrams in the first row of fig 24 swirling flow remains in the straight section but gradually disappears downstream of no 3 corner in the cwc without hc1 the residual rectifying section is sufficient to make the flow uniform in the observation section there are no significant differences between the velocity distributions on the cross section downstream of no 3 corner this is mainly due to the fact that the well distributed guide vanes cause the swirling flow to be basically straight the velocity distributions across the cross sections along the straight section without hc1 are shown in fig 25 with the swirling flow developing along the straight section the flow vorticity and the velocity distributions become more uniform from cs1 to cs7 compared with the velocity distribution on cs7 in the original cwc fig 22 a more uniform velocity distribution on cs7 is observed in the cwc without hc1 therefore in subsequent cwc design the detachment of hc1 can be considered base on the above analysis it can be concluded that honeycombs are efficient to straighten swirling flow and improve velocity uniformity somewhat punched metal has a significant effect on the velocity uniformity but does not obviously reduces the vorticity similar phenomena about honeycombs and punched metal are found in other experimental researches these phenomena prove the validation of the simulation on the rectifying section besides the simulation on the cwc without hc1 obtains the same high quality flow field as the original cwc cfd methods can give advice in cwc design 5 conclusion we report a comprehensive investigation on the hydrodynamic performance of a cwc via numerical methods and test validations the flow rate under different impeller revolutions the uniformity of velocity distribution and the steady wave height are measured a numerical model of the whole cwc is established to study multiple hydrodynamic performances numerical simulations are performed under the same conditions and their accuracy is verified by comparing the numerical results with the test results in consideration of the effect of a free surface performances are further divided into main flow and surface flow ones for the former velocity distribution and turbulence intensity are focused on for the latter the effects of the water level on steady waves and of a surface flow accelerator on the flow field are discussed besides flow patterns in the cwc are also analyzed to show the mechanism of each rectifying section the main conclusions are as follows 1 numerical simulations have sufficient accuracy in predicting the flow velocity and are basically accurate in predicting steady waves the relationship between the incoming flow velocity in the observation section and the impeller rotation speed is established based on the relationship the impeller rotation speed can be estimated for a desired incoming flow velocity in further simulation 2 based on the calibration of the velocity and the turbulence intensity distributions in the numerical cwc both distributions are similar in the observation section therefore the numerical cwc generates the same high quality flow field as the physical one 3 the steady wave height is significantly reduced by slightly adjusting the water level when the terminal mean water level is aligned with the suppressing plate the minimum steady wave height may be obtained moreover the wavelength of the steady waves is decided by the flow velocity 4 the rotor type surface flow accelerator obviously improves the surface flow velocity and enhances the velocity uniformity of the flow field in the test section it has no significant effect on the main flow field at a depth of about 200 mm below the water surface 5 honeycombs have a strong effect on the suppression of swirling flow and punched metal significantly improves the uniformity but does not change the vorticity of the anterior and posterior sections therefore it is necessary to combine honeycombs and punched metal to generate a straight and uniform flow 6 the honeycomb downstream of the diffuser has no significant effect on the quality of the flow field in the test section numerical results show the rest of the rectifying section are sufficient to obtain a high quality flow field the numerical simulation of the cwc and the visualization and analysis of the simulation results make it feasible to evaluate the influence of each device on the hydrodynamic performance of the circulating water tank based on the whole domain of the cwc simulations a wider range of hydrodynamic performances can be taken into evaluation which will also set the stage for subsequent optimizations credit authorship contribution statement zhu gucheng software investigation formal analysis

20437,according to recent research studies global fuel energy consumption will keep on increasing and will result in increase in carbon emission and significant decrease of fuel reserve at a higher rate therefore carbon neutral energy sources and energy harvesting technologies have been attracted more attention of researchers one of the promising energy harvesting technologies is vibration based energy harvesting from wave energy with the use of piezoelectric materials piezoelectric transducers are used extensively to obtain energy from vibration sources with their inherent capability of electromechanical coupling and high power density cantilever piezoelectric beams are commonly used in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting however cantilever harvesters require clamping as well as proof mass and are not practical to be implemented in complex structures such as marine platforms in this study an embedded patch based energy harvesting on a marine composite boat was proposed and the performance of the harvester exposed to wave induced loads was investigated piezoceramics pzt and zno were regarded for the patch material an electromechanical model of the glass fiber reinforced polymer gfrp boat integrated with the piezoelectric patches was developed the patches were placed on the port bow side of the boat below and above the waterline hence the efficiency of the patches according to their location was investigated and electrical power was obtained by optimizing the load resistances from a variety of load resistance values thus a comparative study of the effectiveness of both piezoelectric materials was carried out keywords energy harvesting piezoelectric materials piezoceramics zno patch composite boat wave induced vibration 1 introduction depletion of fossil fuel resources and increase in greenhouse gas emissions are the biggest problems facing the world at a near future while available energy sources are coming to a shortage researches on alternative energy sources have been started energy harvesting concept mainly involves the direct transformation of the ambient energy to electrical energy by means of some particular mechanisms the ambient energy exists in several forms such as thermal solar wind and wave among these energy forms wave energy draws attention especially for marine platforms with its availability and relatively high energy density therefore various studies have been recently carried out in this area oscillating water column owc mechanisms have mainly been of interest for wave energy harvesting falcao 2010 he et al 2013 studied the implementation of an owc which is combined with slack moored break water ning et al 2017 investigated the application of a dual chamber owc as well as the effect of wave conditions on energy harvesting zhang et al 2021 proposed a magnetic bistable device in order to improve the efficiency of a point absorber wave energy converter likewise in another study an improved bistable device was introduced for wave energy harvesting liu et al 2021 lai et al 2021 numerically simulated the performance of oscillating buoy wave energy converter in addition to large scale energy sources smaller scale energy sources tend to be wasted and not used they can be found in the surrounding environment such as vibrating structures rotating engines and flow turbulence small scale energy harvesting is applicable for the low energy electronics with a power range of μw mw li et al 2014 in this methodology vibrational energy on the system is converted into electrical energy by many transduction mechanisms using electrostatic zhang et al 2018 miljkovic et al 2014 electromagnetic tan et al 2017 asai et al 2017 magnestrictive fang et al 2017 wang and yuan 2008 triboelectric xu et al 2018 chen et al 2018 and piezoelectric anton and sodano 2003 saadon and sidek 2011 mahajan goel verma converters the advances of piezoelectric energy harvesting over other methods are its inherent transduction capacity high power density efficiency and operability in high frequency applications stojčev et al 2009 over the last four decades many piezoelectric materials have been developed to be used for energy harvesting roundy and wright 2004 wang and song 2006 hwang et al 2014 park et al 2010 alam et al 2015 jeong et al 2014 the most common of these is piezoelectric ceramics known as pzt pzts have been widely used in sensors and actuators due to their direct coupling properties excellent sensing and driving performance and their capability to output large voltages safaei et al 2008 however there are some critical issues to be considered for using pzt materials since they exhibit brittle fracture under heavy operational loads and poor acoustic impedance especially in the curved surfaces kim et al 2015 sridhar and keip 2019 jiaa et al 2021 there have been studies on the piezoelectric energy harvesting from the sea wave motions using piezoelectric coupled structures most of these studies have focused on cantilever piezoelectric beams with the use of pzt material in this configuration one unimorph or two bimorph piezoelectric layer is bonded to the cantilever beam in order to increase the strain in the pzt material the beams are then attached to the floating structure and the wave loads excite the beam resulting strains in the piezoelectric material which lead to the generation of electrical outputs xie at al xie et al 2014 presented the applicability of a piezoelectric energy harvester from sea waves and simulated the cantilever beam harvester exposed to longitudinal sea waves jbaily et al jbaily and yeung 2015 discussed about the selection of piezoelectric materials for different ocean engineering applications in another study a piezoelectric wave energy harvester composed of a piezoelectric cantilever beam and a magnet on the tip was demonstrated by simulating the sway movements of the ocean hwang et al 2017 mutsuda et al 2019 proposed a flexible piezoelectric device which is an example of bimorph cantilever piezoelectric beam for harvesting wave energy nabavi et al 2019 presented a harvesting system which can obtain sufficient electrical output from the heave motion of breakwater another method of piezoelectric energy harvesting is to attach the pzt patches directly to the vibrating surfaces compared to cantilever beams patch based configuration eliminates the need for clamping and proof mass provides convenient implementation for the complex structures such as the marine and aerospace applications besides broadband energy can be generated more effectively than cantilever beams since the vibration modes of pzt patches are closely decomposed there are limited studies on the use of patch based energy harvesting especially for mechanical vibrating structures de marqui et al de marqui et al 2009 created an electromechanically coupled finite element model of a plate with piezoceramic layers in another study a finite element model was developed to define the distribution of piezoelectric materials in order to maximize the electrical energy output rupp et al 2009 aridogan et al 2014 studied electroelastic model of a fully clamped plate integrated with a pzt patch and presented the distributed parameter model using this model aghakhani et al agakhani et al 2015 developed the equivalent circuit model of a thin plate coupled with a pzt patch an alternative to the energy harvesters built by pzt materials is using zno zinc oxide films on the vibrating structure zno is a semiconductor material having many key advantages in the field of energy harvesting the remarkable ones are that they are biologically safe can be easily integrated with flexible structures and have a higher mechanical quality factor compared to piezoceramics kumara and kima 2012 however there is not much studies about zno film based vibration energy harvesters either wang et al wang and du 2015 introduced an energy harvester with zno thin film and reported the electrical outputs of the harvester with different designs lidong du et al lidong et al 2017 developed a wind energy harvester with several cavities covered by zno thin films on the other hand celik butler et al 2014 provided novelty by presenting the integration of zno and si structures as a vibrational energy harvester herrera may et al 2020 presented an electromechanical modeling of piezoelectric energy harvesting devices for domestic washing machines they used two different types of materials zno and pzt 5a in the design of the harvesters and compared the obtained results in this study an embedded patch based energy harvesting on a marine composite boat is proposed and the performance of the harvester exposed to wave induced loads is investigated two different materials pzt and zno are regarded as the patch materials and the attainability of the results obtained in herrera may et al 2020 is also examined under hydrodynamic loads the patches are embedded in the curved surface of a glass reinforced polymer gfrp composite boat and the electromechanical responses of the boat based on a wide range of resistive loads are predicted under the specified sea state condition afterwards the optimum resistance values are determined in order to obtain the peak electrical power and the results for pzt and zno patches are discussed 2 electromechanical coupling based on wave induced loads structural and quasi electrostatic fields are coupled with the piezoelectric matrix defined in the

the values for the east mediterranean sea are tabulated in table 1 world meteorological organization wmo 2015 by using the above formulations a long crested wave surfaces at a specified time for the sea state 6 condition can be identified as shown in fig 1 3 electromechanical modeling building the electromechanical model properly is an extremely critical step in terms of the reliability of the results obtained therefore a case study is executed for the validation purposes in this case study a gfrp cantilever beam having a size of 500x50x1 mm lxwxd is used as a test set up duraact pi p 876 a12 is used as the pzt patch and embedded in the beam to ensure that pzt patches can be used as built in for composite boats gfrp beam is excited by the embedded pzt patch and the frequency response is measured via laser doppler vibrometer ldv experimental set up and measurement system are shown in fig 2 along with the experimental measurements the finite element model of the test set up was created as shown in fig 3 the characteristics of the composite material such as elastic modulus and damping coefficient obtained by experimental tests were input to the numerical model together with the piezoelectric material properties and the experimental and numerical frequency responses of the structure were examined as can be seen in fig 3 the numerical frequency response function frf agrees reasonably well with the experimentally measured one therefore the numerical model is validated and it can be stated that the numerical electromechanical coupling with gfrp composite can be used in patch based energy harvesting studies for gfrp composite boats a gfrp composite boat having a length of 16 m is used as the structural model for the patch based energy harvesting study the general

assuming that the ship will encounter the waves from the port bow side 4 patches are placed on the port bow side of the ship as shown in fig 5 however 2 of the patches are placed below the waterline in order to study the effect of the wave induced loads on the submerged surfaces each patch is directly connected to various resistive loads two different materials pzt and zno are used as the harvester material in this study these materials are considered anisotropic to reflect the dynamic behavior whereas gfrp hull structure to which the patches are attached is assumed isotropic the fundamental electromechanical properties of piezoelectric materials pzt and zno are given in table 3 4 results and discussions in this section in order to investigate the energy harvesting capability of the piezoelectric materials on a gfrp composite boat the wave induced loads were applied as the excitations to the wetted surface of the ship model for the sea state 6 as discussed in the previous section and the electrical outputs of the piezoelectric patches pzt and zno under this load was determined as far as the effectiveness of the patches with respect to the waterline location is concerned it would be appropriate to investigate the strain fields for the port side of the bow as presented in fig 6 note that the locations of the patches are circled in the figure as shown in fig 6 the wetted surface at where patch 1 and 2 are located exhibits rigid body behavior since the surface acts in unison with the water mass when excited by the wave induced loads therefore the electrical potential cannot be generated below the waterline patch 1 and 2 and it can be stated that the patch based energy harvesting due to the wave induced loads is not applicable for the wetted surfaces of the boat however it has been observed that considerable strain occurs above the waterline and hence electrical outputs are generated at the patch 3 and 4 4 1 pzt based energy harvesting case this section presents the results of energy harvesting by using the pzt patches duraact pi p 876 a12 at the location of patch 3 and 4 the voltage responses and power outputs obtained from the patch 3 and 4 above the waterline are shown in fig 7 for a wide range of resistive load cases from 100 ω to 1 mω according to fig 7 it can be stated that the voltage at small resistive loads is small and the voltage amplitude increases with increasing resistive load around each resonance frequency with pzt based configuration the maximum voltage of 0 315 v and 0 423 v can be generated at the location of patch 3 and 4 respectively as can be seen in the figure the maximum voltage responses differ at each resonance frequency due to the modal behavior of the structure and the location of the patches it can also be seen that the generated voltage remains almost constant after a certain resistive load case 100 kω in this case the open circuit condition r is achieved for the open circuit condition the highest voltage response is obtained at the location of patch 4 close to the constraint at the bow of the ship since higher strain occurs compared to that of patch 3 electrical power output can be calculated by dividing the square of the voltage amplitudes with the resistive load values fig 8 presents the generated power with respect to the resistive load cases and a comparison of the peak electrical responses obtained at resonance frequencies is illustrated in fig 9 although there exists an open circuit condition with a 100 kω resistive load it is calculated that the output power values decrease after a certain resistance value the optimum resistive load values are determined as 20 kω and 50 kω for patch 3 and 4 respectively at these resistive loads the peak output power calculated for the pzt based patch 3 and 4 is 1 18 and 4 08 μw respectively 4 2 zno based energy harvesting case in this section zno film based patch configuration was taken into consideration with the same sea conditions the electrical outputs obtained under these conditions are shown in figs 10 and 11 according to the figure it can be stated that similar electromechanical behavior is observed compared to pzt based configuration higher voltage outputs such as 3 28 v and 4 07 v are achieved at the locations of patch 3 and 4 respectively however it is determined that higher resistance values are required to obtain these voltage values for zno patches in fig 7 it can be seen that after 10 mω resistive load the voltage remains almost constant and the peak power is calculated as 0 56 μw and 1 66 μw with the 10 mω optimum resistive load 4 3 summary of pzt based and zno based energy harvesting cases the results obtained with pzt and zno based energy harvesting are summarized in table 4 according to the results highest power output location is patch 4 and it is identical for pzt based and zno based energy harvesting cases while higher voltages can be generated by zno based patch 4 the peak power output of pzt based patch 4 is significantly higher this is due to the fact that significantly higher resistance values are required in zno based patches compared to pzt based patches 5 conclusions in this study piezoelectric energy harvesting on a gfrp boat exposed to the wave induced loads in possible sea states that a ship will encounter has been investigated instead of commonly used energy harvesters this study focused on patch based energy harvesting which is more convenient for embedding into marine structures two different piezoelectric materials are used as patch materials pzt which is widely used in piezoelectric energy harvesting and zno film the patch locations were placed at the port bow side assuming that the ship would encounter the waves from the port side 4 patches have been used 2 of which are below the waterline finite element model of the electromechanical structure was created and numerical analysis with the input of wave induced loads for the sea state 6 in the mediterranean sea was performed according to the results positioning the patches above the waterline turns out to be a more viable solution since the wetted surface below waterline exhibits rigid body behavior due to the coupling with the water in the case of other patches patch 4 which is quite close to the bow of the boat has been found to give higher electrical outputs due to the higher strain amount it is therefore considered effective to place patches in locations close to constraints on the hull surface as well as to investigate the strain field of the structure with respect to the wave encounter frequencies for the selected location patch 4 energy harvesting with pzt and zno materials resulted in 0 423 v and 4 07 v generated voltages with 4 08 μw and 1 66 μw electrical power respectively it has been determined that zno film needs a comparatively high resistance value for a high voltage output and therefore lower power is obtained compared to that of the pzt material however it can be stated that both materials can be used for patch based energy harvesting and generated outputs can be supplied to low power electronics on board such as microprocessors and microcontrollers used at the marine navigation equipment ship autopilot systems and command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance c4isr systems for the

20437,according to recent research studies global fuel energy consumption will keep on increasing and will result in increase in carbon emission and significant decrease of fuel reserve at a higher rate therefore carbon neutral energy sources and energy harvesting technologies have been attracted more attention of researchers one of the promising energy harvesting technologies is vibration based energy harvesting from wave energy with the use of piezoelectric materials piezoelectric transducers are used extensively to obtain energy from vibration sources with their inherent capability of electromechanical coupling and high power density cantilever piezoelectric beams are commonly used in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting however cantilever harvesters require clamping as well as proof mass and are not practical to be implemented in complex structures such as marine platforms in this study an embedded patch based energy harvesting on a marine composite boat was proposed and the performance of the harvester exposed to wave induced loads was investigated piezoceramics pzt and zno were regarded for the patch material an electromechanical model of the glass fiber reinforced polymer gfrp boat integrated with the piezoelectric patches was developed the patches were placed on the port bow side of the boat below and above the waterline hence the efficiency of the patches according to their location was investigated and electrical power was obtained by optimizing the load resistances from a variety of load resistance values thus a comparative study of the effectiveness of both piezoelectric materials was carried out keywords energy harvesting piezoelectric materials piezoceramics zno patch composite boat wave induced vibration 1 introduction depletion of fossil fuel resources and increase in greenhouse gas emissions are the biggest problems facing the world at a near future while available energy sources are coming to a shortage researches on alternative energy sources have been started energy harvesting concept mainly involves the direct transformation of the ambient energy to electrical energy by means of some particular mechanisms the ambient energy exists in several forms such as thermal solar wind and wave among these energy forms wave energy draws attention especially for marine platforms with its availability and relatively high energy density therefore various studies have been recently carried out in this area oscillating water column owc mechanisms have mainly been of interest for wave energy harvesting falcao 2010 he et al 2013 studied the implementation of an owc which is combined with slack moored break water ning et al 2017 investigated the application of a dual chamber owc as well as the effect of wave conditions on energy harvesting zhang et al 2021 proposed a magnetic bistable device in order to improve the efficiency of a point absorber wave energy converter likewise in another study an improved bistable device was introduced for wave energy harvesting liu et al 2021 lai et al 2021 numerically simulated the performance of oscillating buoy wave energy converter in addition to large scale energy sources smaller scale energy sources tend to be wasted and not used they can be found in the surrounding environment such as vibrating structures rotating engines and flow turbulence small scale energy harvesting is applicable for the low energy electronics with a power range of μw mw li et al 2014 in this methodology vibrational energy on the system is converted into electrical energy by many transduction mechanisms using electrostatic zhang et al 2018 miljkovic et al 2014 electromagnetic tan et al 2017 asai et al 2017 magnestrictive fang et al 2017 wang and yuan 2008 triboelectric xu et al 2018 chen et al 2018 and piezoelectric anton and sodano 2003 saadon and sidek 2011 mahajan goel verma converters the advances of piezoelectric energy harvesting over other methods are its inherent transduction capacity high power density efficiency and operability in high frequency applications stojčev et al 2009 over the last four decades many piezoelectric materials have been developed to be used for energy harvesting roundy and wright 2004 wang and song 2006 hwang et al 2014 park et al 2010 alam et al 2015 jeong et al 2014 the most common of these is piezoelectric ceramics known as pzt pzts have been widely used in sensors and actuators due to their direct coupling properties excellent sensing and driving performance and their capability to output large voltages safaei et al 2008 however there are some critical issues to be considered for using pzt materials since they exhibit brittle fracture under heavy operational loads and poor acoustic impedance especially in the curved surfaces kim et al 2015 sridhar and keip 2019 jiaa et al 2021 there have been studies on the piezoelectric energy harvesting from the sea wave motions using piezoelectric coupled structures most of these studies have focused on cantilever piezoelectric beams with the use of pzt material in this configuration one unimorph or two bimorph piezoelectric layer is bonded to the cantilever beam in order to increase the strain in the pzt material the beams are then attached to the floating structure and the wave loads excite the beam resulting strains in the piezoelectric material which lead to the generation of electrical outputs xie at al xie et al 2014 presented the applicability of a piezoelectric energy harvester from sea waves and simulated the cantilever beam harvester exposed to longitudinal sea waves jbaily et al jbaily and yeung 2015 discussed about the selection of piezoelectric materials for different ocean engineering applications in another study a piezoelectric wave energy harvester composed of a piezoelectric cantilever beam and a magnet on the tip was demonstrated by simulating the sway movements of the ocean hwang et al 2017 mutsuda et al 2019 proposed a flexible piezoelectric device which is an example of bimorph cantilever piezoelectric beam for harvesting wave energy nabavi et al 2019 presented a harvesting system which can obtain sufficient electrical output from the heave motion of breakwater another method of piezoelectric energy harvesting is to attach the pzt patches directly to the vibrating surfaces compared to cantilever beams patch based configuration eliminates the need for clamping and proof mass provides convenient implementation for the complex structures such as the marine and aerospace applications besides broadband energy can be generated more effectively than cantilever beams since the vibration modes of pzt patches are closely decomposed there are limited studies on the use of patch based energy harvesting especially for mechanical vibrating structures de marqui et al de marqui et al 2009 created an electromechanically coupled finite element model of a plate with piezoceramic layers in another study a finite element model was developed to define the distribution of piezoelectric materials in order to maximize the electrical energy output rupp et al 2009 aridogan et al 2014 studied electroelastic model of a fully clamped plate integrated with a pzt patch and presented the distributed parameter model using this model aghakhani et al agakhani et al 2015 developed the equivalent circuit model of a thin plate coupled with a pzt patch an alternative to the energy harvesters built by pzt materials is using zno zinc oxide films on the vibrating structure zno is a semiconductor material having many key advantages in the field of energy harvesting the remarkable ones are that they are biologically safe can be easily integrated with flexible structures and have a higher mechanical quality factor compared to piezoceramics kumara and kima 2012 however there is not much studies about zno film based vibration energy harvesters either wang et al wang and du 2015 introduced an energy harvester with zno thin film and reported the electrical outputs of the harvester with different designs lidong du et al lidong et al 2017 developed a wind energy harvester with several cavities covered by zno thin films on the other hand celik butler et al 2014 provided novelty by presenting the integration of zno and si structures as a vibrational energy harvester herrera may et al 2020 presented an electromechanical modeling of piezoelectric energy harvesting devices for domestic washing machines they used two different types of materials zno and pzt 5a in the design of the harvesters and compared the obtained results in this study an embedded patch based energy harvesting on a marine composite boat is proposed and the performance of the harvester exposed to wave induced loads is investigated two different materials pzt and zno are regarded as the patch materials and the attainability of the results obtained in herrera may et al 2020 is also examined under hydrodynamic loads the patches are embedded in the curved surface of a glass reinforced polymer gfrp composite boat and the electromechanical responses of the boat based on a wide range of resistive loads are predicted under the specified sea state condition afterwards the optimum resistance values are determined in order to obtain the peak electrical power and the results for pzt and zno patches are discussed 2 electromechanical coupling based on wave induced loads structural and quasi electrostatic fields are coupled with the piezoelectric matrix defined in the

the values for the east mediterranean sea are tabulated in table 1 world meteorological organization wmo 2015 by using the above formulations a long crested wave surfaces at a specified time for the sea state 6 condition can be identified as shown in fig 1 3 electromechanical modeling building the electromechanical model properly is an extremely critical step in terms of the reliability of the results obtained therefore a case study is executed for the validation purposes in this case study a gfrp cantilever beam having a size of 500x50x1 mm lxwxd is used as a test set up duraact pi p 876 a12 is used as the pzt patch and embedded in the beam to ensure that pzt patches can be used as built in for composite boats gfrp beam is excited by the embedded pzt patch and the frequency response is measured via laser doppler vibrometer ldv experimental set up and measurement system are shown in fig 2 along with the experimental measurements the finite element model of the test set up was created as shown in fig 3 the characteristics of the composite material such as elastic modulus and damping coefficient obtained by experimental tests were input to the numerical model together with the piezoelectric material properties and the experimental and numerical frequency responses of the structure were examined as can be seen in fig 3 the numerical frequency response function frf agrees reasonably well with the experimentally measured one therefore the numerical model is validated and it can be stated that the numerical electromechanical coupling with gfrp composite can be used in patch based energy harvesting studies for gfrp composite boats a gfrp composite boat having a length of 16 m is used as the structural model for the patch based energy harvesting study the general characteristics of the boat are presented in table 2 and the finite element method fem model is shown in fig 4 fem model of the gfrp boat and the electromechanical coupling is developed in line with the validated numerical electromechanical modeling principles point mass distribution including the lightship mass the payload and the fluid mass on board is properly established along the structure assuming that the ship will encounter the waves from the port bow side 4 patches are placed on the port bow side of the ship as shown in fig 5 however 2 of the patches are placed below the waterline in order to study the effect of the wave induced loads on the submerged surfaces each patch is directly connected to various resistive loads two different materials pzt and zno are used as the

concerned it would be appropriate to investigate the strain fields for the port side of the bow as presented in fig 6 note that the locations of the patches are circled in the figure as shown in fig 6 the wetted surface at where patch 1 and 2 are located exhibits rigid body behavior since the surface acts in unison with the water mass when excited by the wave induced loads therefore the electrical

the boat however it has been observed that considerable strain occurs above the waterline and hence electrical outputs are generated at the patch 3 and 4 4 1 pzt based energy harvesting case this section presents the results of energy harvesting by using the pzt patches duraact pi p 876 a12 at the location of patch 3 and 4 the voltage responses and power outputs obtained from the patch 3 and 4 above the waterline are shown in fig 7 for a wide range of resistive load cases from 100 ω to 1 mω according to fig 7 it can be stated that the voltage at small resistive loads is small and the

the same sea conditions the electrical outputs obtained under these conditions are shown in figs 10 and 11 according to the figure it can be stated that similar electromechanical behavior is observed compared to pzt based configuration higher voltage outputs such as 3 28 v and 4 07 v are achieved at the locations of patch 3 and 4 respectively however it is determined that higher resistance values are required to obtain these voltage values for zno patches in fig 7 it can be seen that after 10 mω resistive load the voltage remains almost constant and the peak power is calculated as 0 56 μw and 1 66 μw with the 10 mω optimum resistive load 4 3 summary of pzt based and zno based energy harvesting cases the results obtained with pzt and zno based energy harvesting are summarized in table 4 according to the results highest power output location is patch 4 and it is identical for pzt based and zno based energy harvesting cases while higher voltages can be generated by zno based patch 4 the peak power output of pzt based patch 4 is significantly higher this is due to the fact that significantly higher resistance values are required in zno based patches compared to pzt based patches 5

20438,inspired by the technical characteristics of the two modes of hard hang off and soft hang off commonly used when hanging risers on drilling platforms to avoid typhoons a new riser flexible hang off scheme is proposed to compensate the riser heave dynamic load the mechanical mechanism of riser flexible hang off is designed two compensation strategies are proposed including the proportional compensation strategy and the back pressure variable damping compensation strategy aiming at the control method of the compensation strategy of back pressure variable damping with better compensation effect the hydraulic system scheme of riser flexible hang off is designed in order to verify the feasibility of the hydraulic system the compensation performance of the riser flexible hang off scheme subjected to the designed hydraulic system is investigated using simulink software the results show that the riser flexible hang off compensates riser heave dynamic load by 30 under the once in a decade sea conditions in the western pacific ocean the filling pressure of the gas cylinder and the displacement voltage gain of the throttle valve are critical to on the system performance the proposed new riser flexible hang off system casts light on an alternative compensation for drilling platform to avoid typhoon keywords riser flexible hang off system dynamic load compensation variable damping simulation research 1 introduction as the throat channel connecting the seabed blowout preventer bop to the offshore drilling platform the drilling riser is an important equipment in offshore oil and gas exploration and development thus it is particularly important to ensure the safety of the riser especially during the hazardous weather conditions at present commonly used procedures to deal with typhoons are to evacuate ahead of time that is recovering all risers before the typhoon arrives and evacuating the platform to the safe sea however due to the difficulty of typhoon forecasting the time allowed for evacuation is limited especially for deep or ultra deep water meanwhile the installation or retrieval of the riser must be carried out under mild weather conditions enda et al 2004 brekke et al 2004 as a result the drilling platform has to evacuate by hanging risers when operating in deep water as shown in fig 1 two types of hang off modes are commonly used on drilling platforms hard hang off and soft hang off the hard hang off riser is installed on the turntable through the chuck universal joint and the platform movement is directly transmitted to the top of the riser ambrose et al 2001 the soft hang off suspends the riser by the tensioner thus the platform movement is transferred to the outer tube of the telescopic joint through the tensioner the riser is under good stress condition but there are also operational risks gallagher c et al 2012 first the operation in the soft hang off mode is complex to prevent the riser from colliding to the seabed under the heave movement of the drilling platform the tension system needs to be removed a certain number of risers need to be removed and then the telescopic joint and tension system need to be installed again second the operation risk of soft hang off mode is relatively high the installation of the telescopic joint and tension system needs to be carried out in the moonpool it is difficult and risky to work in the moonpool under the severe sea conditions of typhoon finally the soft hang off mode generally adopts the passive hydraulic compensation scheme the hydraulic cylinder compensation stroke is larger than the heave of the platform and the compensation stroke cannot be controlled due to the purely passive compensation scheme scholars have done a lot of research on the dynamic characteristics of risers under hard hang off and soft hang off conditions sun et al 2009 investigated the axial dynamic characteristics of ultra deep water risers in hard hang off configurations and discussed the typhoon avoidance management strategy of risers ju et al 2012 put forward a method to analyze operating windows for soft or hard hang off modes of the riser which includes to establish a finite element model for the riser axial dynamic analysis and to examine riser hang off windows under different oceanic conditions based on the restraint criterion of riser hang off operations gao et al 2014 simulated a marine drilling riser system through fem with orcaflex software on a semisubmersible platform and studied the axial dynamic characteristics of a hard hang off riser at different water depths wu et al 2014 simulated the dynamic response of a riser in a hard hang off state with consideration of the wave and current effects the platform motion and the large deformation of the drilling riser the authors also studied the dynamic response of the riser to evacuate with hysy 981 drilling platform under the ocean condition caused by a once in a year typhoon in the south china sea qi et al 2015 applied fem with the orcaflex software to simulate dynamic responses of a hard hang off drilling riser system with different suspended lengths current speeds and driving directions and analyzed the feasibility of riser evacuation under hard hang off mode in case of a typhoon the authors also used shear7 to study the vortex induced vibration characteristics of drilling risers under hard hang off mode when evacuated to avoid typhoons sheng et al 2015 took the suspended risers as the research objects considering dynamic tension bending stress flex joint angle of risers and the space interference with the moon pool the axial dynamic model of risers in suspension mode is established to analyze the effects of different suspension modes evacuation speed and heading on riser safety liu et al 2017 presented a dynamic analysis model and method for the riser system in different operation modes to calculate weak points and the safe operation window of the riser system in typhoon mao et al 2019 established a dynamic analysis model for a drilling riser under hard hang off conditions and the model is solved by finite element method in combination with the newmark β method and verified by comparing the results with similar researches the authors also analyzed the influences of evacuation and current speeds the desired track of the drilling platform the weight of lower marine riser package lmrp and the length of the hang off drilling riser on drilling riser deformation and bending moment chen et al 2020 investigates the axial vibration of pipes subjected to the resonance excitation in previous studies the dynamic characteristics of risers in harsh environments are studied based on traditional hard and soft hang off this paper designs a new riser flexible hang off according to the technical characteristics of the above two kinds of hang off which can shorten the operation time of platform evacuation thus improving the platform s ability to cope with typhoon at the same time the new riser flexible hang off also can compensate riser heave dynamic load improve riser stress and ensure riser safety 2 structural description of riser flexible hang off system the schematic diagram of the riser flexible hang off device is shown in fig 2 the top half part in the figure is the riser flexible hang off device which is composed of three parts heave compensation mechanism riser clamping mechanism and heave movement guiding mechanism the whole device is installed on the chuck universal joint zuber et al 2011 the linkage and centralizer are the auxiliary devices of the riser flexible hang off device which can bear the static and the lateral load of the riser 1 motion compensation mechanism as shown in fig 3 eight hydraulic cylinders constitute the motion compensation mechanism eight hydraulic cylinders are connected to the base by bolts each two hydraulic cylinders are arranged in a group of circles the motion compensation mechanism increases the compensation stroke by moving pulley to twice the hydraulic cylinder stroke thus reducing the height of the whole device and improving the stability of the device 2 riser holding mechanism fig 4 shows the three dimensional structure of the riser gripper the riser gripper connects the compensation device to the riser xiao 2014 the chuck has four claws which are driven by four rotary hydraulic cylinders when the claws are completely open the riser hang off nipple can be completely passed when the claws are closed the riser is suspended from the riser clamping mechanism with the chuck 3 motion guiding mechanism as shown in fig 5 the guide device is composed of four sets of guide wheels and guide rail which limits the riser to move only in the vertical direction and bear the load parallel to the drill floor direction so as to ensure the normal work of the compensation mechanism the guide rail is connected to the base by bolts the guide wheel module is installed on the bearing plate and the four guide rail in the middle position is connected to eight compensation hydraulic cylinders by connecting tiles 3 riser flexible hang off compensation strategy limited by the operating conditions of the drilling platform the riser flexible hang off device cannot adopt the control strategy of full stroke compensation like the tensioner and must use the limited compensation cylinder stroke to reduce the peak dynamic load generated by the riser so it is necessary to find a reasonable and effective compensation strategy two control strategies are proposed in this paper including the proportional compensation strategy and the backpressure variable damping compensation strategy the riser flexible hang off is studied based on the once in a decade sea conditions in the western pacific the specific sea conditions parameters and basic parameters are shown in table 2 3 1 proportional compensation strategy the proportional compensation strategy compensates the riser s movement in full period according to the period of platform motion the compensation is carried out with fixed amplitude from the perspective of displacement analysis the riser is suspended so that the riser compensates for the movement of the platform with the opposite trend and equal period quan et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the acceleration curve of the proportional compensation strategy is shown in fig 6 fig 7 is the proportional compensation strategy model y is the platform displacement x is the riser displacement k is the equivalent stiffness of the hydraulic spring of the hang off device due to the short travel of the hang off device s hydraulic cylinder it can be approximated as a linear spring and c is the viscous damping of the hydraulic system because the flexible suspension of the water pipe is less than the amplitude of the wave it is not possible to use the pure passive compensation method like tensioner and therefore needs to be controlled by the main power sten r et al 2010 gallagher c et al 2012 fac is the main power exerted on the riser by the active hydraulic cylinder and variable pump the mathematical model of proportional compensation strategy system is 1 m x c x k x k y c y f a c where f ac is the active force y is the platform displacement m x is the riser displacement k is the equivalent stiffness c is the viscous damping of hydraulic system m is the riser mass the motion law of the platform can be expressed as huang et al 2017 2 y y sin ω t the condition of proportional compensation is that the phase difference between riser displacement and platform displacement is zero the active force is designed as 3 f a c k y c y ω 2 f sin ω t substituting equations 2 and 3 into equation 1 and solve the steady state response x of the riser s absolute displacement can be written 4 x x sin ω t ϕ x f γ 2 1 γ 2 2 2 ξ γ 2 tan ϕ 2 ξ γ 1 γ 2 where f is steady state response amplitude coefficient of absolute displacement of riser f f m f is the amplitude coefficient of the main force ϕ is the phase difference in the steady state response to the absolute displacement of the riser γ is frequency ratio ξ is damping ratio ω 0 is natural frequency of hang off system ω is platform heave motion frequency fig 8 and fig 9 show the curve of the change of the amplitude of the riser s absolute displacement steady state response with the frequency ratio and the curve of the relationship between phase difference and frequency ratio as can be seen from fig 8 when the frequency ratio is close to 0 the riser s absolute displacement tends to 0 meanwhile as can be seen from fig 9 when the frequency ratio is close to 0 the phase difference is also close to 0 hydraulic cylinder piston movement direction and the platform movement direction opposite therefore from the perspective of phase analysis the model can achieve approximate proportional compensation in order to analyze the feasibility of the compensation strategy the variable pump power required by the proportional compensation strategy and the relationship between the compensation effect and frequency ratio and damping ratio are analyzed this model requires the hydraulic cylinder to provide the main power f ac and the variable pump power p p is calculated by ignoring the transmission efficiency 5 p p f a c δ x relative displacement of riser z x y 6 z z sin ω t φ z cos ϕ y 2 x sin ϕ 2 where φ is relative displacement of riser steady state response phase difference as shown in fig 10 when the damping ratio factor ξ 0 05 0 5 the variable pump power along with the change of frequency ratio can be seen that with the increase of frequency than the variable pump power decreases reducing speed slower and slower and damping ratio the greater the variable pump power is smaller as shown in fig 11 when the damping ratio factor ξ 0 05 0 5 compensation ability decreases with the increase of frequency ratio reduce speed faster and faster and damping ratio compensation ability is lower the greater the compensation ability reduce the faster combined with figs 9 and 10 it can be concluded that under the proportional compensation strategy when the system takes small damping ratio and high frequency ratio the required variable pump power is small and the compensation capacity is high as shown in table 1 is that under the limit state of sea when the damping ratio factor ξ 0 05 corresponding to different frequency ratio of the variable pump power and the rate of compensation when the damping ratio factor ξ 0 05 system compensation rate to 26 22 to achieve 26 22 compensation efficiency the system needs a maximum pump power of 9112 kw therefore the biggest problem of proportional compensation strategy requires large power of motor and v pump to solve this problem a new compensation strategy is explored 3 2 compensation strategy for backpressure variable damping the back pressure variable damping compensation strategy compensates the heave motion by changing the damping ratio of the hand off system the damping ratio is changed by controlling the opening size of the proportional throttle valve the riser flexible hang off device is designed to reduce the dynamic load of riser which dynamic load of riser is caused by riser acceleration thus the effect of compensation strategy on riser acceleration is studied based on riser acceleration the solid line shown in fig 12 is the acceleration of the platform the dotted line is the compensated riser acceleration without compensation the riser follows the platform and the riser acceleration equals the platform acceleration the am value is set according to the heave motion parameters of the platform under the back pressure variable damping compensation strategy the flexible hang off device compensates the riser acceleration to the interval a m a m in the first cycle for example to introduce back pressure variable damping compensation strategy flexible hang off did not work at t 0 riser do heave motion follow platform together to the t1 time monitoring to the riser acceleration is beyond the range of a m a m lower limit this time by adjusting the throttle valve opening size control riser acceleration keep a m is the same during this process the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder is extended when platform acceleration back to the a m a m when the piston to continue upward movement continues to control the riser accelerating to a m is the same at the time of t2 when s 1 s 2 as shown in fig 12 the piston moves to the highest point currently the throttle valve closes and the riser follows the platform to make heave motion again at the time of t3 the acceleration of the riser is detected to exceed the upper limit of the interval a m a m at this time the acceleration of the riser is controlled by adjusting the opening size of the throttle valve to keep a m constant during this process the piston of the hydraulic cylinder moves downward when platform acceleration back to the a m a m the piston to continue downward movement riser acceleration keeps a m is the same at the time of t4 when s 3 s 4 as shown in fig 12 piston rod back completely piston stop motion at this time closed throttle valve riser motion with platform and completed a motor cycle control according to the velocity of piston moving to both ends of hydraulic cylinder is zero and the displacement of piston moving is less than the travel of hydraulic cylinder the compensation efficiency of back pressure variable damping compensation strategy is calculated 7 v h t 1 t 2 a h d t 0 x h max t 1 t 2 a h d t d t l a h 1 2 a p max 1 η a a p t 1 arcsin η a 1 ω where v h is the speed at which the piston moves to the end a h is piston acceleration t 1 and t 2 is the moment the piston moves to both ends of the cylinder x hmax is maximum piston displacement l is stroke of hydraulic cylinder a p is platform heave acceleration a pmax is maximum platform acceleration η a is compensation effect equation 7 is used to calculate the compensation capability of the back pressure damping compensation strategy under extreme sea conditions and compare it with the proportional compensation control strategy as shown in fig 13 it can be seen from the fig 13 that in extreme sea conditions the compensation capacity of the back pressure variation damping compensation strategy is higher than that of the proportional compensation strategy when the hydraulic cylinder stroke is less than 1 85m therefore the back pressure variation damping compensation strategy is easy to achieve better control effect when the stroke is short 4 design and calculation of riser flexible hang off hydraulic system 4 1 hydraulic system design according to the above control strategy a one way differential scheme of hydraulic cylinder is designed to realize the back pressure variable damping compensation strategy the hydraulic system schematic diagram is shown in fig 14 the hydraulic cylinder relates to the gas liquid converter and gas bottle through the ratio throttle block and the pressure of the hydraulic cylinder without rod cavity is adjusted by controlling the opening of the throttle valve port the specific working process of the hydraulic system is as follows when the pressure of hydraulic cylinder rod less than a certain set value is detected the gas liquid converter pushes the piston upward controls the throttle valve opening size to keep the cylinder rod less pressure unchanged check valve 1 opens check valve 2 closes hydraulic cylinder differential connection the effective area is the piston rod area when the pressure in the hydraulic cylinder rod less chamber is detected to be higher than a certain set value the piston moves downward to control the throttle valve opening size to control the pressure in the hydraulic cylinder rod less chamber first the hydraulic oil is charged to the gas liquid converter when the pressure in the gas liquid converter reaches the pressure set by overflow valve the overflow valve opens and the hydraulic oil flows into the oil tank the oil set aside by the overflow valve is high temperature oil which enters the oil tank after being cooled by the cooler system the cooled oil is pumped into the low pressure accumulator 4 2 calculation of key

total working area of hydraulic cylinder the flow curve over time is shown in fig 16 set the flow as positive when the piston is moving upward and negative when the piston is moving downward the peak flow value of the lower stroke is greater than that of the upper stroke which is caused by different acting areas the maximum flow value of the system is 8 75 m3 min 3 gas cylinder volume calculation according to the principle of the hydraulic system the cylinder pressure in the compensation process meets the following conditions p h 1 p a p h 2 in addition due to the gas liquid converter flowing into and out of the hydraulic oil during the compensation process the change of cylinder pressure will be caused and the pressure fluctuation of the cylinder needs to be limited to not too large and the preset cylinder pressure fluctuation δp 1 mpa equation can be obtained from the gas state equation 11 p a 1 v 1 1 4 p a 2 v 2 1 4 v 2 v 1 δ v p a 1 p a 2 δ p δ v a 3 l where p a is gas cylinder

cylinder pressure fluctuation according to the equation 11 the relation curve between cylinder volume and cylinder pressure fluctuation can be obtained as shown in fig 17 as the cylinder volume gradually increases the cylinder pressure fluctuation drops rapidly from the beginning to the slow attenuation later considering the cost and effect the cylinder volume is 6 75m3 5 simulation analysis

influence of each parameter on the compensation performance of the hang off device are analyzed 5 1 establishment of simulation model as shown in fig 18 the riser flexible hang off simulink model is composed of the following modules riser load model hydraulic cylinder piston model pressure transfer model throttle valve model gas cylinder model control system model and theoretical calculation model this paper studies the operating condition of 10000 ft in the maximum operating depth of the drilling platform xie et al 2011 system simulation keyword parameters are shown in table 2 1 mathematical model of riser fig 19 shows the stress diagram of the riser in order to facilitate the study in this paper the riser is simplified into a mass block the riser is subjected to the tension of the compensation device the viscous damping force of seawater its own gravity seawater buoyancy and the tension of the linkage the gravity of the riser and its buoyancy are static and combine to be the wet weight thus the mathematical model of the riser is as follows lü et al 2018 12 f h g f l f s c g x g m g x g where f hg is the force of the hydraulic cylinder on the riser f l is the force of

between the riser and the piston in the downstroke process of the piston of the hydraulic cylinder different from the upper stroke process the hydraulic cylinder in the lower stroke process is in the direct motion mode and the effective action area is the area of the rod cavity the piston mathematical model of the hydraulic cylinder is as follows 14 p h a 1 f g h m h g c h x h f m h x j h 3 mathematical model of gas cylinder when the minimum volume of the gas cylinder is v 2 the maximum pressure of the gas cylinder is p a 2 the piston is then located at the lowest end of the hydraulic cylinder during the upper stroke of the hydraulic cylinder the hydraulic oil flows from the gas liquid converter through the throttle valve to the non rod chamber of the hydraulic cylinder and the volume of gas expands in the gas bottle during the lower stroke of the hydraulic cylinder the hydraulic oil flows from the non rod chamber of the hydraulic cylinder to the gas liquid converter through the throttle valve when the volume of gas in the gas bottle is compressed to the minimum volume v 2 the overflow valve starts to overflow to ensure that the volume of gas in the gas bottle remains unchanged the piston moves upward or downward the hydraulic oil flow through the throttle valve q j is integrated to obtain the volume of the hydraulic oil flowing through the throttle valve into the gas liquid converter which is the change of the gas volume of the cylinder δ v the sum of δ v and v 2 is the real time gas volume according to the gas state equation the real time gas pressure of the gas bottle is calculated gas bottle pressure at any time can be calculated by gas state equation 15 p a 2 v 2 1 4 p a v 2 q j d t 1 4 where q j is the flow of oil through the throttle valve with the direction of flow of the gas cylinder to the hydraulic cylinder as the positive direction the pressure inside the gas cylinder is higher than the pressure inside the rod free chamber of the hydraulic

riser acceleration a p is platform heave acceleration fig 21 shows the simulation curve of riser acceleration the simulink model of riser flexible suspension system adopts pid algorithm to travel control silva 2002 skogestad 2004 after tuning pid parameters the peak acceleration of riser decreases and the compensation effect is 30 the real curve of riser acceleration is consistent with the ideal curve the displacement curve of the piston of the hydraulic cylinder is calculated and it is found that the displacement deviation of the piston contributes to the occurrence of cylinder collision accident therefore it is necessary to control the displacement of the piston the piston displacement is controlled within the stroke interval 0 l of the hydraulic cylinder the piston displacement is controlled by adjusting the acceleration control interval which is adjusted to a m δ a a m δ a the piston displacement control algorithm is shown in formula 19 19 x h 0 δ a 0 0 x h l δ

controlled within the stroke range of the hydraulic cylinder through piston displacement control to avoid the occurrence of collision accident 5 3 simulation study on key parameters of the system since the main power component of the hydraulic system is the gas cylinder and the main control component is the throttle valve influences of gas cylinder and throttle valve parameters on the system performance are investigated in this subsection 5 3 1 the influence of gas cylinder parameters on compensation performance 1 the influence of gas cylinder volume on compensation performance according to the cylinder calculation and selection the gas cylinder volume is 6 75m3 in order to analyze the influence of the cylinder volume on the compensation effect the cylinder volume is simulated by taking different values fig 23 shows the control effect of riser acceleration under different cylinder volumes under the same pid parameter when the cylinder volume reaches 4 5m3 the riser acceleration oscillates significantly when the device starts analysis of the reasons the smaller the cylinder volume in the piston movement process of the cylinder pressure change rate is greater the more difficult the riser acceleration control in the process of analysis it is found that increasing the integral coefficient kd of pid controller can still achieve better control effect after reducing the cylinder volume and the influence of cylinder volume on the riser acceleration control effect is small after adjusting pid parameters 2 influence of gas cylinder filling pressure on compensation performance according to the calculation in section 4 2 the gas cylinder pressure is required to meet the conditions of 15 89mpa pa 27 22mpa in this interval different values are taken to change the gas cylinder filling pressure in the model for simulation and the influence of the cylinder filling pressure on the acceleration control effect is analyzed fig 24 shows the control effect of riser acceleration under cylinder pressure of 17 mpa 21 mpa and 27 mpa respectively it can be seen from the image curve that the control effect in the upper stroke process of the hydraulic cylinder is poor and the control effect in the lower stroke is ideal when the gas cylinder filling pressure is small and the control effect in the lower stroke process is poor and the control effect in the upper stroke is ideal when the gas cylinder filling pressure is large 5 3 2 the influence of throttle parameters on compensation performance the influence of the valve movement time constant t and the valve displacement voltage gain k on the riser acceleration compensation performance is analyzed the time constant t determines the response speed of the throttle valve as shown in fig 25 the acceleration curve of the riser after compensation when the time constant t is 0 1 0 02 and 0 004 as can be seen from fig 25 when the time constant t is taken at different values the acceleration curves of the riser are approximately identical so the time constant t has little impact on the system performance adjust the spool displacement voltage gain k and analyze the influence of spool displacement voltage gain k on the riser acceleration compensation effect according to the riser acceleration curve because of the different flow rate through the throttle valve in the up and down stroke of the hydraulic cylinder the control effect of riser acceleration in the up and down stroke of the hydraulic cylinder is analyzed respectively fig 26 shows the riser acceleration curve after compensation when the spool displacement voltage gain k is 0 001 0 003 and 0 005 the greater the value of valve core displacement voltage gain k the faster the throttle response speed the smaller the riser acceleration compensation error hydraulic cylinder upper stroke flow through the throttle valve is small riser acceleration compensation error is small hydraulic cylinder lower stroke flow through the proportional throttle valve is large riser acceleration compensation error is also large 6 conclusion aiming at the safety problem of drilling platform when hanging riser to avoid typhoon this paper designs a new riser flexible suspension system including structural design and hydraulic system design two compensation strategies of proportional compensation and backpressure variable damping compensation have been proposed by establishing simulink model the compensation effect of backpressure variable damping compensation strategy has been verified and the influence of key parameters of the system on the compensation effect has been analyzed the following conclusions are drawn 1 through the analysis of compensation mechanism the proportional compensation strategy requires additional main power and a very large pump power 2 the back pressure variable damping strategy is better than the proportional compensation strategy when the stroke of the hydraulic cylinder be less than 1 85m 3 the designed riser flexible hang off system can effectively reduce the heave dynamic load of risers due to platform movement by using the compensation strategy of backpressure variable damping the compensation efficiency is 30 when the stroke of the hydraulic cylinder is 1 2 m 4 the influence of key parameters of the system on the compensation effect is analyzed the accumulator volume has little influence on the compensation effect when the inflation pressure is large the upper stroke compensation effect is better while when the inflation pressure is small the lower stroke compensation effect is better throttle valve core displacement voltage gain should be selected larger throttle throttle valve nominal flow the smaller the compensation error credit

20438,inspired by the technical characteristics of the two modes of hard hang off and soft hang off commonly used when hanging risers on drilling platforms to avoid typhoons a new riser flexible hang

proposed new riser flexible hang off system casts light on an alternative compensation for drilling platform to avoid typhoon keywords riser flexible hang off system dynamic load compensation variable damping simulation research 1 introduction as the throat channel connecting the seabed blowout preventer bop to the offshore drilling platform the drilling riser is an important equipment in offshore oil and gas exploration and development thus it is particularly important to ensure the safety of the riser especially during the hazardous weather conditions at present commonly used procedures to deal with typhoons are to evacuate ahead of time that is recovering all risers before the typhoon arrives and evacuating the platform to the safe sea however due to the difficulty of typhoon forecasting the time allowed for evacuation is limited especially for deep or ultra deep water meanwhile the installation or retrieval of the riser must be carried out under mild weather conditions enda et al 2004 brekke et al 2004 as a result the drilling platform has to evacuate by hanging risers when operating in deep water as shown in fig 1 two types of hang off modes are commonly used on drilling platforms hard hang off and soft hang off the hard hang off riser is installed on the turntable through the chuck universal joint and the platform movement is directly transmitted to the top of the riser ambrose et al 2001 the soft hang off suspends the riser by the tensioner thus the platform movement is transferred to the outer tube of the telescopic joint through the tensioner the riser is under good stress condition but there are also operational risks gallagher c et al 2012 first the operation in the soft hang off mode is complex to prevent the riser from colliding to the seabed under the heave movement of the drilling platform the tension system needs to be removed a certain number of risers need to be removed and then the telescopic joint and tension system need to be installed again second the operation risk of soft hang off mode is relatively high the installation of the telescopic joint and tension system needs to be carried out in the moonpool it is difficult and risky to work in the moonpool under the severe sea conditions of typhoon finally the soft hang off mode generally adopts the passive hydraulic compensation scheme the hydraulic cylinder compensation stroke is larger than the heave of the platform and the compensation stroke cannot be controlled due to the purely passive compensation scheme scholars have done a lot of research on the dynamic characteristics of risers under hard hang off and soft hang off conditions sun et al 2009 investigated the axial dynamic characteristics of ultra deep water risers in hard hang off configurations and discussed the typhoon avoidance management strategy of risers ju et al 2012 put forward a method to analyze operating windows for soft or hard hang off modes of the riser which includes to establish a finite element model for the riser axial dynamic analysis and to examine riser hang off windows under different oceanic conditions based on the restraint criterion of riser hang off operations gao et al 2014 simulated a marine drilling riser system through fem with orcaflex software on a semisubmersible platform and studied the axial dynamic characteristics of a hard hang off riser at different water depths wu et al 2014 simulated the dynamic response of a riser in a hard hang off state with consideration of the wave and current effects the platform motion and the large deformation of the drilling riser the authors also studied the dynamic response of the riser to evacuate with hysy 981 drilling platform under the ocean condition caused by a once in a year typhoon in the south china sea qi et al 2015 applied fem with the orcaflex software to simulate dynamic responses of a hard hang off drilling riser system with different suspended lengths current speeds and driving directions and analyzed the feasibility of riser evacuation under hard hang off mode in case of a typhoon the authors also used shear7 to study the vortex induced vibration characteristics of drilling risers under hard hang off mode when evacuated to avoid typhoons sheng et al 2015 took the suspended risers as the research objects considering dynamic tension bending stress flex joint angle of risers and the space interference with the moon pool the axial dynamic model of risers in suspension mode is established to analyze the effects of different suspension modes evacuation speed and heading on riser safety liu et al 2017 presented a dynamic analysis model and method for the riser system in different operation modes to calculate weak points and the safe operation window of the riser system in typhoon mao et al 2019 established a dynamic analysis model for a drilling riser under hard hang off conditions and the model is solved by finite element method in combination with the newmark β method and verified by comparing the results with similar researches the authors also analyzed the influences of evacuation and current speeds the desired track of the drilling platform the weight of lower marine riser package lmrp and the length of the hang off drilling riser on drilling riser deformation and bending moment chen et al 2020 investigates the axial vibration of pipes subjected to the resonance excitation in previous studies the dynamic characteristics of risers in harsh environments are studied based on traditional hard and soft hang off this paper designs a new riser flexible hang off according to the technical characteristics of the above two kinds of hang off which can shorten the operation time of platform evacuation thus improving the platform s ability to cope with typhoon at the same time the new riser flexible hang off also can compensate riser heave dynamic load improve riser stress and ensure riser safety 2 structural description of riser flexible hang off system the schematic diagram of the riser flexible hang off device is shown in fig 2 the top half part in the figure is the riser flexible hang off device which is composed of three parts heave compensation mechanism riser clamping mechanism and heave movement guiding mechanism the whole device is installed on the chuck universal joint zuber et al 2011 the linkage and centralizer are the auxiliary devices of the riser flexible hang off device which can bear the static and the lateral load of the riser 1 motion compensation mechanism as shown in fig 3 eight hydraulic cylinders constitute the motion compensation mechanism eight hydraulic cylinders are connected to the base by bolts each two hydraulic cylinders are arranged in a group of circles the motion compensation mechanism increases the compensation stroke by moving pulley to twice the hydraulic cylinder stroke thus reducing the height of the whole device and improving the stability of the device 2 riser holding mechanism fig 4 shows the three dimensional structure of the riser gripper the riser gripper connects the compensation device to the riser xiao 2014 the chuck has four claws which are driven by four rotary hydraulic cylinders when the claws are completely open the riser hang off nipple can be completely passed when the claws are closed the riser is suspended from the riser clamping mechanism with the chuck 3 motion guiding mechanism as shown in fig 5 the guide device is composed of four sets of guide wheels and guide rail which limits the riser to move only in the vertical direction and bear the load parallel to the drill floor direction so as to ensure the normal work of the compensation mechanism the guide rail is connected to the base by bolts the guide wheel module is installed on the bearing plate and the four guide rail in the middle position is connected to eight compensation hydraulic cylinders by connecting tiles 3 riser flexible hang off compensation strategy limited by the operating conditions of the drilling platform the riser flexible hang off device cannot adopt the control strategy of full stroke compensation like the tensioner and must use the limited compensation cylinder stroke to reduce the peak dynamic load generated by the riser so it is necessary to find a reasonable and effective compensation strategy two control strategies are proposed in this paper including the proportional compensation strategy and the backpressure variable damping compensation strategy the riser flexible hang off is studied based on the once in a decade sea conditions in the western pacific the specific sea conditions parameters and basic parameters are shown in table 2 3 1 proportional compensation strategy the proportional compensation strategy compensates the riser s movement in full period according to the period of platform motion the compensation is carried out with fixed amplitude from the perspective of displacement analysis the riser is suspended so that the riser compensates for the movement of the platform with the opposite trend and equal period quan et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the acceleration curve of the proportional compensation strategy is shown in fig 6 fig 7 is the proportional compensation strategy model y is the platform displacement x is the riser displacement k is the equivalent stiffness of the hydraulic spring of the hang off device due to the short travel of the hang off device s hydraulic cylinder it can be approximated as a linear spring and c is the viscous damping of the hydraulic system because the flexible suspension of the water pipe is less than the amplitude of the wave it is not possible to use the pure passive compensation method like tensioner and therefore needs to be controlled by the main power sten r et al 2010 gallagher c et al 2012 fac is the main power exerted on the riser by the active hydraulic cylinder and variable pump the mathematical model of proportional compensation strategy system is 1 m x c x k x k y c y f a c where f ac is the active force y is the platform displacement m x is the riser displacement k is the

the riser γ is frequency ratio ξ is damping ratio ω 0 is natural frequency of hang off system ω is platform heave motion frequency fig 8 and fig 9 show the curve of the change of the amplitude of the riser s absolute displacement steady state response with the frequency ratio and the curve of the relationship between phase difference and frequency ratio as can be seen from fig 8 when the frequency ratio is close to 0 the riser s absolute displacement tends to 0 meanwhile as can be seen from fig 9 when the frequency ratio is close to 0 the phase difference is also close to 0 hydraulic cylinder piston movement direction and the platform movement direction opposite therefore from the perspective of phase analysis the model can achieve approximate proportional compensation in order to analyze the feasibility of the compensation strategy the variable pump power required by the proportional compensation strategy and the relationship between the compensation effect and frequency ratio and damping ratio are analyzed this model requires the hydraulic cylinder to provide the main power f ac and the variable pump power p p is calculated by ignoring the transmission efficiency 5 p p f a c δ x relative displacement of riser z x y 6 z z sin ω t φ z cos ϕ y 2 x sin ϕ 2 where φ is relative displacement of riser steady state response phase difference as shown in fig 10 when the damping ratio factor ξ 0 05 0 5 the variable pump power along with the change of frequency ratio can be seen that with the increase of frequency than the variable pump power decreases reducing speed slower and slower and damping ratio the greater the variable pump power is smaller as shown in fig 11 when the damping ratio factor ξ 0 05 0 5 compensation ability decreases with the increase of frequency ratio reduce speed faster and faster and damping ratio compensation ability is lower the greater the compensation ability reduce the faster combined with figs 9 and 10 it can be concluded that under the proportional compensation strategy when the system takes small damping ratio and high frequency ratio the required variable pump power is small and the compensation capacity is high as shown in table 1 is that under the limit state of sea when the damping ratio factor ξ 0 05 corresponding to different frequency ratio of the variable pump power and the rate of compensation when the damping ratio factor ξ 0 05 system compensation rate to 26 22 to achieve 26 22 compensation efficiency the system needs a maximum pump power of 9112 kw therefore the biggest problem of proportional compensation strategy requires large power of motor and v pump to solve this problem a new compensation strategy is explored 3 2 compensation strategy for backpressure variable damping the back pressure variable damping compensation strategy compensates the heave motion by changing the damping ratio of the hand off system the damping ratio is changed by controlling the opening size of the proportional throttle valve the riser flexible hang off device is designed to reduce the dynamic load of riser which dynamic load of riser is caused by riser acceleration thus the effect of compensation strategy on riser acceleration is studied based on riser acceleration the solid line shown in fig 12 is the acceleration of the platform the dotted line is the compensated riser acceleration without compensation the riser follows the platform and the riser acceleration equals the platform acceleration the am value is set according to the heave motion parameters of the platform under the back pressure variable damping compensation strategy the flexible hang off device compensates the riser acceleration to the interval a m a m in the first cycle for example to introduce back pressure variable damping compensation strategy flexible hang off did not work at t 0 riser do heave motion follow platform together to the t1 time monitoring to the riser acceleration is beyond the range of a m a m lower limit this time by adjusting the throttle valve opening size control riser acceleration keep a m is the same during this process the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder is extended when platform acceleration back to the a m a m when the piston to continue upward movement continues to control the riser accelerating to a m is the same at the time of t2 when s 1 s 2 as shown in fig 12 the piston moves to the highest point currently the throttle valve closes and the riser follows the platform to make heave motion again at the time of t3 the acceleration of the riser is detected to exceed the upper limit of the interval a m a m at this time the acceleration of the riser is controlled by adjusting the opening size of the throttle valve to keep a m constant during this process the piston of the hydraulic cylinder moves downward when platform acceleration back to the a m a m the piston to continue downward movement riser acceleration keeps a m is the same at the time of t4 when s 3 s 4 as shown in fig 12 piston rod back completely piston stop motion at this time closed throttle valve riser motion with platform and completed a motor cycle control according to the velocity of piston moving to both ends of hydraulic cylinder is zero and the displacement of piston moving is less than the travel of hydraulic cylinder the compensation efficiency of back pressure variable damping compensation strategy is calculated 7 v h t 1 t 2 a h d t 0 x h max t 1 t 2 a h d t d t l a h 1 2 a p max 1 η a a p t 1 arcsin η a 1 ω where v h is the speed at which the piston moves to the end a h is piston acceleration t 1 and t 2 is the moment the piston moves to both ends of the cylinder x hmax is maximum piston displacement l is stroke of hydraulic cylinder a p is platform heave acceleration a pmax is maximum platform acceleration η a is compensation effect equation 7 is used to calculate the compensation capability of the back pressure damping compensation strategy under extreme sea conditions and compare it with the proportional compensation control strategy as shown in fig 13 it can be seen from the fig 13 that in extreme sea conditions the compensation capacity of the back pressure variation damping compensation strategy is higher than that of the proportional compensation strategy when the hydraulic cylinder stroke is less than 1 85m therefore the back pressure variation damping compensation strategy is easy to achieve better control effect when the stroke is short 4 design and calculation of riser flexible hang off hydraulic system 4 1 hydraulic system design according to the above control strategy a one way differential scheme of hydraulic cylinder is designed to realize the back pressure variable damping compensation strategy the hydraulic system schematic diagram is shown in fig 14 the hydraulic cylinder relates to the gas liquid converter and gas bottle through the ratio throttle block and the pressure of the hydraulic cylinder without rod cavity is adjusted by controlling the opening of the throttle valve port the specific working process of the hydraulic system is as follows when the pressure of hydraulic cylinder rod less than a certain set value is detected the gas liquid converter pushes the piston upward controls the throttle valve opening size to keep the cylinder rod less pressure unchanged check valve 1 opens check valve 2 closes hydraulic cylinder differential connection the effective area is the piston rod area when the pressure in the hydraulic cylinder rod less chamber is detected to be higher than a certain set value the piston moves downward to control the throttle valve opening size to control the pressure in the hydraulic cylinder rod less chamber first the hydraulic oil is charged to the gas liquid converter when the pressure in the gas liquid converter reaches the pressure set by overflow valve the overflow valve opens and the hydraulic oil flows into the oil tank the oil set aside by the overflow valve is high temperature oil which enters the oil tank after being cooled by the cooler system the cooled oil is pumped into the low pressure accumulator 4 2 calculation of key

total working area of hydraulic cylinder the flow curve over time is shown in fig 16 set the flow as positive when the piston is moving upward and negative when the piston is moving downward the peak flow value of the lower stroke is greater than that of the upper stroke which is caused by different acting areas the maximum flow value of the system is 8 75 m3 min 3 gas cylinder volume calculation according to the principle of the hydraulic system the cylinder pressure in the compensation process meets the following conditions p h 1 p a p h 2 in addition due to the gas liquid converter flowing into and out of the hydraulic oil during the compensation process the change of cylinder pressure will be caused and the pressure fluctuation of the cylinder needs to be limited to not too large and the preset cylinder pressure fluctuation δp 1 mpa equation can be obtained from the gas state equation 11 p a 1 v 1 1 4 p a 2 v 2 1 4 v 2 v 1 δ v p a 1 p a 2 δ p δ v a 3 l where p a is gas cylinder

cylinder pressure fluctuation according to the equation 11 the relation curve between cylinder volume and cylinder pressure fluctuation can be obtained as shown in fig 17 as the cylinder volume gradually increases the cylinder pressure fluctuation drops rapidly from the beginning to the slow attenuation later considering the cost and effect the cylinder volume is 6 75m3 5 simulation analysis of riser flexible suspension system this section simulates the control strategy by establishing the mathematical model of the hydraulic system of the flexible hang off device by using simulink the influence of each parameter on the compensation performance of the hang off device are analyzed 5 1 establishment of simulation model as shown in fig 18 the riser flexible hang off simulink model is composed of the following modules riser load model hydraulic cylinder piston model pressure transfer model throttle valve model gas cylinder model control system model and theoretical calculation

mathematical model of riser fig 19 shows the stress diagram of the riser in order to facilitate the study in this paper the riser is simplified into a mass block the riser is subjected to the tension of the compensation device the viscous damping force of seawater its own gravity seawater buoyancy and the tension of the linkage the gravity of the riser and its buoyancy are static and combine to be the wet weight thus the mathematical model of the riser is as follows lü et al 2018 12 f h g f l f s c g x g m g x g where f hg is the force of the hydraulic cylinder on the riser f l is the force of

between the riser and the piston in the downstroke process of the piston of the hydraulic cylinder different from the upper stroke process the hydraulic cylinder in the lower stroke process is in the direct motion mode and the effective action area is the area of the rod cavity the piston mathematical model of the hydraulic cylinder is as follows 14 p h a 1 f g h m h g c h x h f m h x j h 3 mathematical model of gas cylinder when the minimum volume of the gas cylinder is v 2 the maximum pressure of the gas cylinder is p a 2 the piston is then located at the lowest end of the hydraulic cylinder during the upper stroke of the hydraulic cylinder the hydraulic oil flows from the gas liquid converter through the throttle valve to the non rod chamber of the hydraulic cylinder and the volume of gas expands in the gas bottle during the lower stroke of the hydraulic cylinder the hydraulic oil flows from the non rod chamber of the hydraulic cylinder to the gas liquid converter through the throttle valve when the volume of gas in the gas bottle is compressed to the minimum volume v 2 the overflow valve starts to overflow to ensure that the volume of gas in the gas bottle remains unchanged the piston moves upward or downward the hydraulic oil flow through the throttle valve q j is integrated to obtain the volume of the hydraulic oil flowing through the throttle valve into the gas liquid converter which is the change of the gas volume of the cylinder δ v the sum of δ v and v 2 is the real time gas volume according to the gas state equation the real time gas pressure of the gas bottle is calculated gas bottle pressure at any time can be calculated by gas state equation 15 p a 2 v 2 1 4 p a v 2 q j d t 1 4 where q j is the flow of oil through the throttle valve with the direction of flow of the gas cylinder to the hydraulic cylinder as the positive direction the pressure inside the gas cylinder is higher than the pressure inside the rod free chamber of the hydraulic

riser acceleration a p is platform heave acceleration fig 21 shows the simulation curve of riser acceleration the simulink model of riser flexible suspension system adopts pid algorithm to travel control silva 2002 skogestad 2004 after tuning pid parameters the peak acceleration of riser decreases and the compensation effect is 30 the real curve of riser acceleration is consistent with the ideal curve the displacement curve of the piston of the hydraulic cylinder is calculated and it is found that the displacement deviation of the piston contributes to the occurrence of cylinder collision accident therefore it is necessary to control the displacement of the piston the piston displacement is controlled within the stroke interval 0 l of the hydraulic cylinder the piston displacement is controlled by adjusting the acceleration control interval which is adjusted to a m δ a a m δ a the piston displacement control algorithm is shown in formula 19 19 x h 0 δ a 0 0 x h l δ a 0 x h l δ a 0 where x h is displacement of piston δ a is adjustment deviation of acceleration control interval the piston displacement simulation curve is shown in fig 22 the piston displacement is controlled within the stroke range of the hydraulic cylinder through piston displacement control to avoid the occurrence of collision accident 5 3 simulation study on key parameters of the system since the main power component of the hydraulic system is the gas cylinder and the main control component is the throttle valve influences of gas cylinder and throttle valve parameters on the system performance are investigated in this subsection 5 3 1 the influence of gas cylinder parameters on compensation performance 1 the influence of gas cylinder volume on compensation performance according to the cylinder calculation and selection the gas cylinder volume is 6 75m3 in order to analyze the influence of the cylinder volume on the compensation effect the cylinder volume is simulated by taking different values fig 23 shows the control effect of riser acceleration under different cylinder volumes under the same pid parameter when the cylinder volume reaches 4 5m3 the riser acceleration oscillates significantly when the device starts analysis of the reasons the smaller the cylinder volume in the piston movement process of the cylinder pressure change rate is greater the more difficult the riser acceleration control in the process of analysis it is found that increasing the integral coefficient kd of pid controller can still achieve better control effect after reducing the cylinder volume and the influence of cylinder volume on the riser acceleration control effect is small after adjusting pid parameters 2 influence of gas cylinder filling pressure on compensation performance according to the calculation in section 4 2 the gas cylinder pressure is required to meet the conditions of 15 89mpa pa 27 22mpa in this interval different values are taken to change the gas cylinder filling pressure in the model for simulation and the influence of the cylinder filling pressure on the acceleration control effect is analyzed fig 24 shows the control effect of riser acceleration under cylinder pressure of 17 mpa 21 mpa and 27 mpa respectively it can be seen from the image curve that the control effect in the upper stroke process of the hydraulic cylinder is poor and the control effect in the lower stroke is ideal when the gas cylinder filling pressure is small and the control effect in the lower stroke process is poor and the control effect in the upper stroke is ideal when the gas cylinder filling pressure is large 5 3 2 the influence of throttle parameters on compensation performance the influence of the valve movement time constant t and the valve displacement voltage gain k on the riser acceleration compensation performance is analyzed the time constant t determines the response speed of the throttle valve as shown in fig 25 the acceleration curve of the riser after compensation when the time constant t is 0 1 0 02 and 0 004 as can be seen from fig 25 when the time constant t is taken at different values the acceleration curves of the riser are approximately identical so the time constant t has little impact on the system performance adjust the spool displacement voltage gain k and analyze the influence of spool displacement voltage gain k on the riser acceleration compensation effect according to the riser acceleration curve because of the different flow rate through the throttle valve in the up and down stroke of the hydraulic cylinder the control effect of riser acceleration in the up and down stroke of the hydraulic cylinder is analyzed respectively fig 26 shows the riser acceleration curve after compensation when the spool displacement voltage gain k is 0 001 0 003 and 0 005 the greater the value of valve core displacement voltage gain k the faster the throttle response speed the smaller the riser acceleration compensation error hydraulic cylinder upper stroke flow through the throttle valve is small riser acceleration compensation error is small hydraulic cylinder lower stroke flow through the proportional throttle valve is large riser acceleration compensation error is also large 6 conclusion aiming at the safety problem of drilling platform when hanging riser to avoid typhoon this paper designs a new riser flexible suspension system including structural design and hydraulic system design two compensation strategies of proportional compensation and backpressure variable damping compensation have been proposed by establishing simulink model the compensation effect of backpressure variable damping compensation strategy has been verified and the influence of key parameters of the system on the compensation effect has been analyzed the following conclusions are drawn 1 through the analysis of compensation mechanism the proportional compensation strategy requires additional main power and a very large pump power 2 the back pressure variable damping strategy is better than the proportional compensation strategy when the stroke of the hydraulic cylinder be less than 1 85m 3 the designed riser flexible hang off system can effectively reduce the heave dynamic load of risers due to platform movement by using the compensation strategy of backpressure variable damping the compensation efficiency is 30 when the stroke of the hydraulic cylinder is 1 2 m 4 the influence of key parameters of the system on the compensation effect is analyzed the accumulator volume has little influence on the compensation effect when the inflation pressure is large the upper stroke compensation effect is better while when the inflation pressure is small the lower stroke compensation effect is better throttle valve core displacement voltage gain should be selected larger throttle throttle valve nominal flow the smaller the compensation error credit

20439,plate anchors have been increasingly used to provide a mooring system for offshore floating facilities due to their relatively high efficiency and low costs the analysis of anchor behaviour can be usually divided into two categories immediate breakaway and no breakaway which correspond to the vented anchors and attached anchors most of the previous literatures focus on these two extreme cases vented anchors in clays without weight and attached anchors however the vented anchors in clays with weight as a most common state are in the intermediate state of the two extreme cases at the cases the change law of the pullout capacity of plate anchors with embedment depth inclination angles and overburden pressure is relatively complex and needs further study this paper investigates the pullout behaviour of inclined strip plate anchors in clays with linearly increasing shear strength by performing a series of finite element analysis and clarify the change law of the pullout capacity and the failure mechanism of plate anchor in the intermediate state two new formulas are proposed to predict the pullout factor for inclined vented and attached anchors related research results can provide a reference for the engineering design of inclined plate anchors in undrained clay keywords plate anchors clays pullout capacity inclined loading offshore geotechnics finite element analysis 1 introduction large floating structures such as fpso floating production storage and offloading have become increasingly popular in offshore engineering with the development of oil and gas exploitation from shallow water to deep water 500 m depth randolph et al 2011 in the complex marine environment the floating platform is connected to the anchor foundation embedded in the seabed through catenary or taut wire moorings to resist the combined vertical and horizontal pullout loads caused by the action of waves winds and currents as one of the anchor foundations plate anchors have been widely studied because of their relatively high efficiency and low cost compared to the conventional piles mat foundations and gravity structures yu et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the ultimate pullout capacity of the plate anchor has always been a key factor in engineering design to ensure the safety of floating structures previous studies paid more attention to horizontal or vertical plate anchors model tests were performed to study the pullout behaviour of plate anchors in clays das 1978 1980 1985 singh and ramaswamy 2008 lai et al 2020 a number of investigations have quantified the anchor pullout resistance in clays using the limit equilibrium method and finite element method rowe and davis 1982 merifield et al 2001 2003 khatri et al 2009 bhattacharya 2016 zhang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 in addition some researchers song et al 2008 wang et al 2006 2010 2013 tho et al 2013 chen et al 2013 liu et al 2014 tian et al 2015 maitra et al 2019 yang et al 2021 used the large deformation finite element method to investigate the plate anchor behaviour in clays during continuous pullout process the anchor plate is commonly placed at an inclination angle in actual engineering some studies have been carried out on inclined plate anchors in clays das 1989 investigated the holding capacity of inclined shallow square plate anchors by performing laboratory model tests merifield et al 2005 evaluated the stability of inclined strip anchors using numerical limit analysis choudhury and rao 2005 investigated the seismic uplift capacity of inclined strip anchors by limit equilibrium approaches gaudin et al 2009 investigated the process of keying of plate anchors in normally consolidated clay under inclined loading yu et al 2011 investigated the coupling effects of anchor inclination clay nonhomogeneity and self weight on the pullout capacity of strip plate anchors fahmy et al 2013 investigated the behaviour of vertical anchors subjected to inclined loads applied at the anchor top jesmani et al 2013 proposed an expression to estimate the ultimate pullout resistance of plates with different dimensions and inclination angles charlton et al 2016 evaluated the ultimate pullout capacity of inclined plate anchors in structured clay using an advanced constitutive model considering the degradation of clay structures singh et al 2017 proposed a generalized design approach for inclined strip anchors in clays by performing a series of finite element analyses the analysis of anchor behaviour can be usually divided into two categories based on rowe et al 1982 immediate breakaway and no breakaway which correspond to the vented anchors and attached anchors the former assumes that there is no suction between anchor and soil while the latter assumes that there is sufficient suction to ensure that the anchor is always in contact with the soil however the true breakaway state is between the extremities of the two cases which represent the lower and upper bounds most of the previous literatures on numerical simulation focus on these two extreme cases vented anchors in clays without weight and attached anchors however the vented anchors in clays with weight as a most common state are in the intermediate state of the two extreme cases when considering the soil weight the superposition principle is often used in the existing literature by assuming that soil weight can be directly superimposed to the pullout capacity factor of plate anchors in clays without weight obviously it is more practical to apply soil weight directly to the soil domain during the finite element analysis however at the cases the change law of the pullout capacity of plate anchors with embedment depth inclination angles and overburden pressure is relatively complex and needs further study hence this paper will investigate the pullout behaviour of inclined strip plate anchors in clays with linearly increasing shear strength by performing a series of finite element analysis main objectives of the paper focus on a clarify the change law of the pullout capacity and the failure mechanism of plate anchor in the intermediate state b compare the difference of the pullout capacity and the failure mechanism under these three cases in this study the plate anchors are wished into place at each specific embedment depth without consideration of large deformations during pullout previous small strain finite element studies have given adequate solutions for the ultimate pullout capacity when compared with results of laboratory experiments and limit analysis formulations rowe and davis 1982 yu et al 2011 charlton et al 2016 2 problem description the primary design concern is the ultimate pullout capacity of plate anchors embedded in clays it is generally expressed as a pullout capacity factor 1 n c f u a s u where n c is the pullout capacity factor f u is the ultimate pullout load a is the plate area s u is the undrained shear strength of clays which can be taken as the value at the centre of the anchor plate and represented by s u h when the anchor is installed in clays with an undrained shear strength that increases with depth yu et al 2011 charlton et al 2016 dnv rp e302 2002 in the present numerical simulation the strip plate anchor is 3 m wide and 0 3 m thick the undrained shear strength s u is assumed to linearly increase along the depth as follows 2 s u s u 0 k z where s u is the undrained shear strength of clays s u 0 is the shear strength at the mudline z is the depth of the soil layer k is the increasing gradient of soil strength which reflects the clay inhomogeneity the effective unit weight of clays γ is 8 kn m3 the distribution of the anchor plate embedding and soil strength is shown in fig 1 β is the inclination angle of the anchor plate relative to the horizontal direction and ranges from 0 to 90 b is the anchor width b 3 m h is the embedment depth which is the distance between the mud surface and the centre of the anchor plate the pullout capacity factor n c is affected by many factors such as the anchor depth anchor inclination overburden pressure in addition it is affected by the anchor soil interface condition physically suction may develop behind the anchor when it is subjected to a pullout load the suction force is likely to be a function of several variables including the embedment depth soil permeability undrained shear strength and loading rate as such the actual magnitude of any suction force is highly uncertain merifield et al 2005 at present it is still difficult to simulate the suction force quantitatively the anchor soil interface condition of immediate breakaway and no breakaway reflects two extreme states of suction force no suction force and enough suction force and thus the former is conservative the latter is opposite for cohesive soil many existing literatures still use these two kinds of interface conditions to consider the extreme case of suction force merifield et al 2005 song et al 2008 yu et al 2011 fahmy et al 2013 charlton et al 2016 seven inclination angles and eight anchor depths are set up to investigate the effect of the inclination angles and embedment depth on the pullout capacity of anchor plates β 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 and h b 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 h b is the embedment ratio four cases are set to investigate the effect of the anchor soil interface and soil weight on the pullout capacity case 1 vented anchors in clays without weight case 2 vented anchors in clays with weight case 3 attached anchors in clays without weight case 4 attached anchors in clays with weight in addition γ h s uh is commonly used to represent the dimensionless overburden pressure merifield et al 2005 yu et al 2011 γ is constant in the entire study then γ h s uh greatly increases with decreasing s uh at identical embedment depth h in other words a smaller s uh corresponds to a larger γ h s uh hence three different strength profiles s u 1 3z s u 1 1 4z and s u 1 0 5z are used to represent three levels of overburden pressure low overburden pressure relatively moderate overburden pressure and high overburden pressure it should be noted that the range from uniform clay to nc clay of 0 1 3z covers the practical range in geotechnical design yu et al 2011 hence three k values k 3 1 4 0 5 within this range are chosen the dimensionless ratio of kb s uh is taken as the clay nonhomogeneity factor yu et al 2011 the values of γ h s uh and kb s uh corresponding to three different strength profiles are shown in table 1 3 finite element model a two dimensional finite element model of a plate anchor in normally consolidated clays is created using 6 node quadratic plane strain triangle elements cpe6 based on abaqus software finite element models of anchor plates for β 0 and h b 2 β 45 and h b 8 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively the size of the soil domain is set as 21b 14b for all cases except for an anchor depth case of h b 10 it is set as 21b 17b in this case to avoid the boundary effects on the numerical results a horizontal constraint is applied to the vertical boundary of the soil domain and a fixed constraint is applied to the bottom boundary but the top boundary is free the mesh around the anchor plate within one anchor width is refined to improve the calculation accuracy see the refined area in fig 2 a mesh sensitivity study is performed to determine an appropriate mesh coarseness for the finite element model the calculation results of n c under different node numbers are shown in fig 3 n c is basically unchanged when the number of nodes is more than 30 000 which implies that a high calculation accuracy can be achieved in this case the mesh contains approximately 35 000 nodes for all finite element models in this paper a mohr coulomb failure criterion that models the elastic perfectly plastic behaviour is adopted to simulate the behaviour of the clay poisson s ratio ν 0 49 and friction and dilation angles ϕ ψ 0 are set to simulate the undrained condition khatri et al 2009 yu et al 2011 fahmy et al 2013 the plate anchor is assumed to be a perfectly rigid body the elastic modulus of clays is set as 500 s u the usdfld subroutine is used to define the undrained shear strength and elastic modulus which linearly increase along the soil depth for the case of clays with weight gravity is first applied to the soil domain to produce an initial stress field then an uplift displacement is applied to the anchor plate until failure occurs for the case of clays without weight the uplift displacement is directly applied to the anchor for the case of attached the tie contact is set between the back of the anchor plate and the surrounding clays to ensure that the anchor is always in contact with the soils for the case of vented the interface between them is defined by tangential and normal behaviours in tangential behaviour a penalty friction formulation is used with a friction coefficient of 0 3 in normal behaviour hard contact is defined for the pressure overclosure jesmani et al 2012 islam et al 2019 and separation after contact is allowed in tangential contact the specifying maximum shear stress τ max is set as α s u which implies that the soil nodes start sliding along the anchor plate when the shear stress between soil and anchor exceeds τ max here α is assumed to be 0 3 throughout the analysis to simulate a rough anchor 4 validation of numerical model reliable research results have been obtained on vented and attached anchors in weightless homogeneous clays merifield et al 2001 yu et al 2011 hence the pullout capacity of the plate anchor in homogeneous clays s u 20 kpa is first calculated to verify the reliability of the numerical model in this paper in comparison with the existing research results fig 4 shows the comparison of the current calculated results with those of merifield et al 2001 and yu et al 2011 under shallow embedment conditions h b 2 and deep embedment conditions h b 8 n c almost does not change with increasing inclination angles for the attached anchor in the deep embedment condition however n c significantly decreases in the shallow embedment condition n c increases when the inclination angle increases for the vented anchor in both shallow and deep embedment conditions the calculated results in this paper are basically consistent with previous results in the literature although there are deviations the anchor is completely smooth in yu et al s study hence the result is relatively conservative however the friction coefficient is set as 0 3 between the plate and the surrounding clays in the current study as a result the current results are slightly higher than those of yu et al in addition the choice of different anchor sizes and soil strengths during the calculation contributes to the deviation and the finite element calculation has a certain error overall the deviation is acceptable the comparison shows the reliability of the numerical model in this paper 5 numerical simulation results and discussion 5 1 load displacement behaviour fig 5 presents normalized load displacement curves with pullout capacity factor n c and the total displacement normalized by the anchor width d b for a horizontal anchor figs 5 a and b correspond to the shallow embedment anchor h b 2 and deep embedment anchor h b 8 with four cases for different anchor soil interfaces and soil weight conditions respectively the figures show that the pullout resistance of the anchor plate increases with increasing displacement and the rate of increase is higher at the initial stage of loading and then gradually decreases when the displacement reaches a certain value the pullout resistance no longer increases which implies that the ultimate pullout capacity is attained in this case the failure displacement that corresponds to the ultimate pullout capacity is commonly less than 0 3 times the anchor width as shown in the figure the load displacement curve is basically identical for case 3 and case 4 which indicates that the soil weight has no effect on the pullout capacity of the attached anchor the main reason is that the soil weight does not affect the failure mechanism of the plate anchor under attached conditions however the failure mechanism determines the bearing capacity the failure mechanism in different cases will be introduced in detail in section 5 3 the soil weight significantly affects the pullout capacity of the vented anchor when we compare case 1 with case 2 the embedment depth significantly affects the pullout capacity for both attached and vented anchors by comparing fig 5 a with b it should be noted that the clay nonhomogeneity has an effect on the form of load displacement curves the bearing capacity does not reach the ultimate value within a limited displacement for some cases of nonhomogeneity in such cases the displacement failure criterion of the plate anchor is taken as 0 3 times the anchor width according to dnv rp e302 2002 5 2 pullout capacity factor fig 6 shows the pullout capacity factor n c with embedment ratio h b for various inclination angles β at different anchor soil interfaces and soil weight conditions for vented anchors in clays without weight case 1 fig 6 a d g show that n c increases when h b increases for all β and the increasing rate gradually decreases but does not tend to be zero this change trend of curves is consistent with the numerical results of yu et al s 2011 for the vented anchor in weightless homogeneous clays the clay nonhomogeneity kb s uh decreases with the decrease of k for three different strength profiles when h b is small such as h b 1 as shown in table 1 so n c increases slightly as k decreases by comparing fig 6 a d g kb s uh is almost the same for large h b such as h b 10 hence n c is almost the same for such cases the comparation means that n c is negatively correlated with clay nonhomogeneity for attached anchors in clays without with weight cases 3 and 4 fig 6 c f i show that the soil weight does not affect n c for attached anchors the change trend of n c with h b has some difference compared to the vented anchor n c tends to be constant when h b is greater than 8 for various β which implies that the embedment depth hardly affects the ultimate pullout capacity when it exceeds a certain value in the attached cases in addition n c is almost the same although the overburden pressure is different for fig 6 c f i the main reason is that n c has reached the limit value at the attached cases and the overburden pressure has no effect on n c for such cases for vented anchors in clays with weight case 2 fig 6 b e h show that the value of n c is between the two extremes of case 1 and case 3 the change trend of n c with h b for various β is closely related to the overburden pressure at the low overburden pressure s u 1 3z the change trend in fig 6 b is similar to that of vented anchors in clays without weight in fig 6 a at a high overburden pressure s u 1 0 5z the change trend in fig 6 h is similar to that of the attached anchor in fig 6 i at a relatively moderate overburden pressure s u 1 1 4z n c increases with increasing h b and the increasing rate gradually decreases as shown in fig 6 e however it seems to be much complex because of the intersection of some curves corresponding to different inclination angles according to the superposition assumption merifield et al 2001 yu et al 2011 n c equals to the sum of the value corresponding to vented anchors in clays without weight denoted as n c 0 and γ h s uh corresponding to overburden pressure but n c will not exceed the value corresponding to attached anchors denoted as n c the above limitation of n c value should be the main reason for the complexity the variation of n c with β for different h b is shown in fig 7 for vented anchors in clays without weight case 1 fig 7 a d g show that n c increases when β increases for all h b however the increasing rate of n c with β of 0 90 varies for different h b the difference is more intuitive in the corresponding figure where the ordinate n c is normalized by n c β 90 n c for β 90 as shown in fig 8 a corresponding to fig 7 d the increasing rate of n c is much higher for smaller h b specifically n c at 0 is approximately 0 4 and 0 83 times the value at 90 for h b 1 and 10 respectively for attached anchors cases 3 and 4 the variation trend of n c with β is in contrast to that of case 1 as shown in fig 7 c f i n c decreases when β increases for various h b and the decreasing rate is much higher for smaller h b n c at 90 is approximately 0 6 and 0 98 times the value at 0 for h b 1 and 10 respectively as shown in fig 8 c corresponding to fig 7 f for vented anchors in clays with weight case 2 fig 7 b e h at low overburden pressure s u 1 3z n c increases when β increases for various h b in fig 7 b and the change trend of n c with β is similar to that of vented anchors in clays without weight in fig 7 a at a high overburden pressure s u 1 0 5z n c decreases when β increases for various h b in fig 7 h and the change trend of n c is similar to that of the attached anchors in fig 7 i the change trend of n c with β is much more complex at a relatively moderate overburden pressure s u 1 1 4z as shown in fig 7 e at some embedment depth n c does not monotonically change with increasing β but reaches a maximum at a certain angle and gradually decreases that is to say the peak value of n c is not always at 0 or 90 the change trend is particularly significant when the embedment depth is shallow which can be seen more intuitively in fig 8 b as mentioned above the limitation of n c value should be the direct cause of the complexity it should be noted that the change trend of n c with β is just the opposite for these two extreme states vented anchors in clays without weight case 1 and attached anchors cases 3 and 4 with the increase of overburden pressure the anchor failure mechanism gradually transits from vented failure mechanism to attached failure mechanism and then the change trend of n c with β gradually reverses in the process of transformation the change trend will inevitably go through a relatively complex stage at a moderate overburden pressure hence the essential reason for the complexity should be that anchor failure results from the coupling of the vented failure mechanism and attached failure mechanism the former is dominant at a relatively low overburden pressure and the latter is dominant at a relatively high overburden pressure das and puri 1989 proposed a simple empirical relationship to estimate the capacity of inclined anchors based on their laboratory findings this relationship has the following form 3 n c β n c β 0 n c β 90 n c β 0 β 90 2 where n c β is the pullout factor of the anchor plate with an arbitrary inclined angle of 0 90 n c β 0 and n c β 90 are the pullout capacity factors for the horizontal and vertical anchors the applicability of this relationship for inclined vented anchors in weightless homogeneous clay has been validated by merifield et al 2005 the relationship is also applicable to the current calculated results for inclined vented anchors in weightless homogeneous clay as predicted based on eq 3 and shown in fig 4 the above relationship is also used to predict the pullout capacity factor of inclined vented anchor plates in normally consolidated weightless clay in this study and the related predicted results are plotted using the dashed line in fig 7 d the predictions are consistent with the numerical results in the overall trend but the relationship appears to underestimate the pullout capacity factor especially for the values of 30 75 in the shallow embedment cases the main reason for the deviation is that the real growth rate of n c in normally consolidated soil does not monotonically increase but generally decreases when the inclined angle is greater than 75 as shown in fig 7 d the trend is different from that of the dashed line which is obtained from eq 3 where the growth rate of n c monotonically increases with increasing inclination angles however for the case of weightless homogeneous clay the change trend of is completely consistent with that based on eq 3 hence eq 3 has good applicability for weightless homogeneous clay for normally consolidated weightless clay a new formula is proposed to reduce the predicted deviation as follows 4 n c β n c β 0 n c β 90 n c β 0 2 β 2 8000 β 2 the prediction based on eq 4 is consistent with the numerical result compared to eq 3 as shown by the dash dot line in fig 7 d obviously eq 3 proposed by das and puri 1989 is not applicable to attached anchors where the pullout capacity factor decreases with increasing inclination angles therefore the following formula is proposed to predict the pullout capacity factor for attached anchors 5 n c β n c β 0 n c β 90 n c β 0 2 5 β 2 4000 2 β 2 the dashed line in fig 7 f shows that the prediction is relatively consistent with the numerical result which indicates the good applicability of the formula for attached anchors in clays with linearly increasing shear strength 5 3 failure mechanism figs 9 and 10 show the failure mechanism of the plate anchor for different anchor soil interfaces and soil weight conditions at h b 2 and h b 8 respectively the failure mechanism is exactly identical for the attached anchors in clays with or without soil weight as shown in figs 9 c and 10 c the main reason is that tie contact fully bonded with enough suction force is set between the back of the anchor plate and the surrounding clays during computation under the attached condition in this case regardless of the soil weight the anchor remains in contact with the soil at all times and hence the soil behind the anchor plate has an intense displacement in the case of h b 2 in fig 9 for either vented or attached anchors the soil domain has an obvious shear failure surface that extends to the seabed surface which results in significant heave deformation of the soil surface for vented anchors in clays without weight in fig 9 a the anchor plate is immediately separated from the soil behind the anchor plate when it is pulled while a certain gap appears between the anchor plate and the soil behind it the failure runs immediately upwards and increases in width when weaker soil is activated the failure mechanism extends deeper into the soil with higher shear strength when the inclination angle increases hence the pullout capacity increases when the inclination angle increases in the vented condition the failure mechanism varies when we consider the soil weight under the vented condition as shown in fig 9 b immediate breakaway of anchor soil interface is set and separation between anchor and soil is allowed during computation the soil behind the anchor plate will flow to the anchor plate because of soil overburden pressure the magnitude of soil displacement depends on the overburden pressure and inclination angle and that becomes usually more significant as the inclination angle or overburden pressure increases it should be emphasized that even if shallow embedment depth large overburden pressure will still cause significant soil displacement obviously there are three ways to increase the dimensionless overburden pressure γ h s uh increasing γ increasing h or decreasing s uh therefore there is a situation where the embedment depth is shallow but the overburden pressure is still large the failure surface gradually expand meanwhile the anchor soil gap becomes narrower or even disappears when the inclination angle increases this failure mechanism for a higher inclination angle is closer to that in the attached case in fig 9 c for the attached anchor in fig 9 c the shear zone extends a distance beneath the anchor because the soil and anchor are fully bonded together which significantly adds to the resistance hence the pullout capacity is greater than that of the vented anchor in addition in the attached case the failure plane becomes much shorter when the inclination angle increases and the anchor resistance does not benefit from the increase in shear strength with depth hence the pullout capacity decreases when the inclination angle increases in the case of h b 8 in fig 10 the failure mechanism does not reach the ground surface for either vented or attached conditions compared to the vented anchor in clays without weight in fig 10 a when the soil weight is considered there is no gap between anchor plate and soil and the soil behind the anchor plate significantly flows due to the relatively high overburden pressure under deep embedment as shown in fig 10 b however the failure mechanism is also different from the attached case where the localization of plastic flow is evident in fig 10 c and plastic deformation extends further above the anchor than below due to the linearly increasing shear strength profile for the attached condition the localization failure mechanism forms for all inclination angles hence the effect of inclination angles on the pullout capacity is not significant in the case of deep embedment interestingly for the vented anchor in clays with weight an attached mechanism would form if the dimensionless overburden pressure γ h s uh is sufficiently high as noted by merifield et al 2005 song et al 2008 charlton et al 2016 here when h b 8 γ h s uh increases to 14 8 s u 1 0 5z from the original value of 5 5 s u 1 1 4z γ and h remain constant and only s u h decreases we find that this is indeed the case and the failure mechanism in the vented condition with a sufficiently high overburden pressure is very similar to the attached failure mechanism as shown in fig 11 6 conclusions the pullout capacity of inclined strip plate anchors in normally consolidated clays with linearly increasing shear strength along the depth has been investigated by performing a series of finite element analysis the key conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the change trend of n c with β is just the opposite for these two extreme states vented anchors in clays without weight and attached anchors for the former n c increases with increasing β while for the latter n c decreases with increasing β the increasing or decreasing rate is much higher for smaller embedment ratios 2 for the vented anchor in clays with weight the change trend of n c with β is similar to that of vented anchors in clays without weight under low overburden pressure and similar to that of attached anchors under high overburden pressure for a relatively moderate overburden pressure at some embedment depth n c does not monotonically change with increasing β but reaches a maximum at a certain angle and gradually decreases that is to say the peak value of n c is not always at 0 or 90 the change trend is particularly significant when the embedment depth is shallow 3 for the vented anchor in clays with weight with the increase of overburden pressure the anchor failure mechanism gradually transits from vented failure mechanism to attached failure mechanism and then the change trend of n c with β gradually reverses in the process of transformation the change trend will inevitably go through a relatively complex stage at a relatively moderate overburden pressure hence the essential reason for the complexity should be that anchor failure results from the coupling of the vented failure mechanism and attached failure mechanism the former is dominant at a relatively low overburden pressure and the latter is dominant at a relatively high overburden pressure 4 a new formula is proposed to predict the pullout factor for inclined vented anchors in weightless clay with linearly increasing shear strength which reduces the predicted deviation of the empirical relationship proposed by das and puri 1989 in addition a new formula with relatively high accuracy is proposed to predict the pullout capacity factor for inclined attached anchors 5 the failure mechanism varies when we consider the soil weight under the vented condition the soil behind the anchor plate will flow to the anchor plate because of soil overburden pressure the magnitude of soil displacement depends on the overburden pressure and inclination angle and that becomes usually more significant as the inclination angle or overburden pressure increases credit authorship contribution

20439,plate anchors have been increasingly used to provide a mooring system for offshore floating facilities due to their relatively high efficiency and low costs the analysis of anchor behaviour can be usually divided into two categories immediate breakaway and no breakaway which correspond to the vented anchors and attached anchors most of the previous literatures focus on these two extreme cases vented anchors in clays without weight and attached anchors however the vented anchors in clays with weight as a most common state are in the intermediate state of the two extreme cases at the cases the change law of the pullout capacity of plate anchors with embedment depth inclination angles and overburden pressure is relatively complex and needs further study this paper investigates the pullout behaviour of inclined strip plate anchors in clays with linearly increasing shear strength by performing a series of finite element analysis and clarify the change law of the pullout capacity and the failure mechanism of plate anchor in the intermediate state two new formulas are proposed to predict the pullout factor for inclined vented and attached anchors related research results can provide a reference for the engineering design of inclined plate anchors in undrained clay keywords plate anchors clays pullout capacity inclined loading offshore geotechnics finite element analysis 1 introduction large floating structures such as fpso floating production storage and offloading have become increasingly popular in offshore engineering with the development of oil and gas exploitation from shallow water to deep water 500 m depth randolph et al 2011 in the complex marine environment the floating platform is connected to the anchor foundation embedded in the seabed through catenary or taut wire moorings to resist the combined vertical and horizontal pullout loads caused by the action of waves winds and currents as one of the anchor foundations plate anchors have been widely studied because of their relatively high efficiency and low cost compared to the conventional piles mat foundations and gravity structures yu et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the ultimate pullout capacity of the plate anchor has always been a key factor in engineering design to ensure the safety of floating structures previous studies paid more attention to horizontal or vertical plate anchors model tests were performed to study the pullout behaviour of plate anchors in clays das 1978 1980 1985 singh and ramaswamy 2008 lai et al 2020 a number of investigations have quantified the anchor pullout resistance in clays using the limit equilibrium method and finite element method rowe and davis 1982 merifield et al 2001 2003 khatri et al 2009 bhattacharya 2016 zhang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 in addition some researchers song et al 2008 wang et al 2006 2010 2013 tho et al 2013 chen et al 2013 liu et al 2014 tian et al 2015 maitra et al 2019 yang et al 2021 used the large deformation finite element method to investigate the plate anchor behaviour in clays during continuous pullout process the anchor plate is commonly placed at an inclination angle in actual engineering some studies have been carried out on inclined plate anchors in clays das 1989 investigated the holding capacity of inclined shallow square plate anchors by performing laboratory model tests merifield et al 2005 evaluated the stability of inclined strip anchors using numerical limit analysis choudhury and rao 2005 investigated the seismic uplift capacity of inclined strip anchors by limit equilibrium approaches gaudin et al 2009 investigated the process of keying of plate anchors in normally consolidated clay under inclined loading yu et al 2011 investigated the coupling effects of anchor inclination clay nonhomogeneity and self weight on the pullout capacity of strip plate anchors fahmy et al 2013 investigated the behaviour of vertical anchors subjected to inclined loads applied at the anchor top jesmani et al 2013 proposed an expression to estimate the ultimate pullout resistance of plates with different dimensions and inclination angles charlton et al 2016 evaluated the ultimate pullout capacity of inclined plate anchors in structured clay using an advanced constitutive model considering the degradation of clay structures singh et al 2017 proposed a generalized design approach for inclined strip anchors in clays by performing a series of finite element analyses the analysis of anchor behaviour can be usually divided into two categories based on rowe et al 1982 immediate breakaway and no breakaway which correspond to the vented anchors and attached anchors the former assumes that there is no suction between anchor and soil while the latter assumes that there is sufficient suction to ensure that the anchor is always in contact with the soil however the true breakaway state is between the extremities of the two cases which represent the lower and upper bounds most of the previous literatures on numerical simulation focus on these two extreme cases vented anchors in clays without weight and attached anchors however the vented anchors in clays with weight as a most common state are in the intermediate state of the two extreme cases when considering the soil weight the superposition principle is often used in the existing literature by assuming that soil weight can be directly superimposed to the pullout capacity factor of plate anchors in clays without weight obviously it is more practical to apply soil weight directly to the soil domain during the finite element analysis however at the cases the change law of the pullout capacity of plate anchors with embedment depth inclination angles and overburden pressure is relatively complex and needs further study hence this paper will investigate the pullout behaviour of inclined strip plate anchors in clays with linearly increasing shear strength by performing a series of finite element analysis main objectives of the paper focus on a clarify the change law of the pullout capacity and the failure mechanism of plate anchor in the intermediate state b compare the difference of the pullout capacity and the failure mechanism under these three cases in this study the plate anchors are wished into place at each specific embedment depth without consideration of large deformations during pullout previous small strain finite element studies have given adequate solutions for the ultimate pullout capacity when compared with results of laboratory experiments and limit analysis formulations rowe and davis 1982 yu et al 2011 charlton et al 2016 2 problem description the primary design concern is the ultimate pullout capacity of plate anchors embedded in clays it is generally expressed as a pullout capacity factor 1 n c f u a s u where n c is the pullout capacity factor f u is the ultimate pullout load a is the plate area s u is the undrained shear strength of clays which can be taken as the value at the centre of the anchor plate and represented by s u h when the anchor is installed in clays with an undrained shear strength that increases with depth yu et al 2011 charlton et al 2016 dnv rp e302 2002 in the present numerical simulation the strip plate anchor is 3 m wide and 0 3 m thick the undrained shear strength s u is assumed to linearly increase along the depth as follows 2 s u s u 0 k z where s u is the undrained shear strength of clays s u 0 is the shear strength at the mudline z is the depth of the soil layer k is the increasing gradient of soil strength which reflects the clay inhomogeneity the effective unit weight of clays γ is 8 kn m3 the distribution of the anchor plate embedding and soil strength is shown in fig 1 β is the inclination angle of the anchor plate relative to the horizontal direction and ranges from 0 to 90 b is the anchor width b 3 m h is the embedment depth which is the distance between the mud surface and the centre of the anchor plate the pullout capacity factor n c is affected by many factors such as the anchor depth anchor inclination overburden pressure in addition it is affected by the anchor soil interface condition physically suction may develop behind the anchor when it is subjected to a pullout load the suction force is likely to be a function of several variables including the embedment depth soil permeability undrained shear strength and loading rate as such the actual magnitude of any suction force is highly uncertain merifield et al 2005 at present it is still difficult to simulate the suction force quantitatively the anchor soil interface condition of immediate breakaway and no breakaway reflects two extreme states of suction force no suction force and enough suction force and thus the former is conservative the latter is opposite for cohesive soil many existing literatures still use these two kinds of interface conditions to consider the extreme case of suction force merifield et al 2005 song et al 2008 yu et al 2011 fahmy et al 2013 charlton et al 2016 seven inclination angles and eight anchor depths are set up to investigate the effect of the inclination angles and embedment depth on the pullout capacity of anchor plates β 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 and h b 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 h b is the embedment ratio four cases are set to investigate the effect of the anchor soil interface and soil weight on the pullout capacity case 1 vented anchors in clays without weight case 2 vented anchors in clays with weight case 3 attached anchors in clays without weight case 4 attached anchors in clays with weight in addition γ h s uh is commonly used to represent the dimensionless overburden pressure merifield et al 2005 yu et al 2011 γ is constant in the entire study then γ h s uh greatly increases with decreasing s uh at identical embedment depth h in other words a smaller s uh corresponds to a larger γ h s uh hence three different strength profiles s u 1 3z s u 1 1 4z and s u 1 0 5z are used to represent three levels of overburden pressure low overburden pressure relatively moderate overburden pressure and high overburden pressure it should be noted that the range from uniform clay to nc clay of 0 1 3z covers the practical range in geotechnical design yu et al 2011 hence three k values k 3 1 4 0 5 within this range are chosen the dimensionless ratio of kb s uh is taken as the clay nonhomogeneity factor yu et al 2011 the values of γ h s uh and kb s uh corresponding to three different strength profiles are shown in table 1 3 finite element model a two dimensional finite element model of a plate anchor in normally consolidated clays is created using 6 node quadratic plane strain triangle elements cpe6 based on abaqus software finite element models of anchor plates for β 0 and h b 2 β 45 and h b 8 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively the size of the soil domain is set as 21b 14b for all cases except for an anchor depth case of h b 10 it is set as 21b 17b in this case to avoid the boundary effects on the numerical results a horizontal constraint is applied to the vertical boundary of the soil domain and a fixed constraint is applied to the bottom boundary but the top boundary is free the mesh around the anchor plate within one anchor width is refined to improve the calculation accuracy see the refined area in fig 2 a mesh sensitivity study is performed to determine an appropriate mesh coarseness for the finite element model the calculation results of n c under different node numbers are shown in fig 3 n c is basically unchanged when the number of nodes is more than 30 000 which implies that a high calculation accuracy can be achieved in this case the mesh contains approximately 35 000 nodes for all finite element models in this paper a mohr coulomb failure criterion that models the elastic perfectly plastic behaviour is adopted to simulate the behaviour of the clay poisson s ratio ν 0 49 and friction and dilation angles ϕ ψ 0 are set to simulate the undrained condition khatri et al 2009 yu et al 2011 fahmy et al 2013 the plate anchor is assumed to be a perfectly rigid body the elastic modulus of clays is set as 500 s u the usdfld subroutine is used to define the undrained shear strength and elastic modulus which linearly increase along the soil depth for the case of clays with weight gravity is first applied to the soil domain to produce an initial stress field then an uplift displacement is applied to the anchor plate until failure occurs for the case of clays without weight the uplift displacement is directly applied to the anchor for the case of attached the tie contact is set between the back of the anchor plate and the surrounding clays to ensure that the anchor is always in contact with the soils for the case of vented the interface between them is defined by tangential and normal behaviours in tangential behaviour a penalty friction formulation is used with a friction coefficient of 0 3 in normal behaviour hard contact is defined for the pressure overclosure jesmani et al 2012 islam et al 2019 and separation after contact is allowed in tangential contact the specifying maximum shear stress τ max is set as α s u which implies that the soil nodes start sliding along the anchor plate when the shear stress between soil and anchor exceeds τ max here α is assumed to be 0 3 throughout the analysis to simulate a rough anchor 4 validation of numerical model reliable research results have been obtained on vented and attached anchors in weightless homogeneous clays merifield et al 2001 yu et al 2011 hence the pullout capacity of the plate anchor in homogeneous clays s u 20 kpa is first calculated to verify the reliability of the numerical model in this paper in comparison with the existing research results fig 4 shows the comparison of the current calculated results with those of merifield et al 2001 and yu et al 2011 under shallow embedment conditions h b 2 and deep embedment conditions h b 8 n c almost does not change with increasing inclination angles for the attached anchor in the deep embedment condition however n c significantly decreases in the shallow embedment condition n c increases when the inclination angle increases for the vented anchor in both shallow and deep embedment conditions the calculated results in this paper are basically consistent with previous results in the literature although there are deviations the anchor is completely smooth in yu et al s study hence the result is relatively conservative however the friction coefficient is set as 0 3 between the plate and the surrounding clays in the current study as a result the current results are slightly higher than those of yu et al in addition the choice of different anchor sizes and soil strengths during the calculation contributes to the deviation and the finite element calculation has a certain error overall the deviation is acceptable the comparison shows the reliability of the numerical model in this paper 5 numerical simulation results and discussion 5 1 load displacement behaviour fig 5 presents normalized load displacement curves with pullout capacity factor n c and the total displacement normalized by the anchor width d b for a horizontal anchor figs 5 a and b correspond to the shallow embedment anchor h b 2 and deep embedment anchor h b 8 with four cases for different anchor soil interfaces and soil weight conditions respectively the figures show that the pullout resistance of the anchor plate increases with increasing displacement and the rate of increase is higher at the initial stage of loading and then gradually decreases when the displacement reaches a certain value the pullout resistance no longer increases which implies that the ultimate pullout capacity is attained in this case the failure displacement that corresponds to the ultimate pullout capacity is commonly less than 0 3 times the anchor width as shown in the figure the load displacement curve is basically identical for case 3 and case 4 which indicates that the soil weight has no effect on the pullout capacity of the attached anchor the main reason is that the soil weight does not affect the failure mechanism of the plate anchor under attached conditions however the failure mechanism determines the bearing capacity the failure mechanism in different cases will be introduced in detail in section 5 3 the soil weight significantly affects the pullout capacity of the vented anchor when we compare case 1 with case 2 the embedment depth significantly affects the pullout capacity for both attached and vented anchors by comparing fig 5 a with b it should be noted that the clay nonhomogeneity has an effect on the form of load displacement curves the bearing capacity does not reach the ultimate value within a limited displacement for some cases of nonhomogeneity in such cases the displacement failure criterion of the plate anchor is taken as 0 3 times the anchor width according to dnv rp e302 2002 5 2 pullout capacity factor fig 6 shows the pullout capacity factor n c with embedment ratio h b for various inclination angles β at different anchor soil interfaces and soil weight conditions for vented anchors in clays without weight case 1 fig 6 a d g show that n c increases when h b increases for all β and the increasing rate gradually decreases but does not tend to be zero this change trend of curves is consistent with the numerical results of yu et al s 2011 for the vented anchor in weightless homogeneous clays the clay nonhomogeneity kb s uh decreases with the decrease of k for three different strength profiles when h b is small such as h b 1 as shown in table 1 so n c increases slightly as k decreases by comparing fig 6 a d g kb s uh is almost the same for large h b such as h b 10 hence n c is almost the same for such cases the comparation means that n c is negatively correlated with clay nonhomogeneity for attached anchors in clays without with weight cases 3 and 4 fig 6 c f i show that the soil weight does not affect n c for attached anchors the change trend of n c with h b has some difference compared to the vented anchor n c tends to be constant when h b is greater than 8 for various β which implies that the embedment depth hardly affects the ultimate pullout capacity when it exceeds a certain value in the attached cases in addition n c is almost the same although the overburden pressure is different for fig 6 c f i the main reason is that n c has reached the limit value at the attached cases and the overburden pressure has no effect on n c for such cases for vented anchors in clays with weight case 2 fig 6 b e h show that the value of n c is between the two extremes of case 1 and case 3 the change trend of n c with h b for various β is closely related to the overburden pressure at the low overburden pressure s u 1 3z the change trend in fig 6 b is similar to that of vented anchors in clays without weight in fig 6 a at a high overburden pressure s u 1 0 5z the change trend in fig 6 h is similar to that of the attached anchor in fig 6 i at a relatively moderate overburden pressure s u 1 1 4z n c increases with increasing h b and the increasing rate gradually decreases as shown in fig 6 e however it seems to be much complex because of the intersection of some curves corresponding to different inclination angles according to the superposition assumption merifield et al 2001 yu et al 2011 n c equals to the sum of the value corresponding to vented anchors in clays without weight denoted as n c 0 and γ h s uh corresponding to overburden pressure but n c will not exceed the value corresponding to attached anchors denoted as n c the above limitation of n c value should be the main reason for the complexity the variation of n c with β for different h b is shown in fig 7 for vented anchors in clays without weight case 1 fig 7 a d g show that n c increases when β increases for all h b however the increasing rate of n c with β of 0 90 varies for different h b the difference is more intuitive in the corresponding figure where the ordinate n c is normalized by n c β 90 n c for β 90 as shown in fig 8 a corresponding to fig 7 d the increasing rate of n c is much higher for smaller h b specifically n c at 0 is approximately 0 4 and 0 83 times the value at 90 for h b 1 and 10 respectively for attached anchors cases 3 and 4 the variation trend of n c with β is in contrast to that of case 1 as shown in fig 7 c f i n c decreases when β increases for various h b and the decreasing rate is much higher for smaller h b n c at 90 is approximately 0 6 and 0 98 times the value at 0 for h b 1 and 10 respectively as shown in fig 8 c corresponding to fig 7 f for vented anchors in clays with weight case 2 fig 7 b e h at low overburden pressure s u 1 3z n c increases when β increases for various h b in fig 7 b and the change trend of n c with β is similar to that of vented anchors in clays without weight in fig 7 a at a high overburden pressure s u 1 0 5z n c decreases when β increases for various h b in fig 7 h and the change trend of n c is similar to that of the attached anchors in fig 7 i the change trend of n c with β is much more complex at a relatively moderate overburden pressure s u 1 1 4z as shown in fig 7 e at some embedment depth n c does not monotonically change with increasing β but reaches a maximum at a certain angle and gradually decreases that is to say the peak value of n c is not always at 0 or 90 the change trend is particularly significant when the embedment depth is shallow which can be seen more intuitively in fig 8 b as mentioned above the limitation of n c value should be the direct cause of the complexity it should be noted that the change trend of n c with β is just the opposite for these two extreme states vented anchors in clays without weight case 1 and attached anchors cases 3 and 4 with the increase of overburden pressure the anchor failure mechanism gradually transits from vented failure mechanism to attached failure mechanism and then the change trend of n c with β gradually reverses in the process of transformation the change trend will inevitably go through a relatively complex stage at a moderate overburden pressure hence the essential reason for the complexity should be that anchor failure results from the coupling of the vented failure mechanism and attached failure mechanism the former is dominant at a relatively low overburden pressure and the latter is dominant at a relatively high overburden pressure das and puri 1989 proposed a simple empirical relationship to estimate the capacity of inclined anchors based on their laboratory findings this relationship has the following form 3 n c β n c β 0 n c β 90 n c β 0 β 90 2 where n c β is the pullout factor of the anchor plate with an arbitrary inclined angle of 0 90 n c β 0 and n c β 90 are the pullout capacity factors for the horizontal and vertical anchors the applicability of this relationship for inclined vented anchors in weightless homogeneous clay has been validated by merifield et al 2005 the relationship is also applicable to the current calculated results for inclined vented anchors in weightless homogeneous clay as predicted based on eq 3 and shown in fig 4 the above relationship is also used to predict the pullout capacity factor of inclined vented anchor plates in normally consolidated weightless clay in this study and the related predicted results are plotted using the dashed line in fig 7 d the predictions are consistent with the numerical results in the overall trend but the relationship appears to underestimate the pullout capacity factor especially for the values of 30 75 in the shallow embedment cases the main reason for the deviation is that the real growth rate of n c in normally consolidated soil does not monotonically increase but generally decreases when the inclined angle is greater than 75 as shown in fig 7 d the trend is different from that of the dashed line which is obtained from eq 3 where the growth rate of n c monotonically increases with increasing inclination angles however for the case of weightless homogeneous clay the change trend of is completely consistent with that based on eq 3 hence eq 3 has good applicability for weightless homogeneous clay for normally consolidated weightless clay a new formula is proposed to reduce the predicted deviation as follows 4 n c β n c β 0 n c β 90 n c β 0 2 β 2 8000 β 2 the prediction based on eq 4 is consistent with the numerical result compared to eq 3 as shown by the dash dot line in fig 7 d obviously eq 3 proposed by das and puri 1989 is not applicable to attached anchors where the pullout capacity factor decreases with increasing inclination angles therefore the following formula is proposed to predict the pullout capacity factor for attached anchors 5 n c β n c β 0 n c β 90 n c β 0 2 5 β 2 4000 2 β 2 the dashed line in fig 7 f shows that the prediction is relatively consistent with the numerical result which indicates the good applicability of the formula for attached anchors in clays with linearly increasing shear strength 5 3 failure mechanism figs 9 and 10 show the failure mechanism of the plate anchor for different anchor soil interfaces and soil weight conditions at h b 2 and h b 8 respectively the failure mechanism is exactly identical for the attached anchors in clays with or without soil weight as shown in figs 9 c and 10 c the main reason is that tie contact fully bonded with enough suction force is set between the back of the anchor plate and the surrounding clays during computation under the attached condition in this case regardless of the soil weight the anchor remains in contact with the soil at all times and hence the soil behind the anchor plate has an intense displacement in the case of h b 2 in fig 9 for either vented or attached anchors the soil domain has an obvious shear failure surface that extends to the seabed surface which results in significant heave deformation of the soil surface for vented anchors in clays without weight in fig 9 a the anchor plate is immediately separated from the soil behind the anchor plate when it is pulled while a certain gap appears between the anchor plate and the soil behind it the failure runs immediately upwards and increases in width when weaker soil is activated the failure mechanism extends deeper into the soil with higher shear strength when the inclination angle increases hence the pullout capacity increases when the inclination angle increases in the vented condition the failure mechanism varies when we consider the soil weight under the vented condition as shown in fig 9 b immediate breakaway of anchor soil interface is set and separation between anchor and soil is allowed during computation the soil behind the anchor plate will flow to the anchor plate because of soil overburden pressure the magnitude of soil displacement depends on the overburden pressure and inclination angle and that becomes usually more significant as the inclination angle or overburden pressure increases it should be emphasized that even if shallow embedment depth large overburden pressure will still cause significant soil displacement obviously there are three ways to increase the dimensionless overburden pressure γ h s uh increasing γ increasing h or decreasing s uh therefore there is a situation where the embedment depth is shallow but the overburden pressure is still large the failure surface gradually expand meanwhile the anchor soil gap becomes narrower or even disappears when the inclination angle increases this failure mechanism for a higher inclination angle is closer to that in the attached case in fig 9 c for the attached anchor in fig 9 c the shear zone extends a distance beneath the anchor because the soil and anchor are fully bonded together which significantly adds to the resistance hence the pullout capacity is greater than that of the vented anchor in addition in the attached case the failure plane becomes much shorter when the inclination angle increases and the anchor resistance does not benefit from the increase in shear strength with depth hence the pullout capacity decreases when the inclination angle increases in the case of h b 8 in fig 10 the failure mechanism does not reach the ground surface for either vented or attached conditions compared to the vented anchor in clays without weight in fig 10 a when the soil weight is considered there is no gap between anchor plate and soil and the soil behind the anchor plate significantly flows due to the relatively high overburden pressure under deep embedment as shown in fig 10 b however the failure mechanism is also different from the attached case where the localization of plastic flow is evident in fig 10 c and plastic deformation extends further above the anchor than below due to the linearly increasing shear strength profile for the attached condition the localization failure mechanism forms for all inclination angles hence the effect of inclination angles on the pullout capacity is not significant in the case of deep embedment interestingly for the vented anchor in clays with weight an attached mechanism would form if the dimensionless overburden pressure γ h s uh is sufficiently high as noted by merifield et al 2005 song et al 2008 charlton et al 2016 here when h b 8 γ h s uh increases to 14 8 s u 1 0 5z from the original value of 5 5 s u 1 1 4z γ and h remain constant and only s u h decreases we find that this is indeed the case and the failure mechanism in the vented condition with a sufficiently high overburden pressure is very similar to the attached failure mechanism as shown in fig 11 6 conclusions the pullout capacity of inclined strip plate anchors in normally consolidated clays with linearly increasing shear strength along the depth has been investigated by performing a series of finite element analysis the key conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the change trend of n c with β is just the opposite for these two extreme states vented anchors in clays without weight and attached anchors for the former n c increases with increasing β while for the latter n c decreases with increasing β the increasing or decreasing rate is much higher for smaller embedment ratios 2 for the vented anchor in clays with weight the change trend of n c with β is similar to that of vented anchors in clays without weight under low overburden pressure and similar to that of attached anchors under high overburden pressure for a relatively moderate overburden pressure at some embedment depth n c does not monotonically change with increasing β but reaches a maximum at a certain angle and gradually decreases that is to say the peak value of n c is not always at 0 or 90 the change trend is particularly significant when the embedment depth is shallow 3 for the vented anchor in clays with weight with the increase of overburden pressure the anchor failure mechanism gradually transits from vented failure mechanism to attached failure mechanism and then the change trend of n c with β gradually reverses in the process of transformation the change trend will inevitably go through a relatively complex stage at a relatively moderate overburden pressure hence the essential reason for the complexity should be that anchor failure results from the coupling of the vented failure mechanism and attached failure mechanism the former is dominant at a relatively low overburden pressure and the latter is dominant at a relatively high overburden pressure 4 a new formula is proposed to predict the pullout factor for inclined vented anchors in weightless clay with linearly increasing shear strength which reduces the predicted deviation of the empirical relationship proposed by das and puri 1989 in addition a new formula with relatively high accuracy is proposed to predict the pullout capacity factor for inclined attached anchors 5 the failure mechanism varies when we consider the soil weight under the vented condition the soil behind the anchor plate will flow to the anchor plate because of soil overburden pressure the magnitude of soil displacement depends on the overburden pressure and inclination angle and that becomes usually more significant as the inclination angle or overburden pressure increases credit authorship contribution
