4900,latent heat undoubtedly the most important component of the earths energy cycle serves two major purposes cools the natural bodies and controls weather timely and accurate measurement of the evaporation rate is therefore of paramount interest unfortunately the time needed to measure such a slow process is an hour at the least in this era of real time data analysis there is a need for quick measurement of this parameter here we present a unique way to quickly measure the evaporation rate of water the time duration of the measurement varied between 2 5 and 6 min this temporal resolution opens new opportunities in the area of plant sciences the effect of varying atmospheric conditions including wind speed and sun like radiation were also studied we also proposed a reduced order mathematical model for evaporation whose results agreed reasonably well with those measured in the experiments the device is easy to use simple to construct and portable considering these benefits the proposed device can become an integral part of the weather stations and will improve the analysis of the real time energy distribution at the earths surface 1 introduction moisture loss is an important process in the water cycle jasechko et al 2013 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 out of the three ways in which moisture loss occurs in nature the contribution from the water surfaces is the largest stephens et al 2012 many factors including the atmospheric parameters and the heating load halley 1687 tao et al 2018 kumar and arakeri 2018 2019 govern the process of evaporation phase change being the most dominant energy component related to the earths surface evaporation has been studied globally from aeons halley 1694 dalton 1802 raman et al 2014 on the application perspectives the evaporation phenomenon has been studied extensively related to the electronic cooling devices grover et al 1964 iverson et al 2007 kumar and arakeri 2020 accurate precise and timely estimation or measurement of the rate of evaporation is important two methods are used to calculate this parameter direct and indirect in the direct method mass lost is measured while in the indirect method it is estimated based on some correlations linking the evaporated mass to the other thermodynamic and or aerodynamic variables this method however can only be applied to certain space like a small portion of a large field limited by the measurements experimental data are obtained through either some type of weight measurement techniques such as lysimeters kohnke et al 1940 harrold and dreibelbis 1958 wright 1990 precision weighing scales kumar and arakeri 2015a 2018b 2018c 2020d kumar et al 2020 or measurement of water height to deduce the mass loss vessels or pans also called evaporimeters halley 1694 brutsaert 2013 of various shapes and sizes have been used in the latter case a few standard pans are class a kadel and abbe 1916 sunken colorado carpenter 1889 1891 rohwer 1934 and russian ggi 3000 and 20 m2 pans 27 the measurement from these pans was also used to obtain the estimates of mass loss from large water reservoirs such as lakes through an adjusted coefficient eagleman 1967 irmak and haman 2003 zuo et al 2016 an accuracy of 0 10 mm sometimes 0 01 mm has been widely accepted in these devices another visual based mass loss measurement device is atmometers livingston 1910 bates and no 1920 williams and no 1982 gavilán and castillo llanque 2009 which uses a perforated green coloured thin polymer mounted on a porous strip the porous strip is hydraulically connected through a capillary to a reservoir which consists of a transparent graduated window to monitor the amount of evapotranspiration regularly sometimes this transparent window is provided with an electronic sensor irmak et al 2005 to obtain improved accuracy the indirect methods deploy the use of other measured quantities such as temperature pressure wind speed solar irradiation etc and its connection with the evaporation rate various methods proposed include penman equation penman 1948 1956 blaney criddle equation blaney and criddle 1952 jensen haise equation jensen and haise 1963 penman monteith equation monteith 1965 shuttleworth 1983 2007 and priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 in windy conditions the penman monteith equation produces the closest evaporation values compared to the ones measured directly and has been used to some success to obtain evaporation maps remotely mu et al 2011 anderson et al 2012 li et al 2015 weerasinghe et al 2020 unlike in the direct methods the indirect method may be used to obtain evaporation rates over large spatial scales such as a field or a large water body or even the entire planet depending essentially on the availability of data here the evaporation rates are estimated once or twice in a day we propose a type of direct method similar to the concept of the atmometers to measure the rates of evaporation from a saturated surface in natural conditions the device is hence an evaporimeter the novel idea is to drastically reduce the time of measurement which is often hours in the direct methods to a few minutes though it seems as if a day is sufficient to estimate such a slow process evaporation quickly measuring this parameter has its own benefits one such benefit is in obtaining the temporally resolved evaporation rates which would help in assessing the plants or a leaf response to changes in the vicinity thereby opening new opportunities for the phytologists the proposed device is easy to use portable inexpensive accurate precise and fast the accuracy presses its advantage against the indirect methods which always involve some errors associated with the measured thermodynamic and or atmospheric parameters we successfully tested the device in various conditions mimicking those observed in the atmosphere including sudden exposure to wind an instantaneous change in the wind speed and sudden exposure to a heating source the device finds its use in hydrology agricultural sector and meteorology 2 materials and methods we developed a simple method where a filter paper fp with dimensions of 20 mm 20 mm 0 18 mm is kept wet with deionized water using a unique method see kumar and arakeri 2020 for more details the fp is connected to a thick walled glass capillary gc with an inner diameter of 0 57 mm and the wall thickness of 6 mm which takes water from a glass reservoir gr and supplies it to the fp the distance between the gc top and free water level in the gr is kept to a minimum initially this distance was 6 mm the gr has a small breathing hole which maintains atmospheric pressure inside the reservoir the fp was kept horizontal using a flat acrylic piece at its bottom this ensured evaporation only from the top exposed surface of the fp the entire setup was insulated with polystyrene except the top evaporating side at all the sides aluminium reflector sheet was placed at these sides to prevent the unwanted heating routes the experimental setup is seen in fig 1 in short a wet horizontal fp was used to mimic a water surface the fp is hydraulically connected to a reservoir via the capillary the fp remains wet while the water level in the reservoir decreases with time due to evaporation from the fp alone the ir camera measures the surface temperature of the evaporating fp in the case of heating from above the ir camera was inclined 25 from the vertical we measured the rate of evaporation of water from the wet filter paper by filming the movement of the lower meniscus in the gc once the assembly fp plus gc was taken out of the reservoir a digital camera captured this motion the wind speed in the vicinity of the filter paper was measured by a vane anemometer the following experiments performed in the laboratory conditions were conducted and repeated multiple times 1 lower meniscus visualization using coloured with fluorescein dye water 2 evaporation rates and the corresponding surface temperatures at different wind speeds 3 transient response of the system suddenly changing the wind speed and 4 the effect of the incident heat loads on the evaporation rates 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimating evaporation rates based on front tracking method the water was coloured green by adding in small amount fluorescein dye particles the focus here was on the meniscus formation and its movement inside the capillary and therefore the colour produced a better contrast for the visualization purposes fig 2 is a series of snapshots taken at different time instants thin green vertical objects represent the liquid water which recedes away from the capillary s bottom end as seen here the capillary is one of the components of the removal part see fig s1 of the device as the liquid moves up being sucked by the finer pores in the hydraulically connected filter paper see fig s2 the space left behind is continuously occupied by the ambient air the capillary was graduated at an interval of 5 mm while the wind speed at the evaporating surface was 1 25 ms 1 the time taken for the bottom meniscus to reach a particular graduated position is indicative of the evaporation rate for convenience the time taken to reach the respective graduations is also mentioned in fig 2 note that the time difference between the subsequent graduations reduces and seems to stabilize after 100 s the evaporation rate e w m s 1 from the filter paper is calculated as 1 e w dz dt a gc a fp where z m is the distance travelled by the meniscus in the capillary with the cross sectional area a gc m 2 dz d t o r u l m s 1 is the velocity of the bottom meniscus and a fp m 2 is the cross sectional area of the filter paper equation 1 a mass continuity equation assumes that the contribution of evaporation from the meniscus is negligible a widely accepted unit of the rate of evaporation is mm day which can be converted from m s upon multiplying it with a factor of 8 6e07 it is also important to look at the surface temperature data simultaneously fig 3 shows the variations of the surface temperature primary vertical axis and the evaporation rate secondary vertical axis with time for this case the surface temperature was obtained after averaging over the entire exposed wet surface a sample thermal image is seen in fig s3 the average temperature is seen decreasing once the paper was exposed to the wind this decrease is due to the increased evaporation rate enforced by the incoming wind eventually both the surface temperature and the rate of evaporation achieved the respective steady states in about 110 s the device hence responded quickly to the wind note that the temperature variation across the exposed surface is within 1 c see fig s4 with the central region being slightly warmer due to ingress of the relatively hotter liquid 3 2 response to a sudden change in the wind speed though the device responded quickly when exposed to fixed wind speed it is essential to quantify its response in changing conditions characteristic of the outside atmosphere such as in the agricultural fields or greenhouses for this purpose a separate experiment was performed where the wind was introduced so called forced convection condition suddenly post an initial evaporation process in the absence of wind or natural convection fig 4 shows the variations of the meniscus position and the liquid velocity inside the capillary with time z 0 represents the bottom most end of the capillary and z is positive in the vertically upward direction the meniscus position after the initial transience varies linearly with time and the liquid velocity is constant at 0 15 mms 1 at t 50 seconds 1 25 ms 1 speed wind was introduced and as a result the liquid velocity shoots up to 0 25 mms 1 note that these results were obtained after pixelation of the different images captured using the digital camera in the video mode the error in choosing points in two sample digital images is reflected as the deviation from the true value this deviation is also seen in the figure in terms of time it took nearly 50 s for the evaporation rate to adapt to the sudden change in the ambient condition the device hence offers high adaptability along with a quick response fig 5 shows corresponding to the same experiment as in fig 4 the variation of the average surface temperature and the evaporation rate versus time again the rate of evaporation was calculated using equation 1 an important point to be noticed here is the behaviour in the surface temperature when evaporating in the natural convection the surface temperature was stable after the initial 20 s or so upon insertion of the high speed wind a sharp reduction in the surface temperature is seen in the forced convection environment though the evaporation rate reached a steady state quickly the response in the surface temperature is slightly delayed the results of the experiments conducted at various wind speeds have been accumulated in fig s5 which shows the variations of the surface temperature versus time at four different wind speeds in all the cases the steady state in temperature was achieved within 2 min a better way to delineate the values of the evaporation rates is to compare it against the difference in the two temperatures steady state average surface temperature and the ambient temperature this variation is seen in fig s6 where the evaporation rate is seen increasing at lower values of the temperature difference 3 3 incident heat load as the control parameter in this set of experiments the evaporation rate was boosted by using an ir heater instead of wind three values of the heat flux incident on the wet filter paper were studied 225 low 600 medium and high 900 wm 2 we first observed the steady states of the entire system i e with the reservoir the time taken to reach the steady state was between 5 and 6 min in all the cases the rate of evaporation was obtained through the visualization of the bottom meniscus in the removable part of the device in all the experiments the removable part was introduced into the heating zone when the ir heater was supplying a constant heat output this method is similar to the case when the device is exposed to sunlight fig s7a shows a thermal image high case of the exposed wet filter paper the temperature has been scaled in such a way that only the paper is visible notice the higher temperatures in this case opposed to the forced convection experiments the temperature variation across the entire surface is within 1 c with the lowest temperatures occurring either at the edges or at the centre from where the relatively cooler liquid is entering the porous medium temperature variation along the diagonal line is seen in fig s7b fig s8 shows the time variation of the surface temperature for the three heat loads in all these cases the steady state in the surface temperature was observed to achieve within 360 s note that the device takes a longer time in case of the external heating compared to the cases where evaporation was driven by the force convection however a steady state time of even 6 min is rather quick compared to the conventional ways of measuring the evaporation rate another advantage of the proposed method is its accuracy reliability and functioning in the ever changing atmospheric environment 4 a reduced order model to predict the surface temperature we propose a mathematical model to estimate the surface temperature and hence the rate of evaporation of the evaporating surface at known ambient conditions and incident heat load the model relies on the use of previously obtained experimental results of evaporation kumar and arakeri 2015 from a bare water surface in the presence of external heating fig s9 shows the variation of the rates of evaporation with the steady state temperature difference between the evaporating surface and the ambient for the case of 2 cm 2 cm wet surface the evaporation curves are seen for three different relative humidity values and follow from a known sherwood s h rayleigh r a correlation s h 0 264 r a 0 292 for a bare water surface note that the exponent is close to 1 3 but not equal to it in which case the rate of evaporation would have been independent of the container dimensions an exponent 1 3 is commonly observed in turbulent natural convection processes such as in rayleigh benard convection and convection over flat horizontal heated plates note that the evaporation rates seem to vary nearly linearly till a considerable value of the temperature difference this simple linear relation has been used as an input to the model which essentially incorporates different heat loss gain interaction terms in a surface energy budget seb kumar and arakeri 2018a 2018b 2019c 2018d winter et al 2003 we consider the system see fig s10 comprising of the evaporating horizontal wet filter paper and the acrylic back plate for the seb the system receives the heat given by the ir heater at any instance this incident heat is distributed in the form of different heat loss terms the seb of the system is written in terms of the governing parameters as 2 d t s dt a s m s c p s i n σ s f sa t s 4 t a 4 h s t s t a λ a t s t a b where the parameters of primary importance are the surface temperature t s and the reduced incident heat load i n detailed explanation and the derivation of the eq 2 are shown in the supplementary information the first bracketed term on the rhs of the eq 2 is also important as it is this term which decides the systems response note that the evaporation term in the eq 2 has been incorporated as the latent heat term last term on the rhs upon the assumption given below 3 e w a t s t a b where a and b are the fitting parameters the values of these parameters are seen in table s1 and their variation with the relative humidity in fig s11 interestingly a is a weak function of the ambient conditions while the variation in b is substantial upon further simplification the equation 2 can be reduced to 4 d t s dt m t s t a n where 5 m i n b λ a s m s c p s 6 n h a λ 4 σ s f sa t a 3 a s m s c p s note that h a λ 4 σ s f sa t a 3 is the effective heat transfer coefficient h eff similar to the one used in newton s law of cooling which combines the convective radiative and the latent heat losses we solve the equation 4 for the three known values of i n and the corresponding ambient conditions as well as the fitting parameters the solution for the surface temperature is 7 t s t a m n 1 e n t we can also perceive n as the inverse of the time response τ m s c p s h eff a s of the system the variations with time of the surface temperatures for the case of three heat loads are seen in fig 6 also shown are the experimentally measured average surface temperatures the results of the reduced model agree reasonably well with the experimental values the disagreement originating primarily due to the assumption of a linear relationship between the evaporation rate and the steady state temperature difference between the two increases at the higher heat loads some error is also associated with the convective heat loss term since we have used a correlation for the heated horizontal plate in natural convection and this correlation comes at a cost of about 10 accuracy however the disagreement is rather small and may be neglected in mild heating conditions note that the heat conduction term taken here to be between 15 and 25 had little effect on the surface temperature in case of mild heating conditions however at the higher heat loads the conduction term becomes important and it should be accurately measured or estimated nevertheless it is interesting that such a complicated non linear higher order equation can still be reduced to obtain considerably agreeable results on the other hand this simple time temperature relation can be used to estimate the rate of evaporation at any instant following the sh r a correlation note that in the case of mixed convection i e in the presence of external heating and low wind the model can still be used with an appropriate convective heat transfer coefficient in the end we examine the importance of the material thickness in determining its time response for this we tested three different values of thickness of the acrylic back plate the respective biot numbers b i are 0 1 fig 7 shows the variation of the non dimensional see the supplementary file surface temperature with time the time response is only 25 s for the thinnest 1 mm case while the steady state is reached within 2 5 min for the case of 2 mm thick acrylic plate the steady state is reached in 5 min the sensing ability of the proposed device can thus be further improved by using thin materials having moderate thermal conductivity value we conclude by discussing the effects of wind and external heating in a single figure fig s12 shows such a map note that evaporation rate increases by increasing both of these parameters the wind effects are rather abrupt as compared to the heating cases the experimentally obtained evaporation rates agree reasonably well with the existing correlation at least for the externally heated cases 5 conclusions a simple device capable of measuring the evaporation rate for a wetting liquid in a given condition has been proposed the apparatus consists of a filter paper hydraulically connected to a capillary which takes the liquid from a reservoir and supplies it to the filter paper the wet filter paper thus mimics a flat liquid surface while the liquid level in the reservoir drops gradually when operational two measurements were done evaporation rate and temperature of the evaporating surface the latter was measured using an ir camera while the former was obtained by recording the motion of the liquid meniscus with time in the capillary during evaporation primarily from the exposed filter paper the evaporation rates were enhanced in separate experiments by the use of a a fan and b an ir heater placed above the range of the evaporation rates explored here varied between 4 and 17 mm day 1 values commonly reported throughout the year over the earths surface the device responded swiftly to a suddenly imposed wind and adapted quite quickly to the sudden change in the wind speed the steady state in the surface temperature and the evaporation rates were achieved within 3 min for the cases with the external wind this time nearly doubled to about 6 min for the cases when the evaporation was boosted by an ir heater in any case the proposed device is to the best of our knowledge the fastest one capable of measuring the rate of evaporation the temporally resolved local measurement of the potential evaporation rate would be useful in many applications such as in assessing the time response of a leaf owing to the local atmospheric changes we also proposed a rather simple temperature model which solved the unsteady heat equation and yielded the surface temperatures the results obtained from the model agreed reasonably well with the experimentally measured values this rapid way of measuring the evaporation rate is a novelty and is expected to be helpful in the agricultural sector and meteorology the device can also be included as a part of the weather stations

evaporation rate for convenience the time taken to reach the respective graduations is also mentioned in fig 2 note that the time difference between the subsequent graduations reduces and seems to stabilize after 100 s the evaporation rate e w m s 1 from the filter paper is calculated as 1 e w dz dt a gc a fp where z m is the distance travelled by the meniscus in the capillary with the cross

the meniscus position and the liquid velocity inside the capillary with time z 0 represents the bottom most end of the capillary and z is positive in the vertically upward direction the meniscus position after the initial transience varies linearly with time and the liquid velocity is constant at 0 15 mms 1 at t 50 seconds 1 25 ms 1 speed wind was introduced and as a result the liquid velocity shoots up to 0 25 mms 1 note that these results were obtained after pixelation of the different images captured using the digital camera in the video mode the error in choosing points in two sample digital images is reflected as the deviation from the true value this deviation is also seen in the figure in terms of time it took nearly 50 s for the evaporation rate to adapt to the sudden change in the ambient condition the device hence offers high adaptability along with a quick response fig 5 shows corresponding to the same experiment as in fig 4 the variation of the average surface temperature and the evaporation rate versus time again the rate of evaporation was calculated using equation 1 an important point to be noticed here is the behaviour in the surface temperature when evaporating in the natural convection the surface temperature was stable after the initial 20 s or so upon insertion of the high speed wind a sharp reduction in the surface temperature is seen in the forced convection environment though the evaporation rate reached a steady state quickly the response in the surface temperature is slightly delayed the results of the experiments conducted at various wind speeds have been accumulated in fig s5 which shows the variations of the surface temperature versus time at four different wind speeds in all the cases the steady state in temperature was

in fig s7b fig s8 shows the time variation of the surface temperature for the three heat loads in all these cases the steady state in the surface temperature was observed to achieve within 360 s note that the device takes a longer time in case of the external heating compared to the cases where evaporation was driven by the force convection however a steady state time of even 6 min is rather quick compared to the conventional ways of measuring the evaporation rate another advantage of the proposed method is its accuracy reliability and functioning in the ever changing atmospheric environment 4 a reduced order model to predict the surface temperature we propose a mathematical model to estimate the surface temperature and hence the rate of evaporation of the evaporating surface at known ambient conditions and incident heat load the model relies on the use of previously obtained experimental results of evaporation kumar and arakeri 2015 from a bare water surface in the presence of external heating fig s9 shows the variation of the rates of evaporation with the steady state temperature difference between the evaporating surface and the ambient for the case of 2 cm 2 cm wet surface the evaporation curves are seen for three different relative humidity values and follow from a known sherwood s h rayleigh r a correlation s h 0 264 r a 0 292 for a bare water surface note that the exponent is close to 1 3 but not equal to it in which case the rate of evaporation would have been independent of the container dimensions an exponent 1 3 is commonly observed in turbulent natural convection processes such as in rayleigh benard convection and convection over flat horizontal heated plates note that the evaporation rates seem to vary nearly linearly till a considerable value of the temperature difference this simple linear relation has been used as an input to the model which essentially incorporates different heat loss gain interaction terms in a surface energy budget seb kumar and arakeri 2018a 2018b 2019c 2018d winter et al 2003 we consider the system see fig s10 comprising of the evaporating horizontal wet filter paper and the acrylic back plate for the seb the system receives the heat given by the ir heater at any instance this incident heat is distributed in the form of different heat loss terms the seb of the system is written in terms of the governing parameters as 2 d t s dt a s m s c p s i n σ s f sa t s 4 t a 4 h s t s t a λ a t s t a b where the parameters of primary importance are the surface temperature t s and the reduced incident heat load i n detailed explanation and the derivation of the eq 2 are shown in the supplementary information the first bracketed term on the rhs of the eq 2 is also important as it is this term which decides the systems response note that the evaporation term in the eq 2 has been incorporated as the latent heat term last term on the rhs upon the assumption given below 3 e w a t s t a b where a and b are the fitting parameters the values of these parameters are seen in table s1 and their variation with the relative humidity in fig s11 interestingly a is a weak function of the ambient conditions while the variation in b is substantial upon further simplification the equation 2 can be reduced to 4 d t s dt m t s t a n where 5 m i n b λ a s m s c p s 6 n h a λ 4 σ s f sa t a 3 a s m s c p s note that h a λ 4 σ s f sa t a 3 is the effective heat transfer coefficient h eff similar to the one used in newton s law of cooling which combines the convective radiative and the latent heat losses we solve the equation 4 for the three known values of i n and the corresponding ambient conditions as well as the fitting parameters the solution for the surface temperature is 7 t s t a m n 1 e n t we can also perceive n as the inverse of the time response τ m s c p s h eff a s of the system the variations with time of the surface temperatures for the case of three heat loads are seen in fig 6 also shown are the experimentally measured average surface temperatures the results of the reduced model agree reasonably well with the experimental values the disagreement originating primarily due to the assumption of a linear relationship between the evaporation rate and the steady state temperature difference between the two increases at the higher heat loads some error is also associated with the convective heat loss term since we have used a correlation for the heated horizontal plate in natural convection and this correlation comes at a cost of about 10 accuracy however the disagreement is rather small and may be neglected in mild heating conditions note that the heat conduction term taken here to be between 15 and 25 had little effect on the surface temperature in case of mild heating conditions however at the higher heat loads the conduction term becomes important and it should be accurately measured or estimated nevertheless it is interesting that such a complicated non linear higher order equation can still be reduced to obtain considerably agreeable results on the other hand this simple time temperature relation can be used to estimate the rate of evaporation at any instant following the sh r a correlation note that in the case of mixed convection i e in the presence of external heating and low wind the model can still be used with an appropriate convective heat transfer coefficient in the end we examine the importance of the material thickness in determining its time response for this we tested three different values of thickness of the acrylic back plate the respective biot numbers b i are 0 1 fig 7 shows the variation of the non dimensional see the supplementary file surface temperature with time the time response is only 25 s for the thinnest 1 mm case while the steady state is reached within 2 5 min for the case of 2 mm thick acrylic plate the steady state is reached in 5 min the sensing ability of the proposed device can thus be further improved by using thin materials having moderate thermal conductivity value we conclude by discussing the effects of wind and external heating in a single figure fig s12 shows such a map note that evaporation rate increases by increasing both of these parameters the wind effects are rather abrupt as compared to the heating cases the experimentally obtained evaporation rates agree reasonably well with the existing correlation at least for the externally heated cases 5 conclusions a simple device capable of measuring the evaporation rate for a wetting liquid in a given condition has been proposed the apparatus consists of a filter paper hydraulically connected to a capillary which takes the liquid from a reservoir and supplies it to the filter paper the wet filter paper thus mimics a flat liquid surface while the liquid level in the reservoir drops gradually when operational two measurements were done evaporation rate and temperature of the evaporating surface the latter was measured using an ir camera while the former was obtained by recording the motion of the liquid meniscus with time in the capillary during evaporation primarily from the exposed filter paper the evaporation rates were enhanced in separate experiments by the use of a a fan and b an ir heater placed above the range of the evaporation rates explored here varied between 4 and 17 mm day 1 values commonly reported throughout the year over the earths surface the device responded swiftly to a suddenly imposed wind and adapted quite quickly to the sudden change in the wind speed the steady state in the surface temperature and the evaporation rates were achieved within 3 min for the cases with the external wind this time nearly doubled to about 6 min for the cases when the evaporation was boosted by an ir heater in any case the proposed device is to the best of our knowledge the fastest one capable of measuring the rate of evaporation the temporally resolved local measurement of the potential evaporation rate would be useful in many applications such as in assessing the time response of a leaf owing to the local atmospheric changes we also proposed a rather simple temperature model which solved the unsteady heat equation and yielded the surface temperatures the results obtained from the model agreed reasonably well with the experimentally measured values this rapid way of measuring the evaporation rate is a novelty and is expected to be helpful in the agricultural sector and meteorology the device can also be included as a part of the weather stations

4901,in this paper we provide a holistic view of the hydro sedimentological regimes of the chao phraya river cpr basin the fifth largest basin in southeast asia our analysis of daily discharge and sediment data from 42 major gauge stations showed high seasonal variation in the suspended sediment discharge qs with the maximum discharge occurring in october on an inter annual average at nakhon sawan the river discharges 304x104 tons of sediment every year 60 of which is transported in the peak flooding months september to november the peak sediment discharge in october is dramatically attenuated at a station 150 km downstream from nakhon sawan mainly due to discharge diversion to irrigation canals distributaries and branches as well as seasonal flooding over the central plain sediment yield sy calculated at major stations showed spatial variability across the basin generally decreasing in a downstream direction i e as drainage area increases r2 0 55 some stations in the upper basin s watersheds showed sy as high as 700 tons km2 yr which is comparable to upstream catchments of other large rivers with high sediment production two significant sediment sinks were identified in this study the bhumibol and sirikit dams each on ping and nan rivers which trap 236 104 tons of sediment each year 90 trapping rate as well as the floodplain of the cpr which stores 176 104 tons annually along the 150 km downstream reach from nakhon sawan 60 of qs at nakhon sawan by extrapolating the floodplain sediment budget we estimate that around 300 104 tons yr of suspended sediment can be stored downstream of nakhon sawan to the gulf comparable to the total annual storage of the two mega dams upstream although these dams have been previously reported to cause substantial sediment starvation in the cpr delta this study is the first to recognize the important role of lowland storage on the cpr s basin s sediment discharge to the gulf of thailand and how it contributes a similar degree of threat to the shrinking delta keywords chao phraya river discharge sediment yield hydrology human impacts thailand 1 research gap and motivation the chao phraya river cpr in thailand is the fifth largest river basin in southeast asia with a drainage area and mean annual discharge of close to 160 000 km2 and 1 000 m3 s respectively gupta et al 2012 it originates from the central cordillera near the border with myanmar and laos flows 1300 km across the basin and eventually drains into the gulf of thailand near bangkok the crucial role played by seasonal flooding of the cpr in supporting ecosystems and high biodiversity along its vast floodplains has been recognized hungspreug et al 2000 the cpr is fundamental to thailand s agricultural sector one of the country s major economic sectors which constitutes around 8 1 of the gdp in 2018 world bank 2020 in addition it is a major food source for numerous inhabitants along the riverine environment and serves as one of thailand s major transportation routes hossain and iamtrakul 2007 historically the cpr has connected numerous parts of the country through its extensive network hence the etymology of the cpr is river of mother in siamese central and south thais in tribute to its significance in thailand s history besides its historical significance the cpr also experiences numerous natural hazards and anthropogenic pressures for example the 2011 thailand flood in cpr basin was globally considered one of the most catastrophic flood disasters recorded in recent history resulting in 813 casualties and incurring us 46 billion in economic losses dhi 2012 world bank 2011 the cpr delta the third largest delta in southeast asia is presently sinking dramatically this is mainly attributed to intensive dredging upstream mega dams groundwater extraction around bangkok ongoing sea level rise and rapid coastal erosion which has destroyed more than 100 km2 of mangrove forest over the past 30 years saito et al 2007 winterwerp et al 2005 while there are existing studies contributing to the understanding of the hydrological and sediment regimes of the cpr the former is mainly focused on the numerical simulations of discharge under the future climate change e g kure and tebakari 2012 kotsuki et al 2014 ligaray et al 2015 watanabe et al 2014 hunukumbura and tachikawa 2012 and land cover change thanapakpawin et al 2007 petchprayoon et al 2010 in the cpr basin most of the gcm based discharge regime studies predict future increases in discharge while kim et al 2005 expected a decrease due to crop field expansion in contrast wilk et al 2001 reported no findings of a solid relationship between deforestation and discharge through a catchment scale study in north eastern thailand despite an 80 to 27 decrease in forest cover over the last 30 years in the 2010s there was a spike in the number of hydrological studies on the cpr basin pertaining to the increased flooding frequency including the deadliest flood of 2011 e g mateo et al 2014 komori et al 2012 jamrussri and toda 2017 tebakari et al 2012 however almost no research articles have been dedicated to conceptualizing the basin scale hydrology and sediment regimes of the cpr knowledge of the cpr sediment regime is still nascent one of the pioneer studies of sediment regime by alford 1992 focuses on the northern mountainous catchments the first basin wide scale assessment by jica 2000 calculated qs at nakhon sawan prior to and during the construction of the bhumibol and sirikit dams until 1972 fig 1 a averaged 25 3 million tons per year mtons yr thereafter it decreased to 6 6 mtons yr bidorn et al 2016 reconstructed historical qs from the 1950s by using discharge based rating curves at major gauge stations concluding that there was no significant decrease of qs between 1950s and 1995 possibly due to intensified erosion runoff from agricultural expansion which negated the effects of the dam instead they reported a reduction in qs only after 1995 which may have been due to a large scale flood reduction infrastructure development after the severe flood of 1995 hovius 1998 through the compilation of available gauge station data from different sources reported that the cpr at nakhon sawan used to transport 11 mtons yr prior to the dams this is less than half of jica s estimation in spite of discrepancies in reported qs values and their trends among the small number of existing articles there is a general consensus on the dramatic decrease in qs delivered to the gulf of thailand over the past century gupta et al 2012 the serious shift of delta accretion rate from 1 5 km2 yr to that of an erosional phase saito et al 2007 is also a testament to this collectively our literature review here is indicative of the current rudimentary understanding of the cpr s sediment regime showing a clear necessity for a consolidated characterization of the qs regime refer to si fig 1 for the available literature about the cpr compared to other large rivers in southeast asia in this study we characterize the basin wide patterns of the hydrology and sediment fluxes yield across the cpr basin we first obtained hydrological data from 211 stations across the cpr basin and analyzed daily discharge q since the 1970s and qs since 2000 data among them we selected stations based on the three criteria 1 location for example the lowermost station that represents the catchment regimes or upstream stations in the headwater area to assess the sediment sourcing erosion and weathering 2 data quality filtering outliers in order to obtain representative trends in inter annual seasonality and 3 data availability using at least five years of record to ensure the accuracy of the seasonal trends whilst ensuring continuity in data using the q and qs data from our selected 42 major stations we first report their q and qs regimes by presenting the inter annual average based on long term data and discuss in detail the intra annual seasonal patterns of q and qs over six major stations that either represent the cpr basin or its sub basins sediment yields of sub basin scale are also computed and their heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns across the cpr basin are analyzed since the cpr is a large basin with heterogeneous hydroclimatic regimes geological setting as well as different degrees of human induced environmental impacts the spatial patterns of sediment yields are further investigated in relation to surface geology rainfall trends and land cover data finally we discuss the sediment budget of the mega dams in the upper basin and the central plain in the lower basin and identify them as key sediment sinks that determine the sediment flux arriving at the coast 2 the chao phraya river cpr basin the chao phraya river cpr originates near the central cordillera around the thailand myanmar laos borders daen lao range along the northeast and luang prabang range along the northeast flowing across nearly 160 000 km2 almost 40 of the country draining into the gulf of thailand fig 1a the overall basin relief is not high compared to other large rivers which drain the himalayas in southeast asia e g mekong or ganges brahmaputra more than 80 of the total area in the cpr basin lies below 600 m asl at the elevation threshold of 300 m it transits from hanging intermontane valleys of the cordillera draining steep highlands to the lowland of the cpr basin that occupy a broad graben 23 of the basin 37 000 km2 lies below 50 m asl these areas are referred to in this study as the central plain of thailand fig 1b the basin is broadly divided at nakhon sawan into an upper and lower cpr basin the upper basin contains four large tributary catchments which we refer to in this study as sub basins ping 34 537 km2 wang 10 793 km2 tributary of ping yom 24 047 km2 tributary of nan and nan 34 682 km2 the ping and nan rivers merge at nakhon sawan from that point until it drains into the gulf the river is referred to as the cpr two major tributaries along the cpr in the lower basin are sakae krang 4 907 km2 and pa sak 15 626 km2 there are also distributaries such as tha chin which diverge at chai nat and smaller branches such as noi and lop buri along with several irrigation canals loc et al 2020 although the relief of the basin is generally low the slope of the upper tributary catchments is generally high 1m km the ping river upstream of the wang confluence has a channel slope close to 2 m km fig 1c the slope in the central plain is very low with approximately 0 2 m km on average the cordilleran sub basins ping wang yom and nan consist of broad 5 25 km wide intermontane valleys that are mostly above 300 m elevation incised parallel to the regional geological fabric defined by north south striking permotriassic sutures assembling paleozoic predominantly marine sedimentary sequences metcalfe 2011 geologic map of thailand 2013 abundant arc granites associated felsic metavolcanics and proximal marine sequences are associated with these sutures as is the predominantly north south fabric of the landscape that governs drainage patterns precambrian mostly amphibolite grade metamorphics are abundant in the upper ping drainage around chiang mai the headlands of the pa sak sub basin are along the western margin of the khorat plateau a region of northeastern thailand dominated by flat lying undeformed cretaceous fluvial sequences saminpanya et al 2014 isolated neogene and quaternary volcanic centers occur throughout the region with the largest concentration in the lower pa sak sub basin some 5 000 km2 in size the pitanulok and chao phraya basins form a 100 150 km wide composite graben extending from the sukhothai region south to bangkok and the gulf of thailand these basins contain extensive quaternary cover underlain by kilometres thick basin fill dating back to the miocene the large size of these basins accounts for the steep hypsometric curve in fig 1b for elevations below 200 m while the minor irregularity in this curve at approximately 200 300 m reflects the recent activity of basin marginal graben structures typical of monsoonal regimes the cpr basin has a typical tropical savanna climate with two distinct seasons that are characterized by great seasonal variability of rainfall total annual around 800 000 million m3 simachaya and yolthantha 2006 every year storms cause large floods across the cpr basin during the rainy season typically may october these are associated with tropical depressions developed from typhoons in the south china sea moving westward across the indochina peninsula wood and ziegler 2008 therefore the annual hydrographs in the cpr show peak discharge usually around october fig 1d the highest discharge in the basin is observed in nakhon sawan where the ping and nan rivers converge downstream of nakhon sawan the river starts diverting water through distributaries branches or floodplains for this reason nakhon sawan is considered the most important gauge station in the cpr since the basin s flux is the largest at this station mean annual discharge mad 946 m3 s the discharge variability is significant because the mean monthly discharge at c 2 ranges from 400 april to 2 500 october m3 s with only four months a year august november above 1 000 m3 s on average another interesting seasonal discharge pattern observed in the nan ping and sakae krang basins all along the mountain range along the western boundary of the basin is the secondary peaks of q around may which reflect the heterogeneous seasonal climatic patterns within the basin the seasonal flood regime in cpr is mainly controlled by the two mega dams at upstream sub basins the bhumibol construction completed in 1965 along the ping river and sirikit construction completed in 1972 along the nan river with reservoir areas of 364 000 and 13 100 km2 respectively collectively their storage capacities total up to 23 billion m3 although there are nine other reservoirs in the cpr basin the sum of their total storage is only around 4 billion m3 operation of the dams during the rainy season is particularly important since it aids in controlling flooding downstream and also determines the availability of water for the subsequent dry season in terms of sediment regime these dams in the upstream basin have been regarded as the main cause of the drastic reduction of sediment delivered through nakhon sawan and eventually to the delta refer to introduction however given that 1 the basin area of the two sub basins without impoundments wang and yom are comparable to the two other sub basins 2 surface geology across the upstream basin is heterogeneous 3 upstream basins have undergone a substantial land cover change recently sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 paiboonvorachat and oyana 2011 and 4 the sediment regimes of these sub basins have yet to be well studied the real impact of these dams on the sediment delivery downstream in terms of flux and budget remains uncertain other than the two mega dams in the basin the cpr dam at nakhon sawan and the pa sak dam could be considered locally important cpr dam is a run of the river dam that produces hydropower while pa sak dam finished in 1998 is an impoundment that serves irrigation purposes in the eastern cpr basin 3 data and methods 3 1 gauge stations measurement protocols and data availability daily q m3 s and qs tons day data across 211 gauge stations over the chao phraya river cpr basin were obtained from the hydrology division of the royal irrigation department rid of thailand measurements of water levels began in the early 1900s these were mostly for stations located in the central plain measurements gradually expanded to other locations discharge and sediment fluxes have been measured at selected stations since around the 1948 and the 2000s respectively the organization of data follows the thai water year system which starts in april and ends in march of the following year q is frequently measured mostly by the cross section area velocity approach in this approach velocity is measured by the current meter at multiple depths across the channel width and occasionally using an acoustic doppler profilers adp then water level discharge rating curves are developed for each station to reconstruct an estimate of historical daily q daily q is then multiplied by the average suspended sediment concentration ssc where ssc is measured mostly using the grab sampler at the water surface close to the channel center rating curves logarithmic re calibrated once a year are then developed with q to estimate daily qs at each station the availability of q and qs data varies widely among stations on average q data has been available since 1973 on the other hand major stations such as c 13 in the downstream reach have discharge data from 1948 however it is important to note that most stations have missing records throughout the available period for example q data at p 17 spans from 1955 to 2013 however there are 18 years with missing records there are several reasons for these gaps in data malfunction or loss due to flood or landslides insufficient manpower for maintenance for certain years or simply the loss of record during the archiving process sediment samples for concentration in the cpr have been collected mostly after 2007 likewise not all stations have complete years of sediment sampling record since data availability is of utmost concern we tried to secure data from the lowermost stations of the basins and up and downstream of major tributaries for analysis of hydro sedimentological impacts of upper catchments 3 2 data quality control we first averaged daily q and qs into monthly averages to ensure consistency in the quality of data we applied the following filters 1 we only used years with more than ten months of records i e a year with only nine months of data would be omitted from the analysis if a year had less than two months of missing data a moving average was used to interpolate the data 2 only stations with at least two years of records were chosen i e if a station only has one year s worth of records it is excluded from the analysis 3 data from 2011 the year of the greatest flood loc et al 2020 was removed from the q and qs analyses because their values in the flood peak month usually october is more than three times of other years with typical hydrological conditions since the main objective of the paper is to characterize the general hydrology and sediment transport regimes of the river we deemed that using records from an anomalously wet year would distort the results this also stems from the recognition that records from 2011 would inevitably have large margins of errors since the discharge water level rating curve method is used to estimate q and in turn qs during the peak flow of 2011 the water levels greatly exceeded the bankfull capacity of the channel in the lower cpr reach therefore a significant volume of water was lost to the floodplain through overbank dispersion and the floodplain water budget in 2011 is still unknown loc et al 2020 also there must have been a significant reorganization of channel bedforms due to the abnormally high sandy material transport during the flood bidorn et al 2015 hence adapting previous year s rating curve may not be valid for estimating q for that particular year nevertheless we report the annual sediment discharge of 2011 qs2011 calculated from the gauge station records where available for reader s reference we only used records of qs after 2007 when ssc data were collected at the gauge stations while in theory more than 50 years of daily qs record could be constructed using rating curves between water level q qs this process contains some major uncertainties related to non stationarity due to changes in driving factors these may include regional scale climate regimes geological characteristics of the watershed local channel geometry as well as land use cover change among these the last two have undergone significant changes over recent decades bidorn et al 2015 paiboonvorachat and oyana 2011 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 finally we chose 42 stations which are well distributed across the cpr basin fig 1a with the assurance that their data are by far the most reliable and geographically representative among them 28 68 7 13 31 0 and 14 33 3 are from the upper lower basins and the central plain respectively the number of stations in each sub basin ranges from 5 to 7 except for tha chin which only has 1 in terms of the data period used to calculate the annual qs there are variations between stations with an average of 9 years overall both the ping and wang sub basins are relatively well gauged with the exception of p 78 which only has one year record with many of their stations having 18 years of time series on average 14 years for the two sub basins the nan and yom are comparatively less well gauged with 6 stations collectively y 6 y 14 y 16 n 2b n 81 and n 1 having only one year s record i e after 2018 the most downstream station in the ping river n 67 which is also the largest sub basin in the upper basin 21 of the cpr basin has 8 years of record 2007 2014 therefore the qs regime of the ping basin is well represented qs at the stations along the cpr downstream of nakhon sawan have 7 years on average 3 3 water and sediment yield analysis across the basin after the quality of the collected data had been reviewed mean monthly q and total monthly qs were calculated for the 42 selected stations across the cpr basin we reconstructed the monthly qs q rating curve for each major station using power functions since their phases are strongly correlated bidorn et al 2016 since sediment was primarily sampled using grab samples at the surface and it has been measured by bidorn et al 2015 that the bedload generally constitutes 5 of the total load transport in the cpr though the ratio varies among rivers it is inferred that the sediment discharge in this study is predominantly wash load clay and silty materials with only a small fraction of suspended sand both of which are at least semi permanently in suspension colby 1963 to characterize the intensity of source fluxes across different sub basins in the cpr we calculated sediment yield tons km2 yr for the basins of selected stations each sub basin and watershed were delineated based on the flow direction raster derived from the multi error removed improved terrain dem merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 3 4 analysis of factors controlling sediment yield to further assess the regional variations of sediment yield we considered mean elevation and elevation above 300 m asl surface geology as it relates to erodibility of various rock types precipitation and land cover an elevation threshold of 300 m was selected as it represents the approximate transition between the hanging intermontane valleys which drain steep highlands and the lowlands of the southern cpr river slopes above 300 m are on average much steeper fig 1 the abundance of quaternary sediments is an important parameter because these unlithified deposits are easily mobilized making them part of the dynamic erosional landscape proportions of each geologic unit in respective subbasins were determined as a percentage area based on the geologic map supplied by the coordinating committee for geoscience programme http www ccop or th erosivity of bedrock was considered in the context of the erodibility index proposed by moosdorf et al 2018 which offers an estimate of the sediment production potential of various rock types normalized to granite which is assigned an index value of 1 the erodibility index offers an estimate of the sediment yield of different rock types and this estimate was weighted by the percentage area of different lithic rock types within each sub basin to obtain a basin wide erodibility index we processed the freely available 3b43 monthly precipitation estimates product from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm to obtain rainfall over the cpr basin trmm 2011 the data was resampled from 0 25 to 1 km via google earth engine land cover data 300 m from the european space agency s esa climate change initiative cci was downloaded https www esa landcover cci org for the year 2010 the numerous land cover classes were broadly aggregated into 4 classes cropland forest urban grass and or shrubland and water we adopted a two step multivariate analysis i e principal component analysis pca and multi variable linear regression analysis pca is a widely used dimensionality reduction method for large datasets that transforms a set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the original dataset e g loc et al 2017 pca is used to explore the underlying correlations of the latent variables in this case five measurements including quaternary sedimentary rocks erodibility index catchment areas of urban and crops catchment areas of forests areas with elevation greater than 300 m and rainfall we included the estimated sy as the supplementary variable to visualize its relationships with the six aforementioned latent variables in the second step we developed a multilinear regression model to verify the contributions of the six latent variables to the dependent variable the sy of the cpr 3 5 sediment budget of the central plain we hypothesize that the central plain of thailand is an important sediment sink although the magnitude of the sediment trapping and its contribution to the total cpr discharge remains unknown most of the central plain is seasonally flooded and it contains most of thailand s paddy fields this extensive conversion started since the early 20th century around 20 of the country had been converted to paddy fields before the 1960s which then increased to about 40 in the early 1980s center for agricultural statistics 1994 charuppat 1998 we focused on the central plain of the lower basin to calculate the monthly and annual sediment budget of the 150 km long reach between c 2 and c 7a fig 1a with a low channel gradient and relief this reach is where the cpr is mostly embanked and meandering with an average sinuosity index of approximately 1 46 the floodplain in the reach is highly susceptible to seasonal flooding and was also largely inundated during the 2011 flood liew et al 2016 loc et al 2020 by conceptualizing the complex hydrographic network tributaries distributaries and irrigation canals diversion in this reach we derived the following equation for the sediment budget of the reach reach

million tons at respective gauge stations canals denote the qs of the two important irrigation canals makamthao uthong and chainat ayutthaya which merges with the downstream main channels monthly ssc at c 2 were used to estimate qs at the canals since there are more than 30 other small to medium irrigation canals along the river between c 2 and c 7a we hypothesize that majority of water and sediment in the central plain floodplain is transferred through the canals we did not consider the qs diversion to the lop buri branch because most of the floodplain along that branch is upstream of c 7a moreover it eventually re joins the main cpr downstream 4 results and discussion 4 1 properties of the measured sediments at the gauge stations although it is mentioned above that the measured sediment is predominantly washload possibly with some suspended sand we first present an in depth discussion on the properties of the measured sediments at the gauge stations like other large anabranching rivers which flow in low gradient landscapes with islands the cpr could also be considered a washload clay and silt dominated river in terms of sediment properties however there are significant variations within the basin these are attributed to the heterogeneous surface geology and topography that control weathering intensity hydrological regimes and land cover therefore it might be difficult to make basin scale generalizations based on only one property of the sediments moreover several existing studies have reported contrasting results some local scale studies based on field measurements have reported that rivers in the upper basins can have only up to 30 40 of the total load consisting of bed load chanyotha and chadchawan 1995 tae sombat 1988 however kitisuntorn 1994 estimated the proportion of bedload to be around 1 2 in the northern part of the nan basin later on bidorn et al 2015 reported that bedload generally constitutes 5 of the total load transport in the cpr this was based on the 17 bedload samples that were collected across the four sub basins in the upper cpr they also posited that bedload fraction increased with increasing q however 13 of the samples constituted 5 10 of which had 1 of bedload most recently based on field measurement during 2011 2013 namsai et al 2020 also showed that the bedload fraction was 5 in the yom river regardless of the bedload fraction in the upper basin we believe that almost no coarse load is transported in the lower basin as most of the sandy load is trapped in the reservoirs in the ping and nan basin the formation of muddy tidal flats of the cpr through the accumulation of clay sediment tanabe et al 2003 uehara et al 2010 is also a testament to the absence of coarse material being transported 4 2 sediment yield sy of sub basins and determinant factors sediment yields calculated at major stations showed spatial variability across the basin and we analyzed the patterns using different factors fig 2 there is a clear difference in the magnitude of sediment production between the upper eastern and western basins the nan has a much higher sediment yield sy than ping the highest sy recorded at nan is 268 8 tons km2 yr at n 81 while the highest at ping is 58 9 tons km2 yr at p 75 overall when plotted against drainage basin area sy showed a decreasing pattern in the downstream direction i e as drainage area increases with r2 0 47 not including the stations downstream the dams i e n 2b n 67 p 17 and s 9 fig 2d when removed two stations on the 3rd order tributaries i e ct 20 and p 78 that drain the relatively small area along the western cordillera of the cpr basin it further increased the r2 to 0 55 as indicated in fig 2d here we report the watershed scale pca and multiple linear regression analysis results using 18 stations located upstream of the dams that overlap with the cordillera at least partially fig 3 and table 1 we excluded w 17 in the analysis because the watershed area 729 km2 is even smaller than the size of a single trmm pixel hence the actual amount of on the w 17 watershed is unknown the pca results show the effective representation of the original data using 2 principal components with the accumulated explained variances of 78 9 the projection of the latent explanatory variables onto the two dimensional plane pc1 pc2 is therefore effective in revealing their underlying relationships specifically the latent variables quaternary surface and erodibility index are closely correlated with the sy as illustrated by the bundled position of the respective vector arrows in fig 3 annual rainfall is also associated with sy albeit to a much lesser degree it should be noted since sediment yields are the dependent variable it was not included in pca on the other hand three other latent variables urban forests and elevation 300 m are not significantly correlated with the sediment yields our multiple regression analysis including 6 latent variables confirmed the statistical significance p value 0 01 at 99 confidence level of the quaternary surface and erodibility index in controlling the watershed scale sy in the cpr basin similarly annual rainfall contribution is slightly less significant with p value 0 05 the other remaining variables are not statistically significant which is in line with the assessments from pca the multilinear regression model itself is also significant at p value 0 01 with the adjusted r2 of 0 87 the summary statistics of the model is presented in table 1 the sediment yield of ping river measured at p 73 upstream of the dam showed a relatively low average sy of 27 4 tons km2 yr among sub basins although ping basin is relatively high in elevation the western cordillera along the thong chai range are mostly composed of triassic felsic plutonic rocks which are resistant to erosion and also the average rainfall 1 330 mm yr was below the average of cpr basin the extensive intra cratonic basin around chiang mai may also efficiently trap sediment the overall sy quaternary surface and erodibility index of the wang basin are high while the basin wide average rainfall is moderate at 1281 287 mm yr this may indicate that other local scale factors such as flash floods may induce episodic sediment fluxes into the river from landslides or bank erosion the yom basin has relatively low sy and other factors including average rainfall the northern part of the basin where it overlaps with the cordillera is mostly resistant rocks such as triassic sedimentary rocks for the nan basin there were only two stations analyzed in terms of sy n 81 and n 1 which may not properly represent the basin although there is regional variability of sediment production sys of mountainous areas in the nan and ping basins are comparable to sy measured at upstream catchments of other rivers flowing highly erodible terrains around the world such as the mississippi new zealand along with the river basins in andes or even taiwan milliman and farnsworth 2013 for instance sy in the wang basin can be as high as 705 1 and 623 7 tons km2 yr at w 17 and w 25 respectively and up to 268 8 tons km2 yr in the nan basin at n 81 4 3 discharge and sediment load in the cpr at key stations among the 42 stations are 6 important stations deserving of special attention because they are representative of the cpr basin or their respective sub basins these stations p 17 n 67 ct 19 s 9 c 2 and c 7a in fig 4 all showed q and qs to be in phase with each other differences in the shape of the rating curves are related to the characteristics of each watershed asselman 2000 i e size of the basin hence discharge surface geology and erodibility as well as rainfall regimes all of which are exhaustively discussed in the previous section effective discharge peak sediment discharge is observed during the peak flow which is mainly driven by the monsoonal regime of the basin as such erosion and transport of materials are concentrated in a few months every year in the case of the c 2 and c 7a about 59 and 75 of the annual sediment discharge occurs only during the three months september october and november respectively fig 4 during the dry season especially february to june sediment discharge is almost zero at c 7a in other words a very low amount of sediment reaches the delta during the dry season jarupongsakul et al 2007 approximately 45 km upstream of the confluence of the cpr is p 17 the lowermost station in the ping river it is therefore representative of the tributary basin s total fluxes covering 98 9 of the basin the q and qs are 359 1 m3 s and 99x104 tons yr respectively accounting for 38 and 32 5 of the water and sediment fluxes of the cpr basin at c 2 bidorn et al 2015 estimated the qs of ping river at p 2a as 60 104 tons yr based on historically reconstructed daily qs data 1952 2010 p 2a is approximately 150 km upstream of p 17 between both stations are several small scale tributaries most of them width 10 m which drain the western mountainous area close to myanmar border where sediment yields can be relatively high details in the next section however floodplain water storage is limited with narrow fluvial belt and steeper slope as inferred from the maximum flood extent map during the 2011 flood loc et al 2020 in this reach this explains the downstream increase of qs from p 2a to p 17 the nan basin is the largest in the upper cpr basin n 67 about 30 km upstream from nakhon sawan representing 96 7 of the basin is the lowermost station immediately downstream of the yom confluence q and qs at n 67 are 499 m3 s and 216x104 tons yr respectively relative to the ping q is around 28 larger while qs is 54 2 larger indicating higher rates of sediment production in the nan basin the nan basin contributes around 72 of the sediment discharge at c 2 and is therefore considered the most important tributary in terms of sediment transport however the nan basin s sediment discharge has yet to be reported interestingly most of the qs recorded at n 7a is not contributed from the nan river itself but a tributary draining eastern watershed through n 81 without accounting for the yom basin bidorn et al 2015 estimated qs at n 7a which is about 120 km upstream from n 67 at 138x104 tons yr approximately 100 km upstream of n 7a and immediately downstream of the sirikit dam is n 2b which has qs of 16 104 tons yr on the other hand qs at n 81 is 137 104 tons yr given that the drainage area of n 2b is about 5 times larger than that of n 81 it is inferred that there is significant sediment trapping in sirikit reservoir the total qs of these two stations 153 104 tons yr exceeds that of n 7a by 20 104 as reported by bidorn et al 2015 this is likely due to the diversion of water for agricultural purposes and seasonal flooding in that reach as mentioned previously c 2 is regarded as the most important station in the cpr basin because it has the largest q and qs the mad and annual qs at c 2 are 946 m3 s and 304 104 tons yr respectively due to water loss downstream of nakhon sawan resulting from the diversion of water to floodplain and canals it is interesting to note that the mad at c 7a i e 480 m3 s is almost half of c 2 s another noteworthy aspect is that peak discharge at c 7a almost simultaneously occurs with c 2 fig 1d despite the gentle channel slope of the central plain in fact the peak discharge at c 7a is reached a month earlier than p 17 which is almost 300 km upstream from c 7a this phenomenon has been recently analyzed by loc et al 2020 who attributed it to the substantial amounts of local rainfall received by the lower cpr during the early rainy season sakae krang and pa sak are the two main tributaries of the cpr sakae krang s q and qs are estimated at ct 19 to be 242 m3 s and 25x104 tons yr respectively they are also the most important hydrological input between c 2 and c 7a the r2 of the qs q rating curve at ct 19 was 0 74 the lowest among major stations fig 4c this may be due to the relatively small size of the sub basin which renders it unable to accommodate climatic variability as well as its poorly developed floodplains cannot effectively attenuate flood waves the non correlative relationship between ssc and q in fig 4c along with the fact that peak q and qs in sakae krang both occur in september while all others were in october also attests to the unpredictable qs and flash flood regimes of the sub basin pa sak is the largest and the lowermost tributary of the cpr contributing an average of 73 m3 s and 16 104 tons of sediment annually while the basin area of pa sak is more than four times that of the sakae krang q and qs are substantially lower around 30 and 64 respectively we attribute this to the pa sak dam located along the middle reach of the main channel discussed in the next section stations downstream of the cpr confluence with pa sak river are affected by tidal influences as such they were not analyzed in this study 4 4 major sediment storage in the cpr basin 4 4 1 dam trapping of sediment the combination of large seasonal variability of discharge stemming from the monsoonal regime and the generally flat terrain makes the lower cpr basin extremely vulnerable to seasonal flooding the two mega dams along the main stem of the ping and nan rivers play an important role in controlling floods mateo et al 2014 komori et al 2012 tebakari et al 2012 while these dams have managed to mitigate flooding they have also resulted in a great decrease of sediment load being transported to the delta it has been estimated by jica 2000 that prior to the dams the cpr used to transport 25 3 mt of sediment per year which has now decreased by almost 75 to the current 6 6 mtons yr hovius 1998 reported that sediment transport of the cpr at nakhon sawan prior to the dam construction was 11 mtons yr i e 43 of the estimation by jica 2000 which then decreased to 3 mtons yr after the construction of dams in contrast bidorn et al 2016 stated that based on historical reconstruction of daily qs at nakhon sawan there had been no significant decrease in sediment discharge until 1995 which is almost two decades after the construction of the bhumibol dam beyond differences in reported qs values is the indisputable dramatic decrease in qs delivered to the gulf of thailand over the past century in this section we provide the most updated and refined values based on sediment samples collected after 2007 to assess the present rate of sediment trapping at the two mega dams we calculate the trapping rate by taking the qs differences at the two nearest stations that are upstream and downstream of the dam a simple longitudinal approach to estimate sediment trapping at bhumibol reservoir we integrated qs records from the two stations w 4a 89 104 tons yr and p 17 99 104 tons yr theoretically the sum of qs at w 4a and bhumibol s qs should be the qs at p 17 assuming no sediment input output between the dam and p 17 which is located about 270 km downstream from the dam this assumption holds because the floodplain in that reach is poorly developed and the terrain is generally characterized by hummocky structures with inselbergs of mesozoic and paleozoic bedrock protruding through the thin quaternary cover it is likely that minor tectonic uplift of this area has also occurred from motion along with basin marginal graben structures to the east moreover the sediment input from the tributaries whilst unknown may be considered minor because their drainage area along the western cordillera part of western thongchai range is very small fig 2a for these reasons we estimate the qs along the reach between the dam and p 17 to be stable therefore qs immediately downstream from the bhumibol dam is estimated as 10 104 tons yr i e the difference between qs at p 17 and w 4a the lowermost station located upstream from the dam is p 73 42 5x104 tons yr 115 km upstream from the dam there is one major tributary that drains the alluvial gorge between the two north eastern cordilleras with highly erodible areas western thongchai and thongchai ranges fig 2a the qs input from this tributary is estimated from the p 73 record based on the area load approach milliman et al 1999 we used qs at p 73 and extrapolated this value based on area i e upstream of the dam area is 134 of the area of p 73 watershed therefore qs of 56 9 104 42 5 104 134 tons was assumed to flow into the reservoir each year comparing this to the annual dam sediment discharge of 10x104 tons yields a trapping rate of 82 4 regarding the sirikit dam the only station upstream with available data is n 1 where qs is 77 3 104 tons yr n 1 is located about 150 km upstream from the dam accounting for three major tributaries which drain the luang prabang range and phi pan nam mountains fig 2a both regions are characterized by high erosion applying the same area load approach as that of the bhumibol reservoir we extrapolated qs from n 1 to estimate the sediment load entering the sirikit reservoir the area of the watershed upstream of the sirikit dam is 265 of the n 1 watershed therefore 204 8 104 77 3 104 265 tons of sediment was assumed to flow into the reservoir each year from this we calculated the trapping rate to be 92 1 by comparing with the qs downstream at n 2b 16 1 104 tons yr however the actual trapping rate exceeds our calculated value since n 2b is about 50 km downstream along the flat terrain where water and washload sediment can be lost due to irrigation and seasonal flooding similar to what has been observed after the construction of reservoirs worldwide e g syvitski et al 2005 vörösmarty et al 2003 walling and fang 2003 the existence of these reservoirs is the primary cause of the reduction in suspended sediment in the cpr still it is fortunate that both mega dams are located upstream of confluences where large tributaries from the upper basin converge wang and yom each discharge 117 8 104 and 68 7 104 tons annually at w 3a and y 41 respectively hence qs from those tributaries is delivered to the lower basin without interference from the dams the nan basin a watershed draining the eastern cordillera luang prabang range through n 81 also has a high qs of 137 3 104 tons yr the total qs from these three tributaries is 323 8 104 tons yr which is even higher than the annual qs at nakhon sawan 304 2 104 tons as measured at c 2 this indicates that although suspended sediment is stored in the floodplains which are downstream of the ping and nan rivers there is still a significant volume of sediment which remains unaffected by dams that is being supplied to the lower basin whether planned or inadvertently in the cpr basin the strategic placement of dams outside of tributaries with high sediment contribution downstream has been recently suggested in the neighbouring mekong basin schmitt et al 2018 2019 this finding leads to the following conclusion if these two dams did not exist the qs at c 2 would increase by 77 to be 539 8 104 tons yr this is based on the sum of qs at c 2 304 2 104 tons yr trapped qs of 46 9 104 and 188 7 104 tons yr at the dam sites of ping and nan respectively therefore we estimate that dams in the upper cpr basin have caused a 44 reduction in sediment i e ratio of total dam trapping budget 46 9 104 188 7 104 539 8 104 sediment influx of the reservoirs dam discharge qs budget and trapping rates derived in this section are summarized in table 3 4 4 2 central plain sediment budget and its magnitude the central plain of thailand can be divided into the upper and lower central plain at nakhon sawan the upper central plain is only 29 of the lower central plain area the trunk rivers in the upper central plain have a higher slope 0 33 m km that flow on the hummocky terrain and the floodplain is poorly developed compared to the lower central plain the yom and nan consist mostly of the upper central plain 29 and 52 respectively while the ping s areal contribution is only 12 along the 100 km reach from y 16 to y 41 which covers most of the yom basin within the upper central plain it is estimated that there is 8 2 104 tons yr of sediment input from small tributaries those ungauged some of them drain from watersheds outside of the central plain fig 1a and table 2 for the nan basin the available qs records upstream of the n 67 are n 2b and n 81 both of which are outside of the upper central plain therefore we could not provide an estimate for the nan basin within the upper central plain however we deem that similar to yom river there can be some additional sediment inputs from the small rivers draining luang prabang range therefore we consider that sediment storage of the upper central plain to be limited downstream of nakhon sawan the river flows across the vast central plain and loses discharge and sediment load for two main reasons storage and loss of sediment and water in the floodplain and distributary channels such as the tha chin river although the tha chin river eventually flows into the gulf of thailand and therefore can be considered as part of qs of the cpr reaching the ocean water and sediment are lost to the floodplain during seasonal flooding and irrigation this means less water and sediment is discharged into the ocean in addition to the dams in the upper basin we quantify the seasonal storage of sediment in the central plain in a 150 km reach between c 2 and c 7a the reach most vulnerable to seasonal flooding liew et al 2016 fig 5 a there is a prominent qs peak at c 2 in october fig 5b which exceeds the qs in september by 150 moving downstream the qs difference between both months decreases and becomes similar at c 7a in terms of qs c 7a s is slightly less than half of c 2 which suggests significant loss of suspended sediment in the reach however quantifying the sediment budget of the floodplain by directly comparing qs at c 2 and c 7a is not possible due to sediment inputs from the tributaries and distributaries between the two stations fig 5c shows the seasonal sediment input ct 19 from sakae krang and outputs t 12 and ni 2 to tha chin and noi respectively as well as diversions through the irrigation canals from the cpr accounting for the complex hydrographic network between c 2 and c 7a the monthly floodplain storage of the reach is computed fig 5d the total annual sediment budget an average net transfer to the floodplain of the reach is 176x104 tons the sediment budget of the central plain s floodplain in october makes up 34 59 1 104 tons of the annual floodplain budget showing very high seasonal variability when comparing the channel geometry the bankfull width and depth of the cpr at c 2 are 360 and 12 3 m while it is much smaller at c 7a 120 and 16 5 m channel cross section data obtained from the rid the river in this reach is partially embanked in order to control the overbank flow at certain thresholds of water level and the excessive flood water is attenuated by additional retention reservoirs connected through the extensively developed canals in both sides of the cpr fig 5e this flood control philosophy is locally known as the monkey cheeks in thai pronounced as kaem ling based on the observation of king bhumibol adulyadej of thailand that monkeys store bananas in their cheeks conserving them to eat later the government public relations department 2016 the monkey cheeks can be the seasonal storages of flood water as well as paddy fields or detention basins most of them efficiently connected to the main channel through the irrigation canals mostly with silty and sandy materials we have not further decoupled the floodplain sediment budget into the loss through the canals or overbank dispersion due to the lack of data e g daily discharge data at each canal however given the extensively canaled landscape of the central plain fig 5a we regard the irrigation canals to be the main mechanism delivering a significant portion of sediment to floodplain there are also hardly any topographic variations in the central plain for this reason both the peak water and sediment discharges in this reach are effectively attenuated as clearly observed in figs 1d and 5b no outstanding peak sediment discharge in c 2 is observed in c 7a due to extensive floodplain sediment storage the annual floodplain storage of suspended sediment in this reach 176 104 tons is indeed high comprising almost 60 of qs at c 2 we compared the relative magnitude of the central plain s sediment budget to other large sediment laden rivers which are known for their inland sediment storage over naturally developed floodplains such as the amazon and mekong rivers we calculated the floodplain s suspended sediment deposition per unit distance along the lower reach of the rivers to assess the river sedimentation magnitude rsm tons km yr based on published values dunne et al 1998 park and latrubesse 2019 binh et al 2020 the rsms of the amazon mekong and cpr were reported as 650 000 in between negro river confluence and obidos 120 000 in between pakse and tan chau and 17 000 tons km yr in between c 2 and c 7a on average respectively the rsms were further normalized by their respective mean annual discharges i e 150 000 10 000 and 1 000 m3 s for each river to enable the comparison of the rsm across rivers with different scales the normalized rsms for the amazon and mekong were 4 3 and 12 respectively and the cpr s was 17 which is substantially higher than the other two large rivers fig 5f it is therefore concluded that the central plain reach of the cpr is an important sediment sink given its geographical scale it is interesting to note that this high rate of sediment storage in central plain largely happens through the canals while in the lower amazon floodplain channels are limited compared to overbank dispersion in transferring sediment to floodplain park and latrubesse 2017 park 2020 since the central plain stretches farther downstream from c 7a to the gulf of thailand 120 km the actual floodplain budget of the cpr in the lower basin is expected to be much larger in this study we did not use gauge station data downstream of c 7a due to the possible tidal influences when applied to the same rsm over this reach c 7a to mouth roughly 150 104 tons of extra loss of suspended sediment is calculated nevertheless based on crude extrapolation the annual floodplain sediment storage between c 2 and the cpr mouth could reach around 300x104 tons this value is comparable to the annual storage sum of the two mega dams upstream i e 302 104 in fact the significant role of the dams on sediment deficit in the cpr delta area has been analyzed by several studies e g saito et al 2007 winterwerp et al 2005 however the importance of floodplain storage on basin discharge to the gulf of thailand has yet to be recognized even though it poses a similar level of threat to the delta 5 summary and concluding remarks in this paper we provide a holistic view of hydro sedimentological regimes of the chao phraya river cpr basin the fifth largest basin in southeast asia our analysis is based on daily discharge of water since 1948 and sediment data since 2000 over 42 major stations across the basin all of them showed high seasonal variations in the sediment discharge with the maximum discharge occurring in october on an inter annual average in the case of the c 2 which has largest sediment flux in the cpr the peak flooding months september to november contribute almost 60 of the annual sediment load with the highest monthly qs of 79 104 tons in october 26 of the annual load at c 2 the peak qs in october is dramatically attenuated in c 7a 150 km downstream from c 2 mainly due to discharge diversion to irrigation canals distributaries and branches and seasonal flooding over the central plain sediment yield calculated at major stations varied spatially across the basin with a clear difference between eastern and western upper basins there is a decreasing pattern of sy in the downstream direction i e as drainage area increases the pca results indicated that quaternary surface erodibility index and average rainfall are closely associated with the watershed scale sy multiple regression model including other factors such as elevation and land cover yielded r2 of 0 87 with a p value 0 01 some stations in the upper basins watersheds showed very high sediment yields however the two mega dams bhumibol and sirikit each on ping and nan rivers trap 82 92 from the upstream sediment fluxes nevertheless since both dams are located upstream of the confluences with large tributaries in the upper basin wang and yom qs from those tributaries are still delivered to the lower basin without interference from the dams seasonal storage of sediment in the central plain in a reach between c 2 and c 7a was quantified to be 176x104 tons yr comprising almost 60 of qs at c 2 when this sedimentation magnitude is applied to the downstream reach a sediment budget of approximately 300 104 tons yr for the whole lower cpr basin was estimated although the significance of the dams on sediment deficit in the cpr delta area has been reported previously e g saito et al 2007 we recognize for the first time in this study the important role of floodplain storage on the basin s discharge of sediment to the gulf of thailand and therefore how it poses a similar level of threat to the delta in terms of sediment starvation this study contributes to the interests of scientific and non scientific communities in several aspects firstly this paper reveals the basin scale patterns of hydrology and sediment yields in the cpr based on analysis of a large volume of raw data from the thai government agencies secondly we identified the mega dams and the central plain as two comparably important inland sediment sinks in the cpr basin finally we hope that the spatial patterns of sediment source and deposition across different sub basins in cpr reported in this study will aid in improving the management strategies of the water and sediment resources in thailand since optical satellite images since the 1970 s are publicly available remote sensing can be used to estimate the ssc in the channel floodplain and reservoirs bernardo et al 2019 park and latrubesse 2014 and hence over the past 40 years qs can be reconstructed in the cpr this will enable further basin wide assessment of long term qs trends driven by human activities in the basin credit authorship contribution statement edward park conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding acquisition methodology project

4901,in this paper we provide a holistic view of the hydro sedimentological regimes of the chao phraya river cpr basin the fifth largest basin in southeast asia our analysis of daily discharge and sediment data from 42 major gauge stations showed high seasonal variation in the suspended sediment discharge qs with the maximum discharge occurring in october on an inter annual average at nakhon sawan the river discharges 304x104 tons of sediment every year 60 of which is transported in the peak flooding months september to november the peak sediment discharge in october is dramatically attenuated at a station 150 km downstream from nakhon sawan mainly due to discharge diversion to irrigation canals distributaries and branches as well as seasonal flooding over the central plain sediment yield sy calculated at major stations showed spatial variability across the basin generally decreasing in a downstream direction i e as drainage area increases r2 0 55 some stations in the upper basin s watersheds showed sy as high as 700 tons km2 yr which is comparable to upstream catchments of other large rivers with high sediment production two significant sediment sinks were identified in this study the bhumibol and sirikit dams each on ping and nan rivers which trap 236 104 tons of sediment each year 90 trapping rate as well as the floodplain of the cpr which stores 176 104 tons annually along the 150 km downstream reach from nakhon sawan 60 of qs at nakhon sawan by extrapolating the floodplain sediment budget we estimate that around 300 104 tons yr of suspended sediment can be stored downstream of nakhon sawan to the gulf comparable to the total annual storage of the two mega dams upstream although these dams have been previously reported to cause substantial sediment starvation in the cpr delta this study is the first to recognize the important role of lowland storage on the cpr s basin s sediment discharge to the gulf of thailand and how it contributes a similar degree of threat to the shrinking delta keywords chao phraya river discharge sediment yield hydrology human impacts thailand 1 research gap and motivation the chao phraya river cpr in thailand is the fifth largest river basin in southeast asia with a drainage area and mean annual discharge of close to 160 000 km2 and 1 000 m3 s respectively gupta et al 2012 it originates from the central cordillera near the border with myanmar and laos flows 1300 km across the basin and eventually drains into the gulf of thailand near bangkok the crucial role played by seasonal flooding of the cpr in supporting ecosystems and high biodiversity along its vast floodplains has been recognized hungspreug et al 2000 the cpr is fundamental to thailand s agricultural sector one of the country s major economic sectors which constitutes around 8 1 of the gdp in 2018 world bank 2020 in addition it is a major food source for numerous inhabitants along the riverine environment and serves as one of thailand s major transportation routes hossain and iamtrakul 2007 historically the cpr has connected numerous parts of the country through its extensive network hence the etymology of the cpr is river of mother in siamese central and south thais in tribute to its significance in thailand s history besides its historical significance the cpr also experiences numerous natural hazards and anthropogenic pressures for example the 2011 thailand flood in cpr basin was globally considered one of the most catastrophic flood disasters recorded in recent history resulting in 813 casualties and incurring us 46 billion in economic losses dhi 2012 world bank 2011 the cpr delta the third largest delta in southeast asia is presently sinking dramatically this is mainly attributed to intensive dredging upstream mega dams groundwater extraction around bangkok ongoing sea level rise and rapid coastal erosion which has destroyed more than 100 km2 of mangrove forest over the past 30 years saito et al 2007 winterwerp et al 2005 while there are existing studies contributing to the understanding of the hydrological and sediment regimes of the cpr the former is mainly focused on the numerical simulations of discharge under the future climate change e g kure and tebakari 2012 kotsuki et al 2014 ligaray et al 2015 watanabe et al 2014 hunukumbura and tachikawa 2012 and land cover change thanapakpawin et al 2007 petchprayoon et al 2010 in the cpr basin most of the gcm based discharge regime studies predict future increases in discharge while kim et al 2005 expected a decrease due to crop field expansion in contrast wilk et al 2001 reported no findings of a solid relationship between deforestation and discharge through a catchment scale study in north eastern thailand despite an 80 to 27 decrease in forest cover over the last 30 years in the 2010s there was a spike in the number of hydrological studies on the cpr basin pertaining to the increased flooding frequency including the deadliest flood of 2011 e g mateo et al 2014 komori et al 2012 jamrussri and toda 2017 tebakari et al 2012 however almost no research articles have been dedicated to conceptualizing the basin scale hydrology and sediment regimes of the cpr knowledge of the cpr sediment regime is still nascent one of the pioneer studies of sediment regime by alford 1992 focuses on the northern mountainous catchments the first basin wide scale assessment by jica 2000 calculated qs at nakhon sawan prior to and during the construction of the bhumibol and sirikit dams until 1972 fig 1 a averaged 25 3 million tons per year mtons yr thereafter it decreased to 6 6 mtons yr bidorn et al 2016 reconstructed historical qs from the 1950s by using discharge based rating curves at major gauge stations concluding that there was no significant decrease of qs between 1950s and 1995 possibly due to intensified erosion runoff from agricultural expansion which negated the effects of the dam instead they reported a reduction in qs only after 1995 which may have been due to a large scale flood reduction infrastructure development after the severe flood of 1995 hovius 1998 through the compilation of available gauge station data from different sources reported that the cpr at nakhon sawan used to transport 11 mtons yr prior to the dams this is less than half of jica s estimation in spite of discrepancies in reported qs values and their trends among the small number of existing articles there is a general consensus on the dramatic decrease in qs delivered to the gulf of thailand over the past century gupta et al 2012 the serious shift of delta accretion rate from 1 5 km2 yr to that of an erosional phase saito et al 2007 is also a testament to this collectively our literature review here is indicative of the current rudimentary understanding of the cpr s sediment regime showing a clear necessity for a consolidated characterization of the qs regime refer to si fig 1 for the available literature about the cpr compared to other large rivers in southeast asia in this study we characterize the basin wide patterns of the hydrology and sediment fluxes yield across the cpr basin we first obtained hydrological data from 211 stations across the cpr basin and analyzed daily discharge q since the 1970s and qs since 2000 data among them we selected stations based on the three criteria 1 location for example the lowermost station that represents the catchment regimes or upstream stations in the headwater area to assess the sediment sourcing erosion and weathering 2 data quality filtering outliers in order to obtain representative trends in inter annual seasonality and 3 data availability using at least five years of record to ensure the accuracy of the seasonal trends whilst ensuring continuity in data using the q and qs data from our selected 42 major stations we first report their q and qs regimes by presenting the inter annual average based on long term data and discuss in detail the intra annual seasonal patterns of q and qs over six major stations that either represent the cpr basin or its sub basins sediment yields of sub basin scale are also computed and their heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns across the cpr basin are analyzed since the cpr is a large basin with heterogeneous hydroclimatic regimes geological setting as well as different degrees of human induced environmental impacts the spatial patterns of sediment yields are further investigated in relation to surface geology rainfall trends and land cover data finally we discuss the sediment budget of the mega dams in the upper basin and the central plain in the lower basin and identify them as key sediment sinks that determine the sediment flux arriving at the coast 2 the chao phraya river cpr basin the chao phraya river cpr originates near the central cordillera around the thailand myanmar laos borders daen lao range along the northeast and luang prabang range along the northeast flowing across nearly 160 000 km2 almost 40 of the country draining into the gulf of thailand fig 1a the overall basin relief is not high compared to other large rivers which drain the himalayas in southeast asia e g mekong or ganges brahmaputra more than 80 of the total area in the cpr basin lies below 600 m asl at the elevation threshold of 300 m it transits from hanging intermontane valleys of the cordillera draining steep highlands to the lowland of the cpr basin that occupy a broad graben 23 of the basin 37 000 km2 lies below 50 m asl these areas are referred to in this study as the central plain of thailand fig 1b the basin is broadly divided at nakhon sawan into an upper and lower cpr basin the upper basin contains four large tributary catchments which we refer to in this study as sub basins ping 34 537 km2 wang 10 793 km2 tributary of ping yom 24 047 km2 tributary of nan and nan 34 682 km2 the ping and nan rivers merge at nakhon sawan from that point until it drains into the gulf the river is referred to as the cpr two major tributaries along the cpr in the lower basin are sakae krang 4 907 km2 and pa sak 15 626 km2 there are also distributaries such as tha chin which diverge at chai nat and smaller branches such as noi and lop buri along with several irrigation canals loc et al 2020 although the relief of the basin is generally low the slope of the upper tributary catchments is generally high 1m km the ping river upstream of the wang confluence has a channel slope close to 2 m km fig 1c the slope in the central plain is very low with approximately 0 2 m km on average the cordilleran sub basins ping wang yom and nan consist of broad 5 25 km wide intermontane valleys that are mostly above 300 m elevation incised parallel to the regional geological fabric defined by north south striking permotriassic sutures assembling paleozoic predominantly marine sedimentary sequences metcalfe 2011 geologic map of thailand 2013 abundant arc granites associated felsic metavolcanics and proximal marine sequences are associated with these sutures as is the predominantly north south fabric of the landscape that governs drainage patterns precambrian mostly amphibolite grade metamorphics are abundant in the upper ping drainage around chiang mai the headlands of the pa sak sub basin are along the western margin of the khorat plateau a region of northeastern thailand dominated by flat lying undeformed cretaceous fluvial sequences saminpanya et al 2014 isolated neogene and quaternary volcanic centers occur throughout the region with the largest concentration in the lower pa sak sub basin some 5 000 km2 in size the pitanulok and chao phraya basins form a 100 150 km wide composite graben extending from the sukhothai region south to bangkok and the gulf of thailand these basins contain extensive quaternary cover underlain by kilometres thick basin fill dating back to the miocene the large size of these basins accounts for the steep hypsometric curve in fig 1b for elevations below 200 m while the minor irregularity in this curve at approximately 200 300 m reflects the recent activity of basin marginal graben structures typical of monsoonal regimes the cpr basin has a typical tropical savanna climate with two distinct seasons that are characterized by great seasonal variability of rainfall total annual around 800 000 million m3 simachaya and yolthantha 2006 every year storms cause large floods across the cpr basin during the rainy season typically may october these are associated with tropical depressions developed from typhoons in the south china sea moving westward across the indochina peninsula wood and ziegler 2008 therefore the annual hydrographs in the cpr show peak discharge usually around october fig 1d the highest discharge in the basin is observed in nakhon sawan where the ping and nan rivers converge downstream of nakhon sawan the river starts diverting water through distributaries branches or floodplains for this reason nakhon sawan is considered the most important gauge station in the cpr since the basin s flux is the largest at this station mean annual discharge mad 946 m3 s the discharge variability is significant because the mean monthly discharge at c 2 ranges from 400 april to 2 500 october m3 s with only four months a year august november above 1 000 m3 s on average another interesting seasonal discharge pattern observed in the nan ping and sakae krang basins all along the mountain range along the western boundary of the basin is the secondary peaks of q around may which reflect the heterogeneous seasonal climatic patterns within the basin the seasonal flood regime in cpr is mainly controlled by the two mega dams at upstream sub basins the bhumibol construction completed in 1965 along the ping river and sirikit construction completed in 1972 along the nan river with reservoir areas of 364 000 and 13 100 km2 respectively collectively their storage capacities total up to 23 billion m3 although there are nine other reservoirs in the cpr basin the sum of their total storage is only around 4 billion m3 operation of the dams during the rainy season is particularly important since it aids in controlling flooding downstream and also determines the availability of water for the subsequent dry season in terms of sediment regime these dams in the upstream basin have been regarded as the main cause of the drastic reduction of sediment delivered through nakhon sawan and eventually to the delta refer to introduction however given that 1 the basin area of the two sub basins without impoundments wang and yom are comparable to the two other sub basins 2 surface geology across the upstream basin is heterogeneous 3 upstream basins have undergone a substantial land cover change recently sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 paiboonvorachat and oyana 2011 and 4 the sediment regimes of these sub basins have yet to be well studied the real impact of these dams on the sediment delivery downstream in terms of flux and budget remains uncertain other than the two mega dams in the basin the cpr dam at nakhon sawan and the pa sak dam could be considered locally important cpr dam is a run of the river dam that produces hydropower while pa sak dam finished in 1998 is an impoundment that serves irrigation purposes in the eastern cpr basin 3 data and methods 3 1 gauge stations measurement protocols and data availability daily q m3 s and qs tons day data across 211 gauge stations over the chao phraya river cpr basin were obtained from the hydrology division of the royal irrigation department rid of thailand measurements of water levels began in the early 1900s these were mostly for stations located in the central plain measurements gradually expanded to other locations discharge and sediment fluxes have been measured at selected stations since around the 1948 and the 2000s respectively the organization of data follows the thai water year system which starts in april and ends in march of the following year q is frequently measured mostly by the cross section area velocity approach in this approach velocity is measured by the current meter at multiple depths across the channel width and occasionally using an acoustic doppler profilers adp then water level discharge rating curves are developed for each station to reconstruct an estimate of historical daily q daily q is then multiplied by the average suspended sediment concentration ssc where ssc is measured mostly using the grab sampler at the water surface close to the channel center rating curves logarithmic re calibrated once a year are then developed with q to estimate daily qs at each station the availability of q and qs data varies widely among stations on average q data has been available since 1973 on the other hand major stations such as c 13 in the downstream reach have discharge data from 1948 however it is important to note that most stations have missing records throughout the available period for example q data at p 17 spans from 1955 to 2013 however there are 18 years with missing records there are several reasons for these gaps in data malfunction or loss due to flood or landslides insufficient manpower for maintenance for certain years or simply the loss of record during the archiving process sediment samples for concentration in the cpr have been collected mostly after 2007 likewise not all stations have complete years of sediment sampling record since data availability is of utmost concern we tried to secure data from the lowermost stations of the basins and up and downstream of major tributaries for analysis of hydro sedimentological impacts of upper catchments 3 2 data quality control we first averaged daily q and qs into monthly averages to ensure consistency in the quality of data we applied the following filters 1 we only used years with more than ten months of records i e a year with only nine months of data would be omitted from the analysis if a year had less than two months of missing data a moving average was used to interpolate the data 2 only stations with at least two years of records were chosen i e if a station only has one year s worth of records it is excluded from the analysis 3 data from 2011 the year of the greatest flood loc et al 2020 was removed from the q and qs analyses because their values in the flood peak month usually october is more than three times of other years with typical hydrological conditions since the main objective of the paper is to characterize the general hydrology and sediment transport regimes of the river we deemed that using records from an anomalously wet year would distort the results this also stems from the recognition that records from 2011 would inevitably have large margins of errors since the discharge water level rating curve method is used to estimate q and in turn qs during the peak flow of 2011 the water levels greatly exceeded the bankfull capacity of the channel in the lower cpr reach therefore a significant volume of water was lost to the floodplain through overbank dispersion and the floodplain water budget in 2011 is still unknown loc et al 2020 also there must have been a significant reorganization of channel bedforms due to the abnormally high sandy material transport during the flood bidorn et al 2015 hence adapting previous year s rating curve may not be valid for estimating q for that particular year nevertheless we report the annual sediment discharge of 2011 qs2011 calculated from the gauge station records where available for reader s reference we only used records of qs after 2007 when ssc data were collected at the gauge stations while in theory more than 50 years of daily qs record could be constructed using rating curves between water level q qs this process contains some major uncertainties related to non stationarity due to changes in driving factors these may include regional scale climate regimes geological characteristics of the watershed local channel geometry as well as land use cover change among these the last two have undergone significant changes over recent decades bidorn et al 2015 paiboonvorachat and oyana 2011 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 finally we chose 42 stations which are well distributed across the cpr basin fig 1a with the assurance that their data are by far the most reliable and geographically representative among them 28 68 7 13 31 0 and 14 33 3 are from the upper lower basins and the central plain respectively the number of stations in each sub basin ranges from 5 to 7 except for tha chin which only has 1 in terms of the data period used to calculate the annual qs there are variations between stations with an average of 9 years overall both the ping and wang sub basins are relatively well gauged with the exception of p 78 which only has one year record with many of their stations having 18 years of time series on average 14 years for the two sub basins the nan and yom are comparatively less well gauged with 6 stations collectively y 6 y 14 y 16 n 2b n 81 and n 1 having only one year s record i e after 2018 the most downstream station in the ping river n 67 which is also the largest sub basin in the upper basin 21 of the cpr basin has 8 years of record 2007 2014 therefore the qs regime of the ping basin is well represented qs at the stations along the cpr downstream of nakhon sawan have 7 years on average 3 3 water and sediment yield analysis across the basin after the quality of the collected data had been reviewed mean monthly q and total monthly qs were calculated for the 42 selected stations across the cpr basin we reconstructed the monthly qs q rating curve for each major station using power functions since their phases are strongly correlated bidorn et al 2016 since sediment was primarily sampled using grab samples at the surface and it has been measured by bidorn et al 2015 that the bedload generally constitutes 5 of the total load transport in the cpr though the ratio varies among rivers it is inferred that the sediment discharge in this study is predominantly wash load clay and silty materials with only a small fraction of suspended sand both of which are at least semi permanently in suspension colby 1963 to characterize the intensity of source fluxes across different sub basins in the cpr we calculated sediment yield tons km2 yr for the basins of selected stations each sub basin and watershed were delineated based on the flow direction raster derived from the multi error removed improved terrain dem merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 3 4 analysis of factors controlling sediment yield to further assess the regional variations of sediment yield we considered mean elevation and elevation above 300 m asl surface geology as it relates to erodibility of various rock types precipitation and land cover an elevation threshold of 300 m was selected as it represents the approximate transition between the hanging intermontane valleys which drain steep highlands and the lowlands of the southern cpr river slopes above 300 m are on average much steeper fig 1 the abundance of quaternary sediments is an important parameter because these unlithified deposits are easily mobilized making them part of the dynamic erosional landscape proportions of each geologic unit in respective subbasins were determined as a percentage area based on the geologic map supplied by the coordinating committee for geoscience programme http www ccop or th erosivity of bedrock was considered in the context of the erodibility index proposed by moosdorf et al 2018 which offers an estimate of the sediment production potential of various rock types normalized to granite which is assigned an index value of 1 the erodibility index offers an estimate of the sediment yield of different rock types and this estimate was weighted by the percentage area of different lithic rock types within each sub basin to obtain a basin wide erodibility index we processed the freely available 3b43 monthly precipitation estimates product from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm to obtain rainfall over the cpr basin trmm 2011 the data was resampled from 0 25 to 1 km via google earth engine land cover data 300 m from the european space agency s esa climate change initiative cci was downloaded https www esa landcover cci org for the year 2010 the numerous land cover classes were broadly aggregated into 4 classes cropland forest urban grass and or shrubland and water we adopted a two step multivariate analysis i e principal component analysis pca and multi variable linear regression analysis pca is a widely used dimensionality reduction method for large datasets that transforms a set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the original dataset e g loc et al 2017 pca is used to explore the underlying correlations of the latent variables in this case five measurements including quaternary sedimentary rocks erodibility index catchment areas of urban and crops catchment areas of forests areas with elevation greater than 300 m and rainfall we included the estimated sy as the supplementary variable to visualize its relationships with the six aforementioned latent variables in the second step we developed a multilinear regression model to verify the contributions of the six latent variables to the dependent variable the sy of the cpr 3 5 sediment budget of the central plain we hypothesize that the central plain of thailand is an important sediment sink although the magnitude of the sediment trapping and its contribution to the total cpr discharge remains unknown most of the central plain is seasonally flooded and it contains most of thailand s paddy fields this extensive conversion started since the early 20th century around 20 of the country had been converted to paddy fields before the 1960s which then increased to about 40 in the early 1980s center for agricultural statistics 1994 charuppat 1998 we focused on the central plain of the lower basin to calculate the monthly and annual sediment budget of the 150 km long reach between c 2 and c 7a fig 1a with a low channel gradient and relief this reach is where the cpr is mostly embanked and meandering with an average sinuosity index of approximately 1 46 the floodplain in the reach is highly susceptible to seasonal flooding and was also largely inundated during the 2011 flood liew et al 2016 loc et al 2020 by conceptualizing the complex hydrographic network tributaries distributaries and irrigation canals diversion in this reach we derived the following equation for the sediment budget of the reach reach scale map provided in section 4 4 1 change i n s e d i m e n t s t o r a g e c 2 c t 19 t 12 n i 2 c a n a l s c 7 a where all terms are cumulative sums of daily qs to represent total monthly qs in million tons at respective gauge stations canals denote the qs of the two important irrigation canals makamthao uthong and chainat ayutthaya which merges with the downstream main channels monthly ssc at c 2 were used to estimate qs at the canals since there are more than 30 other small to medium irrigation canals along the river between c 2 and c 7a we hypothesize that majority of water and sediment in the central plain floodplain is transferred through the canals we did not consider the qs diversion to the lop buri branch because most of the floodplain along that branch is upstream of c 7a moreover it eventually re joins the main cpr downstream 4 results and discussion 4 1 properties of the measured sediments at the gauge stations although it is mentioned above that the measured sediment is predominantly washload possibly with some suspended sand we first present an in depth discussion on the properties of the measured sediments at the gauge stations like other large anabranching rivers which flow in low gradient landscapes with islands the cpr could also be considered a washload clay and silt dominated river in terms of sediment properties however there are significant variations within the basin these are attributed to the heterogeneous surface geology and topography that control weathering intensity hydrological regimes and land cover therefore it might be difficult to make basin scale generalizations based on only one property of the sediments moreover several existing studies have reported contrasting results some local scale studies based on field measurements have reported that rivers in the upper basins can have only up to 30 40 of the total load consisting of bed load chanyotha and chadchawan 1995 tae sombat 1988 however kitisuntorn 1994 estimated the proportion of bedload to be around 1 2 in the northern part of the nan basin later on bidorn et al 2015 reported that bedload generally constitutes 5 of the total load transport in the cpr this was based on the 17 bedload samples that were collected across the four sub basins in the upper cpr they also posited that bedload fraction increased with increasing q however 13 of the samples constituted 5 10 of which had 1 of bedload most recently based on field measurement during 2011 2013 namsai et al 2020 also showed that the bedload fraction was 5 in the yom river regardless of the bedload fraction in the upper basin we believe that almost no coarse load is transported in the lower basin as most of the sandy load is trapped in the reservoirs in the ping and nan basin the formation of muddy tidal flats of the cpr through the accumulation of clay sediment tanabe et al 2003 uehara et al 2010 is also a testament to the absence of coarse material being transported 4 2 sediment yield sy of sub basins and determinant factors sediment yields calculated at major stations showed spatial variability across the basin and we analyzed the patterns using different factors fig 2 there is a clear difference in the magnitude of sediment production between the upper eastern and western basins the nan has a much higher sediment yield sy than ping the highest sy recorded at nan is 268 8 tons km2 yr at n 81 while the highest at ping is 58 9 tons km2 yr at p 75 overall when plotted against drainage basin area sy showed a decreasing pattern in the downstream direction i e as drainage area increases with r2 0 47 not including the stations downstream the dams i e n 2b n 67 p 17 and s 9 fig 2d when removed two stations on the 3rd order tributaries i e ct 20 and p 78 that drain the relatively small area along the western cordillera of the cpr basin it further increased the r2 to 0 55 as indicated in fig 2d here we report the watershed scale pca and multiple linear regression analysis results using 18 stations located upstream of the dams that overlap with the cordillera at least partially fig 3 and table 1 we excluded w 17 in the analysis because the watershed area 729 km2 is even smaller than the size of a single trmm pixel hence the actual amount of on the w 17 watershed is unknown the pca results show the effective representation of the original data using 2 principal components with the accumulated explained variances of 78 9 the projection of the latent explanatory variables onto the two dimensional plane pc1 pc2 is therefore effective in revealing their underlying relationships specifically the latent variables quaternary surface and erodibility index are closely correlated with the sy as illustrated by the bundled position of the respective vector arrows in fig 3 annual rainfall is also associated with sy albeit to a much lesser degree it should be noted since sediment yields are the dependent variable it was not included in pca on the other hand three other latent variables urban forests and elevation 300 m are not significantly correlated with the sediment yields our multiple regression analysis including 6 latent variables confirmed the statistical significance p value 0 01 at 99 confidence level of the quaternary surface and erodibility index in controlling the watershed scale sy in the cpr basin similarly annual rainfall contribution is slightly less significant with p value 0 05 the other remaining variables are not statistically significant which is in line with the assessments from pca the multilinear regression model itself is also significant at p value 0 01 with the adjusted r2 of 0 87 the summary statistics of the model is presented in table 1 the sediment yield of ping river measured at p 73 upstream of the dam showed a relatively low average sy of 27 4 tons km2 yr among sub basins although ping basin is relatively high in elevation the western cordillera along the thong chai range are mostly composed of triassic felsic plutonic rocks which are resistant to erosion and also the average rainfall 1 330 mm yr was below the average of cpr basin the extensive intra cratonic basin around chiang mai may also efficiently trap sediment the overall sy quaternary surface and erodibility index of the wang basin are high while the basin wide average rainfall is moderate at 1281 287 mm yr this may indicate that other local scale factors such as flash floods may induce episodic sediment fluxes into the river from landslides or bank erosion the yom basin has relatively low sy and other factors including average rainfall the northern part of the basin where it overlaps with the cordillera is mostly resistant rocks such as triassic sedimentary rocks for the nan basin there were only two stations analyzed in terms of sy n 81 and n 1 which may not properly represent the basin although there is regional variability of sediment production sys of mountainous areas in the nan and ping basins are comparable to sy measured at upstream catchments of other rivers flowing highly erodible terrains around the world such as the mississippi new zealand along with the river basins in andes or even taiwan milliman and farnsworth 2013 for instance sy in the wang basin can be as high as 705 1 and 623 7 tons km2 yr at w 17 and w 25 respectively and up to 268 8 tons km2 yr in the nan basin at n 81 4 3 discharge and sediment load in the cpr at key stations among the 42 stations are 6 important stations deserving of special attention because they are representative of the cpr basin or their respective sub basins these stations p 17 n 67 ct 19 s 9 c 2 and c 7a in fig 4 all showed q and qs to be in phase with each other differences in the shape of the rating curves are related to the characteristics of each watershed asselman 2000 i e size of the basin hence discharge surface geology and erodibility as well as rainfall regimes all of which are exhaustively discussed in the previous section effective discharge peak sediment discharge is observed during the peak flow which is mainly driven by the monsoonal regime of the basin as such erosion and transport of materials are concentrated in a few months every year in the case of the c 2 and c 7a about 59 and 75 of the annual sediment discharge occurs only during the three months september october and november respectively fig 4 during the dry season especially february to june sediment discharge is almost zero at c 7a in other words a very low amount of sediment reaches the delta during the dry season jarupongsakul et al 2007 approximately 45 km upstream of the confluence of the cpr is p 17 the lowermost station in the ping river it is therefore representative of the tributary basin s total fluxes covering 98 9 of the basin the q and qs are 359 1 m3 s and 99x104 tons yr respectively accounting for 38 and 32 5 of the water and sediment fluxes of the cpr basin at c 2 bidorn et al 2015 estimated the qs of ping river at p 2a as 60 104 tons yr based on historically reconstructed daily qs data 1952 2010 p 2a is approximately 150 km upstream of p 17 between both stations are several small scale tributaries most of them width 10 m which drain the western mountainous area close to myanmar border where sediment yields can be relatively high details in the next section however floodplain water storage is limited with narrow fluvial belt and steeper slope as inferred from the maximum flood extent map during the 2011 flood loc et al 2020 in this reach this explains the downstream increase of qs from p 2a to p 17 the nan basin is the largest in the upper cpr basin n 67 about 30 km upstream from nakhon sawan representing 96 7 of the basin is the lowermost station immediately downstream of the yom confluence q and qs at n 67 are 499 m3 s and 216x104 tons yr respectively relative to the ping q is around 28 larger while qs is 54 2 larger indicating higher rates of sediment production in the nan basin the nan basin contributes around 72 of the sediment discharge at c 2 and is therefore considered the most important tributary in terms of sediment transport however the nan basin s sediment discharge has yet to be reported interestingly most of the qs recorded at n 7a is not contributed from the nan river itself but a tributary draining eastern watershed through n 81 without accounting for the yom basin bidorn et al 2015 estimated qs at n 7a which is about 120 km upstream from n 67 at 138x104 tons yr approximately 100 km upstream of n 7a and immediately downstream of the sirikit dam is n 2b which has qs of 16 104 tons yr on the other hand qs at n 81 is 137 104 tons yr given that the drainage area of n 2b is about 5 times larger than that of n 81 it is inferred that there is significant sediment trapping in sirikit reservoir the total qs of these two stations 153 104 tons yr exceeds that of n 7a by 20 104 as reported by bidorn et al 2015 this is likely due to the diversion of water for agricultural purposes and seasonal flooding in that reach as mentioned previously c 2 is regarded as the most important station in the cpr basin because it has the largest q and qs the mad and annual qs at c 2 are 946 m3 s and 304 104 tons yr respectively due to water loss downstream of nakhon sawan resulting from the diversion of water to floodplain and canals it is interesting to note that the mad at c 7a i e 480 m3 s is almost half of c 2 s another noteworthy aspect is that peak discharge at c 7a almost simultaneously occurs with c 2 fig 1d despite the gentle channel slope of the central plain in fact the peak discharge at c 7a is reached a month earlier than p 17 which is almost 300 km upstream from c 7a this phenomenon has been recently analyzed by loc et al 2020 who attributed it to the substantial amounts of local rainfall received by the lower cpr during the early rainy season sakae krang and pa sak are the two main tributaries of the cpr sakae krang s q and qs are estimated at ct 19 to be 242 m3 s and 25x104 tons yr respectively they are also the most important hydrological input between c 2 and c 7a the r2 of the qs q rating curve at ct 19 was 0 74 the lowest among major stations fig 4c this may be due to the relatively small size of the sub basin which renders it unable to accommodate climatic variability as well as its poorly developed floodplains cannot effectively attenuate flood waves the non correlative relationship between ssc and q in fig 4c along with the fact that peak q and qs in sakae krang both occur in september while all others were in october also attests to the unpredictable qs and flash flood regimes of the sub basin pa sak is the largest and the lowermost tributary of the cpr contributing an average of 73 m3 s and 16 104 tons of sediment annually while the basin area of pa sak is more than four times that of the sakae krang q and qs are substantially lower around 30 and 64 respectively we attribute this to the pa sak dam located along the middle reach of the main channel discussed in the next section stations downstream of the cpr confluence with pa sak river are affected by tidal influences as such they were not analyzed in this study 4 4 major sediment storage in the cpr basin 4 4 1 dam trapping of sediment the combination of large seasonal variability of discharge stemming from the monsoonal regime and the generally flat terrain makes the lower cpr basin extremely vulnerable to seasonal flooding the two mega dams along the main stem of the ping and nan rivers play an important role in controlling floods mateo et al 2014 komori et al 2012 tebakari et al 2012 while these dams have managed to mitigate flooding they have also resulted in a great decrease of sediment load being transported to the delta it has been estimated by jica 2000 that prior to the dams the cpr used to transport 25 3 mt of sediment per year which has now decreased by almost 75 to the current 6 6 mtons yr hovius 1998 reported that sediment transport of the cpr at nakhon sawan prior to the dam construction was 11 mtons yr i e 43 of the estimation by jica 2000 which then decreased to 3 mtons yr after the construction of dams in contrast bidorn et al 2016 stated that based on historical reconstruction of daily qs at nakhon sawan there had been no significant decrease in sediment discharge until 1995 which is almost two decades after the construction of the bhumibol dam beyond differences in reported qs values is the indisputable dramatic decrease in qs delivered to the gulf of thailand over the past century in this section we provide the most updated and refined values based on sediment samples collected after 2007 to assess the present rate of sediment trapping at the two mega dams we calculate the trapping rate by taking the qs differences at the two nearest stations that are upstream and downstream of the dam a simple longitudinal approach to estimate sediment trapping at bhumibol reservoir we integrated qs records from the two stations w 4a 89 104 tons yr and p 17 99 104 tons yr theoretically the sum of qs at w 4a and bhumibol s qs should be the qs at p 17 assuming no sediment input output between the dam and p 17 which is located about 270 km downstream from the dam this assumption holds because the floodplain in that reach is poorly developed and the terrain is generally characterized by hummocky structures with inselbergs of mesozoic and paleozoic bedrock protruding through the thin quaternary cover it is likely that minor tectonic uplift of this area has also occurred from motion along with basin marginal graben structures to the east moreover the sediment input from the tributaries whilst unknown may be considered minor because their drainage area along the western cordillera part of western thongchai range is very small fig 2a for these reasons we estimate the qs along the reach between the dam and p 17 to be stable therefore qs immediately downstream from the bhumibol dam is estimated as 10 104 tons yr i e the difference between qs at p 17 and w 4a the lowermost station located upstream from the dam is p 73 42 5x104 tons yr 115 km upstream from the dam there is one major tributary that drains the alluvial gorge between the two north eastern cordilleras with highly erodible areas western thongchai and thongchai ranges fig 2a the qs input from this tributary is estimated from the p 73 record based on the area load approach milliman et al 1999 we used qs at p 73 and extrapolated this value based on area i e upstream of the dam area is 134 of the area of p 73 watershed therefore qs of 56 9 104 42 5 104 134 tons was assumed to flow into the reservoir each year comparing this to the annual dam sediment discharge of 10x104 tons yields a trapping rate of 82 4 regarding the sirikit dam the only station upstream with available data is n 1 where qs is 77 3 104 tons yr n 1 is located about 150 km upstream from the dam accounting for three major tributaries which drain the luang prabang range and phi pan nam mountains fig 2a both regions are characterized by high erosion applying the same area load approach as that of the bhumibol reservoir we extrapolated qs from n 1 to estimate the sediment load entering the sirikit reservoir the area of the watershed upstream of the sirikit dam is 265 of the n 1 watershed therefore 204 8 104 77 3 104 265 tons of sediment was assumed to flow into the reservoir each year from this we calculated the trapping rate to be 92 1 by comparing with the qs downstream at n 2b 16 1 104 tons yr however the actual trapping rate exceeds our calculated value since n 2b is about 50 km downstream along the flat terrain where water and washload sediment can be lost due to irrigation and seasonal flooding similar to what has been observed after the construction of reservoirs worldwide e g syvitski et al 2005 vörösmarty et al 2003 walling and fang 2003 the existence of these reservoirs is the primary cause of the reduction in suspended sediment in the cpr still it is fortunate that both mega dams are located upstream of confluences where large tributaries from the upper basin converge wang and yom each discharge 117 8 104 and 68 7 104 tons annually at w 3a and y 41 respectively hence qs from those tributaries is delivered to the lower basin without interference from the dams the nan basin a watershed draining the eastern cordillera luang prabang range through n 81 also has a high qs of 137 3 104 tons yr the total qs from these three tributaries is 323 8 104 tons yr which is even higher than the annual qs at nakhon sawan 304 2 104 tons as measured at c 2 this indicates that although suspended sediment is stored in the floodplains which are downstream of the ping and nan rivers there is still a significant volume of sediment which remains unaffected by dams that is being supplied to the lower basin whether planned or inadvertently in the cpr basin the strategic placement of dams outside of tributaries with high sediment contribution downstream has been recently suggested in the neighbouring mekong basin schmitt et al 2018 2019 this finding leads to the following conclusion if these two dams did not exist the qs at c 2 would increase by 77 to be 539 8 104 tons yr this is based on the sum of qs at c 2 304 2 104 tons yr trapped qs of 46 9 104 and 188 7 104 tons yr at the dam sites of ping and nan respectively therefore we estimate that dams in the upper cpr basin have caused a 44 reduction in sediment i e ratio of total dam trapping budget 46 9 104 188 7 104 539 8 104 sediment influx of the reservoirs dam discharge qs budget and trapping rates derived in this section are summarized in table 3 4 4 2 central plain sediment budget and its magnitude the central plain of thailand can be divided into the upper and lower central plain at nakhon sawan the upper central plain is only 29 of the lower central plain area the trunk rivers in the upper central plain have a higher slope 0 33 m km that flow on the hummocky terrain and the floodplain is poorly developed compared to the lower central plain the yom and nan consist mostly of the upper central plain 29 and 52 respectively while the ping s areal contribution is only 12 along the 100 km reach from y 16 to y 41 which covers most of the yom basin within the upper central plain it is estimated that there is 8 2 104 tons yr of sediment input from small tributaries those ungauged some of them drain from watersheds outside of the central plain fig 1a and table 2 for the nan basin the available qs records upstream of the n 67 are n 2b and n 81 both of which are outside of the upper central plain therefore we could not provide an estimate for the nan basin within the upper central plain however we deem that similar to yom river there can be some additional sediment inputs from the small rivers draining luang prabang range therefore we consider that sediment storage of the upper central plain to be limited downstream of nakhon sawan the river flows across the vast central plain and loses discharge and sediment load for two main reasons storage and loss of sediment and water in the floodplain and distributary channels such as the tha chin river although the tha chin river eventually flows into the gulf of thailand and therefore can be considered as part of qs of the cpr reaching the ocean water and sediment are lost to the floodplain during seasonal flooding and irrigation this means less water and sediment is discharged into the ocean in addition to the dams in the upper basin we quantify the seasonal storage of sediment in the central plain in a 150 km reach between c 2 and c 7a the reach most vulnerable to seasonal flooding liew et al 2016 fig 5 a there is a prominent qs peak at c 2 in october fig 5b which exceeds the qs in september by 150 moving downstream the qs difference between both months decreases and becomes similar at c 7a in terms of qs c 7a s is slightly less than half of c 2 which suggests significant loss of suspended sediment in the reach however quantifying the sediment budget of the floodplain by directly comparing qs at c 2 and c 7a is not possible due to sediment inputs from the tributaries and distributaries between the two stations fig 5c shows the seasonal sediment input ct 19 from sakae krang and outputs t 12 and ni 2 to tha chin and noi respectively as well as diversions through the irrigation canals from the cpr accounting for the complex hydrographic network between c 2 and c 7a the monthly floodplain storage of the reach is computed fig 5d the total annual sediment budget an average net transfer to the floodplain of the reach is 176x104 tons the sediment budget of the central plain s floodplain in october makes up 34 59 1 104 tons of the annual floodplain budget showing very high seasonal variability when comparing the channel geometry the bankfull width and depth of the cpr at c 2 are 360 and 12 3 m while it is much smaller at c 7a 120 and 16 5 m channel cross section data obtained from the rid the river in this reach is partially embanked in order to control the overbank flow at certain thresholds of water level and the excessive flood water is attenuated by additional retention reservoirs connected through the extensively developed canals in both sides of the cpr fig 5e this flood control philosophy is locally known as the monkey cheeks in thai pronounced as kaem ling based on the observation of king bhumibol adulyadej of thailand that monkeys store bananas in their cheeks conserving them to eat later the government public relations department 2016 the monkey cheeks can be the seasonal storages of flood water as well as paddy fields or detention basins most of them efficiently connected to the main channel through the irrigation canals mostly with silty and sandy materials we have not further decoupled the floodplain sediment budget into the loss through the canals or overbank dispersion due to the lack of data e g daily discharge data at each canal however given the extensively canaled landscape of the central plain fig 5a we regard the irrigation canals to be the main mechanism delivering a significant portion of sediment to floodplain there are also hardly any topographic variations in the central plain for this reason both the peak water and sediment discharges in this reach are effectively attenuated as clearly observed in figs 1d and 5b no outstanding peak sediment discharge in c 2 is observed in c 7a due to extensive floodplain sediment storage the annual floodplain storage of suspended sediment in this reach 176 104 tons is indeed high comprising almost 60 of qs at c 2 we compared the relative magnitude of the central plain s sediment budget to other large sediment laden rivers which are known for their inland sediment storage over naturally developed floodplains such as the amazon and mekong rivers we calculated the floodplain s suspended sediment deposition per unit distance along the lower reach of the rivers to assess the river sedimentation magnitude rsm tons km yr based on published values dunne et al 1998 park and latrubesse 2019 binh et al 2020 the rsms of the amazon mekong and cpr were reported as 650 000 in between negro river confluence and obidos 120 000 in between pakse and tan chau and 17 000 tons km yr in between c 2 and c 7a on average respectively the rsms were further normalized by their respective mean annual discharges i e 150 000 10 000 and 1 000 m3 s for each river to enable the comparison of the rsm across rivers with different scales the normalized rsms for the amazon and mekong were 4 3 and 12 respectively and the cpr s was 17 which is substantially higher than the other two large rivers fig 5f it is therefore concluded that the central plain reach of the cpr is an important sediment sink given its geographical scale it is interesting to note that this high rate of sediment storage in central plain largely happens through the canals while in the lower amazon floodplain channels are limited compared to overbank dispersion in transferring sediment to floodplain park and latrubesse 2017 park 2020 since the central plain stretches farther downstream from c 7a to the gulf of thailand 120 km the actual floodplain budget of the cpr in the lower basin is expected to be much larger in this study we did not use gauge station data downstream of c 7a due to the possible tidal influences when applied to the same rsm over this reach c 7a to mouth roughly 150 104 tons of extra loss of suspended sediment is calculated nevertheless based on crude extrapolation the annual floodplain sediment storage between c 2 and the cpr mouth could reach around 300x104 tons this value is comparable to the annual storage sum of the two mega dams upstream i e 302 104 in fact the significant role of the dams on sediment deficit in the cpr delta area has been analyzed by several studies e g saito et al 2007 winterwerp et al 2005 however the importance of floodplain storage on basin discharge to the gulf of thailand has yet to be recognized even though it poses a similar level of threat to the delta 5 summary and concluding remarks in this paper we provide a holistic view of hydro sedimentological regimes of the chao phraya river cpr basin the fifth largest basin in southeast asia our analysis is based on daily discharge of water since 1948 and sediment data since 2000 over 42 major stations across the basin all of them showed high seasonal variations in the sediment discharge with the maximum discharge occurring in october on an inter annual average in the case of the c 2 which has largest sediment flux in the cpr the peak flooding months september to november contribute almost 60 of the annual sediment load with the highest monthly qs of 79 104 tons in october 26 of the annual load at c 2 the peak qs in october is dramatically attenuated in c 7a 150 km downstream from c 2 mainly due to discharge diversion to irrigation canals distributaries and branches and seasonal flooding over the central plain sediment yield calculated at major stations varied spatially across the basin with a clear difference between eastern and western upper basins there is a decreasing pattern of sy in the downstream direction i e as drainage area increases the pca results indicated that quaternary surface erodibility index and average rainfall are closely associated with the watershed scale sy multiple regression model including other factors such as elevation and land cover yielded r2 of 0 87 with a p value 0 01 some stations in the upper basins watersheds showed very high sediment yields however the two mega dams bhumibol and sirikit each on ping and nan rivers trap 82 92 from the upstream sediment fluxes nevertheless since both dams are located upstream of the confluences with large tributaries in the upper basin wang and yom qs from those tributaries are still delivered to the lower basin without interference from the dams seasonal storage of sediment in the central plain in a reach between c 2 and c 7a was quantified to be 176x104 tons yr comprising almost 60 of qs at c 2 when this sedimentation magnitude is applied to the downstream reach a sediment budget of approximately 300 104 tons yr for the whole lower cpr basin was estimated although the significance of the dams on sediment deficit in the cpr delta area has been reported previously e g saito et al 2007 we recognize for the first time in this study the important role of floodplain storage on the basin s discharge of sediment to the gulf of thailand and therefore how it poses a similar level of threat to the delta in terms of sediment starvation this study contributes to the interests of scientific and non scientific communities in several aspects firstly this paper reveals the basin scale patterns of hydrology and sediment yields in the cpr based on analysis of a large volume of raw data from the thai government agencies secondly we identified the mega dams and the central plain as two comparably important inland sediment sinks in the cpr basin finally we hope that the spatial patterns of sediment source and deposition across different sub basins in cpr reported in this study will aid in improving the management strategies of the water and sediment resources in thailand since optical satellite images since the 1970 s are publicly available remote sensing can be used to estimate the ssc in the channel floodplain and reservoirs bernardo et al 2019 park and latrubesse 2014 and hence over the past 40 years qs can be reconstructed in the cpr this will enable further basin wide assessment of long term qs trends driven by human activities in the basin credit authorship contribution statement edward park conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding acquisition methodology project

4902,groundwater is essential for agricultural ecological and domestic water use and its depletion under climatic and anthropogenic impacts can impose challenges on regional water resources and ecological security particularly in arid regions spatiotemporal variation and drivers of groundwater are critical to understand groundwater cycling and restore groundwater while they are poorly understood in arid oasis region due to sparse field monitoring to address this we examined the spatiotemporal variations and controlling factors of groundwater level and mineralization degree using data collected at 22 wells in the wei ku oasis of tarim basin during 2000 2018 a typical arid inland river basin in northwest china results showed that obviously large spatial and temporal variations existed in both dgl depth to groundwater level and dm degree of mineralization groundwater level was the shallowest in spring and deepest in autumn dgl exhibited a markedly increasing trend 2 05 m per decade while dm marginally decreased 0 21 g l per decade p 0 001 during 2000 2018 the spatial distributions of dgl and dm were complex larger variation of dgl dm generally occurred at the areas with greater dgl dm dm in the northwestern part was obviously smaller than that in the southeastern part the variation of dgl in the eastern region was noticeably larger than that in the western region human activity was the main driving factor of dgl increasing climate change had a dominant role in dm decreasing and the relationship between controlling factors and groundwater varied in space and season decreasing riverbank leakage and increasing volume of evapotranspiration groundwater pumping and water drainage led to decreasing groundwater level while increasing infiltration leakage from irrigated water canal and reservoir resulted in increasing groundwater level the results could help to advance the understanding of groundwater cycling mechanism and be useful in improving sustainable groundwater management and restoring ecosystem in arid region keywords groundwater dynamics climate variability land use change agricultural irrigation dried up river oasis tarim basin 1 introduction groundwater is essential for agricultural ecological and domestic water use orellana et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 erler et al 2019 and is extremely important in arid regions due to low rainfall and insufficient surface water zhang et al 2014a wang et al 2019b chen et al 2019 jia et al 2020 including the quantity and quality of groundwater ma et al 2013 liu et al 2018b porhemmat et al 2018 zou et al 2019 owing to agricultural development urban land expansion increasing population and climate change the locations amounts and timing of groundwater discharge and recharge are being modified worldwide han et al 2017 manna et al 2019 riley et al 2019 which are also currently leading to an unforeseen consequence for groundwater quality tweed et al 2011 wang et al 2013 bekele et al 2019 riedel 2019 groundwater depletion caused primarily by a growing influence of human activities during the past decades can impose challenges on regional water resources and ecological security in arid

supplement in recent decades has influenced hydrological and ecological processes biogeochemical cycling and plant communities in arid regions of the world huang and pang 2010 zhang et al 2014b groundwater level fluctuation can reflect the state of connectivity between river and aquifer in semiarid and arid areas mccallum et al 2013 fuchs et al 2019 riley et al 2019 furthermore groundwater salinization is linked with the recharge discharge and migration processes of groundwater tweed et al 2011 liu et al 2018b and can impact public health soil fertility vegetation growth and renewable fresh groundwater resources manchanda and garg 2008 liu et al 2018b jia et al 2020 spatial distribution of groundwater salinity can reflect groundwater salinization process xie et al 2013 cary et al 2015 and thus in turn could provide insight into hydrogeochemical evolution as well as the interactions between local environment and groundwater in arid regions edmunds 2009 liu et al 2018b therefore it is critical to evaluate the dynamics and drivers of groundwater under climatic and anthropogenic impacts for effectively understanding modelling and managing groundwater systems and improving ecosystem in these arid regions han et al 2017 numerous studies have been carried out to analyze groundwater hydrological processes for reasonable groundwater management in arid areas via various techniques e g geostatistical analysis hu et al 2012 traditional field experiments wang et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 water chemistry huang and pang 2010 tracer experiments guo et al 2019 ma et al 2019a remote sensing inversion zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2019b and hydrologic modeling liu et al 2018a currently studies of groundwater dynamic are mainly based on two data sources including local in situ

water leakage little rainfall infiltration irrigation return flow lateral groundwater flow groundwater evapotranspiration and pumping in arid regions healy and cook 2002 abdalla 2008 wang et al 2014 guo et al 2019 liu et al 2018b the spatio temporal dynamic of groundwater salinity in arid inland river basin is influenced by several mechanisms including evaporation transpiration of deep rooted plants dilution mixing with saline water mineral dissolution and leaching and agricultural irrigation herczeg et al 2001 han et al 2011 tweed et al 2011 farid et al 2015 sun et al 2016 liu et al 2018b jia et al 2020 however although the importance of phreatic fluctuation as a mechanism that influences soil desertification and ecosystem restoration is well recognized groundwater level dynamic and its associated hydrological processes have not been studied extensively in arid areas wang et al 2014 changes in the groundwater level and quality could be caused by many factors including human activities and climate variability wang et al 2014 hu et al 2019 fu et al 2019 recently anthropogenic activities e g agricultural irrigation have exerted great pressure on natural hydrological cycle in arid regions liu et al 2018a and even have greater effects than climate change taylor et al 2013 previous studies investigated the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change on groundwater via building a geostatistical relationship based on historical observations or using a hydrological model fu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b generally groundwater level and quality in arid regions could be affected by topographic characteristics geology aquifer lithology climatic factors land use pattern vegetation soil texture agricultural activities etc wang et al 2014 2019b jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2018b 2018a porhemmat et al 2018 segura et al 2019 the combined effects of these control factors on groundwater are complicated bekele et al 2019 chen et al 2009 found that groundwater extraction could alter the recharge and discharge processes of groundwater and lead to increasing salinity in aquifer porhemmat et al 2018 reported that water saving irrigation systems reduced potential groundwater recharge agam et al 2012 and zhang et al 2014a found that groundwater table declined with increasing agricultural land in arid and semi arid regions however the controls of shallow groundwater level and quality have not been thoroughly examined in arid regions especially in the arid inland river basins the tarim river basin is the largest inland river basin and socioeconomically important region in china and is highly stressed in terms of water scarcity and the water use conflicts between eco environment and agriculture due to uncontrolled cultivated land expansion pang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2019 in the last 30 years the exploitation of water and land resources associated with population growth in the tarim basin has resulted in great changes in water regime and sharply increased water consumption zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2019a and the irrigated agriculture relied heavily on groundwater due to scarce surface water resources which induced groundwater overexploitation for irrigation zhang et al 2014b chen et al 2019 some studies e g chen et al 2019 bai et al 2020b and wang et al 2019a reported that groundwater level is decreasing in tarim basin due to the increased demands for water usage on the one hand and increase in evaporation on the other hand the current decline and extraction of groundwater are not sustainable i e human abstraction exceeds natural groundwater recharge chen et al 2019 anthropogenic impacts and climate variability are exerting pressure on the groundwater in tarim basin bai et al 2020b which has caused some serious hydrological and ecological issues in the middle and lower reaches such as dramatical groundwater level decline natural vegetation degradation especially the riparian ecosystem soil salinization and desertification and drying of rivers huang and pang 2010 bai et al 2020b chen et al 2019 therefore a thorough study of long term variations of groundwater level and quality affected by agricultural activities in the tarim basin is quite necessary to understand groundwater cycling and salt migration mechanism and also is the basis for sustainable groundwater management to meet ecosystem and human needs in such a water limited arid environment scanlon et al 2006 liu et al 2018a hu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b however the evolution characteristic of groundwater and its response to climate variability and enhanced anthropogenic activities were poorly understood in this region due to relatively few hydrological monitoring stations and limited field observation data chen et al 2019 this had resulted in uncertainties when simulating and predicting the regional hydrological and biogeochemical cycling and imposed challenges on the sustainable management of regional water resources and appropriate policy formulation in this arid inland river basin the wei ku oasis a typical dried up river oasis of the tarim basin in northwestern china was selected as the study area to explore the variations and drivers of groundwater the oasis has experienced intensive cultivated area expansion rapidly growing population and increasing extreme weather events in recent decades chen et al 2019 previous studies using multiple temporal scales to examine oasis groundwater dynamics revealed obvious inter annual variability of groundwater level zhang et al 2014b however the evolution characteristics of groundwater and their response to climate and land cover changes in the oasis were not well understood we analyzed the spatio temporal variations and determinants of groundwater over the wei ku oasis using long term situ groundwater monitoring data collected at 22 wells over the past 19 years 2000 2018 the main objectives of this study were 1 to assess climate variability and land cover change in the oasis 2 to examine the long term spatio temporal variations of groundwater level and quality on annual scale and seasonal scale and 3 to evaluate the influence of environmental drivers on groundwater level and quality over time i e air temperature precipitation streamflow actual evapotranspiration normalized difference vegetation index and cropland area the results would be expected to improve our understanding of groundwater cycling process in the oasis of dried up river basin in arid areas and provide theoretical foundation for sustainable groundwater resource management in the tarim basin 2 study area the tarim river basin 73 40 93 65 e and 34 80 43 35 n is the largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwest china fig 1 a the basin is flanked by the kunlun mountains to the south and tianshan mountains to the north with an area of 1 02 106 km2 fig 1b our study area wei ku oasis is located in the middle and lower reaches of the weigan kuqa river basin in northern tarim basin fig 1b and natural desert ecosystem and agricultural economic development are heavily dependent on groundwater in the oasis chen et al 2019 the weigan kuqa river basin which originated in the south of tianshan mountains is mainly composed of the weigan river and kuqa river and finally disappeared near the northern bank of tarim river the weigan river has five tributaries the muzati river kapusilang river televichuk river karasu river and kizil river fig 1b the annual streamflow is about 26 6 108 m3 for the weigan river and 4 6 108 m3 for the kuqa river and the flood season is from june to september accounting for 56 3 of the total the wei ku oasis 82 09 83 47 e and 40 90 41 85 n consists of kuqa shaya and xinhe counties and covers approximately 7104 km2 fig 1c the elevation declines from the north to the south and ranges from 945 to 1147 m above sea level this area is characterized by a typical temperate arid continental climate the mean annual air temperature is 11 4 and mean annual precipitation is 74 6 mm data from the chinese national meteorological centre and mean annual potential evaporation is about 2401 mm with a strong seasonal dynamic chen et al 2019 precipitation in this area has an uneven seasonal distribution and more than 76 of the overall precipitation occurs from may to september the annual surface runoff into the oasis is 31 2 108 m3 and more than 90 of the river water is diverted for irrigation zhang et al 2014b causing dried up natural river courses in recent decades groundwater level and quality data were collected from 22 groundwater observation wells on the wei ku oasis and the spatial distribution and geographic information of the 22 monitoring wells are shown in fig 1c and table 1 the depth to groundwater level in this oasis ranges from 2 to 6 m and the phreatic water evaporation is strong causing severe soil salinization based on the groundwater level contours fig 1d groundwater levels generally decline gradually from northwestern higher elevation to southeastern lower elevation indicating that the groundwater in the wei ku oasis flows from the north to the south and finally into the tarim river the wei ku oasis is covered by the quaternary sediments of various hydrogeologic units fig 1e including fine sandstone pebbly sandstone silty fine sandstone fine siltstone sandy gravel and sandstone the weigan and kuqa river transported large amount of eroded materials from the tianshan mountains into the plain and lead to the formation of alluvial fan the southeastern part of the wei ku oasis is alluvial sediment mainly covered by fine sandstone with a thickness of 40 60 m with shallow groundwater level and moderate water abundance fig 1e the northeastern part and northern margin of the oasis are proluvial sediments mainly covered by pebbly sandstone very strong water abundance and sandstone moderate water abundance with deep groundwater level the central part of the oasis is alluvial proluvial sediment the grain size of sediments is decreasing from pebbly sandstone to fine siltstone and correspondingly the water abundance of aquifer systems is decreasing from very strong water abundance to weak water abundance with shallow groundwater level fig 1e moreover in the vertical layers coarse material and fine material in the sediments were alternately deposited due to the runoff variations of the weigan river and kuqa river fig 1f the spatial heterogeneity of hydrogeologic conditions over the oasis impacts the occurrence reserve distribution and flow of subsurface water wang et al 2013 furthermore the wei ku oasis is dominated by agriculture and the main crops are cotton corn and winter wheat chen et al 2019 in the oasis the dominated natural plants are populus euphratica tamarix spp halostachys caspica phragmites communis alhagi pseudalhagi karelinia caspica glycyrrhiza and sophora alopecuroides zhao 2006 in 2018 the cropland grassland forest urban areas and bare areas accounted for 62 5 17 9 5 1 1 1 and 13 0 respectively of the total area of this oasis table 3 3 methodology 3 1 data in this study we concentrate on the time period from january 2000 to december 2018 data used in the study included hydrological observations streamflow groundwater level and mineralization degree meteorological data air temperature precipitation and actual evapotranspiration vegetation cover data ndvi and land use and land cover data lulc 3 1 1 hydrological data daily streamflow data of the two tributaries weigan river kuqa river in the upstream of the weigan kuqa river basin from 2000 to 2018 were obtained from the weigan river basin authority streamflow was measured daily by hydrological observational stations at the outlets of the mountainous sub basins in addition monthly groundwater level and quality data from 2000 to 2018 for the wei ku oasis were collected from the water salt monitoring station of the weigan river basin authority china groundwater was observed from dates throughout the year for each groundwater monitoring well fig 1c groundwater level was manually observed three times on the 5th 15th and 25th of each month and groundwater samples were collected once every season the water quality measurements of samples were undertaken at the water salt monitoring station of the weigan river basin authority and the analytical detection limit for ions was 0 1 mg l the basic information of the 22 groundwater monitoring wells on the oasis was shown in table 1 which observed only the water level and quality dynamics for shallow groundwater in this study the groundwater quality parameter of interest was mineralization degree which represented salts the groundwater level and mineralization degree data were interpolated into a 250 m resolution grid data using the inverse distance weighting idw method to keep the spatial resolution identical with other data 3 1 2 meteorological data monthly mean air temperature and monthly precipitation data were all obtained from the chinese national meteorological information center http cdc cma gov cn which provided china datasets of monthly precipitation and temperature from 1961 to present with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and a monthly temporal resolution this data was validated by error analysis and cross validation with gauge based observations indicating good quality the above temperature and precipitation grid data in the wei ku oasis from 2000 to 2018 were used in this study the amount of actual evapotranspiration aet strongly depends on vegetation covers climatic variables and climate forcing factors e g greenhouse gases ozone co2 liu et al 2016 long term climate variability lulc change and related management strategies are expected to have an influence on regional aet thus affecting groundwater recharge and discharge berihun et al 2019 therefore evaluating long term effects of aet on groundwater is extremely important in this study monthly aet data in the wei ku oasis during 2000 to 2018 were sourced from the gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model http www gleam eu v3 3a dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a monthly temporal resolution which has been verified to agree well with land surface flux observation results in china particularly in arid northwestern china both for the areas with without vegetation ma et al 2019b wu et al 2020 the datasets are based on reanalysis radiation and air temperature reanalysis and satellite based precipitation a combination of gauge based and satellite based vegetation optical depth which have higher temporal and spatial resolutions and match better with data requirements in large scale research compared with other aet data products wu et al 2020 monthly aet data was accumulated into the seasonal aet and annual aet from 2000 to 2018 in order to maintain consistency with other data used in this study all the temperature precipitation and aet data were resampled into a spatial resolution of 250 m using the bilinear interpolation method by arcgis 10 5 software 3 1 3 vegetation data ndvi normalized difference vegetation index was used in this study to describe vegetation cover due to its good correlation with vegetation cover an et al 2015 ndvi data for the study area from 2000 to 2018 were derived from the modis ndvi product mod13q1 provided by nasa national aeronautics and space administration http ladsweb nascom nasa gov data search html with a spatial resolution of 250 m and a 16 day temporal resolution orbital number h24v04 this dataset has been widely used in ecohydrological studies in semi arid and arid regions of northern china due to its finer resolution and high reliability

which represents the growth of vegetation in the month or year then the seasonal ndvi was determined by averaging the monthly ndvi for the three months in each season which represents the growth of vegetation in the season 3 1 4 land use data the annual lulc land use and land cover data used in this study were derived from the esa cci lc products 300 m resolution 2000 to 2015 http maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer and the c3s global land cover products 300 m resolution 2016 to 2018 http cds climate copernicus eu which is a spatial data layer of land use types denoted in grid the esa cci lc products were released by the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci which was an annual global land cover time series from 1992 to 2015 with a 300 m resolution this dataset has fine classification long time series and high spatial resolution and is suitable for the large scale and long term land cover change study which was found to have good applicability in china yang et al 2017 further the c3s global land cover products for the years 2016 2018 were released by the copernicus climate change service c3s in 2019 and described the land surface into 22 classes united nations land cover classification system lccs which were consistent with the esa cci lc products to ensure continuity then the 22 lccs land use classes were grouped into 6 ipcc land categories for ear year including cropland forest grassland urban areas bare areas and water bodies finally the lulc type maps for the years 2000 2018 were produced for further analysis 3 2 statistical analyses data statistical analyses were performed using the arcgis version 10 5 ibm spss software package version 22 0 and matlab version r2018a and the statistical significance level was 5 or 1 the sen s slope method was used to evaluate the variation trends and amplitudes of groundwater hydrometeorological and vegetation variables the inverse distance weighting idw method was used to interpolate the borehole observations of groundwater level and mineralization degree into a 250 m resolution grid data pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlations between groundwater and forcing factors multiple linear stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the key controlling factors of the groundwater level and mineralization degree spatial multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the dominant factors of groundwater level and mineralization degree for each pixel percentage variation of individual lulc types was evaluated to describe the extent of lulc variation between two time points using eq 1 long et al 2009 1 p e r c e n t v a r i a t i o n a 2 a 1 a 1 100 where a 1 and a 2 are the area of a given lulc type in year 1 and year 2 respectively the spatial and temporal variations of hydroclimatic and vegetation variables were evaluated using zonal statistics and the sen s slope method sen 1968 which has been widely applied to analyze variation of long term hydrometeorological time series berihun et al 2019 the sen s slope method can evaluate the variation trend and amplitude of time series data based on the median of the

sen s slope x i and x j are the sequential values corresponding to times i and j respectively where 1 i j n n is the length of the time series when sen greater than 0 the time series show an increasing trend vice versa pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between environmental factors and oasis groundwater level and mineralization degree for two elements and y if their sample values are x i and y i i 1 2 n the correlation coefficient between them is defined as eq 3 3 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r xy is the correlation coefficient between and y x is the average value of the sample values for x y is the average value of the sample values for y the key controlling factors of oasis groundwater level and mineralization

reasonable regression fittings akaike information criterion aic values were calculated step by step under various parameter settings to evaluate the reliability of model capacity and parameter selection wu et al 2020 during the process of stepwise regression analysis this study used the whole time series data 2000 2018 for exploring the driven module eqs 4 and 5 and the raw data was standardized firstly 4 d g l b i x i ε 5 d m b i x i ε where dgl and dm are the depth to groundwater level and mineralization degree respectively b i is the regression coefficient x i is the key

standardized partial regression coefficient b i is the partial regression coefficient σ x i is the standard deviation of independent variables climatic hydrological and vegetation variables σ y is the standard deviation of dependent variables dgl and dm inverse distance weighting idw method was used to generate a continuous surface of groundwater level and quality based on the borehole observations data which is one of the most important interpolation methods recognized in geostatistical analysis nistor et al 2020 the idw is based on the first law of geography and assumes the proportionality of similarity and correlation between neighbors and the distance between them the cell values are evaluated by linear weighted combination of sample point dataset and the weighting is a function of inverse distance that is the weighting of farther known points is less than that for nearer known points the accuracy of the idw is influenced by the power parameter p a lower p value has more effect on the surrounding region of the farther points while a higher p value can define a detailed surface on the nearest points the formulas for the idw are given as eqs 7 9 nistor et al 2020 7 z i 1 n w i

cover an overview of the temporal analysis was shown in fig 2 presenting annual and monthly averages of air temperature precipitation and streamflow in the oasis from 2000 to 2018 the annual mean air temperature had a decreasing trend with a mean rate of about 0 12 10a over the period from 2000 to 2018 while annual precipitation and streamflow exhibited an increasing trend with a mean rate of about 12 mm 10a and 0 30 108 m3 10a during this period respectively fig 2 and table 2 in addition the variation trends of hydrometeorological factors air temperature precipitation and streamflow differed between the four seasons table 2 air temperature significantly decreased in summer 0 33 10a and autumn 0 57 10a from 2000 to 2018 while increased in spring 0 20 10a precipitation increased in summer 10 31 mm 10a and autumn 3 27 mm 10a while decreased in spring 0 86 mm 10a and winter 1 00 mm 10a streamflow increased in spring 0 11 108 m3 10a and summer 1 04 108 m3 10a while decreased in autumn 0 47 108 m3 10a and winter 0 53 108 m3 10a due to the regulation of mountain reservoirs chen et al 2019 furthermore there were diverse intra annual variation characteristics for the three hydrometeorological factors in the oasis during 2000 to 2018 fig 2g h and i as shown in fig 2i the monthly streamflow of the weigan kuqa river showed some large fluctuations the highest value appeared in july 6 19 108 m3 and the lowest value occurred in january 0 5 108 m3 the intra annual distribution of streamflow showed three peaks occurred in march july and november respectively due to reservoir regulation the peak air temperature occurred in july 25 4 and the lowest value occurred in january 8 1 fig 2g the maximum value of monthly precipitation occurred in june 15 2 mm and the minimum value occurred in march 0 8 mm fig 2h the spatial distributions of lulc for 2000 2010 and 2018 were prepared for the wei ku oasis fig 3 a b and c as shown in fig 3 cropland was mainly distributed in the west and northeast of the oasis grassland mainly in the middle and southeast forest mainly on the edge of the cropland mainly as artificial forest and bare land mainly on the edge of the oasis i e the transition zone between oasis and desert fig 3a b and c in general during the entire study period the area of cropland forest and urban land gradually increased while the area of grassland bare land and water bodies gradually decreased as time goes on cropland forest and urban areas continuously increased to 62 5 5 1 and 1 1 respectively in 2018 table 3 conversely grassland bare areas and water bodies continuously decreased to 17 9 13 0 and 0 4 respectively in 2018 table 3 furthermore the dominant lulc type was cropland over the entire period covering more than half of the oasis area 55 9 60 6 and 62 5 in 2000 2010 and 2018 respectively resulting in high water demand grassland was second in dominance 20 3 18 9 and 17 9 in 2000 2010 and 2018 respectively followed by bare areas 20 2 15 2 and 13 0 in 2000 2010 and 2018 respectively fig 3 and table 3 compared to other lulc types urban areas accounted for the least coverage 0 3 in 2000 but showed a dramatic increase during 2000 to 2018 the highest percentage change was observed in urban areas which increased by 137 0 between 2000 and 2010 and by 68 1 between 2010 and 2018 table 3 on the other hand bare areas decreased markedly between 2000 and 2018 by 35 4 and grassland underwent a general decrease by 11 9 between 2000 and 2018 mainly due to farmland expansion in the study area in contrast cropland exhibited a persistent increase by 8 4 from 2000 to 2010 and by 11 9 from 2000 to 2018 table 3 indicating that a considerable area of bare land and grassland was converted into cropland and urban land in the oasis throughout the entire study period zhang et al 2014b however the expansion of farmland had obviously slowed by 2018 in the wei ku oasis table 3 forest area also underwent a conspicuous increase by 72 1 from 2000 to 2018 in the oasis including natural forest and artificial forest artificial ecological forest and economic forest water bodies had remained unchanged from 2000 to 2010 but underwent a general decrease by 8 3 between 2010 and 2018 annual mean ndvi in the oasis exhibited a significant increasing trend at the 0 1 significance level with a mean rate of about 0 10 per decade over the period from 2000 to 2018 fig 2d and table 2 for the oasis ndvi showed increasing trend for all seasons at least at the 1 significance level table 2 the rate of ndvi increase was the largest in summer 0 10 10a followed by autumn 0 06 10a and the smallest in spring and winter 0 03 10a as shown in fig 2j ndvi in the study area displayed a noticeable seasonal distribution the maximum value of monthly ndvi appeared in august 0 42 the minimum value occurred in february 0 10 and the values from december to march were very close 0 15 in addition fig 3 used colour gradients to exhibit details in the spatial distribution of ndvi over the oasis for 2000 2010 and 2018 fig 3d e and f the figures exhibited a decreasing gradient for ndvi from north west to the south east for almost all years and the sparsely vegetated area was mainly located on the edge of the oasis and in certain localized areas of the central oasis mainly as bare land vegetation cover in the northwestern and central parts changed more obviously than that in the southeastern part furthermore fig 4 presented the spatiotemporal variation of ndvi across the oasis for annual average and four seasons during 2000 to 2018 fig 4k l m n and o overall ndvi increased significantly in most parts of the entire oasis p 0 05 while decreased noticeably in sporadic areas of the northeastern and southeastern parts fig 4k for most of the study area there was significant spatiotemporal variation in the ndvi in all seasons p 0 05 fig 4l m n and o in summer the lulc type with the largest increase of ndvi was mainly cultivated land with a rate of 0 25 0 55 10a fig 4m in spring and winter the lulc types with the significant changes of ndvi were mainly cultivated land and bare land with a rate of 0 05 0 10 10a fig 4l and o in autumn the variation of ndvi in the southeastern part was significantly smaller than that in other regions fig 4n 4 2 spatio temporal variations of groundwater the distributions of dgl and dm across the wei ku oasis for annual average spring summer autumn and winter during 2000 to 2018 were shown in fig 5 both dgl and dm showed significant spatial variability in the oasis and the spatial distribution pattern of dgl and dm varied among the four seasons dgl ranged from 0 4 to 9 6 m the maximum value was observed at well w8 in the summer of 2017 and the minimum value was observed at well w21 in the spring of 2009 maybe due to underlying surface conditions hydrometeorological conditions and human activities wang et al 2014 the dm for the four seasons spanned a relatively wide range from 0 4 to 16 0 g l during 2000 to 2018 the maximum and minimum dm were observed at well w22 in the autumn of 2017 and w1 in the winter of 2002 respectively the normal operation of the paman reservoir caused a visible decrease in dgl near well w21 which was 0 3 1 2 m smaller than the dgl of ambient wells w20 and w22 in all seasons across most of the oasis the dgl was greater than 3 0 m however there were many areas where it was between 3 5 and 5 0 m fig 4a in general in the east central region of the oasis there were several sizable areas where the dgl exceeded 5 0 m and reached a maximum depth of about 6 5 m in some locations while in the southwest there was a sizable area where the dgl was below 3 0 m and reached a minimum depth of about 1 5 m in some locations due to reservoir influence overall there appeared to be a pattern by which the regions with the deepest groundwater level also experienced the largest seasonal variations in the dgl fig 5a b c d and e for the oasis dgl was the smallest in spring followed by winter and the largest in summer and autumn fig 5b c d and e moreover across most of the oasis the dm was less than 4 g l and was relatively lower in the northwestern and central parts of the oasis below 2 g l fig 5k lowest concentrations of dm were in the northwestern part of the oasis 0 4 g l and the highest concentrations were in the southeastern part up to 13 g l fig 5k during all seasons the dm in spring was significantly lower than that in the other seasons for the northwestern and central parts while the differences of dm between the four seasons were not significant for the other regions of our study area fig 5l m n and o the trend statistics of groundwater level and quality were shown in fig 2 the dgl in the wei ku oasis showed a significant continuously increasing trend of about 4 1 m on average across the oasis from 2000 to 2018 fig 2e while the dm showed a noticeable decreasing trend of about 0 42 g l on average during the same period fig 2f however variations of dgl and dm were not significant after 2015 in the seasonal analysis 22 wells showed a downward trend for groundwater level and quality in all seasons and the decreasing trends between the four seasons were close in fig 2 it was clear that the degree of mineralization and groundwater level showed the most significant decrease in the spring months april and may decreasing by about 0 82 g l and 4 3 m respectively while the decrease was the least in the autumn months october and november furthermore the mean annual dgl varied from 2 4 to 5 7 m with mean value of 4 0 m and dm varied from 3 1 to 3 9 g l with mean value of 3 3 g l during 2000 2018 period fig 2e and f moreover the intra annual distributions of the dgl and dm averaged over the entire oasis were shown in fig 2k and l the dgl developed a pronounced seasonal cycle in the oasis while the dm exhibited a noticeably weaker season cycle in general the intra annual distribution of dgl showed two peaks the first peak appeared in april and the other in december fig 2k the groundwater level remained too shallow in spring 3 6 m in april while too deep in autumn 4 2 m in october the dm in groundwater was lower in winter 3 2 g l than that in the other seasons but the difference of dm was not significant between seasons fig 2l values of dgl and dm in our study area significantly varied in space and time fig 3 it was evident that the dgl across this oasis was greater in 2018 fig 3i than that in 2010 fig 3h or 2000 fig 3g in contrast the dm of groundwater was lower in 2018 fig 3l than that in 2010 fig 3k or 2000 fig 3j overall from 2000 to 2018 there appeared to be a pattern by which the areas with the smallest dgl experienced the smallest increase in the dgl and vice versa fig 3g h and i while the areas with the highest dm had the largest decrease in the dm and vice versa fig 3j k and l during the study period 2000 2018 the dgl increased significantly in most areas of the oasis increased by about 4 1 m or more and the increase in the southwest was significantly smaller than that in other regions in 2000 the spatial difference of dgl was not obvious and the dgl was relatively small across the entire oasis about below 3 0 m except for a sizable area in the northwest fig 3g in 2010 dgl presented significant spatial differences and the lower value mainly occurred in the southwest part the higher value in the east and central parts fig 3h furthermore the southwestern part had consistently higher dm compared to other parts in the oasis during the entire period fig 3j k and l overall dm displayed obvious spatial variability for 2000 2010 and 2018 and decreased significantly in most parts of the entire oasis in 2000 the spatial differenceof dm was significant the minimum value of dm was in the northwest and central parts of the oasis while the maximum value in the southwest fig 3j likewise in 2010 the maximum value of dm was in the southwest and northeast the lower value in the northwest and central areas fig 3k the spatiotemporal variations of dgl and dm across the oasis for annual average and four seasons from 2000 to 2018 were shown in fig 4 and table 2 during the period from 2000 to 2018 the average rate of dgl variation sen s slope estimator in the whole oasis was about 2 05 m per decade p 0 001 with the greatest rate in spring 2 15 m 10a and the smallest in autumn 1 94 m 10a table 2 sen s slope tested variation showed a noticeable increase in the dgl across the entire oasis at the 5 significance level with changes of more than 3 m 10a in areas where the groundwater level was deep greater than 5 m while small increase 1 m 10a where the dgl was shallow fig 4a b c d and e that is the regions that are the most sensitive and experience the largest changes were the regions where the dgl was already relatively great and vice versa figs 4 and 5 overall the variation of dgl in the eastern region of our study area was significantly larger than that in the western region fig 4a for the seasonal analysis of groundwater level 22 wells showed a downward trend in all seasons at the 5 significance level the increase of dgl was noticeably greater in spring and winter than that in summer and autumn for the west part w9 w17 and w18 was the greatest in spring and smallest in winter for the east part w14 and w15 and was the largest in spring and smallest in summer and autumn for the northeastern part w6 fig 4b c d and e furthermore the variation of dm across the study area during 2000 to 2018 presented great spatial heterogeneity with no clear pattern emerging maybe due to the impact of irrigation and drainage network fig 4f g h i and j as shown in table 2 over the entire study period the mean decreasing rate of dm sen s slope estimator in the whole oasis was about 0 21 g l per decade at the 0 1 significance level with the greatest in spring 0 41 g l per decade and the smallest in autumn 0 17 g l per decade in summer and winter the mean decreasing rate of 22 wells was 0 28 g l and 0 22 g l per decade respectively overall the rate of dm change at the northwest and southwest parts was positive increasing trend in four seasons whereas it in the western and eastern parts was negative decreasing trend in four seasons while the decreasing trend was not significant in the remaining sporadic areas during the study period fig 4f it was evident that the area with significant dm changes was noticeably larger in spring than that in the other seasons fig 4g h i and j in the analysis on seasonal scale the decrease of dm was noticeably greater in spring than that in other season for the western part of our study area w9 w10 and w17 while was greater in spring and autumn than that in summer and winter for the south part w22 likewise the increase of dm was significantly smaller in spring than that in other seasons for the southwest and northwest parts w3 w8 and w18 while the decrease of dm was obviously smaller in winter than that in other seasons for the northeast part w6 the relationship between groundwater level and mineralization degree over the study period was prepared for the wei ku oasis fig 5f g h i and j as shown in fig 5 a negative correlation p 0 01 between dgl and dm was observed across the oasis for annual average fig 5f and four seasons fig 5g h i and j that is the regions with a higher average groundwater level showed a noticeably greater dm and vice versa on the annual scale the fitting equation between dgl and dm across the entire oasis was described as dm 1 448 6 066 dgl 1 n 418 r 2 0 081 p 0 01 fig 5f however this relationship during the study period was generally weak in the study area mainly due to the influence of strong evaporation and drainage channels zhang et al 2014b furthermore in the analysis on seasonal scale the correlation coefficient between dgl and dm also varied among the four seasons and was greater in spring than that in the other seasons fig 5g h i and j 4 3 correlations between groundwater and climate and land cover change pearson s correlation analysis results showed that the environmental factors had greater effects on dgl than dm and the effects exhibited significant seasonal heterogeneity in the study area during 2000 to 2018 table 4 dgl was significantly positively correlated with precipitation actual evapotranspiration and cropland area while significantly negatively related to streamflow similarly dm had a significant positive relation with air temperature while showed significant negative correlations with precipitation and actual evapotranspiration dm in all seasons had no statistical correlation with streamflow and cropland area overall compared with climate drivers anthropogenic activities had greater impacts on the decline of groundwater level during the study period table 4 among hydrometeorological factors the important factor was actual evapotranspiration r 0 374 p 0 001 n 418 for dgl and air temperature r 0 147 p 0 01 n 418 for dm among anthropogenic activity factors cropland area r 0 602 p 0 001 n 418 was important factor for dgl furthermore cropland area in all seasons was significantly correlated with dgl but had no significant relationship with dm table 4 streamflow was significantly correlated with dgl in autumn and winter but had no significant relationship with dm in all seasons ndvi was significantly correlated with dgl in summer and winter while had significant relationship with dm in spring and winter actual evapotranspiration was significantly correlated with dgl in all seasons except winter but was significantly correlated with dm in spring and summer precipitation showed a significant relationship with dgl in summer and winter whereas was significantly correlated with dm in all seasons except winter air temperature showed a significant relationship with dgl in summer and autumn while was significantly correlated with dm in all seasons furthermore the stepwise linear regression analysis was used to identify the major controlling factors for the decreasing groundwater level and mineralization degree and their seasonal differences in the wei ku oasis table 5 the stepwise linear regression models for the annual mean dgl and dm across the whole oasis were expressed as d g l a n n u a l 21 12 0 54 c r o p l a n d 0 14 a e t r2 0 38 p 0 001 n 418 and d m a n n u a l 1 54 0 15 t e m p e r a t u r e r2 0 02 p 0 005 n 418 the cropland area and actual evapotranspiration were the main controlling factors affecting groundwater level among the climate and anthropogenic drivers which both had positive effects nevertheless air temperature was the major factor of the mineralization degree of groundwater which had a positive effect in addition cropland area and actual evapotranspiration explained important proportions of the dgl in spring and summer while cropland area played an important role in the dgl in autumn and winter table 5 the correlations between groundwater and environmental variables confirmed that anthropogenic activities had strong influences on the groundwater level in our study area table 4 and 5 dgl depth to groundwater level dm degree of mineralization cropland area of cropland aet actual evapotranspiration t air temperature n number of samples moreover the dominant factor influencing groundwater level and mineralization degree also differed spatially in the wei ku oasis during the study period fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the dominant factor affecting groundwater level variation was ndvi or actual evapotranspiration for most areas of the oasis while was precipitation or air temperature for very small areas fig 6a in contrast the spatial difference of the dominant factor of mineralization degree change was more significant the dominant factor of dm change was precipitation or actual evapotranspiration or ndvi for most regions of the oasis while was air temperature for some sporadic small areas fig 6b generally for the regions with the largest increase in ndvi cropland forest and bare areas ndvi was the dominant factor causing dgl change fig 4k and fig 6a probably due to artificial oasis expansion leading to more water consumption for the areas with insignificant variation in ndvi bare land in the west and southeast parts cultivated land near the river channel actual evapotranspiration was the dominant factor of dgl change fig 1b fig 3a 3c fig 4k and fig 6a precipitation was the dominant factor of dgl variation for the grassland in southeast part fig 3a 3c fig 6a for the areas with the largest decrease in ndvi urban land in the northern part air temperature was the dominant factor of dgl change fig 3a 3c fig 4k fig 6a furthermore for the areas with very small dm mainly in the northwestern part ndvi was the dominant factor of dm change maybe due to the impact of drainage channels fig 1 fig 3l and fig 6b for the regions with the largest increase in ndvi cropland bare land and forest in the northwest actual evapotranspiration was the dominant factor of dm fig 3c fig 4k and fig 6b precipitation was the dominant factor of dm for the areas with insignificant variation of ndvi grassland and bare land in the southeast fig 3c fig 4k and 4o while air temperature was the dominant factor of dm for some sporadic areas in the northwest part urban areas and some grassland 5 discussion 5 1 variation characteristics of groundwater the average annual dgl in the present study across the whole oasis varied from 2 4 to 5 7 m with mean value of 4 0 m and dm varied from 3 1 to 3 9 g l with mean value of 3 3 g l during 2000 to 2018 these data were consistent with the results by zhang et al zhang et al 2014b for the wei ku oasis however the dgl values in the present study were higher than those in the lower reaches of the tarim river in recent years sun et al 2020 this could be explained by the rapid farmland expansion in the oasis and the continuous ecological water conveyance in the lower reaches of tarim river chen et al 2019 the rapid expansion of cultivated area across the oasis in recent decades has led to a continuous decline of the groundwater level since the sharp increase of regional water consumption could cause groundwater overexploitation chen et al 2019 in contrast since 2000 the continuous ecological water conveyance to the lower reaches of tarim river has increased the recharge from the river channel to groundwater which in turn has caused a substantial increase of groundwater level in the downstream chen et al 2019 groundwater level and mineralization degree significantly decreased with time fig 2e and f our results exhibited that the annual dgl had a significant increasing trend about 2 05 m per decade table 2 across the whole oasis from 2000 to 2018 while the annual dm showed a decreasing trend about 0 21 g l per decade table 2 several studies in the tarim basin reported similar groundwater depletion chen et al 2019 this was consistent with the observations in the oases of the hexi corridor in china feng et al 2004 chen 2010 huang and pang 2010 and other arid regions around the world scanlon et al 2006 joodaki et al 2014 asoka et al 2017 hu et al 2019 reported that groundwater table declined with a rate of 13 mm month in the western australia during 1980 to 2015 and ma et al 2005 2013 discovered groundwater level decreased by 35 m in the minqin oasis and by 10 m in the dunhuang oasis in northwest china in the past decades the falling of groundwater level in the study area could be explained by five aspects first climate change plays an important role in groundwater dynamics beal et al 2019 wittenberg et al 2019 elevated air temperature could enhance the duration and intensity of evaporation which in turn lead to lower groundwater level due to the increased evaporation of soil water and groundwater wang et al 2019b while elevated air temperature also could increase the melting water of glacier and snow in mountains by enhancing melting period hori et al 2017 and thus results in higher groundwater level due to the supply from meltwater and river water chao et al 2020 the amount and spatio temporal distribution of precipitation would determine the quantity and distribution of regional water resources by affecting runoff formation process which in turn lead to groundwater level fluctuation owing to variations of groundwater recharge zhang et al 2014b eamus et al 2015 second lulc changes greatly impact groundwater dynamics in arid regions due to the great differences in evapotranspiration and water consumption of different vegetation bai et al 2020a and cultivated area expansion could lead to a dramatic increase in irrigation water from river water and groundwater thus causing groundwater level decline due to reduced river infiltration and groundwater overexploitation chen et al 2019 third agricultural irrigation activities in arid regions could greatly impact groundwater level and quality by affecting groundwater cycle process wang et al 2014 field irrigation usually enhances the recharge from infiltrating irrigation water to groundwater increased channel water utilization coefficient could reduce channel water leakage and gradually improved drainage systems could reduce the groundwater level porhemmat et al 2018 fourth groundwater overexploitation could lead to the falling of groundwater level and the depletion of groundwater storage mainly due to the direct pumping of shallow and deep groundwater to meet regional water demand in arid regions asoka et al 2017 wang et al 2019b fifth soaring population could greatly enhance domestic water consumption and thus results in the continuous falling of groundwater level due to limited surface water resources and increased groundwater exploitation in the arid oasis area scanlon et al 2006 groundwater level and mineralization degree exhibited significant seasonal differences in the arid oasis figs 2 and 5 these were consistent with the results by bai et al bai et al 2020b for the upper tarim river and wang et al 2014 for the lower heihe river in northwestern china these were reasonable due to the seasonal deviations in climatic and anthropogenic factors in fact great differences of driving factors exist among the seasons such as climatic conditions temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow hydrological connectivity vegetation coverage soil water content groundwater extraction and agricultural irrigation activities irrigation methods irrigation water requirement agricultural drainage fig 2 taylor et al 2013 porhemmat et al 2018 furthermore groundwater level was the shallowest in spring and exhibited the most significant decrease in spring fig 2k and table 2 this might be contributed to less evapotranspiration due to lower air temperature more recharge from snowmelt runoff and infiltration recharge due to spring flood irrigation from pumping deep groundwater zhang et al 2014b wang et al 2014 hu et al 2019 in contrast groundwater level was the deepest in summer and autumn and presented the least decrease in autumn fig 2k and table 2 probably due to strong evapotranspiration agricultural drainage groundwater extraction increased crop water requirements during the growing season decreased irrigation water seepage by water saving irrigation and reduced recharge from river water resulting from surface water transfer for irrigation han et al 2011 porhemmat et al 2018 additionally the mineralization degree of groundwater in our study area was the highest in autumn and lowest in winter fig 2l these could be related to the different influence of evaporation and transpiration dilution mineral dissolution and leaching and agricultural irrigation among the seasons han et al 2011 liu et al 2018b jia et al 2020 transpiration of deep rooted plants and evaporation of soil moisture and shallow groundwater could affect groundwater quality by redistributing moisture and salinity within the soil profile herczeg et al 2001 tweed et al 2011 liu et al 2018b the dilution caused by precipitation river water and irrigation water could reduce groundwater ion concentration due to lower salinity of precipitation and streamflow compared to shallow groundwater tweed et al 2011 wang et al 2013 jia et al 2020 soil mineral dissolution and leaching could increase the salts in groundwater since the downward migration of soil water could also cause the downward migration of salinity dissolved in soil moisture into groundwater su et al 2009 tweed et al 2011 farid et al 2015 liu et al 2018b liu et al 2018b reported that saline soil in unsaturated zone and evaporites in fine grained sediment were widely distributed in the arid regions and subsurface water could efficiently dissolve evaporates during vertical migration processes agricultural irrigation activities greatly impact groundwater hydrochemistry in arid regions since agricultural drainage systems could reduce groundwater salinity by lowering groundwater level discharging of subsurface water with high salinity and decreasing subsurface water evaporation and the quality of irrigation water also could affect groundwater salinity han et al 2011 liu et al 2018a however the difference of dm was not significant between seasons in the oasis fig 2l and fig 5 this may be attributed to the complex coupled effects of climate and human activities on groundwater quality zhang et al 2014b and might imply that anthropogenic activities play a great role in groundwater quality in the arid oasis area liu et al 2018b the spatial distributions and variations of groundwater level and mineralization degree both exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity and a spatial trend was not obvious figs 4 and 5 these could be related to the great spatial heterogeneity of environmental conditions and anthropogenic activities among the monitoring wells such as topography climatic conditions hydrogeological condition soil properties lulc types vegetation agricultural irrigation and drainage activities and groundwater exploitation fig 1 and fig 3 table 1 zhang et al 2014b the random spatial trend of dgl and dm revealed the complex interaction between groundwater and environmental factors and suggested that the effects of climatic and topographic conditions on groundwater level and quality were not significant in the tarim basin zhang et al 2014b chen et al 2019 furthermore the regions with a higher groundwater level exhibited a higher mineralization degree fig 5 probably due to greater salt accumulation caused by greater evaporative enrichment at the areas with higher water level liu et al 2018b in addition larger variation of dgl during the study period was found at the areas with greater dgl figs 4 and 5 probably due to more stable recharge sources for the regions with smaller dgl smaller dgl were generally found near river courses or cultivated land which was mainly recharged by infiltrating water from river water or irrigation water from river water transfer or pumping deep groundwater leading to smaller variation of shallow groundwater level han et al 2011 moreover the variation of groundwater level in the eastern region was significantly larger than that in the western region fig 4a probably due to weaker anthropogenic interference in the eastern part wang et al 2014 compared to the western part the land use types in the east was dominated by grassland and bare land fig 3 a and thus shallow groundwater recharge was more unstable due to less infiltration water from almost dried up river channels and little agricultural irrigation leading to greater interannual fluctuation of groundwater level due to the effects of climate change zhang et al 2014b furthermore the lowest values of dm were found in the northwestern part while the highest values were found in the southeastern part fig 5k these could be related to the different recharge mechanisms hydrogeochemical evolution hydrogeological conditions hydraulic gradient drainage conditions evaporation effect field irrigation and drainage network and groundwater level ma et al 2013 porhemmat et al 2018 compared to the southeastern part the higher terrain in the northwest could lead to better drainage conditions due to greater hydraulic gradient and improved agricultural drainage systems fig 1 thus making less salt accumulate in shallow groundwater due to lower water level less evaporation and more salt excretion by drainage channel zhang et al 2014b 5 2 effects of climate and land cover changes on groundwater climatic factors interact to affect groundwater level and quality table 4 and fig 6 our results showed that dgl was significantly positively correlated to precipitation and actual evapotranspiration while negatively related to air temperature table 4 dm was significantly positively related to air temperature while significantly negatively related to precipitation table 4 higher air temperature could decrease groundwater level by increasing evapotranspiration berihun et al 2019 fu et al 2019 but could also stimulate glacier and snow melting and thus lead to higher groundwater level due to greater supply from meltwater ma et al 2005 segura et al 2019 lin et al 2020 furthermore increased precipitation during the wet season could promote vegetation growth by enhancing soil moisture content riley et al 2019 and thus lead to lower groundwater level owing to the absorption of soil water and groundwater by deep rooted vegetation wang et al 2014 liu et al 2018b this effect is limited in the arid oasis area due to scarce precipitation intensive evaporation and high groundwater depths table 1 ma et al 2013 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a liu et al 2018b groundwater variations in arid oasis region mainly depend on surface water infiltration river water and irrigation water and lateral groundwater flow rather than rainfall wang et al 2013 guo et al 2019 and high evaporation rate makes it hard for precipitation to become groundwater in arid area hu et al 2019 in addition actual evapotranspiration was one of the major controlling factors for groundwater level table 5 elevated actual evapotranspiration could lead to more water dissipation from river soil water and shallow groundwater due to increased temperature berihun et al 2019 folton et al 2019 and thus decrease groundwater level due to less recharge ma et al 2013 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2018b fu et al 2019 moreover air temperature was the dominant factor of groundwater mineralization degree table 5 elevated temperature could increase salt evaporative enrichment during evaporation process which in turn result in more salt accumulation in soil profile chen et al 2018 rose et al 2005 leading to higher mineralization degree for the shallow groundwater due to the downward migration of salt dissolved in soil moisture into aquifer tweed et al 2011 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2018b furthermore temperature is one of the controlling factors for the rate of mineral dissolution and leaching which exhibited a positive correlation welch and ullman 2000 and thus higher temperature can lead to large salt leaching from soil into soil water and moving downward into aquifers resulting in higher groundwater salinity kindler et al 2011 riedel 2019 additionally elevated rainwater could dilute the salt concentration in soil water and shallow groundwater during the wet season due to greater recharge from precipitation infiltration which has lower salinity compared to subsurface water huang et al 2017 jia et al 2020 moreover actual evapotranspiration was not significantly related to groundwater mineralization degree table 4 indicating that other factors might exert strong influences on shallow groundwater salts e g agricultural activities liu et al 2018b streamflow had great effects on groundwater table 4 streamflow was significantly negatively related to dgl while positively correlated with dm table 4 greater streamflow could increase groundwater level by enhancing groundwater recharge from river water wang et al 2014 gu et al 2016a guo et al 2019 for example zhang et al zhang et al 2014b reported that the upward trend of groundwater level in 2002 and 2003 for the wei ku oasis was mainly caused by the catastrophic flood on july 22 to 23 2002 moreover the relationship between dgl and streamflow was significant in autumn and winter while not significant in spring and summer table 4 one possible explanation was that the reservoirs in the tarim basin can regulate the annual distribution of surface water chen et al 2019 and there is a lag between groundwater level fluctuation and river water infiltration during the flood period wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014b erler et al 2019 greater streamflow during flood period with 61 occurring from may to september fig 2i could increase groundwater level due to large river water seepage into subsurface water wang et al 2014 gu et al 2016b in addition streamflow showed not significant relation with groundwater mineralization degree the correlation was not shown possibly due to limited surface water and intensified anthropogenic activities in the study area wang et al 2013 liu et al 2018b the direct impact of river water on groundwater quality was limited due to dried up channels in the oasis surface water transfer for irrigation could enhance salt evaporative enrichment by increasing evaporation in the arid region and increased irrigation water from river water could promote mineral dissolution and leaching due to high soil salts liu et al 2018b this in turn results in higher groundwater salinity due to more salt moving downward with soil water into aquifer during the irrigation season wang et al 2013 han et al 2011 nevertheless variations in groundwater level and quality may respond slowly to climate change and anthropogenic forcing erler et al 2019 riley et al 2019 so that the effect of forcing differences in spring was still seen in summer and even in autumn hu et al 2019 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014b observed a lag between groundwater level and runoff over the wei ku oasis and pointed out that the high groundwater level in 2003 was affected by the catastrophic flood in 2002 lulc types and vegetation coverage may exert a strong influence on groundwater level and mineralization degree table 4 and 5 fig 6 land cover change controls on the overall water balance water demand and supply and redistributes water resources modifying groundwater recharge locations rates and mechanisms han et al 2017 berihun et al 2019 folton et al 2019 thus affecting groundwater dynamics zhang et al 2014b chen et al 2019 riley et al 2019 scanlon et al 2006 the cropland area was significantly positively related to dgl while negatively related to dm table 4 and 5 ndvi was positively correlated with dgl while significantly negatively related to dm in spring and winter table 4 the cropland area was one of the main controlling factors for groundwater level table 5 elevated cropland area could enhance agricultural water consumption by increasing evaporation and transpiration zhang et al 2014a shukla et al 2018 which in turn leads to greater groundwater exploitation and surface water transfer to meet irrigation water demands resulting in lower groundwater level in arid regions feng et al 2004 liu et al 2018a zhang et al 2014b reported that the effects of anthropogenic activities on groundwater change were roughly proportional to cultivated area in the tarim basin berihun et al 2019 reported that cultivated land expansion could continuously deteriorate soil structural qualities by tillage thus affecting regional hydrological process in addition elevated cropland area can reduce groundwater level due to more complete agricultural irrigation and drainage systems castellano et al 2019 which in turn leads to less salt accumulation in the shallow groundwater owing to weaker evaporative enrichment and larger salt discharge by the drainage channel resulting in lower groundwater salinity table 6 zhang et al 2014b riedel 2019 reported that agriculturally used land could receive large amounts of nutrients including n p and k which eventually accumulate in soil and aquifer thus influencing groundwater salinity moreover vegetation type also contributed to the variation of groundwater level table 4 and fig 6a vegetation type could influence evaporation and transpiration rates root uptake of water and intercepting rainfall leading to different fluctuation of shallow groundwater levia and frost 2003 jobbágy and jackson 2004 berihun et al 2019 riley et al 2019 increased ndvi due to farmland expansion cropland and artificial forest could change hydrological process by enhancing crop water demand and evapotranspiration in arid region ma et al 2005 huang et al 2013 leading to lower groundwater level due to greater groundwater exploitation and higher water loss via groundwater transpiration in the growing season wang et al 2014 chen et al 2019 increased ndvi could also dry and disconnect stream to groundwater due to most of surface water transfer for irrigation which in turn leads to lower water level owing to little supply from river water zhang et al 2014b on the other hand higher vegetation coverage could make the upper soil layer have greater water holding capacity thus slower the infiltration of rainfall and irrigation water through the shallow soil layer to the deep layer resulting in phreatic decline yinglan et al 2019 furthermore higher ndvi in winter and spring e g winter wheat could increase the discharge of water and salt by drainage channels due to flood irrigation leading to less salt migration and accumulation into shallow groundwater chen et al 2019 agricultural irrigation activities significantly affected groundwater level and quality these correlations were not displayed agricultural irrigation canal can redistribute surface water resources in time and space thus influencing groundwater level and its distribution liu et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 with the expansion of oasis a large number of irrigation canals were constructed to directly transport the upstream river water to the irrigated fields more than 90 of the inflow zhang et al 2014b sun et al 2018 which in turn reduced river water leakage due to the dried up river channel resulting in lower groundwater level chen et al 2019 the gradually increased channel water utilization coefficient could also reduce channel water leakage leading to decreased groundwater level owing to little recharge from surface water zhang et al 2014b chen et al 2019 liu et al 2018b liu et al 2018a and porhemmat et al 2018 reported that water saving irrigation methods could reduce deep percolation and thus decrease potential groundwater recharge in arid and semiarid regions liu et al 2018b noted that irrigation water infiltration and channel leakage could promote soil salinization by elevating shallow groundwater level thus enhancing the direct evaporation effect on groundwater salinization furthermore agricultural drainage systems also affected groundwater dynamics zhang et al 2014b gradually improved drainage system could discharge a certain amount of water and solute salt from irrigated fields table 6 castellano et al 2019 and thus can reduce the groundwater level and salinity due to weaker subsurface water evaporation and less salt accumulation into unconfined aquifer zhang et al 2014b zhang et al 2014b reported that the peaks of water and salt discharge by drainage canals mostly occurred after a large amount of irrigation indicating that drainage and irrigation are inseparable in addition groundwater overexploitation carried out in arid region could modify the regional natural hydrological regime groundwater recharge and discharge processes flow path liu et al 2018b 2018a mancuso et al 2020 thus affecting groundwater storage and phreatic fluctuation scanlon et al 2012 asoka et al 2017 hu et al 2019 farmland expansion and population growth could lead to a dramatic increase in water consumption shukla et al 2018 which in turn increased the intensity of groundwater extraction to meet regional water demand due to limited surface water and increased groundwater usage in arid regions table 6 resulting in groundwater depletion and phreatic decline chen et al 2019 wang et al 2019b riley et al 2019 liu et al 2018b zhang et al 2014b found that the decline of groundwater level was also related to the sharp increase of electromechanical wells in irrigation areas and the increased electromechanical wells could accelerate the exploitation of groundwater resources riley et al 2019 reported that increasing groundwater extraction would reduce groundwater storage in the high plains total water discharge total water discharge by agricultural drainage canals total salt discharge total salt discharge by agricultural drainage canals other various environmental factors such as population policies physiographic characteristics topography lithology and geology and extreme weather conditions could also impact groundwater level and quality directly or indirectly for example shukla et al 2018 reported that population growth would influence groundwater table and quality by enhancing groundwater exploitation and increasing domestic waste discharge contaminating groundwater by direct discharge or leaching in arid regions table 6 chen et al 2019 noted that policies significantly influenced the groundwater dynamics in arid oasis region and the decelerating of phreatic decline in the tarim basin in recent years was most likely due to the implementation of the strictest water resource management system in xinjiang fu et al 2019 found that soil types and land attributes were the most significant factors influencing spatial variation of groundwater recharge erler et al 2019 reported that topographic relief and hydrostratigraphy significantly affected groundwater table it has been widely known that groundwater level decreased significantly with altitude decrease during average conditions fig 1d bekele et al 2019 however our study did not address these aspects further studies on these topics are required 5 3 implications for regional groundwater cycling process the above analyses revealed that spatial and temporal distributions of groundwater level and salinity may provide insight into regional groundwater cycling and hydrogeochemical evolution phreatic decline was caused by an imbalance between recharge and discharge effects healy and cook 2002 groundwater hydrological cycle in arid regions has been altered significantly by climate change and human activities shifting groundwater recharge patterns sources locations rates mechanisms discharge pathways and salts dissolved in water han et al 2017 liu et al 2018a moreover anthropogenic activities seem to have stronger impacts on groundwater after 2000 compared to climatic factors hu et al 2019 before the oasis expansion the river eventually flowed into the tarim river and shallow groundwater system was characterized by simple recharge sources from river and lateral groundwater flow and discharge mainly via evapotranspiration wang et al 2014 the dominant hydrological processes were riverbank leakage and groundwater evaporation for the riparian zone lateral groundwater flow and groundwater evaporation for the desert and irrigation water infiltration lateral groundwater flow and groundwater evapotranspiration for the cultivated land along the river precipitation has little or no direct recharge for shallow aquifer seiler and gat 2007 hu et al 2019 because the scarce rainfall has to satisfy soil and plant transpiration first before infiltrating into aquifers alley 2009 liu et al 2018b after the oasis expansion groundwater recharge and discharge processes have been disturbed by anthropogenic activities wang et al 2014 for the riparian zone the discharge includes groundwater evaporation and shallow aquifer is recharged by little riverbank leakage due to the dried up river courses because more than 90 of the river water was diverted for irrigation plain reservoir regulation zhang et al 2014b for the desert bare areas decreasing to 13 0 in 2018 the dominant hydrological processes are lateral groundwater flow groundwater evaporation and transpiration by deep rooted plants for the cultivated land cropland areas increasing to 62 5 in 2018 shallow aquifer is mainly recharged by massive irrigation water infiltration traditional flood irrigation leakage from canal and reservoir and lateral groundwater flow while the discharge includes groundwater evapotranspiration groundwater extraction and water discharge by agricultural drainage excessive pumping from aquifers has caused local and rapid fall in groundwater level in the weigan kuqa oasis chen et al 2019 in addition groundwater cycle and salt migration are affected by many environmental factors such as climate change lulc change agricultural irrigation activities e g irrigation and drainage groundwater exploitation and population growth fig 7 summarizes the variations of groundwater recharge and discharge due to climate change and anthropogenic activities before and after the oasis expansion in the tarim basin as pointed out previously population growth and cultivated land expansion has caused a sharp increase in water consumption in the arid region on the one hand excessive groundwater abstraction for irrigation domestic and industrial use may reduce groundwater storage on the other hand massive irrigation water infiltration could increase the recharge of shallow aquifers which could counteract part of the negative effects of groundwater overexploitation han et al 2017 however groundwater level continued to decrease due to extensive development of agricultural irrigation by pumping groundwater increased irrigation water infiltration would be primarily adding to vadose zone storage rather than aquifer recharge thus preventing any meaningful groundwater level recovery cao et al 2016 this triggered a series of hydrological and ecological problems including dried up river courses soil salinization and natural desert vegetation degradation thus excessive farmland expansion was an unsuitable use of surface water and groundwater resources which has retarded the restoration of groundwater level and ecosystem in the tarim basin the decreasing trend of groundwater level was still foreseen if land use crop pattern and irrigation water were maintained as present which could strongly challenge water resource security and ecosystem health as well as sustainable economic development in the arid oasis liu et al 2018a wang et al 2019b therefore it is still necessary to reasonably control or even reduce the irrigated area supervise groundwater pumping and or close part of wells and implement the water saving practices in the arid oasis of tarim basin we should scientifically integrate surface water and groundwater management in the oasis scale to balance the recharge and discharge of aquifers restrict non ecological water use and optimize the water allocation ratio between agriculture and ecology to promote groundwater level recovery guo et al 2019 6 conclusions spatio temporal variations and determinants of groundwater level and mineralization degree were examined using groundwater monitoring data collected at 22 wells in the wei ku oasis of tarim basin during the period of 2000 2018 the results showed that the regions with a higher groundwater level generally exhibited a higher mineralization degree obviously large spatial and temporal variations existed in the dgl and dm and the spatial trend was not obvious dgl greatly increased with time 2 05 m per decade p 0 001 during the period due to climate change lulc change agricultural irrigation activities groundwater overexploitation and population growth while dm at most sites was characterized by a decreasing trend 0 21 g l per decade p 0 001 due to evaporative enrichment mineral dissolution and leaching dilution and agricultural drainage groundwater level exhibited significant seasonal differences and was the shallowest in spring and deepest in autumn moreover there appears to be a pattern by which larger variation of dgl dm during the study period generally occurred at the areas with greater dgl dm the lowest values of dm were in the northwestern part and the highest values were in the southeastern part the variation of dgl in the eastern region was noticeably larger than that in the western region furthermore climate conditions streamflow lulc types vegetation coverage agricultural irrigation activities and groundwater exploitation combined to affect the dynamic variations of dgl and dm and the effects exhibited obvious seasonal heterogeneity human activity was the major influencing factor for dgl and climate change for dm the spatial and temporal distributions of groundwater level and salinity may provide insight into groundwater cycling and hydrogeochemical evolution a simple conceptual diagram was drawn to systematically depict the variations of groundwater recharge and discharge associated with climatic and anthropogenic impacts in the arid oasis of tarim basin with the continuous expansion of oasis anthropogenic activities have contributed more and more to groundwater dynamics and further study is needed to quantitatively distinguish the hydrological impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on groundwater dynamics in these arid regions which is critical to sustainable groundwater

4902,groundwater is essential for agricultural ecological and domestic water use and its depletion under climatic and anthropogenic impacts can impose challenges on regional water resources and ecological security particularly in arid regions spatiotemporal variation and drivers of groundwater are critical to understand groundwater cycling and restore groundwater while they are poorly understood in arid oasis region due to sparse field monitoring to address this we examined the spatiotemporal variations and controlling factors of groundwater level and mineralization degree using data collected at 22 wells in the wei ku oasis of tarim basin during 2000 2018 a typical arid inland river basin in northwest china results showed that obviously large spatial and temporal variations existed in both dgl depth to groundwater level and dm degree of mineralization groundwater level was the shallowest in spring and deepest in autumn dgl exhibited a markedly increasing trend 2 05 m per decade while dm marginally decreased 0 21 g l per decade p 0 001 during 2000 2018 the spatial distributions of dgl and dm were complex larger variation of dgl dm generally occurred at the areas with greater dgl dm dm in the northwestern part was obviously smaller than that in the southeastern part the variation of dgl in the eastern region was noticeably larger than that in the western region human activity was the main driving factor of dgl increasing climate change had a dominant role in dm decreasing and the relationship between controlling factors and groundwater varied in space and season decreasing riverbank leakage and increasing volume of evapotranspiration groundwater pumping and water drainage led to decreasing groundwater level while increasing infiltration leakage from irrigated water canal and reservoir resulted in increasing groundwater level the results could help to advance the understanding of groundwater cycling mechanism and be useful in improving sustainable groundwater management and restoring ecosystem in arid region keywords groundwater dynamics climate variability land use change agricultural irrigation dried up river oasis tarim basin 1 introduction groundwater is essential for agricultural ecological and domestic water use orellana et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 erler et al 2019 and is extremely important in arid regions due to low rainfall and insufficient surface water zhang et al 2014a wang et al 2019b chen et al 2019 jia et al 2020 including the quantity and quality of groundwater ma et al 2013 liu et al 2018b porhemmat et al 2018 zou et al 2019 owing to agricultural development urban land expansion increasing population and climate change the locations amounts and timing of groundwater discharge and recharge are being modified worldwide han et al 2017 manna et al 2019 riley et al 2019 which are also currently leading to an unforeseen consequence for groundwater quality tweed et al 2011 wang et al 2013 bekele et al 2019 riedel 2019 groundwater depletion caused primarily by a growing influence of human activities during the past decades can impose challenges on regional water resources and ecological security in arid areas worldwide zhang et al 2014a liu et al 2018a graaf et al 2019 particularly in arid inland river basin with large irrigated agriculture ji et al 2006 white et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 the most affected areas include the northwestern india asoka et al 2017 middle east joodaki et al 2014 california and southern high plains in the north america scanlon et al 2012 and north china plain feng et al 2013 groundwater level is one of the most important parameters for studying arid ecosystems soylu et al 2011 and its continuous decline mainly due to groundwater overexploitation for irrigation supplement in recent decades has influenced hydrological and ecological processes biogeochemical cycling and plant communities in arid regions of the world huang and pang 2010 zhang et al 2014b groundwater level fluctuation can reflect the state of connectivity between river and aquifer in semiarid and arid areas mccallum et al 2013 fuchs et al 2019 riley et al 2019 furthermore groundwater salinization is linked with the recharge discharge and migration processes of groundwater tweed et al 2011 liu et al 2018b and can impact public health soil fertility vegetation growth and renewable fresh groundwater resources manchanda and garg 2008 liu et al 2018b jia et al 2020 spatial distribution of groundwater salinity can reflect groundwater salinization process xie et al 2013 cary et al 2015 and thus in turn could provide insight into hydrogeochemical evolution as well as the interactions between local environment and groundwater in arid regions edmunds 2009 liu et al 2018b therefore it is critical to evaluate the dynamics and drivers of groundwater under climatic and anthropogenic impacts for effectively understanding modelling and managing groundwater systems and improving ecosystem in these arid regions han et al 2017 numerous studies have been carried out to analyze groundwater hydrological processes for reasonable groundwater management in arid areas via various techniques e g geostatistical analysis hu et al 2012 traditional field experiments wang et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 water chemistry huang and pang 2010 tracer experiments guo et al 2019 ma et al 2019a remote sensing inversion zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2019b and hydrologic modeling liu et al 2018a currently studies of groundwater dynamic are mainly based on two data sources including local in situ data borehole data and satellite based grace gravity recovery and climate experiment data combined with hydrological models tweed et al 2007 strassberg et al 2009 hughes et al 2012 chen et al 2016 hu et al 2019 previous studies on groundwater in arid regions mainly focused on the changing trend and rate of groundwater level on annual or interannual scale ma et al 2005 yang and li 2011 hu et al

dynamics and driving factors wang et al 2014 2019b zhang et al 2014a zhou et al 2018 liu et al 2018a generally the hydrological processes that control regional phreatic fluctuation are mainly river water leakage little rainfall infiltration irrigation return flow lateral groundwater flow groundwater evapotranspiration and pumping in arid regions healy and cook 2002 abdalla 2008 wang et al 2014 guo et al 2019 liu et al 2018b the spatio temporal dynamic of groundwater salinity in arid inland river basin is influenced by several mechanisms including evaporation transpiration of deep rooted plants dilution mixing with saline water mineral dissolution and leaching and agricultural irrigation herczeg et al 2001 han et al 2011 tweed et al 2011 farid et al 2015 sun et al 2016 liu et al 2018b jia et al 2020 however although the importance of phreatic fluctuation as a mechanism that influences soil desertification and ecosystem restoration is well recognized groundwater level dynamic and its associated hydrological processes have not been studied extensively in arid areas wang et al 2014 changes in the groundwater level and quality could be caused by many factors including human activities and climate variability wang et al 2014 hu et al 2019 fu et al 2019 recently anthropogenic activities e g agricultural irrigation have exerted great pressure on natural hydrological cycle in arid regions liu et al 2018a and even have greater effects than climate change taylor et al 2013 previous studies investigated the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change on groundwater via building a geostatistical relationship based on historical observations or using a hydrological model fu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b generally groundwater level and quality in arid regions could be affected by topographic characteristics geology aquifer lithology climatic factors land use pattern vegetation soil texture agricultural activities etc wang et al 2014 2019b jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2018b 2018a porhemmat et al 2018 segura et al 2019 the combined effects of these control factors on groundwater are complicated bekele et al 2019 chen et al 2009 found that groundwater extraction could alter the recharge and discharge processes of groundwater and lead to increasing salinity in aquifer porhemmat et al 2018 reported that water saving irrigation systems reduced potential groundwater recharge agam et al 2012 and zhang et al 2014a found that groundwater table declined with increasing agricultural land in arid and semi arid regions however the controls of shallow groundwater level and quality have not been thoroughly examined in arid regions especially in the arid inland river basins the tarim river basin is the largest inland river basin and socioeconomically important region in china and is highly stressed in terms of water scarcity and the water use conflicts between eco environment and agriculture due to uncontrolled cultivated land expansion pang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2019 in the last 30 years the exploitation of water and land resources associated with population growth in the tarim basin has resulted in great changes in water regime and sharply increased water consumption zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2019a and the irrigated agriculture relied heavily on groundwater due to scarce surface water resources which induced groundwater overexploitation for irrigation zhang et al 2014b chen et al 2019 some studies e g chen et al 2019 bai et al 2020b and wang et al 2019a reported that groundwater level is decreasing in tarim basin due to the increased demands for water usage on the one hand and increase in evaporation on the other hand the current decline and extraction of groundwater are not sustainable i e human abstraction exceeds natural groundwater recharge chen et al 2019 anthropogenic impacts and climate variability are exerting pressure on the groundwater in tarim basin bai et al 2020b which has caused some serious hydrological and ecological issues in the middle and lower reaches such as dramatical groundwater level decline natural vegetation degradation especially the riparian ecosystem soil salinization and desertification and drying of rivers huang and pang 2010 bai et al 2020b chen et al 2019 therefore a thorough study of long term variations of groundwater level and quality affected by agricultural activities in the tarim basin is quite necessary to understand groundwater cycling and salt migration mechanism and also is the basis for sustainable groundwater management to meet ecosystem and human needs in such a water limited arid environment scanlon et al 2006 liu et al 2018a hu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b however the evolution characteristic of groundwater and its response to climate variability and enhanced anthropogenic activities were poorly understood in this region due to relatively few hydrological monitoring stations and limited field observation data chen et al 2019 this had resulted in uncertainties when simulating and predicting the regional hydrological and biogeochemical cycling and imposed challenges on the sustainable management of regional water resources and appropriate policy formulation in this arid inland river basin the wei ku oasis a typical dried up river oasis of the tarim basin in northwestern china was selected as the study area to explore the variations and drivers of groundwater the oasis has experienced intensive cultivated area expansion rapidly growing population and increasing extreme weather events in recent decades chen et al 2019 previous studies using multiple temporal scales to examine oasis groundwater dynamics revealed obvious inter annual variability of groundwater level zhang et al 2014b however the evolution characteristics of groundwater and their response to climate and land cover changes in the oasis were not well understood we analyzed the spatio temporal variations and determinants of groundwater over the wei ku oasis using long term situ groundwater monitoring data collected at 22 wells over the past 19 years 2000 2018 the main objectives of this study were 1 to assess climate variability and land cover change in the oasis 2 to examine the long term spatio temporal variations of groundwater level and quality on annual scale and seasonal scale and 3 to evaluate the influence of environmental drivers on groundwater level and quality over time i e air temperature precipitation streamflow actual evapotranspiration normalized difference vegetation index and cropland area the results would be expected to improve our understanding of groundwater cycling process in the oasis of dried up river basin in arid areas and provide theoretical foundation for sustainable groundwater resource management in the tarim basin 2 study area the tarim river basin 73 40 93 65 e and 34 80 43 35 n is the largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwest china fig 1 a the basin is flanked by the kunlun mountains to the south and tianshan mountains to the north with an area of 1 02 106 km2 fig 1b our study area wei ku oasis is located in the middle and lower reaches of the weigan kuqa river basin in northern tarim basin fig 1b and natural desert ecosystem and agricultural economic development are heavily dependent on groundwater in the oasis chen et al 2019 the weigan kuqa river basin which originated in the south of tianshan mountains is mainly composed of the weigan river and kuqa river and finally disappeared near the northern bank of tarim river the weigan river has five tributaries the muzati river kapusilang river televichuk river karasu river and kizil river fig 1b the annual streamflow is about 26 6 108 m3 for the weigan river and 4 6 108 m3 for the kuqa river and the flood season is from june to september accounting for 56 3 of the total the wei ku oasis 82 09 83 47 e and 40 90 41 85 n consists of kuqa shaya and xinhe counties and covers approximately 7104 km2 fig 1c the elevation declines from the north to the south and ranges from 945 to 1147 m above sea level this area is characterized by a typical temperate arid continental climate the mean annual air temperature is 11 4 and mean annual precipitation is 74 6 mm data from the chinese national meteorological centre and mean annual potential evaporation is about 2401 mm with a strong seasonal dynamic chen et al 2019 precipitation in this area has an uneven seasonal distribution and more than 76 of the overall precipitation occurs from may to september the annual surface runoff into the oasis is 31 2 108 m3 and more than 90 of the river water is diverted for irrigation zhang et al 2014b causing dried up natural river courses in recent decades groundwater level and quality data were collected from 22 groundwater observation wells on the wei ku oasis and the spatial distribution and geographic information of the 22 monitoring wells are shown in fig 1c and table 1 the depth to groundwater level in this oasis ranges from 2 to 6 m and the phreatic water evaporation is strong causing severe soil salinization based on the groundwater level contours fig 1d groundwater levels generally decline gradually from northwestern higher elevation to southeastern lower elevation indicating that the groundwater in the wei ku oasis flows from the north to the south and finally into the tarim river the wei ku oasis is covered by the quaternary sediments of various hydrogeologic units fig 1e including fine sandstone pebbly sandstone silty fine sandstone fine siltstone sandy gravel and sandstone the weigan and kuqa river transported large amount of eroded materials from the tianshan mountains into the plain and lead to the formation of alluvial fan the southeastern part of the wei ku oasis is alluvial sediment mainly covered by fine sandstone with a thickness of 40 60 m with shallow groundwater level and moderate water abundance fig 1e the northeastern part and northern margin of the oasis are proluvial sediments mainly covered by pebbly sandstone very strong water abundance and sandstone moderate water abundance with deep groundwater level the central part of the oasis is alluvial proluvial sediment the grain size of sediments is decreasing from pebbly sandstone to fine siltstone and correspondingly the water abundance of aquifer systems is decreasing from very strong water abundance to weak water abundance with shallow groundwater level fig 1e moreover in the vertical layers coarse material and fine material in the sediments were alternately deposited due to the runoff variations of the weigan river and kuqa river fig 1f the spatial heterogeneity of hydrogeologic conditions over the oasis impacts the occurrence reserve distribution and flow of subsurface water wang et al 2013 furthermore the wei ku oasis is dominated by agriculture and the main crops are cotton corn and winter wheat chen et al 2019 in the oasis the dominated natural plants are populus euphratica tamarix spp halostachys caspica phragmites communis alhagi pseudalhagi karelinia caspica glycyrrhiza and sophora alopecuroides zhao 2006 in 2018 the cropland grassland forest urban areas and bare areas accounted for 62 5 17 9 5 1 1 1 and 13 0 respectively of the total area of this oasis table 3 3 methodology 3 1 data in this study we

river kuqa river in the upstream of the weigan kuqa river basin from 2000 to 2018 were obtained from the weigan river basin authority streamflow was measured daily by hydrological observational stations at the outlets of the mountainous sub basins in addition monthly groundwater level and quality data from 2000 to 2018 for the wei ku oasis were collected from the water salt monitoring station of the weigan river basin authority china groundwater was observed from dates throughout the year for each groundwater monitoring well fig 1c groundwater level was manually observed three times on the 5th 15th and 25th of each month and groundwater samples were collected once every season the water quality measurements of samples were undertaken at the water salt monitoring station of the weigan river basin authority and the analytical detection limit for ions was 0 1 mg l the basic information of the 22 groundwater monitoring wells on the oasis was shown in table 1 which observed only the water level and quality dynamics for shallow groundwater in this study the groundwater quality parameter of interest was mineralization degree which represented salts the groundwater level and mineralization degree data were interpolated into a 250 m resolution grid data using the inverse distance weighting idw method to keep the spatial resolution identical with other data 3 1 2 meteorological data monthly mean air temperature and monthly precipitation data were all obtained from the chinese national meteorological information center http cdc cma gov cn which provided china datasets of monthly precipitation and temperature from 1961 to present with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and a monthly temporal resolution this data was validated by error analysis and cross validation with gauge based observations indicating good quality the above temperature and precipitation grid data in the wei ku oasis from 2000 to 2018 were used in this study the amount of actual evapotranspiration aet strongly depends on vegetation covers climatic variables and climate forcing factors e g greenhouse gases ozone co2 liu et al 2016 long term climate variability lulc change and related management strategies are expected to have an influence on regional aet thus affecting groundwater recharge and discharge berihun et al 2019 therefore evaluating long term effects of aet on groundwater is extremely important in this study monthly aet data in the wei ku oasis during 2000 to 2018 were sourced from the gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model http www gleam eu v3 3a dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a monthly temporal resolution which has been verified to agree well with land surface flux observation results in china particularly in arid northwestern china both for the areas with without vegetation ma et al 2019b wu et al 2020 the datasets are based on reanalysis radiation and air temperature reanalysis and satellite based precipitation a combination of gauge based and satellite based vegetation optical depth which have higher temporal and spatial resolutions and match better with data requirements in large scale research compared with other aet data products wu et al 2020 monthly aet data was accumulated into the seasonal aet and annual aet from 2000 to 2018 in order to maintain consistency with other data used in this study all the temperature precipitation and aet data were resampled into a spatial resolution of 250 m using the bilinear interpolation method by arcgis 10 5 software 3 1 3 vegetation data ndvi normalized difference vegetation index was used in this study to describe vegetation cover due to its good correlation with vegetation cover an et al 2015 ndvi data for the study area from 2000 to 2018 were derived from the modis ndvi product mod13q1 provided by nasa national aeronautics and space administration http ladsweb nascom nasa gov data search html with a spatial resolution of 250 m and a 16 day temporal resolution orbital number h24v04 this dataset has been widely used in ecohydrological studies in semi arid and arid regions of northern china due to its finer resolution and high reliability an et al 2015 in this study the maximum value composite mvc method was used to determine the monthly ndvi and annual ndvi values for the 16 day modis ndvi product 2 images per month 23 images per year which represents the growth of vegetation in the month or year then the seasonal ndvi was determined by averaging the monthly ndvi for the three months in each season which represents the growth of vegetation in the season 3 1 4 land use data the annual lulc land use and land cover data used in this study were derived from the esa cci lc products 300 m resolution 2000 to 2015 http maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer and the c3s global land cover products 300 m resolution 2016 to 2018 http cds climate copernicus eu which is a spatial data layer of land use types denoted in grid the esa cci lc products were released by the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci which was an annual global land cover time series from 1992 to 2015 with a 300 m resolution this dataset has fine classification long time series and high spatial resolution and is suitable for the large scale and long term land cover change study which was found to have good applicability in china yang et al 2017 further the c3s global land cover products for the years 2016 2018 were released by the copernicus climate change service c3s in 2019 and described the land surface into 22 classes united nations land cover classification system lccs which were consistent with the esa cci lc products to ensure continuity then the 22 lccs land use classes were grouped into 6 ipcc land categories for ear year including cropland forest grassland urban areas bare areas and water bodies finally the lulc type maps for the years 2000 2018 were produced for further analysis 3 2 statistical analyses data statistical analyses were performed using the arcgis version 10 5 ibm spss software package version 22 0 and matlab version r2018a and the statistical significance level was 5 or 1 the sen s slope method was used to evaluate the variation trends and amplitudes of groundwater hydrometeorological and vegetation variables the inverse distance weighting idw method was used to interpolate the borehole observations of groundwater level and mineralization degree into a 250 m resolution grid data pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlations between groundwater and forcing factors multiple linear stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the key controlling factors of the groundwater level and mineralization degree spatial multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the dominant factors of groundwater level and mineralization degree for each pixel percentage variation of individual lulc types was evaluated to describe the extent of lulc variation between two time points using eq 1 long et al 2009 1 p e r c e n t v a r i a t i o n a 2 a 1 a 1 100 where a 1 and a 2 are the area of a given lulc type in year 1 and year 2 respectively the spatial and temporal variations of hydroclimatic and vegetation variables were evaluated using zonal statistics and the sen s slope method sen 1968 which has been widely applied to analyze variation of long term hydrometeorological time series berihun et al 2019 the sen s slope method can evaluate the variation trend and amplitude of time series data based on the median of the series of slopes and could avoid or reduce the influence of data omissions and anomalies wu et al 2020 the formula is given as eq 2 sen 1968 2 s e n i j m e d i a n x j x i j i where s e n i j is the sen s slope x i and x j are the sequential values corresponding to times i and j respectively where 1 i j n n is the length of the time series when sen greater than 0 the time series show an increasing trend vice versa pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between environmental factors and oasis groundwater level and mineralization degree for two elements and y if their sample values are x i and y i i 1 2 n the correlation coefficient between them is defined as eq 3 3 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r xy is the correlation coefficient between and y x is the average value of the sample values for x y is the average value of the sample values for y the key controlling factors of oasis groundwater level and mineralization degree were evaluated using the multiple linear stepwise regression analysis by setting averages of driving factors as independent variables at the monthly seasonal and annual time scales for the reasonable regression fittings akaike information criterion aic values were calculated step by step under various parameter settings to evaluate the reliability of model capacity and parameter selection wu et al 2020 during the process of stepwise regression analysis this study used the whole time series data 2000 2018 for exploring the driven module eqs 4 and 5 and the raw data was standardized firstly 4 d g l b i x i ε 5 d m b i x i ε where dgl and dm are the depth to groundwater level and mineralization degree respectively b i is the regression coefficient x i is the key

standardized partial regression coefficient b i is the partial regression coefficient σ x i is the standard deviation of independent variables climatic hydrological and vegetation variables σ y is the standard deviation of dependent variables dgl and dm inverse distance weighting idw method was used to generate a continuous surface of groundwater level and quality based on the borehole observations data which is one of the most important interpolation methods recognized in geostatistical analysis nistor et al 2020 the idw is based on the first law of geography and assumes the proportionality of similarity and correlation between neighbors and the distance between them the cell values are evaluated by linear weighted combination of sample point dataset and the weighting is a function of inverse distance that is the weighting of farther known points is less than that for nearer known points the accuracy of the idw is influenced by the power parameter p a lower p value has more effect on the surrounding region of the farther points while a higher p value can define a detailed surface on the nearest points the formulas for the idw are given as eqs 7 9 nistor et al 2020 7 z i 1 n w i

cover an overview of the temporal analysis was shown in fig 2 presenting annual and monthly averages of air temperature precipitation and streamflow in the oasis from 2000 to 2018 the annual mean air temperature had a decreasing trend with a mean rate of about 0 12 10a over the period from 2000 to 2018 while annual precipitation and streamflow exhibited an increasing trend with a mean rate of about 12 mm 10a and 0 30 108 m3 10a during this period respectively fig 2 and table 2 in addition the variation trends of hydrometeorological factors air temperature precipitation and streamflow differed between the four seasons table 2 air temperature significantly decreased in summer 0 33 10a and autumn 0 57 10a from 2000 to 2018 while increased in spring 0 20 10a precipitation increased in summer 10 31 mm 10a and autumn 3 27 mm 10a while decreased in spring 0 86 mm 10a and winter 1 00 mm 10a streamflow increased in spring 0 11 108 m3 10a and summer 1 04 108 m3 10a while decreased in autumn 0 47 108 m3 10a and winter 0 53 108 m3 10a due to the regulation of mountain reservoirs chen et al 2019 furthermore there were diverse intra annual variation characteristics for the three hydrometeorological factors in the oasis during 2000 to 2018 fig 2g h and i as shown in fig 2i the monthly streamflow of the weigan kuqa river showed some large fluctuations the highest value appeared in july 6 19 108 m3 and the lowest value occurred in january 0 5 108 m3 the intra annual distribution of streamflow showed three peaks occurred in march july and november respectively due to reservoir regulation the peak air temperature occurred in july 25 4 and the lowest value occurred in january 8 1 fig 2g the maximum value of monthly precipitation occurred in june 15 2 mm and the minimum value occurred in march 0 8 mm fig 2h the spatial distributions of lulc for 2000 2010 and 2018 were prepared for the wei ku oasis fig 3 a b and c as shown in fig 3 cropland was mainly distributed in the west and northeast of the oasis grassland mainly in the middle and southeast forest mainly on the edge of the cropland mainly as artificial forest and bare land mainly on the edge of the oasis i e the transition zone between oasis and desert fig 3a b and c in general during the entire study period the area of cropland forest and urban land gradually increased while the area of grassland bare land and water bodies gradually decreased as time goes on cropland forest and urban areas continuously increased to 62 5 5 1 and 1 1 respectively in 2018 table 3 conversely grassland bare areas and water bodies continuously decreased to 17 9 13 0 and 0 4 respectively in 2018 table 3 furthermore the dominant lulc type was cropland over the entire period covering more than half of the oasis area 55 9 60 6 and 62 5 in 2000 2010 and 2018 respectively resulting in high water demand grassland was second in dominance 20 3 18 9 and 17 9 in 2000 2010 and 2018 respectively followed by bare areas 20 2 15 2 and 13 0 in 2000 2010 and 2018 respectively fig 3 and table 3 compared to other lulc types urban areas accounted for the least coverage 0 3 in 2000 but showed a dramatic increase during 2000 to 2018 the highest percentage change was observed in urban areas which increased by 137 0 between 2000 and 2010 and by 68 1 between 2010 and 2018 table 3 on the other hand bare areas decreased markedly between 2000 and 2018 by 35 4 and grassland underwent a general decrease by 11 9 between 2000 and 2018 mainly due to farmland expansion in the study area in contrast cropland exhibited a persistent increase by 8 4 from 2000 to 2010 and by 11 9 from 2000 to 2018 table 3 indicating that a considerable area of bare land and grassland was converted into cropland and urban land in the oasis throughout the entire study period zhang et al 2014b however the expansion of farmland had obviously slowed by 2018 in the wei ku oasis table 3 forest area also underwent a conspicuous increase by 72 1 from 2000 to 2018 in the oasis including natural forest and artificial forest artificial ecological forest and economic forest water bodies had remained unchanged from 2000 to 2010 but underwent a general decrease by 8 3 between 2010 and 2018 annual mean ndvi in the oasis exhibited a significant increasing trend at the 0 1 significance level with a mean rate of about 0 10 per decade over the period from 2000 to 2018 fig 2d and table 2 for the oasis ndvi showed increasing trend for all seasons at least at the 1 significance level table 2 the rate of ndvi increase was the largest in summer 0 10 10a followed by autumn 0 06 10a and the smallest in spring and winter 0 03 10a as shown in fig 2j ndvi in the study area displayed a noticeable seasonal distribution the maximum value of monthly ndvi appeared in august 0 42 the minimum value occurred in february 0 10 and the values from december to march were very close 0 15 in addition fig 3 used colour gradients to exhibit details in the spatial distribution of ndvi over the oasis for 2000 2010 and 2018 fig 3d e and f the figures exhibited a decreasing gradient for ndvi from north west to the south east for almost all years and the sparsely vegetated area was mainly located on the edge of the oasis and in certain localized areas of the central oasis mainly as bare land vegetation cover in the northwestern and central parts changed more obviously than that in the southeastern part furthermore fig 4 presented the spatiotemporal variation of ndvi across the oasis for annual average and four seasons during 2000 to 2018 fig 4k l m n and o overall ndvi increased significantly in most parts of the entire oasis p 0 05 while decreased noticeably in sporadic areas of the northeastern and southeastern parts fig 4k for most of the study area there was significant spatiotemporal variation in the ndvi in all seasons p 0 05 fig 4l m n and o in summer the lulc type with the largest increase of ndvi was mainly cultivated land with a rate of 0 25 0 55 10a fig 4m in spring and winter the lulc types with the significant changes of ndvi were mainly cultivated land and bare land with a rate of 0 05 0 10 10a fig 4l and o in autumn the variation of ndvi in the southeastern part was significantly smaller than that in other regions fig 4n 4 2 spatio temporal variations of groundwater the distributions of dgl and dm across the wei ku oasis for annual average spring summer autumn and winter during 2000 to 2018 were shown in fig 5 both dgl and dm showed significant spatial variability in the oasis and the spatial distribution pattern of dgl and dm varied among the four seasons dgl ranged from 0 4 to 9 6 m the maximum value was observed at well w8 in the summer of 2017 and the minimum value was observed at well w21 in the spring of 2009 maybe due to underlying surface conditions hydrometeorological conditions and human activities wang et al 2014 the dm for the four seasons spanned a relatively wide range from 0 4 to 16 0 g l during 2000 to 2018 the maximum and minimum dm were observed at well w22 in the autumn of 2017 and w1 in the winter of 2002 respectively the normal operation of the paman reservoir caused a visible decrease in dgl near well w21 which was 0 3 1 2 m smaller than the dgl of ambient wells w20 and w22 in all seasons across most of the oasis the dgl was greater than 3 0 m however there were many areas where it was between 3 5 and 5 0 m fig 4a in general in the east central region of the oasis there were several sizable areas where the dgl exceeded 5 0 m and reached a maximum depth of about 6 5 m in some locations while in the southwest there was a sizable area where the dgl was below 3 0 m and reached a minimum depth of about 1 5 m in some locations due to reservoir influence overall there appeared to be a pattern by which the regions with the deepest groundwater level also experienced the largest seasonal variations in the dgl fig 5a b c d and e for the oasis dgl was the smallest in spring followed by winter and the largest in summer and autumn fig 5b c d and e moreover across most of the oasis the dm was less than 4 g l and was relatively lower in the northwestern and central parts of the oasis below 2 g l fig 5k lowest concentrations of dm were in the northwestern part of the oasis 0 4 g l and the highest concentrations were in the southeastern part up to 13 g l fig 5k during all seasons the dm in spring was significantly lower than that in the other seasons for the northwestern and central parts while the differences of dm between the four seasons were not significant for the other regions of our study area fig 5l m n and o the trend statistics of groundwater level and quality were shown in fig 2 the dgl in the wei ku oasis showed a significant continuously increasing trend of about 4 1 m on average across the oasis from 2000 to 2018 fig 2e while the dm showed a noticeable decreasing trend of about 0 42 g l on average during the same period fig 2f however variations of dgl and dm were not significant after 2015 in the seasonal analysis 22 wells showed a downward trend for groundwater level and quality in all seasons and the decreasing trends between the four seasons were close in fig 2 it was clear that the degree of mineralization and groundwater level showed the most significant decrease in the spring months april and may decreasing by about 0 82 g l and 4 3 m respectively while the decrease was the least in the autumn months october and november furthermore the mean annual dgl varied from 2 4 to 5 7 m with mean value of 4 0 m and dm varied from 3 1 to 3 9 g l with mean value of 3 3 g l during 2000 2018 period fig 2e and f moreover the intra annual distributions of the dgl and dm averaged over the entire oasis were shown in fig 2k and l the dgl developed a pronounced seasonal cycle in the oasis while the dm exhibited a noticeably weaker season cycle in general the intra annual distribution of dgl showed two peaks the first peak appeared in april and the other in december fig 2k the groundwater level remained too shallow in spring 3 6 m in april while too deep in autumn 4 2 m in october the dm in groundwater was lower in winter 3 2 g l than that in the other seasons but the difference of dm was not significant between seasons fig 2l values of dgl and dm in our study area significantly varied in space and time fig 3 it was evident that the dgl across this oasis was greater in 2018 fig 3i than that in 2010 fig 3h or 2000 fig 3g in contrast the dm of groundwater was lower in 2018 fig 3l than that in 2010 fig 3k or 2000 fig 3j overall from 2000 to 2018 there appeared to be a pattern by which the areas with the smallest dgl experienced the smallest increase in the dgl and vice versa fig 3g h and i while the areas with the highest dm had the largest decrease in the dm and vice versa fig 3j k and l during the study period 2000 2018 the dgl increased significantly in most areas of the oasis increased by about 4 1 m or more and the increase in the southwest was significantly smaller than that in other regions in 2000 the spatial difference of dgl was not obvious and the dgl was relatively small across the entire oasis about below 3 0 m except for a sizable area in the northwest fig 3g in 2010 dgl presented significant spatial differences and the lower value mainly occurred in the southwest part the higher value in the east and central parts fig 3h furthermore the southwestern part had consistently higher dm compared to other parts in the oasis during the entire period fig 3j k and l overall dm displayed obvious spatial variability for 2000 2010 and 2018 and decreased significantly in most parts of the entire oasis in 2000 the spatial differenceof dm was significant the minimum value of dm was in the northwest and central parts of the oasis while the maximum value in the southwest fig 3j likewise in 2010 the maximum value of dm was in the southwest and northeast the lower value in the northwest and central areas fig 3k the spatiotemporal variations of dgl and dm across the oasis for annual average and four seasons from 2000 to 2018 were shown in fig 4 and table 2 during the period from 2000 to 2018 the average rate of dgl variation sen s slope estimator in the whole oasis was about 2 05 m per decade p 0 001 with the greatest rate in spring 2 15 m 10a and the smallest in autumn 1 94 m 10a table 2 sen s slope tested variation showed a noticeable increase in the dgl across the entire oasis at the 5 significance level with changes of more than 3 m 10a in areas where the groundwater level was deep greater than 5 m while small increase 1 m 10a where the dgl was shallow fig 4a b c d and e that is the regions that are the most sensitive and experience the largest changes were the regions where the dgl was already relatively great and vice versa figs 4 and 5 overall the variation of dgl in the eastern region of our study area was significantly larger than that in the western region fig 4a for the seasonal analysis of groundwater level 22 wells showed a downward trend in all seasons at the 5 significance level the increase of dgl was noticeably greater in spring and winter than that in summer and autumn for the west part w9 w17 and w18 was the greatest in spring and smallest in winter for the east part w14 and w15 and was the largest in spring and smallest in summer and autumn for the northeastern part w6 fig 4b c d and e furthermore the variation of dm across the study area during 2000 to 2018 presented great spatial heterogeneity with no clear pattern emerging maybe due to the impact of irrigation and drainage network fig 4f g h i and j as shown in table 2 over the entire study period the mean decreasing rate of dm sen s slope estimator in the whole oasis was about 0 21 g l per decade at the 0 1 significance level with the greatest in spring 0 41 g l per decade and the smallest in autumn 0 17 g l per decade in summer and winter the mean decreasing rate of 22 wells was 0 28 g l and 0 22 g l per decade respectively overall the rate of dm change at the northwest and southwest parts was positive increasing trend in four seasons whereas it in the western and eastern parts was negative decreasing trend in four seasons while the decreasing trend was not significant in the remaining sporadic areas during the study period fig 4f it was evident that the area with significant dm changes was noticeably larger in spring than that in the other seasons fig 4g h i and j in the analysis on seasonal scale the decrease of dm was noticeably greater in spring than that in other season for the western part of our study area w9 w10 and w17 while was greater in spring and autumn than that in summer and winter for the south part w22 likewise the increase of dm was significantly smaller in spring than that in other seasons for the southwest and northwest parts w3 w8 and w18 while the decrease of dm was obviously smaller in winter than that in other seasons for the northeast part w6 the relationship between groundwater level and mineralization degree over the study period was prepared for the wei ku oasis fig 5f g h i and j as shown in fig 5 a negative correlation p 0 01 between dgl and dm was observed across the oasis for annual average fig 5f and four seasons fig 5g h i and j that is the regions with a higher average groundwater level showed a noticeably greater dm and vice versa on the annual scale the fitting equation between dgl and dm across the entire oasis was described as dm 1 448 6 066 dgl 1 n 418 r 2 0 081 p 0 01 fig 5f however this relationship during the study period was generally weak in the study area mainly due to the influence of strong evaporation and drainage channels zhang et al 2014b furthermore in the analysis on seasonal scale the correlation coefficient between dgl and dm also varied among the four seasons and was greater in spring than that in the other seasons fig 5g h i and j 4 3 correlations between groundwater and climate and land cover change pearson s correlation analysis results showed that the environmental factors had greater effects on dgl than dm and the effects exhibited significant seasonal heterogeneity in the study area during 2000 to 2018 table 4 dgl was significantly positively correlated with precipitation actual evapotranspiration and cropland area while significantly negatively related to streamflow similarly dm had a significant positive relation with air temperature while showed significant negative correlations with precipitation and actual evapotranspiration dm in all seasons had no statistical correlation with streamflow and cropland area overall compared with climate drivers anthropogenic activities had greater impacts on the decline of groundwater level during the study period table 4 among hydrometeorological factors the important factor was actual evapotranspiration r 0 374 p 0 001 n 418 for dgl and air temperature r 0 147 p 0 01 n 418 for dm among anthropogenic activity factors cropland area r 0 602 p 0 001 n 418 was important factor for dgl furthermore cropland area in all seasons was significantly correlated with dgl but had no significant relationship with dm table 4 streamflow was significantly correlated with dgl in autumn and winter but had no significant relationship with dm in all seasons ndvi was significantly correlated with dgl in summer and winter while had significant relationship with dm in spring and winter actual evapotranspiration was significantly correlated with dgl in all seasons except winter but was significantly correlated with dm in spring and summer precipitation showed a significant relationship with dgl in summer and winter whereas was significantly correlated with dm in all seasons except winter air temperature showed a significant relationship with dgl in summer and autumn while was significantly correlated with dm in all seasons furthermore the stepwise linear regression analysis was used to identify the major controlling factors for the decreasing groundwater level and mineralization degree and their seasonal differences in the wei ku oasis table 5 the stepwise linear regression models for the annual mean dgl and dm across the whole oasis were expressed as d g l a n n u a l 21 12 0 54 c r o p l a n d 0 14 a e t r2 0 38 p 0 001 n 418 and d m a n n u a l 1 54 0 15 t e m p e r a t u r e r2 0 02 p 0 005 n 418 the cropland area and actual evapotranspiration were the main controlling factors affecting groundwater level among the climate and anthropogenic drivers which both had positive effects nevertheless air temperature was the major factor of the mineralization degree of groundwater which had a positive effect in addition cropland area and actual evapotranspiration explained important proportions of the dgl in spring and summer while cropland area played an important role in the dgl in autumn and winter table 5 the correlations between groundwater and environmental variables confirmed that anthropogenic activities had strong influences on the groundwater level in our study area table 4 and 5 dgl depth to groundwater level dm degree of mineralization cropland area of cropland aet actual evapotranspiration t air temperature n number of samples moreover the dominant factor influencing groundwater level and mineralization degree also differed spatially in the wei ku oasis during the study period fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the dominant factor affecting groundwater level variation was ndvi or actual evapotranspiration for most areas of the oasis while was precipitation or air temperature for very small areas fig 6a in contrast the spatial difference of the dominant factor of mineralization degree change was more significant the dominant factor of dm change was precipitation or actual evapotranspiration or ndvi for most regions of the oasis while was air temperature for some sporadic small areas fig 6b generally for the regions with the largest increase in ndvi cropland forest and bare areas ndvi was the dominant factor causing dgl change fig 4k and fig 6a probably due to artificial oasis expansion leading to more water consumption for the areas with insignificant variation in ndvi bare land in the west and southeast parts cultivated land near the river channel actual evapotranspiration was the dominant factor of dgl change fig 1b fig 3a 3c fig 4k and fig 6a precipitation was the dominant factor of dgl variation for the grassland in southeast part fig 3a 3c fig 6a for the areas with the largest decrease in ndvi urban land in the northern part air temperature was the dominant factor of dgl change fig 3a 3c fig 4k fig 6a furthermore for the areas with very small dm mainly in the northwestern part ndvi was the dominant factor of dm change maybe due to the impact of drainage channels fig 1 fig 3l and fig 6b for the regions with the largest increase in ndvi cropland bare land and forest in the northwest actual evapotranspiration was the dominant factor of dm fig 3c fig 4k and fig 6b precipitation was the dominant factor of dm for the areas with insignificant variation of ndvi grassland and bare land in the southeast fig 3c fig 4k and 4o while air temperature was the dominant factor of dm for some sporadic areas in the northwest part urban areas and some grassland 5 discussion 5 1 variation characteristics of groundwater the average annual dgl in the present study across the whole oasis varied from 2 4 to 5 7 m with mean value of 4 0 m and dm varied from 3 1 to 3 9 g l with mean value of 3 3 g l during 2000 to 2018 these data were consistent with the results by zhang et al zhang et al 2014b for the wei ku oasis however the dgl values in the present study were higher than those in the lower reaches of the tarim river in recent years sun et al 2020 this could be explained by the rapid farmland expansion in the oasis and the continuous ecological water conveyance in the lower reaches of tarim river chen et al 2019 the rapid expansion of cultivated area across the oasis in recent decades has led to a continuous decline of the groundwater level since the sharp increase of regional water consumption could cause groundwater overexploitation chen et al 2019 in contrast since 2000 the continuous ecological water conveyance to the lower reaches of tarim river has increased the recharge from the river channel to groundwater which in turn has caused a substantial increase of groundwater level in the downstream chen et al 2019 groundwater level and mineralization degree significantly decreased with time fig 2e and f our results exhibited that the annual dgl had a significant increasing trend about 2 05 m per decade table 2 across the whole oasis from 2000 to 2018 while the annual dm showed a decreasing trend about 0 21 g l per decade table 2 several studies in the tarim basin reported similar groundwater depletion chen et al 2019 this was consistent with the observations in the oases of the hexi corridor in china feng et al 2004 chen 2010 huang and pang 2010 and other arid regions around the world scanlon et al 2006 joodaki et al 2014 asoka et al 2017 hu et al 2019 reported that groundwater table declined with a rate of 13 mm month in the western australia during 1980 to 2015 and ma et al 2005 2013 discovered groundwater level decreased by 35 m in the minqin oasis and by 10 m in the dunhuang oasis in northwest china in the past decades the falling of groundwater level in the study area could be explained by five aspects first climate change plays an important role in groundwater dynamics beal et al 2019 wittenberg et al 2019 elevated air temperature could enhance the duration and intensity of evaporation which in turn lead to lower groundwater level due to the increased evaporation of soil water and groundwater wang et al 2019b while elevated air temperature also could increase the melting water of glacier and snow in mountains by enhancing melting period hori et al 2017 and thus results in higher groundwater level due to the supply from meltwater and river water chao et al 2020 the amount and spatio temporal distribution of precipitation would determine the quantity and distribution of regional water resources by affecting runoff formation process which in turn lead to groundwater level fluctuation owing to variations of groundwater recharge zhang et al 2014b eamus et al 2015 second lulc changes greatly impact groundwater dynamics in arid regions due to the great differences in evapotranspiration and water consumption of different vegetation bai et al 2020a and cultivated area expansion could lead to a dramatic increase in irrigation water from river water and groundwater thus causing groundwater level decline due to reduced river infiltration and groundwater overexploitation chen et al 2019 third agricultural irrigation activities in arid regions could greatly impact groundwater level and quality by affecting groundwater cycle process wang et al 2014 field irrigation usually enhances the recharge from infiltrating irrigation water to groundwater increased channel water utilization coefficient could reduce channel water leakage and gradually improved drainage systems could reduce the groundwater level porhemmat et al 2018 fourth groundwater overexploitation could lead to the falling of groundwater level and the depletion of groundwater storage mainly due to the direct pumping of shallow and deep groundwater to meet regional water demand in arid regions asoka et al 2017 wang et al 2019b fifth soaring population could greatly enhance domestic water consumption and thus results in the continuous falling of groundwater level due to limited surface water resources and increased groundwater exploitation in the arid oasis area scanlon et al 2006 groundwater level and mineralization degree exhibited significant seasonal differences in the arid oasis figs 2 and 5 these were consistent with the results by bai et al bai et al 2020b for the upper tarim river and wang et al 2014 for the lower heihe river in northwestern china these were reasonable due to the seasonal deviations in climatic and anthropogenic factors in fact great differences of driving factors exist among the seasons such as climatic conditions temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow hydrological connectivity vegetation coverage soil water content groundwater extraction and agricultural irrigation activities irrigation methods irrigation water requirement agricultural drainage fig 2 taylor et al 2013 porhemmat et al 2018 furthermore groundwater level was the shallowest in spring and exhibited the most significant decrease in spring fig 2k and table 2 this might be contributed to less evapotranspiration due to lower air temperature more recharge from snowmelt runoff and infiltration recharge due to spring flood irrigation from pumping deep groundwater zhang et al 2014b wang et al 2014 hu et al 2019 in contrast groundwater level was the deepest in summer and autumn and presented the least decrease in autumn fig 2k and table 2 probably due to strong evapotranspiration agricultural drainage groundwater extraction increased crop water requirements during the growing season decreased irrigation water seepage by water saving irrigation and reduced recharge from river water resulting from surface water transfer for irrigation han et al 2011 porhemmat et al 2018 additionally the mineralization degree of groundwater in our study area was the highest in autumn and lowest in winter fig 2l these could be related to the different influence of evaporation and transpiration dilution mineral dissolution and leaching and agricultural irrigation among the seasons han et al 2011 liu et al 2018b jia et al 2020 transpiration of deep rooted plants and evaporation of soil moisture and shallow groundwater could affect groundwater quality by redistributing moisture and salinity within the soil profile herczeg et al 2001 tweed et al 2011 liu et al 2018b the dilution caused by precipitation river water and irrigation water could reduce groundwater ion concentration due to lower salinity of precipitation and streamflow compared to shallow groundwater tweed et al 2011 wang et al 2013 jia et al 2020 soil mineral dissolution and leaching could increase the salts in groundwater since the downward migration of soil water could also cause the downward migration of salinity dissolved in soil moisture into groundwater su et al 2009 tweed et al 2011 farid et al 2015 liu et al 2018b liu et al 2018b reported that saline soil in unsaturated zone and evaporites in fine grained sediment were widely distributed in the arid regions and subsurface water could efficiently dissolve evaporates during vertical migration processes agricultural irrigation activities greatly impact groundwater hydrochemistry in arid regions since agricultural drainage systems could reduce groundwater salinity by lowering groundwater level discharging of subsurface water with high salinity and decreasing subsurface water evaporation and the quality of irrigation water also could affect groundwater salinity han et al 2011 liu et al 2018a however the difference of dm was not significant between seasons in the oasis fig 2l and fig 5 this may be attributed to the complex coupled effects of climate and human activities on groundwater quality zhang et al 2014b and might imply that anthropogenic activities play a great role in groundwater quality in the arid oasis area liu et al 2018b the spatial distributions and variations of groundwater level and mineralization degree both exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity and a spatial trend was not obvious figs 4 and 5 these could be related to the great spatial heterogeneity of environmental conditions and anthropogenic activities among the monitoring wells such as topography climatic conditions hydrogeological condition soil properties lulc types vegetation agricultural irrigation and drainage activities and groundwater exploitation fig 1 and fig 3 table 1 zhang et al 2014b the random spatial trend of dgl and dm revealed the complex interaction between groundwater and environmental factors and suggested that the effects of climatic and topographic conditions on groundwater level and quality were not significant in the tarim basin zhang et al 2014b chen et al 2019 furthermore the regions with a higher groundwater level exhibited a higher mineralization degree fig 5 probably due to greater salt accumulation caused by greater evaporative enrichment at the areas with higher water level liu et al 2018b in addition larger variation of dgl during the study period was found at the areas with greater dgl figs 4 and 5 probably due to more stable recharge sources for the regions with smaller dgl smaller dgl were generally found near river courses or cultivated land which was mainly recharged by infiltrating water from river water or irrigation water from river water transfer or pumping deep groundwater leading to smaller variation of shallow groundwater level han et al 2011 moreover the variation of groundwater level in the eastern region was significantly larger than that in the western region fig 4a probably due to weaker anthropogenic interference in the eastern part wang et al 2014 compared to the western part the land use types in the east was dominated by grassland and bare land fig 3 a and thus shallow groundwater recharge was more unstable due to less infiltration water from almost dried up river channels and little agricultural irrigation leading to greater interannual fluctuation of groundwater level due to the effects of climate change zhang et al 2014b furthermore the lowest values of dm were found in the northwestern part while the highest values were found in the southeastern part fig 5k these could be related to the different recharge mechanisms hydrogeochemical evolution hydrogeological conditions hydraulic gradient drainage conditions evaporation effect field irrigation and drainage network and groundwater level ma et al 2013 porhemmat et al 2018 compared to the southeastern part the higher terrain in the northwest could lead to better drainage conditions due to greater hydraulic gradient and improved agricultural drainage systems fig 1 thus making less salt accumulate in shallow groundwater due to lower water level less evaporation and more salt excretion by drainage channel zhang et al 2014b 5 2 effects of climate and land cover changes on groundwater climatic factors interact to affect groundwater level and quality table 4 and fig 6 our results showed that dgl was significantly positively correlated to precipitation and actual evapotranspiration while negatively related to air temperature table 4 dm was significantly positively related to air temperature while significantly negatively related to precipitation table 4 higher air temperature could decrease groundwater level by increasing evapotranspiration berihun et al 2019 fu et al 2019 but could also stimulate glacier and snow melting and thus lead to higher groundwater level due to greater supply from meltwater ma et al 2005 segura et al 2019 lin et al 2020 furthermore increased precipitation during the wet season could promote vegetation growth by enhancing soil moisture content riley et al 2019 and thus lead to lower groundwater level owing to the absorption of soil water and groundwater by deep rooted vegetation wang et al 2014 liu et al 2018b this effect is limited in the arid oasis area due to scarce precipitation intensive evaporation and high groundwater depths table 1 ma et al 2013 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a liu et al 2018b groundwater variations in arid oasis region mainly depend on surface water infiltration river water and irrigation water and lateral groundwater flow rather than rainfall wang et al 2013 guo et al 2019 and high evaporation rate makes it hard for precipitation to become groundwater in arid area hu et al 2019 in addition actual evapotranspiration was one of the major controlling factors for groundwater level table 5 elevated actual evapotranspiration could lead to more water dissipation from river soil water and shallow groundwater due to increased temperature berihun et al 2019 folton et al 2019 and thus decrease groundwater level due to less recharge ma et al 2013 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2018b fu et al 2019 moreover air temperature was the dominant factor of groundwater mineralization degree table 5 elevated temperature could increase salt evaporative enrichment during evaporation process which in turn result in more salt accumulation in soil profile chen et al 2018 rose et al 2005 leading to higher mineralization degree for the shallow groundwater due to the downward migration of salt dissolved in soil moisture into aquifer tweed et al 2011 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2018b furthermore temperature is one of the controlling factors for the rate of mineral dissolution and leaching which exhibited a positive correlation welch and ullman 2000 and thus higher temperature can lead to large salt leaching from soil into soil water and moving downward into aquifers resulting in higher groundwater salinity kindler et al 2011 riedel 2019 additionally elevated rainwater could dilute the salt concentration in soil water and shallow groundwater during the wet season due to greater recharge from precipitation infiltration which has lower salinity compared to subsurface water huang et al 2017 jia et al 2020 moreover actual evapotranspiration was not significantly related to groundwater mineralization degree table 4 indicating that other factors might exert strong influences on shallow groundwater salts e g agricultural activities liu et al 2018b streamflow had great effects on groundwater table 4 streamflow was significantly negatively related to dgl while positively correlated with dm table 4 greater streamflow could increase groundwater level by enhancing groundwater recharge from river water wang et al 2014 gu et al 2016a guo et al 2019 for example zhang et al zhang et al 2014b reported that the upward trend of groundwater level in 2002 and 2003 for the wei ku oasis was mainly caused by the catastrophic flood on july 22 to 23 2002 moreover the relationship between dgl and streamflow was significant in autumn and winter while not significant in spring and summer table 4 one possible explanation was that the reservoirs in the tarim basin can regulate the annual distribution of surface water chen et al 2019 and there is a lag between groundwater level fluctuation and river water infiltration during the flood period wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014b erler et al 2019 greater streamflow during flood period with 61 occurring from may to september fig 2i could increase groundwater level due to large river water seepage into subsurface water wang et al 2014 gu et al 2016b in addition streamflow showed not significant relation with groundwater mineralization degree the correlation was not shown possibly due to limited surface water and intensified anthropogenic activities in the study area wang et al 2013 liu et al 2018b the direct impact of river water on groundwater quality was limited due to dried up channels in the oasis surface water transfer for irrigation could enhance salt evaporative enrichment by increasing evaporation in the arid region and increased irrigation water from river water could promote mineral dissolution and leaching due to high soil salts liu et al 2018b this in turn results in higher groundwater salinity due to more salt moving downward with soil water into aquifer during the irrigation season wang et al 2013 han et al 2011 nevertheless variations in groundwater level and quality may respond slowly to climate change and anthropogenic forcing erler et al 2019 riley et al 2019 so that the effect of forcing differences in spring was still seen in summer and even in autumn hu et al 2019 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014b observed a lag between groundwater level and runoff over the wei ku oasis and pointed out that the high groundwater level in 2003 was affected by the catastrophic flood in 2002 lulc types and vegetation coverage may exert a strong influence on groundwater level and mineralization degree table 4 and 5 fig 6 land cover change controls on the overall water balance water demand and supply and redistributes water resources modifying groundwater recharge locations rates and mechanisms han et al 2017 berihun et al 2019 folton et al 2019 thus affecting groundwater dynamics zhang et al 2014b chen et al 2019 riley et al 2019 scanlon et al 2006 the cropland area was significantly positively related to dgl while negatively related to dm table 4 and 5 ndvi was positively correlated with dgl while significantly negatively related to dm in spring and winter table 4 the cropland area was one of the main controlling factors for groundwater level table 5 elevated cropland area could enhance agricultural water consumption by increasing evaporation and transpiration zhang et al 2014a shukla et al 2018 which in turn leads to greater groundwater exploitation and surface water transfer to meet irrigation water demands resulting in lower groundwater level in arid regions feng et al 2004 liu et al 2018a zhang et al 2014b reported that the effects of anthropogenic activities on groundwater change were roughly proportional to cultivated area in the tarim basin berihun et al 2019 reported that cultivated land expansion could continuously deteriorate soil structural qualities by tillage thus affecting regional hydrological process in addition elevated cropland area can reduce groundwater level due to more complete agricultural irrigation and drainage systems castellano et al 2019 which in turn leads to less salt accumulation in the shallow groundwater owing to weaker evaporative enrichment and larger salt discharge by the drainage channel resulting in lower groundwater salinity table 6 zhang et al 2014b riedel 2019 reported that agriculturally used land could receive large amounts of nutrients including n p and k which eventually accumulate in soil and aquifer thus influencing groundwater salinity moreover vegetation type also contributed to the variation of groundwater level table 4 and fig 6a vegetation type could influence evaporation and transpiration rates root uptake of water and intercepting rainfall leading to different fluctuation of shallow groundwater levia and frost 2003 jobbágy and jackson 2004 berihun et al 2019 riley et al 2019 increased ndvi due to farmland expansion cropland and artificial forest could change hydrological process by enhancing crop water demand and evapotranspiration in arid region ma et al 2005 huang et al 2013 leading to lower groundwater level due to greater groundwater exploitation and higher water loss via groundwater transpiration in the growing season wang et al 2014 chen et al 2019 increased ndvi could also dry and disconnect stream to groundwater due to most of surface water transfer for irrigation which in turn leads to lower water level owing to little supply from river water zhang et al 2014b on the other hand higher vegetation coverage could make the upper soil layer have greater water holding capacity thus slower the infiltration of rainfall and irrigation water through the shallow soil layer to the deep layer resulting in phreatic decline yinglan et al 2019 furthermore higher ndvi in winter and spring e g winter wheat could increase the discharge of water and salt by drainage channels due to flood irrigation leading to less salt migration and accumulation into shallow groundwater chen et al 2019 agricultural irrigation activities significantly affected groundwater level and quality these correlations were not displayed agricultural irrigation canal can redistribute surface water resources in time and space thus influencing groundwater level and its distribution liu et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 with the expansion of oasis a large number of irrigation canals were constructed to directly transport the upstream river water to the irrigated fields more than 90 of the inflow zhang et al 2014b sun et al 2018 which in turn reduced river water leakage due to the dried up river channel resulting in lower groundwater level chen et al 2019 the gradually increased channel water utilization coefficient could also reduce channel water leakage leading to decreased groundwater level owing to little recharge from surface water zhang et al 2014b chen et al 2019 liu et al 2018b liu et al 2018a and porhemmat et al 2018 reported that water saving irrigation methods could reduce deep percolation and thus decrease potential groundwater recharge in arid and semiarid regions liu et al 2018b noted that irrigation water infiltration and channel leakage could promote soil salinization by elevating shallow groundwater level thus enhancing the direct evaporation effect on groundwater salinization furthermore agricultural drainage systems also affected groundwater dynamics zhang et al 2014b gradually improved drainage system could discharge a certain amount of water and solute salt from irrigated fields table 6 castellano et al 2019 and thus can reduce the groundwater level and salinity due to weaker subsurface water evaporation and less salt accumulation into unconfined aquifer zhang et al 2014b zhang et al 2014b reported that the peaks of water and salt discharge by drainage canals mostly occurred after a large amount of irrigation indicating that drainage and irrigation are inseparable in addition groundwater overexploitation carried out in arid region could modify the regional natural hydrological regime groundwater recharge and discharge processes flow path liu et al 2018b 2018a mancuso et al 2020 thus affecting groundwater storage and phreatic fluctuation scanlon et al 2012 asoka et al 2017 hu et al 2019 farmland expansion and population growth could lead to a dramatic increase in water consumption shukla et al 2018 which in turn increased the intensity of groundwater extraction to meet regional water demand due to limited surface water and increased groundwater usage in arid regions table 6 resulting in groundwater depletion and phreatic decline chen et al 2019 wang et al 2019b riley et al 2019 liu et al 2018b zhang et al 2014b found that the decline of groundwater level was also related to the sharp increase of electromechanical wells in irrigation areas and the increased electromechanical wells could accelerate the exploitation of groundwater resources riley et al 2019 reported that increasing groundwater extraction would reduce groundwater storage in the high plains total water discharge total water discharge by agricultural drainage canals total salt discharge total salt discharge by agricultural drainage canals other various environmental factors such as population policies physiographic characteristics topography lithology and geology and extreme weather conditions could also impact groundwater level and quality directly or indirectly for example shukla et al 2018 reported that population growth would influence groundwater table and quality by enhancing groundwater exploitation and increasing domestic waste discharge contaminating groundwater by direct discharge or leaching in arid regions table 6 chen et al 2019 noted that policies significantly influenced the groundwater dynamics in arid oasis region and the decelerating of phreatic decline in the tarim basin in recent years was most likely due to the implementation of the strictest water resource management system in xinjiang fu et al 2019 found that soil types and land attributes were the most significant factors influencing spatial variation of groundwater recharge erler et al 2019 reported that topographic relief and hydrostratigraphy significantly affected groundwater table it has been widely known that groundwater level decreased significantly with altitude decrease during average conditions fig 1d bekele et al 2019 however our study did not address these aspects further studies on these topics are required 5 3 implications for regional groundwater cycling process the above analyses revealed that spatial and temporal distributions of groundwater level and salinity may provide insight into regional groundwater cycling and hydrogeochemical evolution phreatic decline was caused by an imbalance between recharge and discharge effects healy and cook 2002 groundwater hydrological cycle in arid regions has been altered significantly by climate change and human activities shifting groundwater recharge patterns sources locations rates mechanisms discharge pathways and salts dissolved in water han et al 2017 liu et al 2018a moreover anthropogenic activities seem to have stronger impacts on groundwater after 2000 compared to climatic factors hu et al 2019 before the oasis expansion the river eventually flowed into the tarim river and shallow groundwater system was characterized by simple recharge sources from river and lateral groundwater flow and discharge mainly via evapotranspiration wang et al 2014 the dominant hydrological processes were riverbank leakage and groundwater evaporation for the riparian zone lateral groundwater flow and groundwater evaporation for the desert and irrigation water infiltration lateral groundwater flow and groundwater evapotranspiration for the cultivated land along the river precipitation has little or no direct recharge for shallow aquifer seiler and gat 2007 hu et al 2019 because the scarce rainfall has to satisfy soil and plant transpiration first before infiltrating into aquifers alley 2009 liu et al 2018b after the oasis expansion groundwater recharge and discharge processes have been disturbed by anthropogenic activities wang et al 2014 for the riparian zone the discharge includes groundwater evaporation and shallow aquifer is recharged by little riverbank leakage due to the dried up river courses because more than 90 of the river water was diverted for irrigation plain reservoir regulation zhang et al 2014b for the desert bare areas decreasing to 13 0 in 2018 the dominant hydrological processes are lateral groundwater flow groundwater evaporation and transpiration by deep rooted plants for the cultivated land cropland areas increasing to 62 5 in 2018 shallow aquifer is mainly recharged by massive irrigation water infiltration traditional flood irrigation leakage from canal and reservoir and lateral groundwater flow while the discharge includes groundwater evapotranspiration groundwater extraction and water discharge by agricultural drainage excessive pumping from aquifers has caused local and rapid fall in groundwater level in the weigan kuqa oasis chen et al 2019 in addition groundwater cycle and salt migration are affected by many environmental factors such as climate change lulc change agricultural irrigation activities e g irrigation and drainage groundwater exploitation and population growth fig 7 summarizes the variations of groundwater recharge and discharge due to climate change and anthropogenic activities before and after the oasis expansion in the tarim basin as pointed out previously population growth and cultivated land expansion has caused a sharp increase in water consumption in the arid region on the one hand excessive groundwater abstraction for irrigation domestic and industrial use may reduce groundwater storage on the other hand massive irrigation water infiltration could increase the recharge of shallow aquifers which could counteract part of the negative effects of groundwater overexploitation han et al 2017 however groundwater level continued to decrease due to extensive development of agricultural irrigation by pumping groundwater increased irrigation water infiltration would be primarily adding to vadose zone storage rather than aquifer recharge thus preventing any meaningful groundwater level recovery cao et al 2016 this triggered a series of hydrological and ecological problems including dried up river courses soil salinization and natural desert vegetation degradation thus excessive farmland expansion was an unsuitable use of surface water and groundwater resources which has retarded the restoration of groundwater level and ecosystem in the tarim basin the decreasing trend of groundwater level was still foreseen if land use crop pattern and irrigation water were maintained as present which could strongly challenge water resource security and ecosystem health as well as sustainable economic development in the arid oasis liu et al 2018a wang et al 2019b therefore it is still necessary to reasonably control or even reduce the irrigated area supervise groundwater pumping and or close part of wells and implement the water saving practices in the arid oasis of tarim basin we should scientifically integrate surface water and groundwater management in the oasis scale to balance the recharge and discharge of aquifers restrict non ecological water use and optimize the water allocation ratio between agriculture and ecology to promote groundwater level recovery guo et al 2019 6 conclusions spatio temporal variations and determinants of groundwater level and mineralization degree were examined using groundwater monitoring data collected at 22 wells in the wei ku oasis of tarim basin during the period of 2000 2018 the results showed that the regions with a higher groundwater level generally exhibited a higher mineralization degree obviously large spatial and temporal variations existed in the dgl and dm and the spatial trend was not obvious dgl greatly increased with time 2 05 m per decade p 0 001 during the period due to climate change lulc change agricultural irrigation activities groundwater overexploitation and population growth while dm at most sites was characterized by a decreasing trend 0 21 g l per decade p 0 001 due to evaporative enrichment mineral dissolution and leaching dilution and agricultural drainage groundwater level exhibited significant seasonal differences and was the shallowest in spring and deepest in autumn moreover there appears to be a pattern by which larger variation of dgl dm during the study period generally occurred at the areas with greater dgl dm the lowest values of dm were in the northwestern part and the highest values were in the southeastern part the variation of dgl in the eastern region was noticeably larger than that in the western region furthermore climate conditions streamflow lulc types vegetation coverage agricultural irrigation activities and groundwater exploitation combined to affect the dynamic variations of dgl and dm and the effects exhibited obvious seasonal heterogeneity human activity was the major influencing factor for dgl and climate change for dm the spatial and temporal distributions of groundwater level and salinity may provide insight into groundwater cycling and hydrogeochemical evolution a simple conceptual diagram was drawn to systematically depict the variations of groundwater recharge and discharge associated with climatic and anthropogenic impacts in the arid oasis of tarim basin with the continuous expansion of oasis anthropogenic activities have contributed more and more to groundwater dynamics and further study is needed to quantitatively distinguish the hydrological impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on groundwater dynamics in these arid regions which is critical to sustainable groundwater

4903,disastrous floods result in severe loss of human lives and intense destruction to the infrastructure and economic activities furthermore it leads to environmental and ecological damages located at the downstream area of the dam the present study aims at investigating experimentally and numerically the sediment transport and morphological evolution of the erodible bed induced by dam break flows experimental runs were conducted in a flume specially designed for dam break flow process equipped with a thin vertical gate at its middle based upon an initial plane bed the effect of three different compaction rates of the bed at both up and downstream of the dam was investigated the experimental data consistently suggested that increasing the bed compaction rate resulted in decreasing the scouring and sedimentation depth as well as the sediment transport rate further increasing the bed compaction rate led to increasing the wave front celerity reducing the scouring rate and the erosion depth both the experimental and numerical outputs highlighted the process of air entrainment at the leading edge of the wave front the numerical results showed that the maximum void fraction was associated with the maximum flow velocity at the zone of wave front comparisons were made between the experimental results and those are provided from a numerical study using standard volume of fluid vof method where three different turbulence closure schemes rng k ε and k ω and three bed load sediment transport approaches van rijn meyer peter muller and nielson were applied accordingly by considering the error values in predicting the free surface height and the bed deformation the k ω closure model showed the highest accuracy in capturing the turbulence features while the mayer peter muller formula had the highest performance in predicting the bed deformation in non compacted nc bed besides the rng closure model and nielsen bed load formula revealed the highest accuracy in predicting the aforementioned features in a semi compacted sc bed the k ɛ closure model and mayer peter muller formula showed the highest accuracy in reproducing the turbulence characteristics and bed profile in a fully compacted fc bed keywords dam break bed compaction experimental study numerical modeling vof 1 introduction the catastrophic flood induced by dam failure may lead to significant morphological changes including erosion in the downstream near field the bed load transport to the downstream and sedimentation in the far field cao et al 2004 wu and wang 2008 while it causes many losses of life and property in the downstream residential or industrial areas the dam failure may also result in some serious environmental issues such as releasing heavy metals into the surrounding environment especially in tailing dam failure zhiquan et al 2015 this kind of morphological change could strongly affect the maximum water level and arrival time of the wave front the consequence assessment of the dam break process begins by gathering information about the dam and determining the dam failure scenario the rate of bed compaction downstream of the dam is a key parameter that substantially affects the morpho dynamic process in the downstream area indeed the geomorphic dam break flow leads to severe bed erosion and sediment transport to the downstream while it resulting in much deformation of the river bed and its beaches accordingly the volume of sediment total load released by the dam break flow mayfrom the same order of water volume within the reservoir while the morphological changes affect the dam break wave evolution advancing distance or the travel time values soares frazão et al 2007 this kind of morphological change could strongly affect the maximum water level and arrival time of the dam break wave front the propagation of dam break flow over the fixed and erodible beds was experimentally evaluated by lauber and hager 1998 vischer and hager 1998 capart and young 1998 capart 2000 spinewine and zech 2002 spinewine and zech 2004 spinewine and zech 2007 leal et al 2006 2009 carrivick et al 2011 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2010 soares frazão et al 2007 park et al 2012 spinewine and capart 2013 di cristo et al 2017 and vosoughi et al 2020 capart and young 1998 and capart 2000 experimentally evaluated the shock feature related to the scouring of a horizontal granular bed caused by a dam break wave the results showed that the subsequent hydraulic jumps are generated in the downstream channel the reason for this phenomenon was the bed resistance effects against the free surface evolution subsequently spinewine and zech 2002 spinewine and zech 2004 spinewine and zech 2007 spinewine and capart 2013 conducted some small scale dam break over loose granular beds in this connection they used different bed materials it was specified that the sheet flow thickness and the deposition are increased in the far field di cristo et al 2017 evaluated the dam break wave propagation over an erodible embankment both experimentally and numerically using a two phase depth integrated model further the sediment transport processes under different flow conditions including the steady and unsteady flows were specifically investigated by fernandez luque and van beek 1976 meyer peter and muller 1948 van rijn 1981 van rijn 1984 nielsen 1992 and ribberink 1988 in terms of computational methods the shallow water equations swe could not predict the vertical flow acceleration the non hydrostatic pressure distribution or formation of the cross flows specifically in the near field at the very initial stage accordingly the process of wave breaking and turbulent variation are predominant and the development of a boundary layer at the bottom influences significantly the shear imparted to the mobile bed besides the three dimensional flow features are locally predominant over the scour holes complex geometry and the downstream wall campisano et al 2004 2004b spinewine and zech 2007 zech et al 2008 soares frazão et al 2007 bahmanpouri et al 2013a 2013b spinewine and capart 2013 in stark contrast the three dimensional models based on the navier stokes equations do not have the aforementioned disadvantages yang et al 2010 xia et al 2010 haddadian et al 2014 issakhov et al 2018 li and yu 2019 the review of the literature including above mentioned highlighted that the bed compaction rate as an independent variable has a significant effect on the dam break free surface evolution and the bed deformation this issue has received little attention which has a great effect on the river morphological process indeed based on the author s knowledge the effect of bed compaction rate as an independent variable on free surface evolution and the erodible bed deformation has not been evaluated in the literature therefore the present study aims to examine the various bed compaction rates that influence the dam break wave evolution over erodible bed based upon both experimental and numerical modeling further the various turbulence closure models and the bed load formula performance was compared in predicting the free surface and bed deformation it is worth noting that the bed load transport formula has been successfully employed in predicting the dam break morpho dynamic characteristics by cao et al 2004 wu and wang 2008 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2010 di cristo et al 2006 while according to these studies the bed load formula performance in capturing the bed deformation is dependent on the sediment physical characteristics and the experimental configuration the findings of the present study would be of great interest in the design of oceans and civil engineering as well as in river and coastal engineering flood hazard analysis in other words the present results are applicable for local officials and dam operators to consider any necessary actions or plans e g emergency operation plan and local hazard mitigation plan 2 methodology experimental runsconductedin a laboratory flume equipped with a rapidup wardmoving of a vertical sluice gate in the middle of the flume aguillotine type mechanism comprising the cable and a 30 kg weight while the initial plane bed test case with three different compaction rates was evaluated afterward numerical modeling of the dam break over movablebeds considering the different compaction rates was carried out employing a cfd commercial package the model has been recently employed by buccino et al 2019a buccino et al 2019b to investigate the failure mechanism of heavily overtopped structures in a highly turbulent two phase flow condition and by khoshkonesh et al 2019 and yang et al 2018 in evaluating the dam break flow propagation over the fixed beds the authors reported considerable agreement between the numerical and the experimental results however in the current study the efficiency of the model is examined in predicting the dam break flow characteristics over the erodible bed in this approach the model is comprising two parts as a clear water model and b scouring and sediment transport in the scouring model entrained sediment and packed bed considered as two concentration fields in evaluating the particle entrainment in water flow the sediment flux equations coupled with clear water equations besides the bed load formulas are separately tackled to estimate the volume of sediment transport as bed load flow science 2012 in this connection the experimental setup is addressed then the description of numerical simulation is provided and ultimately the outputs of numerical modeling are compared with the experimental data 2 1 experimental set up the experiments of dam break over mobile bed were carried out at hydraulic laboratory of civil engineering department university of tehran the flume was 5 m long 0 16 m wide and about 0 4 m high which was specifically designed for the dam break experiments fig 1 the laboratory flume of present study previously employed by bahmanpouri et al 2013a bahmanpouri et al 2013b and haddadian et al 2014 for the experimental study of dam break flow over both movable and smoothed bed configurations as indicated in fig 1 the dam break process was represented by a rapid upward movement of the thin vertical sluice gate in the middle of the flume the plastic gate was 10 mm thick and fitted on its circumference with a hollow pvc seal subsequently a 30 kg weight provided the acceleration for the upward lifting of the gate guided by a system of roller bearings while the gate opening time in the order of 0 1 s was achieved over the full nominal height of 40 cm in order to completely removing the gate from the flume the dam break process was considered as instantaneous if the sluice gate removed from the domain during tr 2hu0 g or tr 1 25 hu0 g respectively lauber and hager 1998 vischer and hager 1998 where tr denotes the removing time hu0 presents the upstream water level and g presents the gravity acceleration g 9 81 m s 2 for all dam break experiments the reservoir still water depth hu was equal to 0 23 m while the greatest removing time trmax was approximately equal to 0 22 s therefore the first instantaneous dam break condition was fulfilled in this study trmax 0 22 s 2hu0 g accordingly a 50 mm thick non uniform coarse sand layer was appended onto the flume fixed bed following the procedure applied by spinewine and zech 2007 and spinewine and capart 2013 as illustrated in fig 1 the saturated sediment layer embodied throughout the flume length the bed material was composed of non uniform coarse sand with a median diameter d50 2 5 mm dry density ρd 1650 kg m 3 saturated density ρs 1820 kg m 3 and a friction angle φ 33 as estimated from the critical angle of repose of a dry granular heap and negligible cohesion table 1 the dispersion of the particle s diameter is according to fig 2 the parameter values are summarized in table 1 table 1 displays three types of beds with different compactness namely non compacted nc semi compacted sc and fully compacted fc along with corresponding physical characteristics of compaction rates cs sediment saturated density ρs and porosity ϕ further the amounts of sediment saturated density ρs for various compaction rates as well as corresponding porosity ϕ are shown in table 1 these magnitudes used to calculate the total load transport qs in numerical modeling it should be pointed out that during an experiment it was impossible to follow the scour and deposition processes therefore for the experimental runs the total amount of bed material transported due to the dam break wave was collected at the downstream settlement tank and dried before being measured soares frazão et al 2012 and daghighi et al 2015 have also taken the same procedure for dam flow and tsunami induced sediment transport over mobile beds respectively 2 2 experimental conditions the experimental tests were contained in covering the channel bed by sand material adjusting compacting and profiling them to the desired depth and saturating them through adding water at a slow rate afterward the proctor procedure was used to provide equal bed layers thickness considering three various sediment compaction rates each sediment layer received a number of blows from a standard weighted hammer at a specified height the hammer with 5 kg weight and 10 10 cm2 touch area compacted the bed in the vertical direction in this connection for each run the rates of density and porosity were measured and recorded in the laboratory at the level of 10 saturation of the bed in this connection for each run the rates of density and porosity were measured and recorded in the laboratory at the level of 10 saturation of the bed subsequently the reservoir was filled up with clear water to a specified level hu0 hence the sediment bed within the reservoir was submerged while there was no water on top of sediment across the downstream channel the sediment initial depth hs0 within the reservoir and downstream was the same when the water came to rest and the instrumentation was ready the gate opening was triggered to start the experiment the configurations that were tested in the present work are shown in fig 3 the initial water depth was set to hu0 0 23 m upstream of the gate and zero downstream 2 3 imaging apparatus measurements of the experimental tests were mainly conducted based upon digital imaging through the transparent side wall in this regard high speed cameras were applied to recorded image sequences with the capability of 200 frames per second four side by side synchronized dalsa cad1 ccd cameras were used with sequential steps of 75 cm to cover the whole flume length so that each captured frame was limited to a length of 80 cm along the longitudinal direction of the flume to record images with the resolution of 1024 512 pixels all cameras recorded frames with 8 bit digital output or 256 grey levels the coverage length of the recording was from 0 5 m upstream of the gate to the downstream end of the channel also to reduce light reflection and improve the extracted image quality a black wall surrounded the flume three tests were conducted in order to calibrate the juxtaposing images of cameras before starting the main runs herein the accuracy of the experimental data primarily dependent on water surface profile and bed level determination while the camera resulted in an accuracy of 2 for measuring water surface level the measurement of bed level with ruler introduced uncertainties up to 1 the initial water level upstream of the dam followed visually with an accuracy of 1 2 4 experimental results the main test to demonstrate the flow behavior was first conducted based upon the semi compacted flat bed with 5 cm sand bed material covered both upstream and downstream fig 3 highlights reconstructed flow mosaics at some chosen instants for this test case overall the propagation of the dam break wave front toward downstream resulted in erosion by entraining large amounts of bed sediments in the flow the flatbed indeed presents the condition that elevation of sediment trapped within the dam reservoir is roughly equal to those deposited throughout the downstream channel while the flatbed is considered as the common type of bed for analyzing the dam break flow over mobile bed spinewine and zech 2002 it is worth noting that breaking the dam leads to releasing the reservoir sediment to the downstream while the bed deforms and will be uneven during the flood propagation therefore the flatbed condition was satisfied only before breaking the dam processes including the deformation of the free surface the downstream propagation of the wave and the intense mobilization of bed sediment into the flow were all observed visually through the naked eye based upon observation in fig 3 three flow regions could be detected clearly a pure water layer a sediment transport layer composed of a mixture of water and moving grains and the motionless sediment bed such flow regions were separated by fairly sharp interfaces which could be defined with a semi automated imaging technique on the mounted digital mosaics fig 4 on the one side the interfaces between air and water and on the other between water and moving grains displayed a high contrast and were located without uncertainty fig 4b on the contrary the interface between moveable and immobile grains was more complex and subject to interpretation the procedure for interface detection was as follows first the moving region is highlighted on a differentiated image generated by subtracting the image from the previous image and taking the absolute value on the resulting image the fixed bed appears dark while the moving layer of grains appears brighter the interface position is then specified using the same method as with the other two interfaces capart 2000 spinewine and zech 2007 in fig 5 the snapshots of the dam break flow evolution and the bed deformation are shown in distorted real coordinates it was not possible to extract the snapshots from water and bed fluctuations because of considerable turbulence intensity during the very initial stage t 0 2 s considering the free surface curvature before and after the dam place itwas observedthat the dam break flow followeda transition fromupstreamsubcriticalflow to the downstream supercritical regime indeed the free surface profile uniformly descended within the dam reservoir while it had a steep slope and notablyfluctuatesacross the downstream channel accordingly the flow wassubcriticaland supercritical inside the dam reservoir and the downstream channel respectively increasing the bed compaction rate led to increasing the wave front celerity reducing the scouring rate and the erosion depth fig 5 and table 2 generally regardless of compaction rate over a first time window the front celerity observed almost constant and consequently decreased slightly highlighting that the gradual transition from the inertial and equilibrium phases to the viscous phase as bed friction resulted in the deceleration of the wave front the similar results were reported by park et al 2012 and yang et al 2018 for dam break flow over smooth bed spinewine and zech 2007 zech et al 2008 and spinewine and capart 2013 for dam break propagation over the sand and pvc beds and bahmanpouri et al 2013a bahmanpouri et al 2013b for the propagation of wave front induced by dam break over sandy bed each dam break test was repeated three times so the values presented in table 2 were averaged magnitudes further the wave front celerity is displayed in fig 6 results are plotted for all three cases and compared to the ritter 1892 solution uwf 2 ghu0 the combined effects of scouring and bed friction led to a notable deceleration of the progressive wave front celerity as compared to the ritter solution the experimental data highlighted that the wave front celerity decreased with increasing the mobility of the bed material this finding was in agreement with the observation reported by leal et al 2006 2009 for dam break flow on different bet types including sand pumice and pvc bed further wu and wang 2008 and capart and young 1998 and capart 2000 similarly addressed that increasing the sediment coefficient led to decreasing wave propagation and consequently the rate of erosion as seen the wave front celerity was constant and then decreased slightly revealing the progressive transition from inertial to viscous phases since the bed friction resulted in a deceleration of the wave front 3 numerical modeling computational fluid dynamic cfd codes solve the differential reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in the fluid domain retaining the reference quantity in the three directions for each control volume identified park et al 2012 issakhov et al 2018 khoshkonesh et al 2019 herein the vof method was employed in modeling the dam break flow hirt and nichols 1981 while the turbulence features were captured through turbulence closure models including standard k ɛ rng jones and launder 1972 yakhot et al 1992 and k ω wilcox 1993 three bed load transport formulas including van rijn 1984 meyer peter and muller 1948 as well as nielsen 1992 were applied to predict the sediment transport processes mastbergen and von den berg 2003 all simulations were conducted using the flow 3d cfd package flow science 2012 3 1 meshing domain initial and boundary conditions thus it is essential to minimize the number of cells while including enough resolution to capture the significant features of the geometry in addition to enough flow specification a fine mesh size also provides a proper representation of rapid changes in the solution however it may lead to an increase in the numerical diffusion due to the discretization of the momentum equations since the momentum residuals and computational efforts increase by raising the mesh resolution khoshkonesh et al 2019 the computational domain extends by 2 m and 3 m away from the gate toward the ends of the flume and 0 34 m in the vertical direction the depth of the water was fixed at 0 23 m and the thickness of packed sediment was set 0 05 m for all the tests all simulations were performed on a single mesh block with uniform cells after multiple checks the mesh size of 0 025 mobtainedas theoptimalsize of all cells indeed the results of multiple checks on mesh resolution and closure models considering the error values as an accuracy criterionhave been presentedin tables 3 and 4 this thechoiceis also consistent withthe assumption ofthe sediment s grain sizeshouldkeep below 10 percent of the mesh cell size flow science 2012 table 5 the boundary conditions of the simulations were derived from the physical model defined as follows the flume bed lateral walls and the left wall beginning point all are the no slip boundary condition while the right side endpoint of the flume is an outlet condition the top of the domain is considered as a free slip condition in which the tangential shear stresses are equal to zero in this boundary further a hydrostatic pressure equivalent to water column height defined in the dam place as a boundary condition accordingly the fraction of fluid f is equal to the unit in the reservoir which considered as an initial condition fig 7 shows meshing details the dimension of cells covering the whole computational domain and boundaries 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the mesh resolution the sensitivity analysis of the mesh resolution was conducted for all bed compaction rates all simulations were conducted using an intel i7 3 6 ghz processor by 8 threads table 3 describes the details of the sensitivity analysis for each run the maximum number of iterations nmi processing time tp and processing time for every thread td showed a direct relationship with the total number of mesh cells nt in all cases however there was not a specified relationship between the aforementioned parameters and the compaction rate the minimum processing time for every cell tc was about 1 2 s while tcmin value was over half of the dam break total time tt furthermore the maximum processing time tpmax for about 170 000 cells was equal to 450 s hence the model showed an acceptable performance in predicting the dam break flow free surface evolution and the bed deformation in terms of the computational efforts based on the data presented in table 4 the bed load transport and turbulence closure were selected according to the highest rate of accuracy in this regard by considering r2 hw values all models have great accuracy in predicting the dam break free surface height however the accuracy of the models in the evaluation of the bed deformations is considerably changed by the number of mesh cells while the greatest r2 hs values are observed in cases nc2 sc2 and fc2 d0 2 5 cm therefore in the present study all the simulations were carried out in mesh cells mean diameter equal to d0 2 5 cm 4 numerical results according to fig 8 and 9 the dam break flow snapshots are presented for sequent instants of 0 2 s to 1 8 s with the time step of 0 2 s as clearly seen in fig 8 the evolution of free surface profile wave front advancing distance as well as bed deformations are consistently comparable to the experimental results shown in fig 3 in both numerical and experimental outputs formation and development of sheet flow under the wave front region especially near field at the initial stages i e t 0 2 1 0 s were observed further the maximum increase in bed level due to sediment deposit was seen in this zone in fact the interaction between the wave front and the moveable bed resulted in a slight upward movement of wave front due to bed resistance force further this resistance force led to the formation of convex curvature at the leading tip of the wave front as well as the formation of the anti dune bed form in the near filed these findings were in consonance with data of spinewine and zech 2007 and spinewine and capart 2013 overcoming the flow shear force to the bed shear resistance resulted in a di considerable local scouring in the near field however bed sediment within the reservoir as well as the bed sediments at downstream far field showed no variation flow shear force was produced because of the intense velocity gradient during the early stages of the dam break process nonetheless overcoming the vertical current accelerations during the early stages in the near field led to slipping and upward jumping of sedimentary particles as well as intense scouring rate while by progressing the wave front in downstream sedimentation happened under wave front in far field these results were in agreement with the data of wu and wang 2008 and cao et al 2004 however the effect of bed compaction was not considered in previous studies in fig 8 predictably the most hydrostatic pressure red color was applied to the bottom of the reservoir however the hydrostatic pressure decreased with decreasing the flow depth and the lowest values were observed in the free water level at very early moments the hydrostatic pressure assumption was not very accurate due to the prevalence of vertical flow accelerations however in the present study the flow was modeled three dimensionally therefore free flow flow simulations at all moments of dam break had the desired accuracy note that the numerical model was limited in providing hydrodynamic pressure values at very early moments of the dam break process on the other hand small values of negative pressure were observed at the top of the wave front and tip region this negative pressure was due to the high velocity of the flow in the wave front area which caused a slight loss of kinetic energy of the wave front maximum pressure pmax 2354 pa the free surface profile the same as the experimental result was uniform through the reservoir however over time the curvature of the profile increased especially in the near field further the bulge of free surface profile in the near field i e x 5 6 m separated the progressive wave front zone from the flow development area within the reservoir similar findings were reported by vosoughi et al 2020 for dam break flow over rough bed fig 9 depicts the air entrainment in the leading edge of the wave front the formation of white capping at the leading edge of the wave front induced by air entrainment also was observed in experimental outputs fig 3 the air entrainment happened due to the formation of circular flow through the leading face of wave front which increased by progressing the wave front toward downstream interaction between the flow and sediment particles resulted in the generation of eddies at the interface of flow and sediment bed enhancing the air entrainment process similar findings were reported by bahmanpouri 2019 for air entrainment in hydraulic jumps on rough bed the void fraction at the wave front zone increased over time and reached the maximum magnitude at the time of t 1 2 1 4 s note that iso surface density of air bubbles was observed at the zone of wave front where the velocity was the maximum lubin et al 2006 and felder and chanson 2018 reported that air entrainment to flow resulted in remarkable energy dissipation they reasoned that the drag force of air bubbles together with the bed resistance force led to increasing the rate of energy dissipation herein further the accidental contact of bubbles with each other and with sediment particles enhanced the process of suspended sediment transport a for the during of t 0 1 s for every 0 2 s b for the during of t 1 s 2 s for every 0 2 s figs 10 12 show the comparison of numerical modeling and experimental results for three bed compaction rates i e nc sc and fc respectively the data are presented for two instants times 0 4 and 0 8 s the sediment scouring model is sensitive to the various turbulence schemes as the turbulence model directly affects the viscosity needed to compute the local shear stress the latter is used to calculate the rates of entrainment and bed load erosion brethour and burnham 2010 in order to assess the strength of numerical simulation it was decided to represent the best fitted results out of 81 possible outputs considering three bed compaction rates three turbulence schemes three sediment transport models for three different time instants based on minimum root mean square difference rmse between the experimental data and predictions regarding the variation of bed level the results presented in figs 10 12 show that except for t 0 4 s for non compacted bed condition all turbulence schemes were in good agreement with experimental data for all bed compaction rates interestingly the predicted shape of scouring downstream of the gate agreed quite well with the experimental data no significant difference was observed between different types of turbulent schemes and experimental data the results highlighted the potential of each sediment transport model together with the chosen turbulent scheme to simulate the scouring process in terms of variation of water surface profile the accuracy of the turbulent scheme increased with increasing the bed compaction rate for non compacted bed condition it was believed that the higher rate of erosion resulted in the higher rate of mixing bed load and fluid flow which led to a more complicated two phase flow in case of the non compacted bed bed particles were easily separated from the bed and suspended into the flow led to mixed two phase flow such a mechanism was already reported by spinewine and zech 2002 2004 for dam break flow over pvc bed and bahmanpouri et al 2013a bahmanpouri et al 2013b for movable gravel bed at the initial stage of model simulation small magnitude oscillations were observed at the wave front because of the steep gradient of water level caused by the sudden gate removal as pointed out by carrivick et al 2011 and xia et al 2010 yang et al 2010 based upon 2 d numerical simulation of dam break flow stated that near the wave front the vertical pressure distribution was non hydrostatic due to the rapid change of water depth and this type of oscillations disappeared as the wave front moved forward technically it was not applicable to employ various turbulence and bed load models to predict water surface profile and bed level from an engineering point of view it was more applicable to propose an ideal unique combination of bed load models and turbulence closures for prediction of water surface profile and sediment bed level to do so for each compaction rate values for the coefficientofdetermination r2 and root mean square error rmse were calculated for all possible bed load turbulence scheme pairs the pairs possessing maximum average on r2 and minimum average on rmses over time were selected as the best prediction method for each type of bed compaction rate table 5 it is worth highlighting that max time averaged r2 and min time averaged rmse for sediment bed level and water surface respectively occurred in the same pair of bed load turbulence scheme representing a consistent response of sediment and water to the selected methods as soares frazão et al 2012 estimated experimental accuracy in terms of values of maximum r2 and minimum rmse the combined methods of k ω and meyer peter muller rng and nielson and k ɛ and meyer peter muller were suggested to simulate water surface profile and bed level for non compacted semi compacted and fully compacted bed configurations respectively comparisons between numerical and physical modelling along with relevant determination coefficient for variation of bed level and water surface profile are depicted in figs 13 and 14 respectively it was worth saying that both turbulence and bed load models were developed based upon phenomenological relationships which included some empirical coefficients it was believed that for each bed compaction rate a couple of turbulence and bed load models which showed the best result had more compatible empirical coefficients with flow condition that affected by the bed compaction rate note that on one hand considering the bed load transport equations different values of the local shields parameter θ i and the empirical coefficient β i strongly affected the simulations results table 6 lists the empirical coefficients employed in numerical modeling of dam break over sc nc and fc beds while on the other hand considering the water surface profile three schemes of turbulence mainly affected by the different convection and diffusion coefficients herein based upon different scenarios it was tried to find the best combination of sediment transport equation and turbulent scheme which resulted in the most accurate simulation in the k ω formulation turbulent diffusion terms were proportional to ρk ω rather than to the eddy viscosity wilcox 2008 in other words since in the non compacted bed condition the eddy viscosity was associated with larger magnitudes k ω turbulent scheme resulted in more accurate simulation the rng model was derived using a rigorous statistical technique called renormalization group theory it was similar in form to the standard k ɛ model but included the following refinements the rng model had an additional term in itsɛequation that significantly improves the accuracy for rapidly strained flows such as for semi compacted bed condition the k ε model focused on the mechanisms that had an impact on the turbulent kinetic energy the basic assumption of this model was that the turbulent viscosity wasisotropic that is in all directions the ratio betweenreynolds stressand meanrate of deformationswas the same 5 conclusions the current study scrutinized some characteristics of dam break flow sediment transport and morphological evolution over an erodible bed both experimentally and numerically the novelty of the study lied in the evaluation of the bed compaction effect upon dam break flow which was performed for three different bed compaction rates as non semi and fully compacted bed configurations respectively experiments were conducted in a flume with a thin vertical gate in the middle of the flume which was specially designed for the dam break process the case of the horizontal plane bed with three different compaction rates was considered in this connection three different turbulence schemes standard and rng k ɛ and k ω and three well known bed load sediment transport approaches van rijn meyer peter muller and nielson were applied comparison of the water surface in the initial stages of dam break flow showed a contracted profile in nc beds compared to a relatively smooth surface in fc sediments implying faster water propagation with increasing bed compaction although the water profiles on all bed types were approximately similar to each other in the next stages of propagation the celerity of the water jet tips on the fc beds was always greater consistently abrupt water motions and turbulence during the early stages of dam break brought about more erosion deposition in nc than fc beds specifically due to the looser and more unstable nature of nc sediments such processes were successfully reproduced by a numerical model in which the standard volume of fluid vof technique along with eddy viscosity turbulence models based and well known established relationships for sediment bed loads were employed to capture the overall characterization of sediment water interactions however the efficiency and accuracy of these models to estimate erosion and deposition rate varied depending on the degree of compaction of the bed sediments furthermore statistical analysis showed that the best agreement with the results and laboratory measurements for each compaction rate depends on choosing a particular pair of turbulence bed load models the various dissipation rates and turbulent kinetic energy of each turbulence model led to the computation of the different flow velocity directly contributing to calculate the local shear stress of the bottom accordingly the combination of a bed load transport model and a turbulence closure reflected different impacts on beds with different compactness the analyses revealed that the highest correlation between numerical and laboratory results in the quantification of sediment scouring and deposition on nc beds was achieved when the k ω turbulence model and the meyer peter and muller 1948 bedload model were simultaneously applied in the simulations similarly the best agreement for sc and fc beds was respectively obtained when rng and nielsen 1992 and k ɛ and meyer peter and muller 1948 were paired together also as far as free surfaces were concerned the results showed that the performance of all turbulence models was always satisfactory with the minimum value of r2 was 0 89 and the maximum value was 0 97 however in general the highest correlation was mostly obtained for fc beds the present study has some major implications for hydrologic and hydraulic engineering design since in natural channels almost all flood flows are hydraulically rough besides the results also are completely helpful in evaluating the losses of property which exacerbated by sediment transport through the dam break flood accordingly they could be definitely fruitful in flood mitigation and control programing or the flood hazard analysis credit authorship contribution statement farhad bahmanpouri conceptualization investigation methodology formal analysis writing original

respectively calculated separately for each bed compaction rate turbulence model and bed load model used in the simulations at 0 8s statistical parameters for the bed profiles suggested a relative superiority of performance of the k ε turbulence models in all bed load models particularly for non compacted beds the rng model however performed slightly better than its corresponding standard turbulence closure a specific turbulence model was adopted which here was the rng model according to its better efficiency the results showed that the best agreement with the laboratory measurements for the nc beds was given by the meyer peter model while for the sc and fc beds by the nielsen model on the other hand water profiles in nearly all bed loads and turbulence models were reproduced very well and the results did not show a significant difference between the models employed overall it could however be argued that k ε turbulence models standard and rng let to better results than k ω

turbulent kinetic energy defined as k u i u i 2 and ν t is the eddy viscosity a lot of turbulence models for ν t and k have been developed each with diﬀerent model assumptions that are empirically designed to be consistent with speciﬁc types of flow in the eddy viscosity model the turbulent energy k is an essential parameter to determine ν t however there are arbitrary choices for the additional parameter s for ν t the turbulence models used in the present study are summarized in the following the volume of fluid vof technique hirt and nichols 1981 is used for free surface tracking in which as eulerian approach the normalized density at the fixed location e g cell center is tracked by solving the transport equation of the vof function i e 4 f t u i f i x i 0 where f is defined as the volume fraction of the fluid in the cell control volume which is equivalent to the normalized by liquid density mean density of the liquid air mixture in the cell note that f 1 in liquid f 0 in air and 0 f 1 on the free surface therefore with the updated information of f in all computational cells the free surface geometry can be approximated and reconstructed it should be noted that the volume of fluid vof approach with high level accuracy and negligible mass loss in comparison with the numerical methods can be used to simulate the dam break free surface hirt and nichols 1981 yang et al 2018 li et al 2019 khoshkonesh et al 2019 li and yu 2019 sun et al 2019 the turbulent closure models standard k ε and rng the k ε turbulence closure model is the most common model used in the computational fluid dynamics cfd to model the average flow characteristics for turbulent flow conditions in this model the general behavior of turbulent fluid is parameterized by the energy

this set of coefficients is often called the standard k ε turbulence model yakhot et al 1992 re derived the ε equation using the renormalized group rng theory one new term was introduced to take into account the highly anisotropic features of turbulence usually associated with regions of large shear and to modify the viscosity accordingly it can be included in the coefﬁcient c ε 1 1 42 η 1 η η 0 1

aforementioned k ε turbulence models another frequently used model is the k ω turbulence model established by wilcox 1993 by replacing the length scale with the specific dissipation rate ω because ω is related to ε by ω ε β k with β 0 09 the k ω model is similar to the standard k ε model with different coefficients the respective turbulence energy k and the speciﬁc dissipation rate ω are expressed in generic form as follows 8 ρ k t ρ u i k x i x i ν t σ k k x i p k ρ β k ω 9 ρ ω t ρ u i ω x i x i ν t σ ω ω x i ω k α p k β ρ k 2 ω where σ k 2 σ ω 2 β 0 075 and α 0 555 sediment scour model the sediment scouring model estimates the motion of sediment by predicting the erosion advection and deposition of sediment in computations of the current study this is done by considering two states in which sediment can exist suspended and packed sediment suspended sediment is typical of low concentration and advected with fluid flow suspended sediment is transported by advection along with the fluid the generic transport equation for each sediment is written as follows 10 c s t u c s 0 where c s is the concentration of the suspended sediment in units of mass per unit volume and u is the mean velocity of the fluid sediment mixture the momentum balances for each sediment species and the fluid sediment mixture can be written as follows 11 u s t u u s 1 ρ s p f k d f s ρ s u r 14 u t u u 1 ρ p f here u s is the velocity of sediment ρ s is the density of the sediment material f s is the volume fraction of sediment p is the pressure k d is the drag function f includes the body and viscous forces ρ is the density of the fluid sediment mixture and u r u s u f is the relative velocity where u f is fluid velocity furthermore sediment is entrained by the picking up and re suspension of packed sediment due to shearing and small eddies at the packed sediment interface the model used in flow 3d is based on mastbergen and von den berg 2003 in calculating the sediment threshold of motion in fluid flow the shields number is employed as the main criterion the criterion is indeed based on evaluating the driving forces induced by the flowing fluid and the retention forces caused by submerged particles weight in this direction the particles start motion while the shields number value is higher than the critical value dey 2014 the first step for computing the critical shields number is calculating the dimensionless parameter d d 50 ρ ρ s ρ g μ 2 3 where d 50 ρ and μ represent median grain diameter water density and water viscosity respectively from d the dimensionless critical shields parameter θ cr 0 3 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 exp 0 02 d is computed using the soulsby whitehouse equation soulsby 1997 the local shields number is computed based on the local shear stress τ where τ is calculated using the law of the wall and the quadratic law of bottom shear stress for 3d turbulent flow and shallow water turbulent flow respectively with consideration of bed surface roughness flow 3d assumes that the nikuradse roughness of the bed surface k s is proportional to the local median grain diameter in packed sediment d 50 i e k s c rough d 50 where c rough 1 is used as a default value the entrainment lift velocity of sediment is then computed using to compute the amount of packed sediment that is converted into suspended sediment effectively acting as a mass source of suspended sediment at the packed bed interface bed load transport is the sediment transport due to rolling or bouncing over the surface of the packed bed of sediment because it is not possible to compute the flow dynamics about each individual grain of sediment and it is oftentimes difficult to compute the boundary layer at the interface an empirical model must be used in this research study for bed load transport the existing meyer peter model 1948 has been complemented by two more empirical approximations fromvan rijn 1984 and nielsen 1992 to expand the range of applicability of the sediment transport model induced by dam break these models predict the volumetric flow of sediment per unit width over the surface of the packed bed 12 m e y e r p e t e r a n d m

b i φ i g ρ s ρ ρ d 50 0 5 meyer peter and müller formula was verified for uniform coarser grains focusing on the alpine flows in switzerland nielsen 1992 suggested replacing the factor 8 in the meyer peter and müller 1948 formula by 12 this later value is proper for high shear stress conditions shields number larger than 1 and permits to take into account the suspended load campisano et al 2004a 2004b in the case of the van rijn formula the benchmark flume tests and experimental data for calibration and validation were carried out with finer bed materials thus based on the morphodynamic features of these measurements the recommended application range of the formula is limited only for sand 2 mm fractions the bed load coefficient is practically used to control the rate at which bed load transport occurs at given shear stress higher than the critical shear stress in order to take the uncertainties and different experimental conditions into the account the value of bed load coefficient is adjustable in the original equations accordingly for meyer peter and mueller equations ribberink 1998 and fernandez luque and van beek 1976 have suggested values ranging from 5 0 for low transport to 13 0 for high sand transport or zech et al 2008 used the meyer peter and mueller formula multiplied by a factor of 4 i e the factor 8 in the original formula is replaced by 32 in 1d numerical modeling of dam break waves over movable beds here in this study the best agreement with the experimental results was given by a factor of 3 after much trial and error hence in flow 3d the bed load coefficients β mpm i β nie i and β vr i were replaced by 24 36 and 1 59 respectively it is worth noticing that although the bed compaction rate cannot be defined explicitly in the calculations this factor can however be regulated by a parameter called the maximum packed fraction embedded in the package the maximum packing fraction fb which is equal to fb 1 ϕ is the fraction of sediment at which the cell becomes packed and the drag function in the cell goes to infinity no flow 
4903,disastrous floods result in severe loss of human lives and intense destruction to the infrastructure and economic activities furthermore it leads to environmental and ecological damages located at the downstream area of the dam the present study aims at investigating experimentally and numerically the sediment transport and morphological evolution of the erodible bed induced by dam break flows experimental runs were conducted in a flume specially designed for dam break flow process equipped with a thin vertical gate at its middle based upon an initial plane bed the effect of three different compaction rates of the bed at both up and downstream of the dam was investigated the experimental data consistently suggested that increasing the bed compaction rate resulted in decreasing the scouring and sedimentation depth as well as the sediment transport rate further increasing the bed compaction rate led to increasing the wave front celerity reducing the scouring rate and the erosion depth both the experimental and numerical outputs highlighted the process of air entrainment at the leading edge of the wave front the numerical results showed that the maximum void fraction was associated with the maximum flow velocity at the zone of wave front comparisons were made between the experimental results and those are provided from a numerical study using standard volume of fluid vof method where three different turbulence closure schemes rng k ε and k ω and three bed load sediment transport approaches van rijn meyer peter muller and nielson were applied accordingly by considering the error values in predicting the free surface height and the bed deformation the k ω closure model showed the highest accuracy in capturing the turbulence features while the mayer peter muller formula had the highest performance in predicting the bed deformation in non compacted nc bed besides the rng closure model and nielsen bed load formula revealed the highest accuracy in predicting the aforementioned features in a semi compacted sc bed the k ɛ closure model and mayer peter muller formula showed the highest accuracy in reproducing the turbulence characteristics and bed profile in a fully compacted fc bed keywords dam break bed compaction experimental study numerical modeling vof 1 introduction the catastrophic flood induced by dam failure may lead to significant morphological changes including erosion in the downstream near field the bed load transport to the downstream and sedimentation in the far field cao et al 2004 wu and wang 2008 while it causes many losses of life and property in the downstream residential or industrial areas the dam failure may also result in some serious environmental issues such as releasing heavy metals into the surrounding environment especially in tailing dam failure zhiquan et al 2015 this kind of morphological change could strongly affect the maximum water level and arrival time of the wave front the consequence assessment of the dam break process begins by gathering information about the dam and determining the dam failure scenario the rate of bed compaction downstream of the dam is a key parameter that substantially affects the morpho dynamic process in the downstream area indeed the geomorphic dam break flow leads to severe bed erosion and sediment transport to the downstream while it resulting in much deformation of the river bed and its beaches accordingly the volume of sediment total load released by the dam break flow mayfrom the same order of water volume within the reservoir while the morphological changes affect the dam break wave evolution advancing distance or the travel time values soares frazão et al 2007 this kind of morphological change could strongly affect the maximum water level and arrival time of the dam break wave front the propagation of dam break flow over the fixed and erodible beds was experimentally evaluated by lauber and hager 1998 vischer and hager 1998 capart and young 1998 capart 2000 spinewine and zech 2002 spinewine and zech 2004 spinewine and zech 2007 leal et al 2006 2009 carrivick et al 2011 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2010 soares frazão et al 2007 park et al 2012 spinewine and capart 2013 di cristo et al 2017 and vosoughi et al 2020 capart and young 1998 and capart 2000 experimentally evaluated the shock feature related to the scouring of a horizontal granular bed caused by a dam break wave the results showed that the subsequent hydraulic jumps are generated in the downstream channel the reason for this phenomenon was the bed resistance effects against the free surface evolution subsequently spinewine and zech 2002 spinewine and zech 2004 spinewine and zech 2007 spinewine and capart 2013 conducted some small scale dam break over loose granular beds in this connection they used different bed materials it was specified that the sheet flow thickness and the deposition are increased in the far field di cristo et al 2017 evaluated the dam break wave propagation over an erodible embankment both experimentally and numerically using a two phase depth integrated model further the sediment transport processes under different flow conditions including the steady and unsteady flows were specifically investigated by fernandez luque and van beek 1976 meyer peter and muller 1948 van rijn 1981 van rijn 1984 nielsen 1992 and ribberink 1988 in terms of computational methods the shallow water equations swe could not predict the vertical flow acceleration the non hydrostatic pressure distribution or formation of the cross flows specifically in the near field at the very initial stage accordingly the process of wave breaking and turbulent variation are predominant and the development of a boundary layer at the bottom influences significantly the shear imparted to the mobile bed besides the three dimensional flow features are locally predominant over the scour holes complex geometry and the downstream wall campisano et al 2004 2004b spinewine and zech 2007 zech et al 2008 soares frazão et al 2007 bahmanpouri et al 2013a 2013b spinewine and capart 2013 in stark contrast the three dimensional models based on the navier stokes equations do not have the aforementioned disadvantages yang et al 2010 xia et al 2010 haddadian et al 2014 issakhov et al 2018 li and yu 2019 the review of the literature including above mentioned highlighted that the bed compaction rate as an independent variable has a significant effect on the dam break free surface evolution and the bed deformation this issue has received little attention which has a great effect on the river morphological process indeed based on the author s knowledge the effect of bed compaction rate as an independent variable on free surface evolution and the erodible bed deformation has not been evaluated in the literature therefore the present study aims to examine the various bed compaction rates that influence the dam break wave evolution over erodible bed based upon both experimental and numerical modeling further the various turbulence closure models and the bed load formula performance was compared in predicting the free surface and bed deformation it is worth noting that the bed load transport formula has been successfully employed in predicting the dam break morpho dynamic characteristics by cao et al 2004 wu and wang 2008 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2010 di cristo et al 2006 while according to these studies the bed load formula performance in capturing the bed deformation is dependent on the sediment physical characteristics and the experimental configuration the findings of the present study would be of great interest in the design of oceans and civil engineering as well as in river and coastal engineering flood hazard analysis in other words the present results are applicable for local officials and dam operators to consider any necessary actions or plans e g emergency operation plan and local hazard mitigation plan 2 methodology experimental runsconductedin a laboratory flume equipped with a rapidup wardmoving of a vertical sluice gate in the middle of the flume aguillotine type mechanism comprising the cable and a 30 kg weight while the initial plane bed test case with three different compaction rates was evaluated afterward numerical modeling of the dam break over movablebeds considering the different compaction rates was carried out employing a cfd commercial package the model has been recently employed by buccino et al 2019a buccino et al 2019b to investigate the failure mechanism of heavily overtopped structures in a highly turbulent two phase flow condition and by khoshkonesh et al 2019 and yang et al 2018 in evaluating the dam break flow propagation over the fixed beds the authors reported considerable agreement between the numerical and the experimental results however in the current study the efficiency of the model is examined in predicting the dam break flow characteristics over the erodible bed in this approach the model is comprising two parts as a clear water model and b scouring and sediment transport in the scouring model entrained sediment and packed bed considered as two concentration fields in evaluating the particle entrainment in water flow the sediment flux equations coupled with clear water equations besides the bed load formulas are separately tackled to estimate the volume of sediment transport as bed load flow science 2012 in this connection the experimental setup is addressed then the description of numerical simulation is provided and ultimately the outputs of numerical modeling are compared with the experimental data 2 1 experimental set up the experiments of dam break over mobile bed were carried out at hydraulic laboratory of civil engineering department university of tehran the flume was 5 m long 0 16 m wide and about 0 4 m high which was specifically designed for the dam break experiments fig 1 the laboratory flume of present study previously employed by bahmanpouri et al 2013a bahmanpouri et al 2013b and haddadian et al 2014 for the experimental study of dam break flow over both movable and smoothed bed configurations as indicated in fig 1 the dam break process was represented by a rapid upward movement of the thin vertical sluice gate in the middle of the flume the plastic gate was 10 mm thick and fitted on its circumference with a hollow pvc seal subsequently a 30 kg weight provided the acceleration for the upward lifting of the gate guided by a system of roller bearings while the gate opening time in the order of 0 1 s was achieved over the full nominal height of 40 cm in order to completely removing the gate from the flume the dam break process was considered as instantaneous if the sluice gate removed from the domain during tr 2hu0 g or tr 1 25 hu0 g respectively lauber and hager 1998 vischer and hager 1998 where tr denotes the removing time hu0 presents the upstream water level and g presents the gravity acceleration g 9 81 m s 2 for all dam break experiments the reservoir still water depth hu was equal to 0 23 m while the greatest removing time trmax was approximately equal to 0 22 s therefore the first instantaneous dam break condition was fulfilled in this study trmax 0 22 s 2hu0 g accordingly a 50 mm thick non uniform coarse sand layer was appended onto the flume fixed bed following the procedure applied by spinewine and zech 2007 and spinewine and capart 2013 as illustrated in fig 1 the saturated sediment layer embodied throughout the flume length the bed material was composed of non uniform coarse sand with a median diameter d50 2 5 mm dry density ρd 1650 kg m 3 saturated density ρs 1820 kg m 3 and a friction angle φ 33 as estimated from the critical angle of repose of a dry granular heap and negligible cohesion table 1 the dispersion of the particle s diameter is according to fig 2 the parameter values are summarized in table 1 table 1 displays three types of beds with different compactness namely non compacted nc semi compacted sc and fully compacted fc along with corresponding physical characteristics of compaction rates cs sediment saturated density ρs and porosity ϕ further the amounts of sediment saturated density ρs for various compaction rates as well as corresponding porosity ϕ are shown in table 1 these magnitudes used to calculate the total load transport qs in numerical modeling it should be pointed out that during an experiment it was impossible to follow the scour and deposition processes therefore for the experimental runs the total amount of bed material transported due to the dam break wave was collected at the downstream settlement tank and dried before being measured soares frazão et al 2012 and daghighi et al 2015 have also taken the same procedure for dam flow and tsunami induced sediment transport over mobile beds respectively 2 2 experimental conditions the experimental tests were contained in covering the channel bed by sand material adjusting compacting and profiling them to the desired depth and saturating them through adding water at a slow rate afterward the proctor procedure was used to provide equal bed layers thickness considering three various sediment compaction rates each sediment layer received a number of blows from a standard weighted hammer at a specified height the hammer with 5 kg weight and 10 10 cm2 touch area compacted the bed in the vertical direction in this connection for each run the rates of density and porosity were measured and recorded in the laboratory at the level of 10 saturation of the bed in this connection for each run the rates of density and porosity were measured and recorded in the laboratory at the level of 10 saturation of the bed subsequently the reservoir was filled up with clear water to a specified level hu0 hence the sediment bed within the reservoir was submerged while there was no water on top of sediment across the downstream channel the sediment initial depth hs0 within the reservoir and downstream was the same when the water came to rest and the instrumentation was ready the gate opening was triggered to start the experiment the configurations that were tested in the present work are shown in fig 3 the initial water depth was set to hu0 0 23 m upstream of the gate and zero downstream 2 3 imaging apparatus measurements of the experimental tests were mainly conducted based upon digital imaging through the transparent side wall in this regard high speed cameras were applied to recorded image sequences with the capability of 200 frames per second four side by side synchronized dalsa cad1 ccd cameras were used with sequential steps of 75 cm to cover the whole flume length so that each captured frame was limited to a length of 80 cm along the longitudinal direction of the flume to record images with the resolution of 1024 512 pixels all cameras recorded frames with 8 bit digital output or 256 grey levels the coverage length of the recording was from 0 5 m upstream of the gate to the downstream end of the channel also to reduce light reflection and improve the extracted image quality a black wall surrounded the flume three tests were conducted in order to calibrate the juxtaposing images of cameras before starting the main runs herein the accuracy of the experimental data primarily dependent on water surface profile and bed level determination while the camera resulted in an accuracy of 2 for measuring water surface level the measurement of bed level with ruler introduced uncertainties up to 1 the initial water level upstream of the dam followed visually with an accuracy of 1 2 4 experimental results the main test to demonstrate the flow behavior was first conducted based upon the semi compacted flat bed with 5 cm sand bed material covered both upstream and downstream fig 3 highlights reconstructed flow mosaics at some chosen instants for this test case overall the propagation of the dam break wave front toward downstream resulted in erosion by entraining large amounts of bed sediments in the flow the flatbed indeed presents the condition that elevation of sediment trapped within the dam reservoir is roughly equal to those deposited throughout the downstream channel while the flatbed is considered as the common type of bed for analyzing the dam break flow over mobile bed spinewine and zech 2002 it is worth noting that breaking the dam leads to releasing the reservoir sediment to the downstream while the bed deforms and will be uneven during the flood propagation therefore the flatbed condition was satisfied only before breaking the dam processes including the deformation of the free surface the downstream propagation of the wave and the intense mobilization of bed sediment into the flow were all observed visually through the naked eye based upon observation in fig 3 three flow regions could be detected clearly a pure water layer a sediment transport layer composed of a mixture of water and moving grains and the motionless sediment bed such flow regions were separated by fairly sharp interfaces which could be defined with a semi automated imaging technique on the mounted digital mosaics fig 4 on the one side the interfaces between air and water and on the other between water and moving grains displayed a high contrast and were located without uncertainty fig 4b on the contrary the interface between moveable and immobile grains was more complex and subject to interpretation the procedure for interface detection was as follows first the moving region is highlighted on a differentiated image generated by subtracting the image from the previous image and taking the absolute value on the resulting image the fixed bed appears dark while the moving layer of grains appears brighter the interface position is then specified using the same method as with the other two interfaces capart 2000 spinewine and zech 2007 in fig 5 the snapshots of the dam break flow evolution and the bed deformation are shown in distorted real coordinates it was not possible to extract the snapshots from water and bed fluctuations because of considerable turbulence intensity during the very initial stage t 0 2 s considering the free surface curvature before and after the dam place itwas observedthat the dam break flow followeda transition fromupstreamsubcriticalflow to the downstream supercritical regime indeed the free surface profile uniformly descended within the dam reservoir while it had a steep slope and notablyfluctuatesacross the downstream channel accordingly the flow wassubcriticaland supercritical inside the dam reservoir and the downstream channel respectively increasing the bed compaction rate led to increasing the wave front celerity reducing the scouring rate and the erosion depth fig 5 and table 2 generally regardless of compaction rate over a first time window the front celerity observed almost constant and consequently decreased slightly highlighting that the gradual transition from the inertial and equilibrium phases to the viscous phase as bed friction resulted in the deceleration of the wave front the similar results were reported by park et al 2012 and yang et al 2018 for dam break flow over smooth bed spinewine and zech 2007 zech et al 2008 and spinewine and capart 2013 for dam break propagation over the sand and pvc beds and bahmanpouri et al 2013a bahmanpouri et al 2013b for the propagation of wave front induced by dam break over sandy bed each dam break test was repeated three times so the values presented in table 2 were averaged magnitudes further the wave front celerity is displayed in fig 6 results are plotted for all three cases and compared to the ritter 1892 solution uwf 2 ghu0 the combined effects of scouring and bed friction led to a notable deceleration of the progressive wave front celerity as compared to the ritter solution the experimental data highlighted that the wave front celerity decreased with increasing the mobility of the bed material this finding was in agreement with the observation reported by leal et al 2006 2009 for dam break flow on different bet types including sand pumice and pvc bed further wu and wang 2008 and capart and young 1998 and capart 2000 similarly addressed that increasing the sediment coefficient led to decreasing wave propagation and consequently the rate of erosion as seen the wave front celerity was constant and then decreased slightly revealing the progressive transition from inertial to viscous phases since the bed friction resulted in a deceleration of the wave front 3 numerical modeling computational fluid dynamic cfd codes solve the differential reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in the fluid domain retaining the reference quantity in the three directions for each control volume identified park et al 2012 issakhov et al 2018 khoshkonesh et al 2019 herein the vof method was employed in modeling the dam break flow hirt and nichols 1981 while the turbulence features were captured through turbulence closure models including standard k ɛ rng jones and launder 1972 yakhot et al 1992 and k ω wilcox 1993 three bed load transport formulas including van rijn 1984 meyer peter and muller 1948 as well as nielsen 1992 were applied to predict the sediment transport processes mastbergen and von den berg 2003 all simulations were conducted using the flow 3d cfd package flow science 2012 3 1 meshing domain initial and boundary conditions thus it is essential to minimize the number of cells while including enough resolution to capture the significant features of the geometry in addition to enough flow specification a fine mesh size also provides a proper representation of rapid changes in the solution however it may lead to an increase in the numerical diffusion due to the discretization of the momentum equations since the momentum residuals and computational efforts increase by raising the mesh resolution khoshkonesh et al 2019 the computational domain extends by 2 m and 3 m away from the gate toward the ends of the flume and 0 34 m in the vertical direction the depth of the water was fixed at 0 23 m and the thickness of packed sediment was set 0 05 m for all the tests all simulations were performed on a single mesh block with uniform cells after multiple checks the mesh size of 0 025 mobtainedas theoptimalsize of all cells indeed the results of multiple checks on mesh resolution and closure models considering the error values as an accuracy criterionhave been presentedin tables 3 and 4 this thechoiceis also consistent withthe assumption ofthe sediment s grain sizeshouldkeep below 10 percent of the mesh cell size flow science 2012 table 5 the boundary conditions of the simulations were derived from the physical model defined as follows the flume bed lateral walls and the left wall beginning point all are the no slip boundary condition while the right side endpoint of the flume is an outlet condition the top of the domain is considered as a free slip condition in which the tangential shear stresses are equal to zero in this boundary further a hydrostatic pressure equivalent to water column height defined in the dam place as a boundary condition accordingly the fraction of fluid f is equal to the unit in the reservoir which considered as an initial condition fig 7 shows meshing details the dimension of cells covering the whole computational domain and boundaries 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the mesh resolution the sensitivity analysis of the mesh resolution was conducted for all bed compaction rates all simulations were conducted using an intel i7 3 6 ghz processor by 8 threads table 3 describes the details of the sensitivity analysis for each run the maximum number of iterations nmi processing time tp and processing time for every thread td showed a direct relationship with the total number of mesh cells nt in all cases however there was not a specified relationship between the aforementioned parameters and the compaction rate the minimum processing time for every cell tc was about 1 2 s while tcmin value was over half of the dam break total time tt furthermore the maximum processing time tpmax for about 170 000 cells was equal to 450 s hence the model showed an acceptable performance in predicting the dam break flow free surface evolution and the bed deformation in terms of the computational efforts based on the data presented in table 4 the bed load transport and turbulence closure were selected according to the highest rate of accuracy in this regard by considering r2 hw values all models have great accuracy in predicting the dam break free surface height however the accuracy of the models in the evaluation of the bed deformations is considerably changed by the number of mesh cells while the greatest r2 hs values are observed in cases nc2 sc2 and fc2 d0 2 5 cm therefore in the present study all the simulations were carried out in mesh cells mean diameter equal to d0 2 5 cm 4 numerical results according to fig 8 and 9 the dam break flow snapshots are presented for sequent instants of 0 2 s to 1 8 s with the time step of 0 2 s as clearly seen in fig 8 the evolution of free surface profile wave front advancing distance as well as bed deformations are consistently comparable to the experimental results shown in fig 3 in both numerical and experimental outputs formation and development of sheet flow under the wave front region especially near field at the initial stages i e t 0 2 1 0 s were observed further the maximum increase in bed level due to sediment deposit was seen in this zone in fact the interaction between the wave front and the moveable bed resulted in a slight upward movement of wave front due to bed resistance force further this resistance force led to the formation of convex curvature at the leading tip of the wave front as well as the formation of the anti dune bed form in the near filed these findings were in consonance with data of spinewine and zech 2007 and spinewine and capart 2013 overcoming the flow shear force to the bed shear resistance resulted in a di considerable local scouring in the near field however bed sediment within the reservoir as well as the bed sediments at downstream far field showed no variation flow shear force was produced because of the intense velocity gradient during the early stages of the dam break process nonetheless overcoming the vertical current accelerations during the early stages in the near field led to slipping and upward jumping of sedimentary particles as well as intense scouring rate while by progressing the wave front in downstream sedimentation happened under wave front in far field these results were in agreement with the data of wu and wang 2008 and cao et al 2004 however the effect of bed compaction was not considered in previous studies in fig 8 predictably the most hydrostatic pressure red color was applied to the bottom of the reservoir however the hydrostatic pressure decreased with decreasing the flow depth and the lowest values were observed in the free water level at very early moments the hydrostatic pressure assumption was not very accurate due to the prevalence of vertical flow accelerations however in the present study the flow was modeled three dimensionally therefore free flow flow simulations at all moments of dam break had the desired accuracy note that the numerical model was limited in providing hydrodynamic pressure values at very early moments of the dam break process on the other hand small values of negative pressure were observed at the top of the wave front and tip region this negative pressure was due to the high velocity of the flow in the wave front area which caused a slight loss of kinetic energy of the wave front maximum pressure pmax 2354 pa the free surface profile the same as the experimental result was uniform through the reservoir however over time the curvature of the profile increased especially in the near field further the bulge of free surface profile in the near field i e x 5 6 m separated the progressive wave front zone from the flow development area within the reservoir similar findings were reported by vosoughi et al 2020 for dam break flow over rough bed fig 9 depicts the air entrainment in the leading edge of the wave front the formation of white capping at the leading edge of the wave front induced by air entrainment also was observed in experimental outputs fig 3 the air entrainment happened due to the formation of circular flow through the leading face of wave front which increased by progressing the wave front toward downstream interaction between the flow and sediment particles resulted in the generation of eddies at the interface of flow and sediment bed enhancing the air entrainment process similar findings were reported by bahmanpouri 2019 for air entrainment in hydraulic jumps on rough bed the void fraction at the wave front zone increased over time and reached the maximum magnitude at the time of t 1 2 1 4 s note that iso surface density of air bubbles was observed at the zone of wave front where the velocity was the maximum lubin et al 2006 and felder and chanson 2018 reported that air entrainment to flow resulted in remarkable energy dissipation they reasoned that the drag force of air bubbles together with the bed resistance force led to increasing the rate of energy dissipation herein further the accidental contact of bubbles with each other and with sediment particles enhanced the process of suspended sediment transport a for the during of t 0 1 s for every 0 2 s b for the during of t 1 s 2 s for every 0 2 s figs 10 12 show the comparison of numerical modeling and experimental results for three bed compaction rates i e nc sc and fc respectively the data are presented for two instants times 0 4 and 0 8 s the sediment scouring model is sensitive to the various turbulence schemes as the turbulence model directly affects the viscosity needed to compute the local shear stress the latter is used to calculate the rates of entrainment and bed load erosion brethour and burnham 2010 in order to assess the strength of numerical simulation it was decided to represent the best fitted results out of 81 possible outputs considering three bed compaction rates three turbulence schemes three sediment transport models for three different time instants based on minimum root mean square difference rmse between the experimental data and predictions regarding the variation of bed level the results presented in figs 10 12 show that except for t 0 4 s for non compacted bed condition all turbulence schemes were in good agreement with experimental data for all bed compaction rates interestingly the predicted shape of scouring downstream of the gate agreed quite well with the experimental data no significant difference was observed between different types of turbulent schemes and experimental data the results highlighted the potential of each sediment transport model together with the chosen turbulent scheme to simulate the scouring process in terms of variation of water surface profile the accuracy of the turbulent scheme increased with increasing the bed compaction rate for non compacted bed condition it was believed that the higher rate of erosion resulted in the higher rate of mixing bed load and fluid flow which led to a more complicated two phase flow in case of the non compacted bed bed particles were easily separated from the bed and suspended into the flow led to mixed two phase flow such a mechanism was already reported by spinewine and zech 2002 2004 for dam break flow over pvc bed and bahmanpouri et al 2013a bahmanpouri et al 2013b for movable gravel bed at the initial stage of model simulation small magnitude oscillations were observed at the wave front because of the steep gradient of water level caused by the sudden gate removal as pointed out by carrivick et al 2011 and xia et al 2010 yang et al 2010 based upon 2 d numerical simulation of dam break flow stated that near the wave front the vertical pressure distribution was non hydrostatic due to the rapid change of water depth and this type of oscillations disappeared as the wave front moved forward technically it was not applicable to employ various turbulence and bed load models to predict water surface profile and bed level from an engineering point of view it was more applicable to propose an ideal unique combination of bed load models and turbulence closures for prediction of water surface profile and sediment bed level to do so for each compaction rate values for the coefficientofdetermination r2 and root mean square error rmse were calculated for all possible bed load turbulence scheme pairs the pairs possessing maximum average on r2 and minimum average on rmses over time were selected as the best prediction method for each type of bed compaction rate table 5 it is worth highlighting that max time averaged r2 and min time averaged rmse for sediment bed level and water surface respectively occurred in the same pair of bed load turbulence scheme representing a consistent response of sediment and water to the selected methods as soares frazão et al 2012 estimated experimental accuracy in terms of values of maximum r2 and minimum rmse the combined methods of k ω and meyer peter muller rng and nielson and k ɛ and meyer peter muller were suggested to simulate water surface profile and bed level for non compacted semi compacted and fully compacted bed configurations respectively comparisons between numerical and physical modelling along with relevant determination coefficient for variation of bed level and water surface profile are depicted in figs 13 and 14 respectively it was worth saying that both turbulence and bed load models were developed based upon phenomenological relationships which included some empirical coefficients it was believed that for each bed compaction rate a couple of turbulence and bed load models which showed the best result had more compatible empirical coefficients with flow condition that affected by the bed compaction rate note that on one hand considering the bed load transport equations different values of the local shields parameter θ i and the empirical coefficient β i strongly affected the simulations results table 6 lists the empirical coefficients employed in numerical modeling of dam break over sc nc and fc beds while on the other hand considering the water surface profile three schemes of turbulence mainly affected by the different convection and diffusion coefficients herein based upon different scenarios it was tried to find the best combination of sediment transport equation and turbulent scheme which resulted in the most accurate simulation in the k ω formulation turbulent diffusion terms were proportional to ρk ω rather than to the eddy viscosity wilcox 2008 in other words since in the non compacted bed condition the eddy viscosity was associated with larger magnitudes k ω turbulent scheme resulted in more accurate simulation the rng model was derived using a rigorous statistical technique called renormalization group theory it was similar in form to the standard k ɛ model but included the following refinements the rng model had an additional term in itsɛequation that significantly improves the accuracy for rapidly strained flows such as for semi compacted bed condition the k ε model focused on the mechanisms that had an impact on the turbulent kinetic energy the basic assumption of this model was that the turbulent viscosity wasisotropic that is in all directions the ratio betweenreynolds stressand meanrate of deformationswas the same 5 conclusions the current study scrutinized some characteristics of dam break flow sediment transport and morphological evolution over an erodible bed both experimentally and numerically the novelty of the study lied in the evaluation of the bed compaction effect upon dam break flow which was performed for three different bed compaction rates as non semi and fully compacted bed configurations respectively experiments were conducted in a flume with a thin vertical gate in the middle of the flume which was specially designed for the dam break process the case of the horizontal plane bed with three different compaction rates was considered in this connection three different turbulence schemes standard and rng k ɛ and k ω and three well known bed load sediment transport approaches van rijn meyer peter muller and nielson were applied comparison of the water surface in the initial stages of dam break flow showed a contracted profile in nc beds compared to a relatively smooth surface in fc sediments implying faster water propagation with increasing bed compaction although the water profiles on all bed types were approximately similar to each other in the next stages of propagation the celerity of the water jet tips on the fc beds was always greater consistently abrupt water motions and turbulence during the early stages of dam break brought about more erosion deposition in nc than fc beds specifically due to the looser and more unstable nature of nc sediments such processes were successfully reproduced by a numerical model in which the standard volume of fluid vof technique along with eddy viscosity turbulence models based and well known established relationships for sediment bed loads were employed to capture the overall characterization of sediment water interactions however the efficiency and accuracy of these models to estimate erosion and deposition rate varied depending on the degree of compaction of the bed sediments furthermore statistical analysis showed that the best agreement with the results and laboratory measurements for each compaction rate depends on choosing a particular pair of turbulence bed load models the various dissipation rates and turbulent kinetic energy of each turbulence model led to the computation of the different flow velocity directly contributing to calculate the local shear stress of the bottom accordingly the combination of a bed load transport model and a turbulence closure reflected different impacts on beds with different compactness the analyses revealed that the highest correlation between numerical and laboratory results in the quantification of sediment scouring and deposition on nc beds was achieved when the k ω turbulence model and the meyer peter and muller 1948 bedload model were simultaneously applied in the simulations similarly the best agreement for sc and fc beds was respectively obtained when rng and nielsen 1992 and k ɛ and meyer peter and muller 1948 were paired together also as far as free surfaces were concerned the results showed that the performance of all turbulence models was always satisfactory with the minimum value of r2 was 0 89 and the maximum value was 0 97 however in general the highest correlation was mostly obtained for fc beds the present study has some major implications for hydrologic and hydraulic engineering design since in natural channels almost all flood flows are hydraulically rough besides the results also are completely helpful in evaluating the losses of property which exacerbated by sediment transport through the dam break flood accordingly they could be definitely fruitful in flood mitigation and control programing or the flood hazard analysis credit authorship contribution statement farhad bahmanpouri conceptualization investigation methodology formal analysis writing original

respectively calculated separately for each bed compaction rate turbulence model and bed load model used in the simulations at 0 8s statistical parameters for the bed profiles suggested a relative superiority of performance of the k ε turbulence models in all bed load models particularly for non compacted beds the rng model however performed slightly better than its corresponding standard turbulence closure a specific turbulence model was adopted which here was the rng model according to its better efficiency the results showed that the best agreement with the laboratory measurements for the nc beds was given by the meyer peter model while for the sc and fc beds by the nielsen model on the other hand water profiles in nearly all bed loads and turbulence models were reproduced very well and the results did not show a significant difference between the models employed overall it could however be argued that k ε turbulence models standard and rng let to better results than k ω

turbulent kinetic energy defined as k u i u i 2 and ν t is the eddy viscosity a lot of turbulence models for ν t and k have been developed each with diﬀerent model assumptions that are empirically designed to be consistent with speciﬁc types of flow in the eddy viscosity model the turbulent energy k is an essential parameter to determine ν t however there are arbitrary choices for the additional parameter s for ν t the turbulence models used in the present study are summarized in the following the volume of fluid vof technique hirt and nichols 1981 is used for free surface tracking in which as eulerian approach the normalized density at the fixed location e g cell center is tracked by solving the transport equation of the vof function i e 4 f t u i f i x i 0 where f is defined as the volume fraction of the fluid in the cell control volume which is equivalent to the normalized by liquid density mean density of the liquid air mixture in the cell note that f 1 in liquid f 0 in air and 0 f 1 on the free surface therefore with the updated information of f in all computational cells the free surface geometry can be approximated and reconstructed it should be noted that the volume of fluid vof approach with high level accuracy and negligible mass loss in comparison with the numerical methods can be used to simulate the dam break free surface hirt and nichols 1981 yang et al 2018 li et al 2019 khoshkonesh et al 2019 li and yu 2019 sun et al 2019 the turbulent closure models standard k ε and rng the k ε turbulence closure model is the most common model used in the computational fluid dynamics cfd to model the average flow characteristics for turbulent flow conditions in this model the general behavior of turbulent fluid is parameterized by the energy dissipation rate ε and k jones and launder 1972 5 ν t c μ k 2 ε where ε the dissipation rate of turbulence kinetic energy and c μ is an empirical constant to determine k and ε two additional transport

this set of coefficients is often called the standard k ε turbulence model yakhot et al 1992 re derived the ε equation using the renormalized group rng theory one new term was introduced to take into account the highly anisotropic features of turbulence usually associated with regions of large shear and to modify the viscosity accordingly it can be included in the coefﬁcient c ε 1 1 42 η 1 η η 0 1

aforementioned k ε turbulence models another frequently used model is the k ω turbulence model established by wilcox 1993 by replacing the length scale with the specific dissipation rate ω because ω is related to ε by ω ε β k with β 0 09 the k ω model is similar to the standard k ε model with different coefficients the respective turbulence energy k and the speciﬁc dissipation rate ω are expressed in generic form as follows 8 ρ k t ρ u i k x i x i ν t σ k k x i p k ρ β k ω 9 ρ ω t ρ u i ω x i x i ν t σ ω ω x i ω k α p k β ρ k 2 ω where σ k 2 σ ω 2 β 0 075 and α 0 555 sediment scour model the sediment scouring model estimates the motion of sediment by predicting the erosion advection and deposition of sediment in computations of the current study this is done by considering two states in which sediment can exist suspended and packed sediment suspended sediment is typical of low concentration and advected with fluid flow suspended sediment is transported by advection along with the fluid the generic transport equation for each sediment is written as follows 10 c s t u c s 0 where c s is the concentration of the suspended sediment in units of mass per unit volume and u is the mean velocity of the fluid sediment mixture the momentum balances for each sediment species and the fluid sediment mixture can be written as follows 11 u s t u u s 1 ρ s p f k d f s ρ s u r 14 u t u u 1 ρ p f here u s is the velocity of sediment ρ s is the density of the sediment material f s is the volume fraction of sediment p is the pressure k d is the drag function f includes the body and viscous forces ρ is the density of the fluid sediment mixture and u r u s u f is the relative velocity where u f is fluid velocity furthermore sediment is entrained by the picking up and re suspension of packed sediment due to shearing and small eddies at the packed sediment interface the model used in flow 3d is based on mastbergen and von den berg 2003 in calculating the sediment threshold of motion in fluid flow the shields number is employed as the main criterion the criterion is indeed based on evaluating the driving forces induced by the flowing fluid and the retention forces caused by submerged particles weight in this direction the particles start motion while the shields number value is higher than the critical value dey 2014 the first step for computing the critical shields number is calculating the dimensionless parameter d d 50 ρ ρ s ρ g μ 2 3 where d 50 ρ and μ represent median grain diameter water density and water viscosity respectively from d the dimensionless critical shields parameter θ cr 0 3 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 exp 0 02 d is computed using the soulsby whitehouse equation soulsby 1997 the local shields number is computed based on the local shear stress τ where τ is calculated using the law of the wall and the quadratic law of bottom shear stress for 3d turbulent flow and shallow water turbulent flow respectively with consideration of bed surface roughness flow 3d assumes that the nikuradse roughness of the bed surface k s is proportional to the local median grain diameter in packed sediment d 50 i e k s c rough d 50 where c rough 1 is used as a default value the entrainment lift velocity of sediment is then computed using to compute the amount of packed sediment that is converted into suspended sediment effectively acting as a mass source of suspended sediment at the packed bed interface bed load transport is the sediment transport due to rolling or bouncing over the surface of the packed bed of sediment because it is not possible to compute the flow dynamics about each individual grain of sediment and it is oftentimes difficult to compute the boundary layer at the interface an empirical model must be used in this research study for bed load transport the existing meyer peter model 1948 has been complemented by two more empirical approximations fromvan rijn 1984 and nielsen 1992 to expand the range of applicability of the sediment transport model induced by dam break these models predict the volumetric flow of sediment per unit width over the surface of the packed bed 12 m e y e r p e t e r a n d m

peter and müller 1948 formula by 12 this later value is proper for high shear stress conditions shields number larger than 1 and permits to take into account the suspended load campisano et al 2004a 2004b in the case of the van rijn formula the benchmark flume tests and experimental data for calibration and validation were carried out with finer bed materials thus based on the morphodynamic features of these measurements the recommended application range of the formula is limited only for sand 2 mm fractions the bed load coefficient is practically used to control the rate at which bed load transport occurs at given shear stress higher than the critical shear stress in order to take the uncertainties and different experimental conditions into the account the value of bed load coefficient is adjustable in the original equations accordingly for meyer peter and mueller equations ribberink 1998 and fernandez luque and van beek 1976 have suggested values ranging from 5 0 for low transport to 13 0 for high sand transport or zech et al 2008 used the meyer peter and mueller formula multiplied by a factor of 4 i e the factor 8 in the original formula is replaced by 32 in 1d numerical modeling of dam break waves over movable beds here in this study the best agreement with the experimental results was given by a factor of 3 after much trial and error hence in flow 3d the bed load coefficients β mpm i β nie i and β vr i were replaced by 24 36 and 1 59 respectively it is worth noticing that although the bed compaction rate cannot be defined explicitly in the calculations this factor can however be regulated by a parameter called the maximum packed fraction embedded in the package the maximum packing fraction fb which is equal to fb 1 ϕ is the fraction of sediment at which the cell becomes packed and the drag function in the cell goes to infinity no flow 
4904,the hydro mechanical coupling in the shallow crust influences both geological processes such as earthquakes and landslides and anthropogenic processes such as induced seismicity and mining produced subsidence yet there have been few direct field observation to illustrate how the hydraulic and the mechanical processes are coupled in this study we use continuous water level data from wells and ground deformation data over a large area 71 km2 of active coal mining in nw china to examine hydro mechanical coupling in the shallow crust we present detailed analysis of the tidal response of groundwater and surface deformation from radar remote sensing in an actively and intensely mined area and we show that the phase shift of the tidal response of water level may respond significantly to mining disturbances when the excavation workface was many hundred meters to 1 km away whereas significant ground deformation and water level drops occurred only when the workface came much closer to the wells water level and tidal response recovered after the workface moved away but the subsidence is permanent we suggest that the permeability of the mined crust may be controlled by narrow conductive fractures that open and close in response to deviatoric stresses while large ground deformation and water level drops may be controlled by larger fractures and faulting one possibility is the release of the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks by faulting may have allowed the conductive fractures to close and the water level and its tidal response to recover after the workface moved away another possible mechanism is the mobilization of precipitates in clogged fractures by dynamic waves associated with mining induced seismicity which may change the permeability of fractures more studies are warranted for a better understanding of the hydro mechanical coupling during longwall mining keywords hydro mechanical coupling tidal response water level insar mining 1

properties during deformation is critical to constrain numerical and conceptual models bai and elsworth 1995 david et al 2017 and to evaluate the potential impact of mining on groundwater resources liu and elsworth 1997 which is especially important for understanding the impact of mining in arid and semi arid regions where the groundwater resource is scarce and the ecological environment is vulnerable booth 2002 in this study we report continuous monitoring of groundwater levels in wells and surface deformation from radar remote sensing during 2016 2018 over a large area 71 km2 of active coal mining in northwestern china fig 1 a to study the evolution of hydro mechanical coupling between groundwater and deformation we present detailed analysis of the tidal response of groundwater in an actively and intensively mined area we show that the phase shift of the tidal response of water level is by far the most sensitive indicator of changes in hydro mechanical coupling water level and its tidal response in the well recovered after the workface moved away suggesting that the deviatoric stresses that control the opening and closing of narrow conductive fractures may have been

monocline xue et al 2010 ding et al 2016 underground coal mining using the longwall mining method has been in operation since 2013 about 11 longwall panels fig 1a typically 2 4 km in length 300 m in width and 4 m in height fig 1b have been excavated at different times table 1 shows the monthly advancement of each panel provided by the mining company the overburden strata above the extracted coal

unconfined groundwater in the unconfined aquifer is recharged mainly by local precipitation but shows evidence of exchange with groundwater in the confined aquifers below the general pattern of groundwater flow is shown by arrows in fig 1a huang et al 2018 2 2 insar analysis and surface subsidence insar interferometric sar methods have been increasingly used to study ground deformation associated with processes such as aquifer recharge discharge tailings settlement oil gas extraction coal fires and landslides e g hu et al 2017 2018 shirzaei et al 2016 here we relied on one ascending track of sentinel 1 no descending data available to monitor ground deformation in the coal mining area we applied small multilooks 1 in azimuth and 4 in range i e 14 m pixel spacing on the ground to generate the interferograms in order to best preserve drastic deformation i e condensed fringes in localized areas hu et al 2020 here we performed time series analysis using a stack of 108 interferograms with less than 24 day temporal intervals to derive the evolution of surface movements between september 2016 and march 2019 fig 3 the initial interferograms represent a combination of the ground deformation surface topography and artifacts from the atmosphere satellite orbit etc we used 90 m resolution shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem to simulate the topographic phase component we also constrained a spatial ramp fitted by the bilinear polynomial function to be rational we performed the fitting on areas out of the active mine sites thereafter we applied the derived bilinear coefficients for the entire region to approximate the long wavelength artifacts such as that from the atmospheric phase screens and orbits e g hu et al 2018 we resolved the time series displacements based on the singular value decomposition using the corrected unwrapped interferograms note that the interferograms are not fully connected with brief gaps in the summer due to intense rainfall and loss of coherence and we assumed no motions during these gaps for a conservative velocity estimate we converted the radar line of sight measurements to the vertical direction assuming that horizontal motion is negligible fig 1b shows the cumulative vertical surface displacement from 2016 to 2019 and fig 4 d shows the time series of vertical displacement at the three wells fig 5 shows the time series displacement maps which vividly capture ground subsidence during the progression of underground workface table 1 in general the vertical displacements change smoothly with time fig 4d partly due to the relatively coarse temporal sampling of the sar scenes the ground near the j6 well fig 4d j6 for example began to subside when the workface approached the well at a distance of 300 m subsidence continued when the workface passed through the well with a total subsidence of 120 mm when the workface advanced 900 m beyond the well no perceptible subsidence occurred thereafter heavy seasonal rain in the summer of 2017 caused loss of insar coherence near the j7 well fig 4d by utilizing the august 3 15 and september 20 october 2 interferograms however a clear and drastic displacement was identified when the workface was directly beneath the well indicated by a red vertical dashed line in fig 4d j7 which may indicate faulting the ground continued to subside until may 2018 with a total subsidence of at least 100 mm during the course of 1 year the actual displacement may be even larger given that the displacement during the interferogram gaps was assumed zero the j10 well was not situated directly above an excavated panel and thus the total subsidence near the well 30 mm fig 4d j10 is much smaller than that near the other two wells overall the averaged standard deviation of the cumulative displacements measured within a distance of 30 m from wells j6 j7 and j10 are 4 5 mm 5 1 mm and 8 4 mm respectively slight uplift appears along the south north advancing panel 12003 fig 1b which may be an artifact because it occurs only on one side of the panel instead of on both sides subsidence along the axis of the panel caused the margins to lose support and to move sideways towards the center therefore the western margin moved to the east away from the sensor in the ascending sar satellite trajectory and the eastern side moved to the west toward the sensor causing the apparent one side uplift fig 6 2 3 water level we began in september 2016 to monitor water levels in the three wells j6 j7 j10 at depths of 215 204 and 171 m respectively fig 1a and 2b water levels are recorded with solinst levelogger at a sampling rate of 1 h decline of water level in the j6 well became perceptible when the workface was 300 m away from the well fig 4a j6 but large decline of water level occurred when the workface of was 90 m from the well and water level reached a minimum when the workface was directly beneath the well indicated by a red vertical dashed line with a total head loss of 20 m after the workface passed away from the well water level recovered and reached the pre mining level in about half a month when the workface had moved 190 m away decline of water level in the j7 well fig 4a j7 became perceptible when the workface was 712 m from the well water level dropped sharply when the workface reached a distance of 300 m and was lowest when the workface was directly beneath the well indicated by a red vertical dashed line with a total head loss of 44 m water level recovered rapidly after the workface passed the well the borehole damaged and the well casing collapsed shortly after the workface passed the well water level observations then ceased the changes of water level in the j10 well were distinct from those in the other two wells water level in the well began to decline only when the workface of panel 1229 was near the well it continued to decline gradually long after the workface moved away this is the only well that does not overlie an working panel 2 4 response to earth tides tidal signals in the water level are small in magnitude and need to be extracted by applying fourier analysis or some standard computer codes to the water level time series a widely used code in this aspect is baytap based on a bayesian inversion procedure tamura et al 1991 doan et al 2006 error analysis of the parameters is performed in the inversion with the conditional probability of the parameters knowing the data and its observational error these are shown in fig 4 as error bars on each data point the amplitude ratio of the tidal response to the m2 tide fig 4b shows a relatively simple pattern in the j6 well for example this change resembles qualitatively the mirror image of the water level change fig 4a it began to slowly increase when the workface was 300 m away large increases occurred when the workface was fewer than 150 m from the well and reached a maximum when the workface was directly beneath the well fig 4b when the workface moved away amplitude ratio decreased nearly symmetrically with distance from the maximum and returned to a small value when the work face was 150 m away it returned to the pre excavation level when the workface passed by 300 m the change of the phase shift in this well appears quite different from those of the water level and the amplitude ratio it showed three minima two maxima and several changes of signs during the course of this study fig 4c the initial phase shift was 10 when the workface was far away it started to decrease when the workface was 530 m from the well reaching its first minimum of 40 when the workface was 330 m away at which a sudden increase occurred and reached its first maximum of 100 without a corresponding change of water level fig 4a or ground deformation in the satellite image fig 4d the phase shift stayed at this value until the workface was 150 m away when it dropped to the second minimum of 70 within a short distance and stayed at this minimum until the workface advanced beyond the well to a distance of 90 m away it then rose within a short distance to the second maximum of 70 and stayed at this maximum until the workface moved to a distance of 300 m from the well where the phase shift dropped suddenly and decreased to the third minimum of 40 it stayed at this value until the workface was at a distance 640 m away it then rose again without perceptible water level change fig 4a or ground deformation in the satellite image fig 4d to the pre excavation level of 10 the phase shift in the j7 well fig 4c j7 was stable near 40 when the workface was far from the well a significant decrease occurred when the workface was still 1 5 km away it reached a minimum of 70 and then slowly increased and accelerated to a maximum of 20 when the workface was 400 m away it dropped to a minimum of 50 when the workface was beneath the well it increased to a second maximum when the workface moved away and the wellbore was damaged the tidal response of water level in the j10 well differs considerably from those in the other two wells the amplitude ratio shows little change during surface subsidence fig 4b j10 the phase shift fig 4c j10 on the other hand decreased significantly when the workface in the 1229 panel was 345 m away it increased to a maximum when the workface met the well after the workface moved away the phase shift decreased and fluctuated before returning to the pre mining level 3 discussion many studies have used simple models to interpret the tidal response of groundwater in wells doan et al 2006 elkhoury et al 2006 the present study however differs from these studies in two major aspects first the geology of mining areas is modified by the numerous fractures generated by the past and ongoing mining processes e g booth 2002 which may alter the hydrology and dominate the tidal response of groundwater in mining areas zhang and lópez 2019 the available simple models are constructed for horizontal aquifers and are thus inadequate for the interpretation of the tidal response of groundwater in the present study even though hanson and owen 1982 and bower 1983 related tidal response to fractures their models only account for the tidal response of groundwater in an isolated plane fracture which is obviously far from the situation encountered in underground mining areas where the wall rocks are crisscrossed by multisets of intersecting high angle fractures e g booth 2002 second the results of the tidal analysis are usually expressed as the phase shift with respect to the tidal strain and the amplitude ratio of the water tides to the equivalent tidal pressure head because direct measurement of the tidal strains is unavailable in most wells as in the presence case the theoretical tidal strain at the well is assumed as the reference in the analysis however tidal strains are known to be significantly affected by the local geology beaumont and berger 1975 cavity and topography harrison 1974 the numerous subsurface tunnels beneath the studied area may affect the local tidal strain in significant but unpredictable ways as a consequence the theoretical strain cannot serve as an accurate reference for the tidal analysis in the present study for these reasons only a qualitative interpretation of the tidal response may be attempted with the existing models in spite of these difficulties the present study is still a valuable contribution because it presents the first detailed report of the tidal response of groundwater in an actively and intensely mined area the large distances between the wells and the workface 530 m for the j6 well and 1500 m for the j7 well when the first significant change of the phase shift to the m2 tide occurred may appear surprising in view of previous studies of mining induced microseismicity e g cheng et al 2019 and stress changes e g meng et al 2016 which showed a much smaller threshold distance the comparatively large distance between the well and the workface when the first significant change of the phase shift occurred may be due to a combination of the sensitivity of the phase shift of the tidal response to minute stress changes in the shallow crust and to the effect of dynamic stresses in the seismic waves from small earthquakes e g brodsky et al 2003 manga and wang 2015 small earthquakes are ubiquitous during coal mining e g arabasz et al 2005 cheng et al 2019 however few seismographs have been set up near the studied area because it is located inside a geologically stable craton the erdos craton where few natural earthquakes have occurred or may be expected and because no seismograph has been specifically set up for monitoring the mining induced seismicity the nearest seismic stations for monitoring the natural seismicity is 30 km away as a result the accuracy for the epicentral locations is low and none of the eleven reported mining induced earthquakes with magnitude larger than 2 5 was located within the studied area during the studied period for this reason we cannot provide any detailed analysis of the seismic energy density from the induced seismicity or the earthquake induced increase in permeability for this study on the other hand we may expect abundant unreported small earthquakes in the mined area during the mining process which would cause dynamic stresses that attenuate much more slowly with distance than the quasi static stresses kilb et al 2002 brodsky et al 2003 such dynamic stresses have been shown to be effective to mobilize the precipitates in clogged fractures and to increase the fracture permeability which in turn may change the fracture permeability and the phase shift of the tidal response at large distances e g elkhoury et al 2006 the large increase of the amplitude ratio in the j6 and j7 wells fig 4b j6 j7 and simultaneous decline of water level fig 4a j6 j7 when the workface came near and beneath the wells contradicts the prediction of the porous flow models with a horizontal layer roeloffs 1996 doan et al 2006 wang et al 2018 this may be because mining produces high angle fractures in the wall rocks e g booth 2002 which are likely to dominate the tidal response of groundwater the tidal response in mining areas is also complicated by distortions of the strain field and the gravitational potential e g king and bilham 1973 beaumont and berger 1975 in addition the drastic displacement identified on the interferograms fig 4d j7 in late august 2017 implies faulting related mass movement that may further distort the local potential fields on the other hand the detailed recording of the time dependent changes of tidal response may be explored to reveal a degree of qualitative understanding the most revealing aspect in the time dependent change of tidal response is the sudden switches of sign in the phase shift as described in the last section also highly revealing is the co occurrence of the amplitude ratio maximum and the groundwater level minimum the latter clearly indicates a great increase in the vertical permeability which in turn implies the formation of vertical fractures or faults beneath the wells none of the existing horizontal layered models can explain these changes and thus we seek fracture models for explanation bower 1983 showed for fractures that incline at an angle to the horizon the sign of the phase shift depends on the strike of the fracture plane for a well located at a latitude of 45on for example the phase shift of the tidal response to the m2 tide is positive for fractures with strike measured from the north between 0 and 90 and negative for fractures with strike between 90 and 180 with fracture dips increasing beyond 10 to 20 the absolute phase shift decreases rapidly while the amplitude increases more gradually therefore the sharp switches of the signs of the phase shift with and the different characteristics between the phase shift and the amplitude ratio during the progressive mining and excavation are more consistent with the fracture model than the horizontal aquifer models even though the presence in the studied area of multiple intersecting sets of fractures with different strikes precludes a quantitative application of the fracture model some qualitative suggestions may be made given the changing stress conditions in the mining area with the progression of the workface it is reasonable to suggest that different sets of fractures are activated at different times which in turn may have caused the rapid switching of the signs of the phase shift during the progress of mining the observed rapid decline of water level and pronounced increase of the amplitude ratio in the j6 and the j7 wells when the workface comes close to and beneath the wells fig 4a b are consistent with field observations that large fractures with steep dips form above excavated panels david et al 2017 furthermore faulting may occur near the well when the workface comes close as suggested by the drastic displacement identified on the interferograms fig 4d j7 in late august 2017 the occurrence of steep fractures and faults may drastically increase the vertical leakage of the aquifer and change the sign of the phase shift bower 1983 the recovery of the water level and its tidal response at the j6 well after the workface moved away fig 4a b c j6 suggests that the permeability of the shallow crust recovered near the wells which in turn suggests that the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks were released which allows the conductive narrow fractures to close and the permeability to return as noted earlier the amplitude ratio of the tidal response of water level in the j10 well barely changed when the workface approached the well even though the phase shift showed substantial changes this contrast illustrates that the phase shift is sensitively to relatively small stress changes but the amplitude ratio is not the groundwater level in this well declined continuously with time disregard to the progress of mining in contrast with the situations in j6 and j7 wells where the groundwater level showed a pronounced decline to a minimum when the workface arrived directly beneath the well and then rose with time when the workface moved away we hypothesize that the small responses of the groundwater level and the amplitude ratio in the j10 well are indicative that no steep fractures formed beneath the well during mining as a result the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks were not released and the fractures and permeability did not recover which allows the continued gradual decline of water level in the j10 well long after the excavation activity in the nearby panel stopped 4 concluding remarks we present in this study detailed analysis of the tidal response of groundwater and surface deformation from radar remote sensing in an actively and intensely mined area and show that the phase shift of the response of water level to earth tides may be a more sensitive indicator than the other indicators to mining induced disturbances on the hydro mechanical state in the shallow crust we hypothesize that mining produced quasi static and dynamic stresses may induce conductive fractures to open at large distance from the workface which can significantly alter the tidal response of water level but cause little noticeable ground deformation and water level change large ground deformation and rapid decline in water level occur only under large deviatoric stresses when the workface comes much closer to the wells the recovery of the water level and its tidal response after the workface moves away is more difficult to explain we suggest that the occurrence of faulting during mining may have released the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks to allow the conductive fractures to close and become non conductive allowing the permeability and the tidal response of the shallow crust to recover alternatively mining induced seismicity around the coal field cause the permeability increase and recovery more investigations are needed to better

4904,the hydro mechanical coupling in the shallow crust influences both geological processes such as earthquakes and landslides and anthropogenic processes such as induced seismicity and mining produced subsidence yet there have been few direct field observation to illustrate how the hydraulic and the mechanical processes are coupled in this study we use continuous water level data from wells and ground deformation data over a large area 71 km2 of active coal mining in nw china to examine hydro mechanical coupling in the shallow crust we present detailed analysis of the tidal response of groundwater and surface deformation from radar remote sensing in an actively and intensely mined area and we show that the phase shift of the tidal response of water level may respond significantly to mining disturbances when the excavation workface was many hundred meters to 1 km away whereas significant ground deformation and water level drops occurred only when the workface came much closer to the wells water level and tidal response recovered after the workface moved away but the subsidence is permanent we suggest that the permeability of the mined crust may be controlled by narrow conductive fractures that open and close in response to deviatoric stresses while large ground deformation and water level drops may be controlled by larger fractures and faulting one possibility is the release of the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks by faulting may have allowed the conductive fractures to close and the water level and its tidal response to recover after the workface moved away another possible mechanism is the mobilization of precipitates in clogged fractures by dynamic waves associated with mining induced seismicity which may change the permeability of fractures more studies are warranted for a better understanding of the hydro mechanical coupling during longwall mining keywords hydro mechanical coupling tidal response water level insar mining 1

coal mining in northwestern china fig 1 a to study the evolution of hydro mechanical coupling between groundwater and deformation we present detailed analysis of the tidal response of groundwater in an actively and intensively mined area we show that the phase shift of the tidal response of water level is by far the most sensitive indicator of changes in hydro mechanical coupling water level and its tidal response in the well recovered after the workface moved away suggesting that the deviatoric stresses that control the opening and closing of narrow conductive fractures may have been

the j7 well fig 4c j7 was stable near 40 when the workface was far from the well a significant decrease occurred when the workface was still 1 5 km away it reached a minimum of 70 and then slowly increased and accelerated to a maximum of 20 when the workface was 400 m away it dropped to a minimum of 50 when the workface was beneath the well it increased to a second maximum when the workface moved away and the wellbore was damaged the tidal response of water level in the j10 well differs considerably from those in the other two wells the amplitude ratio shows little change during surface subsidence fig 4b j10 the phase shift fig 4c j10 on the other hand decreased significantly when the workface in the 1229 panel was 345 m away it increased to a maximum when the workface met the well after the workface moved away the phase shift decreased and fluctuated before returning to the pre mining level 3 discussion many studies have used simple models to interpret the tidal response of groundwater in wells doan et al 2006 elkhoury et al 2006 the present study however differs from these studies in two major aspects first the geology of mining areas is modified by the numerous fractures generated by the past and ongoing mining processes e g booth 2002 which may alter the hydrology and dominate the tidal response of groundwater in mining areas zhang and lópez 2019 the available simple models are constructed for horizontal aquifers and are thus inadequate for the interpretation of the tidal response of groundwater in the present study even though hanson and owen 1982 and bower 1983 related tidal response to fractures their models only account for the tidal response of groundwater in an isolated plane fracture which is obviously far from the situation encountered in underground mining areas where the wall rocks are crisscrossed by multisets of intersecting high angle fractures e g booth 2002 second the results of the tidal analysis are usually expressed as the phase shift with respect to the tidal strain and the amplitude ratio of the water tides to the equivalent tidal pressure head because direct measurement of the tidal strains is unavailable in most wells as in the presence case the theoretical tidal strain at the well is assumed as the reference in the analysis however tidal strains are known to be significantly affected by the local geology beaumont and berger 1975 cavity and topography harrison 1974 the numerous subsurface tunnels beneath the studied area may affect the local tidal strain in significant but unpredictable ways as a consequence the theoretical strain cannot serve as an accurate reference for the tidal analysis in the present study for these reasons only a qualitative interpretation of the tidal response may be attempted with the existing models in spite of these difficulties the present study is still a valuable contribution because it presents the first detailed report of the tidal response of groundwater in an actively and intensely mined area the large distances between the wells and the workface 530 m for the j6 well and 1500 m for the j7 well when the first significant change of the phase shift to the m2 tide occurred may appear surprising in view of previous studies of mining induced microseismicity e g cheng et al 2019 and stress changes e g meng et al 2016 which showed a much smaller threshold distance the comparatively large distance between the well and the workface when the first significant change of the phase shift occurred may be due to a combination of the sensitivity of the phase shift of the tidal response to minute stress changes in the shallow crust and to the effect of dynamic stresses in the seismic waves from small earthquakes e g brodsky et al 2003 manga and wang 2015 small earthquakes are ubiquitous during coal mining e g arabasz et al 2005 cheng et al 2019 however few seismographs have been set up near the studied area because it is located inside a geologically stable craton the erdos craton where few natural earthquakes have occurred or may be expected and because no seismograph has been specifically set up for monitoring the mining induced seismicity the nearest seismic stations for monitoring the natural seismicity is 30 km away as a result the accuracy for the epicentral locations is low and none of the eleven reported mining induced earthquakes with magnitude larger than 2 5 was located within the studied area during the studied period for this reason we cannot provide any detailed analysis of the seismic energy density from the induced seismicity or the earthquake induced increase in permeability for this study on the other hand we may expect abundant unreported small earthquakes in the mined area during the mining process which would cause dynamic stresses that attenuate much more slowly with distance than the quasi static stresses kilb et al 2002 brodsky et al 2003 such dynamic stresses have been shown to be effective to mobilize the precipitates in clogged fractures and to increase the fracture permeability which in turn may change the fracture permeability and the phase shift of the tidal response at large distances e g elkhoury et al 2006 the large increase of the amplitude ratio in the j6 and j7 wells fig 4b j6 j7 and simultaneous decline of water level fig 4a j6 j7 when the workface came near and beneath the wells contradicts the prediction of the porous flow models with a horizontal layer roeloffs 1996 doan et al 2006 wang et al 2018 this may be because mining produces high angle fractures in the wall rocks e g booth 2002 which are likely to dominate the tidal response of groundwater the tidal response in mining areas is also complicated by distortions of the strain field and the gravitational potential e g king and bilham 1973 beaumont and berger 1975 in addition the drastic displacement identified on the interferograms fig 4d j7 in late august 2017 implies faulting related mass movement that may further distort the local potential fields on the other hand the detailed recording of the time dependent changes of tidal response may be explored to reveal a degree of qualitative understanding the most revealing aspect in the time dependent change of tidal response is the sudden switches of sign in the phase shift as described in the last section also highly revealing is the co occurrence of the amplitude ratio maximum and the groundwater level minimum the latter clearly indicates a great increase in the vertical permeability which in turn implies the formation of vertical fractures or faults beneath the wells none of the existing horizontal layered models can explain these changes and thus we seek fracture models for explanation bower 1983 showed for fractures that incline at an angle to the horizon the sign of the phase shift depends on the strike of the fracture plane for a well located at a latitude of 45on for example the phase shift of the tidal response to the m2 tide is positive for fractures with strike measured from the north between 0 and 90 and negative for fractures with strike between 90 and 180 with fracture dips increasing beyond 10 to 20 the absolute phase shift decreases rapidly while the amplitude increases more gradually therefore the sharp switches of the signs of the phase shift with and the different characteristics between the phase shift and the amplitude ratio during the progressive mining and excavation are more consistent with the fracture model than the horizontal aquifer models even though the presence in the studied area of multiple intersecting sets of fractures with different strikes precludes a quantitative application of the fracture model some qualitative suggestions may be made given the changing stress conditions in the mining area with the progression of the workface it is reasonable to suggest that different sets of fractures are activated at different times which in turn may have caused the rapid switching of the signs of the phase shift during the progress of mining the observed rapid decline of water level and pronounced increase of the amplitude ratio in the j6 and the j7 wells when the workface comes close to and beneath the wells fig 4a b are consistent with field observations that large fractures with steep dips form above excavated panels david et al 2017 furthermore faulting may occur near the well when the workface comes close as suggested by the drastic displacement identified on the interferograms fig 4d j7 in late august 2017 the occurrence of steep fractures and faults may drastically increase the vertical leakage of the aquifer and change the sign of the phase shift bower 1983 the recovery of the water level and its tidal response at the j6 well after the workface moved away fig 4a b c j6 suggests that the permeability of the shallow crust recovered near the wells which in turn suggests that the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks were released which allows the conductive narrow fractures to close and the permeability to return as noted earlier the amplitude ratio of the tidal response of water level in the j10 well barely changed when the workface approached the well even though the phase shift showed substantial changes this contrast illustrates that the phase shift is sensitively to relatively small stress changes but the amplitude ratio is not the groundwater level in this well declined continuously with time disregard to the progress of mining in contrast with the situations in j6 and j7 wells where the groundwater level showed a pronounced decline to a minimum when the workface arrived directly beneath the well and then rose with time when the workface moved away we hypothesize that the small responses of the groundwater level and the amplitude ratio in the j10 well are indicative that no steep fractures formed beneath the well during mining as a result the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks were not released and the fractures and permeability did not recover which allows the continued gradual decline of water level in the j10 well long after the excavation activity in the nearby panel stopped 4 concluding remarks we present in this study detailed analysis of the tidal response of groundwater and surface deformation from radar remote sensing in an actively and intensely mined area and show that the phase shift of the response of water level to earth tides may be a more sensitive indicator than the other indicators to mining induced disturbances on the hydro mechanical state in the shallow crust we hypothesize that mining produced quasi static and dynamic stresses may induce conductive fractures to open at large distance from the workface which can significantly alter the tidal response of water level but cause little noticeable ground deformation and water level change large ground deformation and rapid decline in water level occur only under large deviatoric stresses when the workface comes much closer to the wells the recovery of the water level and its tidal response after the workface moves away is more difficult to explain we suggest that the occurrence of faulting during mining may have released the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks to allow the conductive fractures to close and become non conductive allowing the permeability and the tidal response of the shallow crust to recover alternatively mining induced seismicity around the coal field cause the permeability increase and recovery more investigations are needed to better understand hydro mechanical coupling during longwall mining credit authorship contribution statement zheming shi methodology software writing original draft data curation funding acquisition xie hu
