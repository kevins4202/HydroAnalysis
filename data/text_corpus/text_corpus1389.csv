distributed parameter model which couples modflow sfr with rt3d otis predicts impacts that vary significantly over a region encompassing about 500 km2 and across time results suggest that over the course of several decades average se and nitrate nitrogen no3 n groundwater concentrations within the region could be lowered by as much as 23 and 40 respectively using combined bmps average se concentration in the river could be decreased by up to 56 with combined bmps and no3 n concentrations by up to 32 by using erb the cs rf erb combination type may be the most promising for simultaneously lowering both se and no3 n concentrations to insure compliance with colorado water rights and the arkansas river compact with kansas measures must be taken to compensate for altered return flow patterns that will be a consequence of bmp implementation results also point to the need to consider the targeting of bmps to specific locations within the region to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency keywords selenium nitrate modeling groundwater surface water interactions nonpoint source pollution best management practices irrigation 1 introduction many current water quality concerns are linked to irrigated agriculture along with high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds trace elements and nutrients present in irrigation return flows can pose harm to the environment and human health and reduce crop yields the prevalence of trace elements like selenium se in groundwater alfthan et al 1995 hudak 2010 and surface water engberg and sylvester 1993 may et al 2008 systems has become a growing worry in the western united states and around the world in many cases se is present within shale bedrock as seleno pyrite ii fesexs2 x and is mobilized through oxidation reduction redox processes into the groundwater as it returns to streams gates et al 2009 seiler 1995 high groundwater return rates due to inefficient irrigation practices and canal seepage act to promote this mobilization process furthermore studies have shown that dissolved oxygen do and nitrate no3 present in water both accelerate the mobilization of the seleno pyrite and inhibit the chemical reduction of dissolved species of se weres et al 1990 white et al 1991 stillings and amacher 2010 bailey et al 2012 this presence of se has been linked to toxicity problems in wildlife including fish and waterfowl bioaccumulating in the food chain presser et al 1994 hamilton 2004 the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2016 recently released updated recommended standards for se lowering the standard for warm lotic waters to 3 1 µg l 1 and creating separate standards for fish tissue when concentrations in drinking water exceed the usepa standard of 50 µg l 1 livestock and human health are in jeopardy among nutrients that are applied as fertilizer nitrogen n especially in the form of no3 has become a widespread pollutant of concern in surface water and groundwater systems in recent decades spalding and exner 1993 mueller et al 1995 carpenter et al 1998 burrow et al 2010 tesoriero et al 2013 mobilized by applied water no3 is transported to groundwater and streams through inefficiencies in irrigation practices excess amounts can lead to eutrophication of surface water systems promoting the growth of algae resulting in fish kills and biodiversity loss carpenter et al 1998 furthermore elevated no3 concentrations also can lead to methemoglobinemia in infants fan and steinberg 1996 for these reasons the usepa 2018 has set a maximum contaminant level mcl for no3 as n no3 n to 10 mg l 1 because of the environmental and human health risks that these pollutants pose a number of studies have been performed in recent decades to analyze the potential of water and land best management practices bmps to decrease concentrations several studies have reviewed ways of lowering se contamination in water systems engberg et al 1998 examined the san joaquin valley drainage program a multi tiered approach to reducing the se problems caused by irrigation drainage and outlined several methods to decrease se concentrations including preventing se from entering the system capturing or removing it and allaying its effects lin and terry 2003 used a ten cell wetland system to treat irrigation drainage the system removed 70 of se from the water mostly by sorption to sediment and volatilization amweg et al 2003 studied the use of algae and bacteria to reduce dissolved se results from the analysis showed that while total se was decreased there was a significant increase in bioavailable se similarly many studies have examined effective means of lowering no3 concentrations or mass loading in surface water these bmps include enhancing riparian buffers vaché et al 2002 sahu and gu 2009 lee et al 2010 adjacent to streams reducing or more efficiently applying fertilizer trachtenberg and ogg 1994 molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 lee et al 2010 rong and xuefeng 2011 liu et al 2013 altering land tillage management and using vegetative filter strips vaché et al 2002 lee et al 2010 liu et al 2013 and reducing applied irrigation rong and xuefeng 2011 results show that these bmps can effectively lower no3 contamination bmp modeling studies generally have reported impacts as changes in non point source loading to surface water with moderate alterations in management causing a decrease in n loading of 5 10 and aggressive changes in management reducing n loads by 75 90 vaché et al 2002 sahu and gu 2009 lee et al 2010 liu et al 2013 bailey et al 2015a b examined the effectiveness of mitigating water contamination from se by diminishing groundwater return flows to streams and decreasing available no3 in the system thereby inhibiting the mobilization of se and allowing the chemical reduction of se to occur in these studies the effects of five different water and land bmps were analyzed for their impacts on lowering se and no3 mass loading and on groundwater concentrations in the lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado results show that implementing these bmps especially in combination could significantly decrease mass loading to the arkansas river as well as strongly impact groundwater concentrations bailey et al 2015a b in this paper the analyses of bailey et al 2015a b are expanded to examine the effects of bmps on the reactive transport of se and no3 in not only the aquifer but also in streams using a coupled stream aquifer model the newly developed rt3d otis model shultz et al 2018 linked to a modflow model that employs the streamflow routing sfr package simulates the regional scale fate and transport of these solutes in the irrigated agricultural stream aquifer system of the larv under the influence of five bmps reduced applied irrigation fallowing of agricultural lands sealing of irrigation canals reduced applied fertilizer and enhanced riparian buffer zones alone and in combination bmp economic feasibility and their potential impact on crop yields are under consideration in companion studies here we focus on bmp effectiveness in lowering groundwater concentrations decreasing groundwater mass loading of se and no3 to the stream network and lessening stream concentrations for both se and no3 in comparison to historic baseline conditions insights provide useful guidance in controlling se and no3 contamination in similar irrigated agricultural river valleys 2 description of study region the larv fig 1 is located in southeastern colorado situated between pueblo co and the kansas state line the region is largely dominated by agriculture which due to the semi arid climate relies heavily on irrigation through canal networks and pumped water during previous work by researchers at colorado state university csu the area has been studied with a focus on two representative regions an upstream study region usr fig 2 which contains the arkansas river reach extending from the town of manzanola to adobe creek and a downstream study region dsr which encompasses the river reach from the city of lamar to the kansas state line in the present investigation flow and reactive transport of solutes are simulated in the stream aquifer system of the usr the modeled region consists of a 75 km stretch of the arkansas river several tributaries and an alluvial aquifer that interacts with the stream network the usr contains eight main irrigation canals and about 575 pumping wells bring supplemental water to the crops major crops grown in the region include alfalfa corn sorghum and wheat large portions of the aquifer in the larv including within the usr are underlain by or interspersed with near surface marine shale geology scott 1968 sharps 1976 groundwater flows through the aquifer mobilizing solute species from these rocks and their weathered residuum and transporting them to the river system among these solutes are se and uranium u gates et al 2009 bailey et al 2012 gates et al 2016 gates et al 2009 reported on the scale of the groundwater and stream contamination from se and u as well as no3 and other major salts findings from these extensive field data serve as the basis for the numerical modeling described herein in the usr solute reactive transport in the hydrologic system is controlled heavily by irrigation practices natural aquifer recharge by precipitation and water returned to the stream network are augmented by the use of supplemental water for irrigation some of the infiltrated irrigation water percolates below the crop root zone deep percolation recharges the underlying aquifer and accelerates return flows to the river by increasing the head gradient between the aquifer and stream the infiltrated irrigation water has a large supply of do from the atmosphere and no3 oxidized from applied fertilizer additional water recharges the groundwater through seepage from irrigation canals as the groundwater returns to the river network it comes in contact with the underlying shale where the availability of do and no3 as electron donors in the groundwater allows redox reactions to occur with seleno pyrite within the shale groundwater now containing mobilized se flows through the aquifer to the arkansas river and its tributaries water also runs off fields due to inefficiencies in irrigation and returns in surface drainage to the streams this aqueous se exists primarily as selenate seo4 selenite seo3 or organic selenomethionine semet with seo4 representing the majority of the se in the dissolved phase in the larv gates et al 2009 as water continues downstream where it is again applied it picks up more se from groundwater return flows contacting the bedrock and more no3 from fertilizer over time this repeated reuse of water increases concentrations of the surface water and groundwater along the valley depending upon chemical reactions within the streams aquifer and riparian and hyporheic zones adjacent to streams 3 methodology 3 1 model description to accurately simulate hydraulic head and flows in the stream aquifer system of the usr modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 was used along with several modules including the unsaturated zone flow uzf1 niswonger et al 2006 and stream flow routing sfr2 niswonger and prudic 2005 packages the original regional groundwater model developed by morway et al 2013 was modified by shultz et al 2018 to include the sfr2 package which allows for the simulation of flows in the arkansas river and its tributaries groundwater and stream flow rates along with sinks and sources are taken from the modflow sfr output and are used as input forcing variables in the rt3d otis reactive transport model the rt3d otis model represents a coupling of the uzf rt3d model developed by bailey et al 2013 to simulate unsaturated and saturated zone groundwater reactive transport with a otis qual2e model bailey and ahmadi 2014 which simulates reactive transport of interacting solutes in a stream network a summary of the linked modeling processes is depicted in fig 3 this model coupling of groundwater and streams and of flow and reactive solute transport along with its calibration testing and application to simulate baseline conditions in the larv is described in detail in shultz et al 2018 the coupled model depicts the cycling of se and n along with do in the saturated and unsaturated aquifer zones and in streams it incorporates several aqueous sinks and sources including infiltrated rainfall and irrigation evapotranspiration surface water seepage and pumping from groundwater wells chemical reactions for aqueous and sorbed phases of se and n are represented including autotrophic and heterotrophic reduction and oxidation sorption volatilization immobilization and mineralization reaction rates are modeled using first order kinetics with monod terms employed to account for the effect of multiple chemical species on the reactions zheng and bennett 2002 the model has been calibrated and tested against an extensive data set consisting of groundwater levels from 88 monitoring wells groundwater return flows to the river streamflow and water levels remotely sensed evapotranspiration groundwater solute concentrations from the monitoring wells se and no3 groundwater mass loading to the river and stream se and no3 concentrations at 10 locations 7 along the arkansas river 3 along tributaries having performed well in simulating baseline water and solute mass in the stream aquifer system of the larv the model serves as the basis for the bmp simulations presented here a brief overview of the model highlighting major and exemplary features is laid out here to establish its credibility as a tool for bmp assessment the reader is directed to shultz et al 2018 for a detailed description of model construction model parameters and model input data to simulate the reactive transport of se and no3 in groundwater the uzf rt3d bailey et al 2013 component within the coupled model solves the following advection dispersion reaction adr equation for each solute 1

alg is the rate of algae growth t 1 using the calibrated parameter values determined by morway et al 2013 and bailey et al 2014 within the component groundwater flow and reactive transport models respectively additional parameter adjustments were performed by shultz et al 2018 for the coupled model in light of data on streamflow stream solute concentrations and solute mass loading to the river in the modflow component of the coupled model morway et al 2013 used the river package to represent surface water for stream aquifer interaction in the larv the addition of the sfr2 package in the modflow model by shultz et al 2018 allowed flow in the streams to be simulated for use by the rt3d otis solute transport component without modifying values of aquifer parameters originally calibrated by morway et al 2013 streambed conductance was manually adjusted to best match the measured data on gaged stream flow groundwater hydraulic heads satellite remote sensing estimated et estimated stream gain from groundwater and estimated total unaccounted for stream gain from a river mass balance following the adjustments to the modflow sfr component of the coupled model the rt3d otis component was calibrated by altering parameter values within ranges reported in the literature in an attempt to match observed groundwater concentrations solute mass loading to the arkansas river and in stream concentrations for se seo3 seo4 and no3 n an iterative process of manual calibration followed by automated calibration with the pest parameter estimation doherty 2016 software was used to obtain the final parameter values for a calibration period from june 19th 2006 to march 20th 2008 the calibrated model was then tested against data for the period from march 21st 2008 to october 31st 2009 3 2 assessment of bmps 3 2 1 simulation period to simulate reactive transport in the stream aquifer system for each of the considered bmps the rt3d otis model was applied to the period 1999 2009 with this period then repeated successively three and half times to produce a 40 year long simulation this approach allowed a direct comparison of flow and water quality conditions simulated under bmp scenarios to those under historic baseline conditions that spanned very dry to very wet years the flow rate in the arkansas river averaged over four stream gauges within the study region was analyzed for each year within the 1999 2009 study period the average annual values within the study period ranged from 25 very dry to 183 very wet of the long term average flow rate for the period 1975 2012 for five of the years within the study period the average river flow exceeded 90 of the long term average the average river flow across the entire study period was 81 of the long term average flow with a coefficient of variation of 51 gates et al 2016 the extension of the simulation period to a total of 40 years was necessary to account for long lag times which commonly occur between field level bmp implementation and corresponding water quality responses in both the groundwater and the river network meals et al 2010 such lags are due in part to groundwater residence time taking as long as several decades for infiltrated water in several areas of the irrigated region to reach streams as reported by bailey et al 2015b for the larv 3 2 2 details of considered bmps the bmps considered in the analysis to lower se and no3 groundwater concentrations solute mass loading and stream concentrations are referenced as 1 reduced irrigation ri 2 lease fallowing lf 3 canal sealing to reduce seepage cs 4 reduced fertilizer application rf and 5 enhanced riparian buffers erb these bmps were analyzed individually over three levels or degrees of implementation in addition to the assessment of single bmp scenarios bmps in combination were evaluated the full set of considered bmp scenarios along with nomenclature is summarized in table 1 in the discussion that follows bmps are separated into water bmps ri lf and cs and land bmps rf and erb ri bmps constitute a change to more efficient irrigation practices with less water applied to fields as the level of implementation increases this improved efficiency could be achieved by converting traditional surface irrigation to more efficient irrigation methods such as sprinkler or drip or by improving surface irrigation practices grading the land surface altering rates and timing of irrigation application etc the rationale for ri bmps is the supposition that decreased water applications will lower surface water runoff and deep percolation from irrigated fields this will in turn lower the dissolution and mobilization of surface and subsurface solutes and decrease rates and mass loading of return flows to streams leading to net reductions in stream solute concentrations in this study an attempt is made to avoid bmps that would cause deficit irrigation of crops resulting in considered ri scenarios of 10 20 and 30 below simulated baseline amounts the applied water on each cultivated field was decreased by a specified percentage thus necessitating a change to irrigation infiltration values in the uzf input file and a corresponding reduction in the modeled canal diversions lf and cs scenarios also are thought to potentially lessen the mobilization and transport of solute mass through the stream aquifer system leading to lower concentrations lf bmps entail fallowing irrigated fields for the purpose of leasing the water in excess of crop consumptive use to cities fallowing typically occurs for three out of ten years with associated water rights remaining with the irrigators in the current study an lf scenario was simulated as a portion ranging from 10 20 and 30 of the cultivated fields fallowed with no applied irrigation water during any given year as described by morway et al 2013 lands were fallowed based on crop type with corn hay and alfalfa fallowed before higher valued crops such as melons and onions this was accomplished by removing irrigation water infiltration from the uzf input file decreasing canal diversions and replacing crop et rate with a naturally vegetated et rate additionally fertilizer application was removed from the lf fields in the rt3d otis input files canals are assumed to be sealed using polymers such as linear anionic polyacrylamide susfalk et al 2008 martin 2015 to decrease seepage losses in cs scenarios currently canals in the usr are not sealed or lined and a significant amount of conveyed water is lost as seepage to groundwater to lessen modeled seepage the conductance of the canals is lowered by modifying streambed conductance in the river package resulting in seepage reductions of 40 60 and 80 from baseline conditions for the three levels of implementation canal diversions are decreased accordingly in the larv farmers commonly apply n fertilizers in excess of what is required for optimal crop yields halvorson et al 2002 in bmps that include rf the input amount of fertilizer applied to all fields is lowered in the rt3d otis input files by amounts 10 20 and 30 from the baseline values these levels of reduced fertilizer application are judged reasonable in view of the present practice of over application in the larv however the expected impact on crop yields would need to be carefully assessed in a next step toward implementation rf scenarios are expected to lower nitrification mitigating the role that excess no3 plays in dissolving se from shale and weathered shale through autotrophic redox reactions and through inhibition of the chemical reduction of seo4 bailey et al 2012 changing the dimensions vegetative mix and organic carbon composition of the riparian corridor adjacent to the streams to accelerate the chemical reduction and volatilization of dissolve no3 and se is assumed in the erb scenarios such alterations are recognized as promising approaches for improving the attenuation of nonpoint source pollution to streams tabacchi et al 2000 smith et al 2008 dosskey et al 2010 to represent the considered erb scenarios in the model chemical reduction rates for model cells in delineated riparian areas were increased by factors of 2 5 and 10 from those under baseline conditions while these factors result in chemical reduction rates that are within the feasible range reported in the literature there is yet little information available on the practicality of implementing such increases within the modeled region effective and economical ways to carry out these amendments within the larv will need to be studied in a next step toward implementation a total of 54 bmp scenarios including 39 combined bmps were analyzed for their effectiveness in decreasing se and no3 contamination in the usr due to the uncertainty associated with the practicality of its implementation erb was considered only as a single bmp and within a limited number of combined bmp scenarios every combined bmp scenario that included any of the remaining four single bmps was simulated over a range of implementation levels though scenarios that combined bmps at different levels of implementation e g high level of implementation of one bmp in combination with a basic level implementation of another could be tested to limit the total number of considered bmps and the associated computational requirements only single bmps with the same respective levels of implementation were combined together for this study additionally for the single bmps smaller increments of implementation level were examined to more accurately estimate the relationship of implementation level to the resulting degree of se and no3 reduction 3 2 3 compliance with water law apart from input file modifications that were made for the single bmps other model modifications were made to simulate compliance with colorado water rights and the arkansas river compact between colorado and kansas since water bmps will lead to altered flow patterns within the arkansas river new storage accounts likely will need to be set up in one or more on stream or off stream reservoirs application of water bmps would involve reduced diversions of river flows into canals and would result in diminished surface and groundwater return flows to the river generally this causes net increases in river flow during the irrigation season compared to baseline conditions and net reductions in river flow during the off season new reservoir storage accounts would allow for water to be stored during times of net excess river flow due to reduced diversions to canals and to be released to the river over time to make up for net stream depletions due to reduced groundwater return flows pueblo reservoir to the west of the usr see fig 1 is assumed to be available for storing water to be used for mitigating the impact of alternative bmps flows in the arkansas river at the upstream end of the segment within the usr were altered within bmp model simulations so that river flows leaving the usr at the downstream end would remain the same under each bmp as they were during baseline conditions this assumes that changes in reservoir management would be made to enable reservoir releases resulting in properly timed river flows to compute the required storage and releases from pueblo reservoir each bmp scenario was first simulated with the same river flows entering the usr as under the baseline condition next the river flow computed for the bmp at the downstream end of the usr was compared with that computed for the baseline condition the net amount that would need to be stored in pueblo reservoir and then released to make up for the flow deficit was computed as the difference between the simulated baseline and bmp flows in cases where the baseline flows were less than the bmp flows typically during the irrigation season water was assumed to be released from reservoir storage to make up the difference when computed baseline flows exceed simulated bmp flows at the downstream end of the usr usually during the winter months typically the simulated overall total volume of water leaving the usr for a given year is greater under a water bmp than under the baseline this results primarily from a calculated decline in non beneficial consumptive use from naturally vegetated or fallow fields resulting from a predicted increase in depth to the water table in the region due to bmp implementation niemann et al 2011 morway et al 2013 this excess water returns to the river as subsurface flow and is routed to the downstream end of the usr with only the water necessary to supplement low flows and to account for reservoir evaporation losses assumed to be stored in the reservoir water lost to reservoir evaporation is calculated based upon the additional storage volume in the reservoir water is assumed stored in the reservoir so that at the end of the 11 year simulation period there is approximately no storage remaining in the reservoir this approach to reservoir storage was not meant to model the reservoir management or the river basin as a whole but only to approximate supplemental river flows in the usr that would be needed to allow bmps to be implemented additional work beyond this study is being undertaken to more accurately determine required reservoir storage 3 2 4 effect of upstream bmp implementation a further model modification was made to estimate the se and no3 concentrations that would occur at the upstream end of the river segment in the usr under a bmp scenario if it was assumed to be implemented not only in the usr but also in the irrigated region of the larv between pueblo reservoir and the usr the upstream concentrations under a bmp were computed by multiplying the baseline concentration for each time step by the ratios of irrigated acreage and river length upstream of the usr extending to pueblo reservoir to those within the usr resulting in a factor of 0 93 a similar methodology was used to estimate the reduction in concentrations in flows diverted to canals with headgates located upstream of the usr due to significant spatial variability in computed se and no3 concentrations along the river the concentration changes due to a bmp were computed as averages over the downstream third of the arkansas river segment within the usr 4 results and discussion 4 1 baseline results following model calibration a long term 40 year simulation of the baseline conditions was performed to obtain a better understanding of the spatial distribution of groundwater solute concentrations solute mass loading to streams and stream solute concentrations time averaged concentrations of total dissolved se cse and no3 n c n o 3 n are presented here baseline groundwater concentrations fig 4 vary significantly over the extent of the aquifer values of cse range from the thousands of µgl 1 to nearly zero with more extreme values occurring within portions of the aquifer with slow moving groundwater providing reaction time for se to either be oxidized from shale or chemically reduced out of solution the average value over the region and over the study period is 72 5 µgl 1 similarly c n o 3 n in groundwater ranges from hundreds of mgl 1 to nearly zero averaging 1 9 mgl 1 elevated c n o 3 n is prevalent in areas of intense agricultural production and n fertilizer application interested readers can refer to the usr cropping pattern and fertilizer application rates presented in bailey et al 2014 for comparison with the simulated no3 n concentrations furthermore these localized areas of elevated cse and c n o 3 n within the groundwater contribute a significant quantity of the mass loading of both solutes to the arkansas river figs 5 and 6 results highlight the substantial variability in solute mass loading for different modeled regions and locations along the streams fig 7 shows the 85th percentile value of all of the simulated cse and the median value of simulated c n o 3 n in the arkansas river in the usr averaged over the 40 year baseline simulation period in comparison to the colorado chronic standard for se of 4 6 µg l 1 and the interim standard for total n of 2 0 mg l 1 the 85th percentile and median values are presented for cse and c n o 3 n respectively since the colorado chronic standard for se is defined as the 85th percentile value and for total n as the median value the 85th percentile value of cse peaks at 17 µg l 1 over 3 5 times the standard along the river reach before decreasing to 13 µg l 1 at the end of the reach the median c n o 3 n remains below the interim standard for all but a few kilometers along the river peaking at a little above 2 0 mg l 1 4 2 bmp impact on groundwater solutes the impact of bmps on groundwater concentrations over the usr is illustrated in fig 8 for the case of the ri30 lf30 cs80 rf30 combined bmp fig 8 shows the difference in the computed time averaged groundwater concentration for the baseline condition and the ri30 lf30 cs80 rf30 condition for cse and c n o 3 n in these plots positive blue shades values indicate reductions in concentrations predicted to occur due to bmp implementation while negative red shades values indicate predicted increases in concentrations the cse plot displays substantial spatial variability in the effectiveness of the bmp to lower groundwater concentrations while over the entire region there is an average increase in cse of 8 large regions of the aquifer display a more significant simulated increase or decrease in concentration these stark variations in concentration are due to component bmps having larger effects within some portions of the aquifer than in others as indicated in similar plots of the effects of stand alone bmps in shultz 2017 when combined effects of the individual bmps are largely but not entirely additive fig 8b reveals a more uniform reduction in c n o 3 n for the ri30 lf30 cs80 rf30 bmp with only a few instances of increased concentration again caused by the net effect of the individual bmps the overall spatiotemporal average reductions in groundwater cse and c n o 3 n over the final 11 years of the simulation period are summarized for each of the 54 bmps in fig 9 the bmps are grouped by their respective types with the level of implementation increasing from the most basic on the left of each group to the highest level on the right the single bmps cs erb and rf were found to be effective at reducing groundwater cse by 18 5 and 2 respectively under scenarios with the highest level of implementation while ri and lf increased cse by 13 and 16 respectively under the most aggressive scenarios the reductions in cse under erb and rf bmps are likely due to a diminished availability of no3 to mobilize se as well as to an enhanced chemical reduction of se under the erb scenario the larger reduction predicted for cs is attributed to altered subsurface flow patterns which diminish interaction between seepage induced groundwater flow and the se containing shale formations additionally predicted increases in the groundwater cse that occur under ri and lf result from the combined effects of increases in cse within flow that exits the unsaturated zone to recharge the water table as affected by dissolution evaporative concentration and heterotrophic redox reactions along with corresponding increases in c n o 3 n in recharge water that contribute to inhibited chemical reduction of se and the slowing of return flows by a reduced head gradient to the streams providing groundwater with available no3 and do an extended time to interact with bedrock and near surface shale containing seleno pyrite fig 9b shows lower predicted c n o 3 n under lf and cs bmps compared to the baseline for the ri bmp significant spatial variability in simulated c n o 3 n was found with some locations showing an increase and others a decrease the overall net increase in predicted average c n o 3 n over the region under ri is due in part to the same amount of fertilizer being applied to fields but with less applied water for lowering c n o 3 n the most effective single bmp was rf which at the aggressive level resulted in an average concentration 21 lower than the baseline simulated reductions in se and no3 mass loading and return flow rates to the arkansas river and its tributaries from both groundwater and tailwater runoff over the final 11 years of the simulation period are summarized in fig 10 model output indicates that all bmps would lead to some and often substantial lowering in mass loading of solutes to the arkansas river similar to the findings of bailey et al 2015a b bmps combined of ri lf cs rf and erb have by far the largest simulated reduction in mass loading decreasing no3 loading by 91 and se loading by 86 discrepancies between the values estimated by bailey et al 2015a b and the current predictions could be attributed to a number of different causes including the inclusion of surface runoff mass loading the simulation of stream flow levels using sfr2 and otis and other recent modifications and enhancements further described in shultz 2017 decreases in the return mass loading rates are attributed to two processes changes in the rates of return flow entering the stream system and changes in solute concentrations within the return flows generally speaking model results show that groundwater return flow which makes up the majority of total return flow has higher cse and lower c n o 3 n than the receiving stream water low c n o 3 n values are due in part to denitrifying reactions which occur in the groundwater especially within the riparian zone chemically reducing c n o 3 n thus if the solute concentrations in the return flow are not significantly altered by a bmp a decrease in return flow rate would lead to a corresponding decrease in cse but an increase in c n o 3 n in the streams these processes must be taken into account when evaluating a bmp s effectiveness based on mass loading alone and are further highlighted below by the simulated changes in in stream concentrations the significant decrease in return flow rates shown in fig 10b points to the difficulty described in section 3 2 i e bmps can decrease the rate and alter the pattern of groundwater returning to the stream network results show that aggressive single water bmps could lower return flows by more than 10 20 from their current levels and some combined bmps by more than 50 these changes must be remedied using reservoir storage and release or some other means 4 3 bmp impact on stream concentrations simulated cse and c n o 3 n along the arkansas river under baseline conditions and selected aggressive bmps are shown in fig 11 the bmps include rf30 ri30 erb10 lf30 cs80 and the combined bmp ri30 lf30 cs80 rf30 with the latter representing the upper limit of plausible implementation fig 11a shows that ri30 and lf30 have little effect on cse along the river reach and actually result in an increase in the concentration downstream of the mouth of timpas creek this likely is due at least in part to the considerable increase in groundwater cse west of timpas creek fig 8 which causes a corresponding increase in return flow concentration thus despite ri30 and lf30 substantially reducing the rate of groundwater return flow entering the arkansas river they likely would contribute to a net worsening counter effect including higher groundwater cse which results in a net increase in cse along the arkansas river the rf30 cs80 and erb10 bmps are much more effective in the lowering cse in the river with erb10 being the most impactful fig 11b shows the effects of the same bmps on c n o 3 n here the water bmps result in an increase in c n o 3 n when compared to the baseline this increase in concentration is due to the relatively low c n o 3 n in groundwater return flow that exists under the baseline condition since the groundwater return flow contains a lower c n o 3 n than the stream water due to chemical reduction in the riparian zone huizenga et al 2017 it acts to dilute the stream water therefore when return flow volume is decreased under a water bmp less dilution of the stream water occurs resulting in a higher in stream concentration than under baseline conditions thus despite the reductions in overall mass loading shown in fig 10a the water bmps result in higher stream c n o 3 n there is also noteworthy temporal variability in the simulated concentration decrease along the arkansas river which is depicted for selected bmps in the plots in fig 12 which show percent reduction in cse averaged over the downstream third of the river reach within the usr in addition to showing the large degree of temporal variability these plots reveal a trend of increasing impact over time most water bmps require 5 10 years to achieve their full effect on cse due to the very slow movement of groundwater flow and solutes the land bmps tend to keep increasing in effectiveness throughout the duration of the simulation period implying that that it takes over 40 years for their full effects to be realized in consideration of the time lag in bmp effectiveness spatiotemporal average model output was examined over the final 11 year historical period fig 13 shows the simulated spatial average reduction of the 85th percentile value of cse and of the median c n o 3 n over the last 11 years of the simulation period for each of the 54 bmps while these results offer a general indicator of the overall effectiveness of the bmps the degree of effectiveness varies along the river and over time for both single and combined bmps there is a general correspondence between the predicted change in concentration either positive or negative and the level of implementation the erb is found to be the most effective single bmp for lowering both cse and c n o 3 n resulting in an average reduction of 51 and 33 respectively at the aggressive level furthermore cs rf erb is the most effective type of combined bmp resulting in an average reduction of 53 and 28 respectively at the aggressive level interestingly the ri lf cs rf erb type of combined bmp is predicted to be less effective in lowering concentrations than the erb alone at the aggressive level this is attributed to the significant reduction in groundwater return flow rate that occurs in the implementation of the combined bmp since the erb chemically reduces solutes as they return through the riparian area diminished return flow causes the bmp to be less effective furthermore though ri is generally ineffective in lowering cse as a single bmp in combination with the cs bmp it results in a modest increase about 2 percentage points in the reduction of cse when compared to cs alone at the aggressive level this is attributed in part to alterations in flow patterns under the joint bmp implementation that contribute to its being more effective than the respective single bmps comparing decrease in mass loading fig 10a and reduction in stream concentration fig 13 reveals that there is not necessarily a direct correspondence between the two while bmps such as ri and lf show significant decreases in mass loading simulated stream concentrations remains unchanged or even increase slightly in such cases the reduction in mass loading corresponds primarily to a reduction in return flow rates back to the arkansas river and its tributaries rather than to major alterations in solute processes this is important to note when evaluating the effectiveness of bmps based on impacts to solute mass loading alone fig 13b depicts a number of bmps that are predicted to result in reductions or only small increases in stream c n o 3 n these include the lf erb and rf single bmps lf rf cs rf amd ri rf types of combinations ri lf rf ri cs rf lf cs rf and cs rf erb combinations and the ri lf cs rf erb combination indicating that water bmps in combination with land bmps can result in modest reductions in stream c sewhile keeping increases in c n o 3 n at a minimum 5 summary and conclusions a calibrated stream aquifer flow and solute transport model provides a framework for evaluating the potential of alternative water and land best management practices bmps to decrease se and no3 concentrations in groundwater mass loading to streams and stream concentrations relative to baseline conditions in the lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado many stand alone and combined bmps were simulated for a 40 year period using modflow sfr linked with rt3d otis with the interactive nature of se and no3 allowing for the potential of bmps to lower contamination from both solutes results from this study also could prove useful for other regions facing similar issues offering insight into methods for improving water quality affected by irrigated agriculture modeling outcomes point to several means for achieving significantly lower se and no3 concentrations in the region broad implementation of canal sealing to reduce seepage cs reduced fertilizer application rf and enhanced riparian buffers erb bmps alone and in combination are simulated to effectively decrease the se concentration within the stream and groundwater systems while the land bmps rf and erb are found effective at lowering the no3 concentration results further indicate the benefit of implementing bmps in combination with one another for example jointly implementing cs and rf is predicted to result in a large decrease of se concentration in the river and has some positive effect on no3 concentration as well furthermore the model suggests that joint implementation of cs and reduced irrigation ri or lease fallowing of land lf would enhance the effectiveness of cs alone though ri and lf are not impactful as stand alone bmps the cs80 rf30 erb10 combination appears to hold out the greatest promise for curtailing both se and no3 pollution however it is noteworthy that compliance with the se chronic standard could not be achieved by even the most aggressive simulated bmps this study also highlights the marked spatial and temporal variability in the bmp impacts using this regional scale modeling of broad bmp application as a guide future analysis should focus on gaining an understanding of the best areas within the study region to target localized implementation of bmps additional work is being undertaken to shed light on the economic viability of using these bmps not only to reduce se and no3 concentrations but also to control salinity which adversely impacts crop yield in the hopes of understanding which effective bmps would be most practically feasible other future work should entail understanding the possible effects of bmp implementation on crop yield through changes in water stress and

attenuate nonpoint source pollution and more closely meet regulatory standards for selenium se and nitrogen n in groundwater and streams reduced irrigation ri lease fallowing lf canal sealing to reduce seepage cs reduced fertilizer application rf and enhanced riparian buffers erb are explored as stand alone bmps and in combination at basic to more aggressive levels of implementation the distributed parameter model which couples modflow sfr with rt3d otis predicts impacts that vary significantly over a region encompassing about 500 km2 and across time results suggest that over the course of several decades average se and nitrate nitrogen no3 n groundwater concentrations within the region could be lowered by as much as 23 and 40 respectively using combined bmps average se concentration in the river could be decreased by up to 56 with combined bmps and no3 n concentrations by up to 32 by using erb the cs rf erb combination type may be the most promising for simultaneously lowering both se and no3 n concentrations to insure compliance with colorado water rights and the arkansas river compact with kansas measures must be taken to compensate for altered return flow patterns that will be a consequence of bmp implementation results also point to the need to consider the targeting of bmps to specific locations within the region to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency keywords selenium nitrate modeling groundwater surface water interactions nonpoint source pollution best management practices irrigation 1 introduction many current water quality concerns are linked to irrigated agriculture along with high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds trace elements and nutrients present in irrigation return flows can pose harm to the environment and human health and reduce crop yields the prevalence of trace elements like selenium se in groundwater alfthan et al 1995 hudak 2010 and surface water engberg and sylvester 1993 may et al 2008 systems has become a growing worry in the western united states and around the world in many cases se is present within shale bedrock as seleno pyrite ii fesexs2 x and is mobilized through oxidation reduction redox processes into the groundwater as it returns to streams gates et al 2009 seiler 1995 high groundwater return rates due to inefficient irrigation practices and canal seepage act to promote this mobilization process furthermore studies have shown that dissolved oxygen do and nitrate no3 present in water both accelerate the mobilization of the seleno pyrite and inhibit the chemical reduction of dissolved species of se weres et al 1990 white et al 1991 stillings and amacher 2010 bailey et al 2012 this presence of se has been linked to toxicity problems in wildlife including fish and waterfowl bioaccumulating in the food chain presser et al 1994 hamilton 2004 the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2016 recently released updated recommended standards for se lowering the standard for warm lotic waters to 3 1 µg l 1 and creating separate standards for fish tissue when concentrations in drinking water exceed the usepa standard of 50 µg l 1 livestock and human health are in jeopardy among nutrients that are applied as fertilizer nitrogen n especially in the form of no3 has become a widespread pollutant of concern in surface water and groundwater systems in recent decades spalding and exner 1993 mueller et al 1995 carpenter et al 1998 burrow et al 2010 tesoriero et al 2013 mobilized by applied water no3 is transported to groundwater and streams through inefficiencies in irrigation practices excess amounts can lead to eutrophication of surface water systems promoting the growth of algae resulting in fish kills and biodiversity loss carpenter et al 1998 furthermore elevated no3 concentrations also can lead to methemoglobinemia in infants fan and steinberg 1996 for these reasons the usepa 2018 has set a maximum contaminant level mcl for no3 as n no3 n to 10 mg l 1 because of the environmental and human health risks that these pollutants pose a number of studies have been performed in recent decades to analyze the potential of water and land best management practices bmps to decrease concentrations several studies have reviewed ways of lowering se contamination in water systems engberg et al 1998 examined the san joaquin valley drainage program a multi tiered approach to reducing the se problems caused by irrigation drainage and outlined several methods to decrease se concentrations including preventing se from entering the system capturing or removing it and allaying its effects lin and terry 2003 used a ten cell wetland system to treat irrigation drainage the system removed 70 of se from the water mostly by sorption to sediment and volatilization amweg et al 2003 studied the use of algae and bacteria to reduce dissolved se results from the analysis showed that while total se was decreased there was a significant increase in bioavailable se similarly many studies have examined effective means of lowering no3 concentrations or mass loading in surface water these bmps include enhancing riparian buffers vaché et al 2002 sahu and gu 2009 lee et al 2010 adjacent to streams reducing or more efficiently applying fertilizer trachtenberg and ogg 1994 molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 lee et al 2010 rong and xuefeng 2011 liu et al 2013 altering land tillage management and using vegetative filter strips vaché et al 2002 lee et al 2010 liu et al 2013 and reducing applied irrigation rong and xuefeng 2011 results show that these bmps can effectively lower no3 contamination bmp modeling studies generally have reported impacts as changes in non point source loading to surface water with moderate alterations in management causing a decrease in n loading of 5 10 and aggressive changes in management reducing n loads by 75 90 vaché et al 2002 sahu and gu 2009 lee et al 2010 liu et al 2013 bailey et al 2015a b examined the effectiveness of mitigating water contamination from se by diminishing groundwater return flows to streams and decreasing available no3 in the system thereby inhibiting the mobilization of se and allowing the chemical reduction of se to occur in these studies the effects of five different water and land bmps were analyzed for their impacts on lowering se and no3 mass loading and on groundwater concentrations in the lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado results show that implementing these bmps especially in combination could significantly decrease mass loading to the arkansas river as well as strongly impact groundwater concentrations bailey et al 2015a b in this paper the analyses of bailey et al 2015a b are expanded to examine the effects of bmps on the reactive transport of se and no3 in not only the aquifer but also in streams using a coupled stream aquifer model the newly developed rt3d otis model shultz et al 2018 linked to a modflow model that employs the streamflow routing sfr package simulates the regional scale fate and transport of these solutes in the irrigated agricultural stream aquifer system of the larv under the influence of five bmps reduced applied irrigation fallowing of agricultural lands sealing of irrigation canals reduced applied fertilizer and enhanced riparian buffer zones alone and in combination bmp economic feasibility and their potential impact on crop yields are under consideration in companion studies here we focus on bmp effectiveness in lowering groundwater concentrations decreasing groundwater mass loading of se and no3 to the stream network and lessening stream concentrations for both se and no3 in comparison to historic baseline conditions insights provide useful guidance in controlling se and no3 contamination in similar irrigated agricultural river valleys 2 description of study region the larv fig 1 is located in southeastern colorado situated between pueblo co and the kansas state line the region is largely dominated by agriculture which due to the semi arid climate relies heavily on irrigation through canal networks and pumped water during previous work by researchers at colorado state university csu the area has been studied with a focus on two representative regions an upstream study region usr fig 2 which contains the arkansas river reach extending from the town of manzanola to adobe creek and a downstream study region dsr which encompasses the river reach from the city of lamar to the kansas state line in the present investigation flow and reactive transport of solutes are simulated in the stream aquifer system of the usr the modeled region consists of a 75 km stretch of the arkansas river several tributaries and an alluvial aquifer that interacts with the stream network the usr contains eight main irrigation canals and about 575 pumping wells bring supplemental water to the crops major crops grown in the region include alfalfa corn sorghum and wheat large portions of the aquifer in the larv including within the usr are underlain by or interspersed with near surface marine shale geology scott 1968 sharps 1976 groundwater flows through the aquifer mobilizing solute species from these rocks and their weathered residuum and transporting them to the river system among these solutes are se and uranium u gates et al 2009 bailey et al 2012 gates et al 2016 gates et al 2009 reported on the scale of the groundwater and stream contamination from se and u as well as no3 and other major salts findings from these extensive field data serve as the basis for the numerical modeling described herein in the usr solute reactive transport in the hydrologic system is controlled heavily by irrigation practices natural aquifer recharge by precipitation and water returned to the stream network are augmented by the use of supplemental water for irrigation some of the infiltrated irrigation water percolates below the crop root zone deep percolation recharges the underlying aquifer and accelerates return flows to the river by increasing the head gradient between the aquifer and stream the infiltrated irrigation water has a large supply of do from the atmosphere and no3 oxidized from applied fertilizer additional water recharges the groundwater through seepage from irrigation canals as the groundwater returns to the river network it comes in contact with the underlying shale where the availability of do and no3 as electron donors in the groundwater allows redox reactions to occur with seleno pyrite within the shale groundwater now containing mobilized se flows through the aquifer to the arkansas river and its tributaries water also runs off fields due to inefficiencies in irrigation and returns in surface drainage to the streams this aqueous se exists primarily as selenate seo4 selenite seo3 or organic selenomethionine semet with seo4 representing the majority of the se in the dissolved phase in the larv gates et al 2009 as water continues downstream where it is again applied it picks up more se from groundwater return flows contacting the bedrock and more no3 from fertilizer over time this repeated reuse of water increases concentrations of the surface water and groundwater along the valley depending upon chemical reactions within the streams aquifer and riparian and hyporheic zones adjacent to streams 3 methodology 3 1 model description to accurately simulate hydraulic head and flows in the stream aquifer system of the usr modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 was used along with several modules including the unsaturated zone flow uzf1 niswonger et al 2006 and stream flow routing sfr2 niswonger and prudic 2005 packages the original regional groundwater model developed by morway et al 2013 was modified by shultz et al 2018 to include the sfr2 package which allows for the simulation of flows in the arkansas river and its tributaries groundwater and stream flow rates along with sinks and sources are taken from the modflow sfr output and are used as input forcing variables in the rt3d otis reactive transport model the rt3d otis model represents a coupling of the uzf rt3d model developed by bailey et al 2013 to simulate unsaturated and saturated zone groundwater reactive transport with a otis qual2e model bailey and ahmadi 2014 which simulates reactive transport of interacting solutes in a stream network a summary of the linked modeling processes is depicted in fig 3 this model coupling of groundwater and streams and of flow and reactive solute transport along with its calibration testing and application to simulate baseline conditions in the larv is described in detail in shultz et al 2018 the coupled model depicts the cycling of se and n along with do in the saturated and unsaturated aquifer zones and in streams it incorporates several aqueous sinks and sources including infiltrated rainfall and irrigation evapotranspiration surface water seepage and pumping from groundwater wells chemical reactions for aqueous and sorbed phases of se and n are represented including autotrophic and heterotrophic reduction and oxidation sorption volatilization immobilization and mineralization reaction rates are modeled using first order kinetics with monod terms employed to account for the effect of multiple chemical species on the reactions zheng and bennett 2002 the model has been calibrated and tested against an extensive data set consisting of groundwater levels from 88 monitoring wells groundwater return flows to the river streamflow and water levels remotely sensed evapotranspiration groundwater solute concentrations from the monitoring wells se and no3 groundwater mass loading to the river and stream se and no3 concentrations at 10 locations 7 along the arkansas river 3 along tributaries having performed well in simulating baseline water and solute mass in the stream aquifer system of the larv the model serves as the basis for the bmp simulations presented here a brief overview of the model highlighting major and exemplary features is laid out here to establish its credibility as a tool for bmp assessment the reader is directed to shultz et al 2018 for a detailed description of model construction model parameters and model input data to simulate

respectively additional parameter adjustments were performed by shultz et al 2018 for the coupled model in light of data on streamflow stream solute concentrations and solute mass loading to the river in the modflow component of the coupled model morway et al 2013 used the river package to represent surface water for stream aquifer interaction in the larv the addition of the sfr2 package in the modflow model by shultz et al 2018 allowed flow in the streams to be simulated for use by the rt3d otis solute transport component without modifying values of aquifer parameters originally calibrated by morway et al 2013 streambed conductance was manually adjusted to best match the measured data on gaged stream flow groundwater hydraulic heads satellite remote sensing estimated et estimated stream gain from groundwater and estimated total unaccounted for stream gain from a river mass balance following the adjustments to the modflow sfr component of the coupled model the rt3d otis component was calibrated by altering parameter values within ranges reported in the literature in an attempt to match observed groundwater concentrations solute mass loading to the arkansas river and in stream concentrations for se seo3 seo4 and no3 n an iterative process of manual calibration followed by automated calibration with the pest parameter estimation doherty 2016 software was used to obtain the final parameter values for a calibration period from june 19th 2006 to march 20th 2008 the calibrated model was then tested against data for the period from march 21st 2008 to october 31st 2009 3 2 assessment of bmps 3 2 1 simulation period to simulate reactive transport in the stream aquifer system for each of the considered bmps the rt3d otis model was applied to the period 1999 2009 with this period then repeated successively three and half times to produce a 40 year long simulation this approach allowed a direct comparison of flow and water quality conditions simulated under bmp scenarios to those under historic baseline conditions that spanned very dry to very wet years the flow rate in the arkansas river averaged over four stream gauges within the study region was analyzed for each year within the 1999 2009 study period the average annual values within the study period ranged from 25 very dry to 183 very wet of the long term average flow rate for the period 1975 2012 for five of the years within the study period the average river flow exceeded 90 of the long term average the average river flow across the entire study period was 81 of the long term average flow with a coefficient of variation of 51 gates et al 2016 the extension of the simulation period to a total of 40 years was necessary to account for long lag times which commonly occur between field level bmp implementation and corresponding water quality responses in both the groundwater and the river network meals et al 2010 such lags are due in part to groundwater residence time taking as long as several decades for infiltrated water in several areas of the irrigated region to reach streams as reported by bailey et al 2015b for the larv 3 2 2 details of considered bmps the bmps considered in the analysis to lower se and no3 groundwater concentrations solute mass loading and stream concentrations are referenced as 1 reduced irrigation ri 2 lease fallowing lf 3 canal sealing to reduce seepage cs 4 reduced fertilizer application rf and 5 enhanced riparian buffers erb these bmps were analyzed individually over three levels or degrees of implementation in addition to the assessment of single bmp scenarios bmps in combination were evaluated the full set of considered bmp scenarios along with nomenclature is summarized in table 1 in the discussion that follows bmps are separated into water bmps ri lf and cs and land bmps rf and erb ri bmps constitute a change to more efficient irrigation practices with less water applied to fields as the level of implementation increases this improved efficiency could be achieved by converting traditional surface irrigation to more efficient irrigation methods such as sprinkler or drip or by improving surface irrigation practices grading the land surface altering rates and timing of irrigation application etc the rationale for ri bmps is the supposition that decreased water applications will lower surface water runoff and deep percolation from irrigated fields this will in turn lower the dissolution and mobilization of surface and subsurface solutes and decrease rates and mass loading of return flows to streams leading to net reductions in stream solute concentrations in this study an attempt is made to avoid bmps that would cause deficit irrigation of crops resulting in considered ri scenarios of 10 20 and 30 below simulated baseline amounts the applied water on each cultivated field was decreased by a specified percentage thus necessitating a change to irrigation infiltration values in the uzf input file and a corresponding reduction in the modeled canal diversions lf and cs scenarios also are thought to potentially lessen the mobilization and transport of solute mass through the stream aquifer system leading to lower concentrations lf bmps entail fallowing irrigated fields for the purpose of leasing the water in excess of crop consumptive use to cities fallowing typically occurs for three out of ten years with associated water rights remaining with the irrigators in the current study an lf scenario was simulated as a portion ranging from 10 20 and 30 of the cultivated fields fallowed with no applied irrigation water during any given year as described by morway et al 2013 lands were fallowed based on crop type with corn hay and alfalfa fallowed before higher valued crops such as melons and onions this was accomplished by removing irrigation water infiltration from the uzf input file decreasing canal diversions and replacing crop et rate with a naturally vegetated et rate additionally fertilizer application was removed from the lf fields in the rt3d otis input files canals are assumed to be sealed using polymers such as linear anionic polyacrylamide susfalk et al 2008 martin 2015 to decrease seepage losses in cs scenarios currently canals in the usr are not sealed or lined and a significant amount of conveyed water is lost as seepage to groundwater to lessen modeled seepage the conductance of the canals is lowered by modifying streambed conductance in the river package resulting in seepage reductions of 40 60 and 80 from baseline conditions for the three levels of implementation canal diversions are decreased accordingly in the larv farmers commonly apply n fertilizers in excess of what is required for optimal crop yields halvorson et al 2002 in bmps that include rf the input amount of fertilizer applied to all fields is lowered in the rt3d otis input files by amounts 10 20 and 30 from the baseline values these levels of reduced fertilizer application are judged reasonable in view of the present practice of over application in the larv however the expected impact on crop yields would need to be carefully assessed in a next step toward implementation rf scenarios are expected to lower nitrification mitigating the role that excess no3 plays in dissolving se from shale and weathered shale through autotrophic redox reactions and through inhibition of the chemical reduction of seo4 bailey et al 2012 changing the dimensions vegetative mix and organic carbon composition of the riparian corridor adjacent to the streams to accelerate the chemical reduction and volatilization of dissolve no3 and se is assumed in the erb scenarios such alterations are recognized as promising approaches for improving the attenuation of nonpoint source pollution to streams tabacchi et al 2000 smith et al 2008 dosskey et al 2010 to represent the considered erb scenarios in the model chemical reduction rates for model cells in delineated riparian areas were increased by factors of 2 5 and 10 from those under baseline conditions while these factors result in chemical reduction rates that are within the feasible range reported in the literature there is yet little information available on the practicality of implementing such increases within the modeled region effective and economical ways to carry out these amendments within the larv will need to be studied in a next step toward implementation a total of 54 bmp scenarios including 39 combined bmps were analyzed for their effectiveness in decreasing se and no3 contamination in the usr due to the uncertainty associated with the practicality of its implementation erb was considered only as a single bmp and within a limited number of combined bmp scenarios every combined bmp scenario that included any of the remaining four single bmps was simulated over a range of implementation levels though scenarios that combined bmps at different levels of implementation e g high level of implementation of one bmp in combination with a basic level implementation of another could be tested to limit the total number of considered bmps and the associated computational requirements only single bmps with the same respective levels of implementation were combined together for this study additionally for the single bmps smaller increments of implementation level were examined to more accurately estimate the relationship of implementation level to the resulting degree of se and no3 reduction 3 2 3 compliance with water law apart from input file modifications that were made for the single bmps other model modifications were made to simulate compliance with colorado water rights and the arkansas river compact between colorado and kansas since water bmps will lead to altered flow patterns within the arkansas river new storage accounts likely will need to be set up in one or more on stream or off stream reservoirs application of water bmps would involve reduced diversions of river flows into canals and would result in diminished surface and groundwater return flows to the river generally this causes net increases in river flow during the irrigation season compared to baseline conditions and net reductions in river flow during the off season new reservoir storage accounts would allow for water to be stored during times of net excess river flow due to reduced diversions to canals and to be released to the river over time to make up for net stream depletions due to reduced groundwater return flows pueblo reservoir to the west of the usr see fig 1 is assumed to be available for storing water to be used for mitigating the impact of alternative bmps flows in the arkansas river at the upstream end of the segment within the usr were altered within bmp model simulations so that river flows leaving the usr at the downstream end would remain the same under each bmp as they were during baseline conditions this assumes that changes in reservoir management would be made to enable reservoir releases resulting in properly timed river flows to compute the required storage and releases from pueblo reservoir each bmp scenario was first simulated with the same river flows entering the usr as under the baseline condition next the river flow computed for the bmp at the downstream end of the usr was compared with that computed for the baseline condition the net amount that would need to be stored in pueblo reservoir and then released to make up for the flow deficit was computed as the difference between the simulated baseline and bmp flows in cases where the baseline flows were less than the bmp flows typically during the irrigation season water was assumed to be released from reservoir storage to make up the difference when computed baseline flows exceed simulated bmp flows at the downstream end of the usr usually during the winter months typically the simulated overall total volume of water leaving the usr for a given year is greater under a water bmp than under the baseline this results primarily from a calculated decline in non beneficial consumptive use from naturally vegetated or fallow fields resulting from a predicted increase in depth to the water table in the region due to bmp implementation niemann et al 2011 morway et al 2013 this excess water returns to the river as subsurface flow and is routed to the downstream end of the usr with only the water necessary to supplement low flows and to account for reservoir evaporation losses assumed to be stored in the reservoir water lost to reservoir evaporation is calculated based upon the additional storage volume in the reservoir water is assumed stored in the reservoir so that at the end of the 11 year simulation period there is approximately no storage remaining in the reservoir this approach to reservoir storage was not meant to model the reservoir management or the river basin as a whole but only to approximate supplemental river flows in the usr that would be needed to allow bmps to be implemented additional work beyond this study is being undertaken to more accurately determine required reservoir storage 3 2 4 effect of upstream bmp implementation a further model modification was made to estimate the se and no3 concentrations that would occur at the upstream end of the river segment in the usr under a bmp scenario if it was assumed to be implemented not only in the usr but also in the irrigated region of the larv between pueblo reservoir and the usr the upstream concentrations under a bmp were computed by multiplying the baseline concentration for each time step by the ratios of irrigated acreage and river length upstream of the usr extending to pueblo reservoir to those within the usr resulting in a factor of 0 93 a similar methodology was used to estimate the reduction in concentrations in flows diverted to canals with headgates located upstream of the usr due to significant spatial variability in computed se and no3 concentrations along the river the concentration changes due to a bmp were computed as averages over the downstream third of the arkansas river segment within the usr 4 results and discussion 4 1 baseline results following model calibration a long term 40 year simulation of the baseline conditions was performed to obtain a better understanding of the spatial distribution of groundwater solute concentrations solute mass loading to streams and stream solute concentrations time averaged concentrations of total dissolved se cse and no3 n c n o 3 n are presented here baseline groundwater concentrations fig 4 vary significantly over the extent of the aquifer values of cse range from the thousands of µgl 1 to nearly zero with more extreme values occurring within portions of the aquifer with slow moving groundwater providing reaction time for se to either be oxidized from shale or chemically reduced out of solution the average value over the region and over the study period is 72 5 µgl 1 similarly c n o 3 n in groundwater ranges from hundreds of mgl 1 to nearly zero averaging 1 9 mgl 1 elevated c n o 3 n is prevalent in areas of intense agricultural production and n fertilizer application interested readers can refer to the usr cropping pattern and fertilizer application rates presented in bailey et al 2014 for comparison with the simulated no3 n concentrations furthermore these localized areas of elevated cse and c n o 3 n within the groundwater contribute a significant quantity of the mass loading of both solutes to the arkansas river figs 5 and 6 results highlight the substantial variability in solute mass loading for different modeled regions and locations along the streams fig 7 shows the 85th percentile value of all of the simulated cse and the median value of simulated c n o 3 n in the arkansas river in the usr averaged over the 40 year baseline simulation period in comparison to the colorado chronic standard for se of 4 6 µg l 1 and the interim standard for total n of 2 0 mg l 1 the 85th percentile and median values are presented for cse and c n o 3 n respectively since the colorado chronic standard for se is defined as the 85th percentile value and for total n as the median value the 85th percentile value of cse peaks at 17 µg l 1 over 3 5 times the standard along the river reach before decreasing to 13 µg l 1 at the end of the reach the median c n o 3 n remains below the interim standard for all but a few kilometers along the river peaking at a little above 2 0 mg l 1 4 2 bmp impact on groundwater solutes the impact of bmps on groundwater concentrations over the usr is illustrated in fig 8 for the case of the ri30 lf30 cs80 rf30 combined bmp fig 8 shows the difference in the computed time averaged groundwater concentration for the baseline condition and the ri30 lf30 cs80 rf30 condition for cse and c n o 3 n in these plots positive blue shades values indicate reductions in concentrations predicted to occur due to bmp implementation while negative red shades values indicate predicted increases in concentrations the cse plot displays substantial spatial variability in the effectiveness of the bmp to lower groundwater concentrations while over the entire region there is an average increase in cse of 8 large regions of the aquifer display a more significant simulated increase or decrease in concentration these stark variations in concentration are due to component bmps having larger effects within some portions of the aquifer than in others as indicated in similar plots of the effects of stand alone bmps in shultz 2017 when combined effects of the individual bmps are largely but not entirely additive fig 8b reveals a more uniform reduction in c n o 3 n for the ri30 lf30 cs80 rf30 bmp with only a few instances of increased concentration again caused by the net effect of the individual bmps the overall spatiotemporal average reductions in groundwater cse and c n o 3 n over the final 11 years of the simulation period are summarized for each of the 54 bmps in fig 9 the bmps are grouped by their respective types with the level of implementation increasing from the most basic on the left of each group to the highest level on the right the single bmps cs erb and rf were found to be effective at reducing groundwater cse by 18 5 and 2 respectively under scenarios with the highest level of implementation while ri and lf increased cse by 13 and 16 respectively under the most aggressive scenarios the reductions in cse under erb and rf bmps are likely due to a diminished availability of no3 to mobilize se as well as to an enhanced chemical reduction of se under the erb scenario the larger reduction predicted for cs is attributed to altered subsurface flow patterns which diminish interaction between seepage induced groundwater flow and the se containing shale formations additionally predicted increases in the groundwater cse that occur under ri and lf result from the combined effects of increases in cse within flow that exits the unsaturated zone to recharge the water table as affected by dissolution evaporative concentration and heterotrophic redox reactions along with corresponding increases in c n o 3 n in recharge water that contribute to inhibited chemical reduction of se and the slowing of return flows by a reduced head gradient to the streams providing groundwater with available no3 and do an extended time to interact with bedrock and near surface shale containing seleno pyrite fig 9b shows lower predicted c n o 3 n under lf and cs bmps compared to the baseline for the ri bmp significant spatial variability in simulated c n o 3 n was found with some locations showing an increase and others a decrease the overall net increase in predicted average c n o 3 n over the region under ri is due in part to the same amount of fertilizer being applied to fields but with less applied water for lowering c n o 3 n the most effective single bmp was rf which at the aggressive level resulted in an average concentration 21 lower than the baseline simulated reductions in se and no3 mass loading and return flow rates to the arkansas river and its tributaries from both groundwater and tailwater runoff over the final 11 years of the simulation period are summarized in fig 10 model output indicates that all bmps would lead to some and often substantial lowering in mass loading of solutes to the arkansas river similar to the findings of bailey et al 2015a b bmps combined of ri lf cs rf and erb have by far the largest simulated reduction in mass loading decreasing no3 loading by 91 and se loading by 86 discrepancies between the values estimated by bailey et al 2015a b and the current predictions could be attributed to a number of different causes including the inclusion of surface runoff mass loading the simulation of stream flow levels using sfr2 and otis and other recent modifications and enhancements further described in shultz 2017 decreases in the return mass loading rates are attributed to two processes changes in the rates of return flow entering the stream system and changes in solute concentrations within the return flows generally speaking model results show that groundwater return flow which makes up the majority of total return flow has higher cse and lower c n o 3 n than the receiving stream water low c n o 3 n values are due in part to denitrifying reactions which occur in the groundwater especially within the riparian zone chemically reducing c n o 3 n thus if the solute concentrations in the return flow are not significantly altered by a bmp a decrease in return flow rate would lead to a corresponding decrease in cse but an increase in c n o 3 n in the streams these processes must be taken into account when evaluating a bmp s effectiveness based on mass loading alone and are further highlighted below by the simulated changes in in stream concentrations the significant decrease in return flow rates shown in fig 10b points to the difficulty described in section 3 2 i e bmps can decrease the rate and alter the pattern of groundwater returning to the stream network results show that aggressive single water bmps could lower return flows by more than 10 20 from their current levels and some combined bmps by more than 50 these changes must be remedied using reservoir storage and release or some other means 4 3 bmp impact on stream concentrations simulated cse and c n o 3 n along the arkansas river under baseline conditions and selected aggressive bmps are shown in fig 11 the bmps include rf30 ri30 erb10 lf30 cs80 and the combined bmp ri30 lf30 cs80 rf30 with the latter representing the upper limit of plausible implementation fig 11a shows that ri30 and lf30 have little effect on cse along the river reach and actually result in an increase in the concentration downstream of the mouth of timpas creek this likely is due at least in part to the considerable increase in groundwater cse west of timpas creek fig 8 which causes a corresponding increase in return flow concentration thus despite ri30 and lf30 substantially reducing the rate of groundwater return flow entering the arkansas river they likely would contribute to a net worsening counter effect including higher groundwater cse which results in a net increase in cse along the arkansas river the rf30 cs80 and erb10 bmps are much more effective in the lowering cse in the river with erb10 being the most impactful fig 11b shows the effects of the same bmps on c n o 3 n here the water bmps result in an increase in c n o 3 n when compared to the baseline this increase in concentration is due to the relatively low c n o 3 n in groundwater return flow that exists under the baseline condition since the groundwater return flow contains a lower c n o 3 n than the stream water due to chemical reduction in the riparian zone huizenga et al 2017 it acts to dilute the stream water therefore when return flow volume is decreased under a water bmp less dilution of the stream water occurs resulting in a higher in stream concentration than under baseline conditions thus despite the reductions in overall mass loading shown in fig 10a the water bmps result in higher stream c n o 3 n there is also noteworthy temporal variability in the simulated concentration decrease along the arkansas river which is depicted for selected bmps in the plots in fig 12 which show percent reduction in cse averaged over the downstream third of the river reach within the usr in addition to showing the large degree of temporal variability these plots reveal a trend of increasing impact over time most water bmps require 5 10 years to achieve their full effect on cse due to the very slow movement of groundwater flow and solutes the land bmps tend to keep increasing in effectiveness throughout the duration of the simulation period implying that that it takes over 40 years for their full effects to be realized in consideration of the time lag in bmp effectiveness spatiotemporal average model output was examined over the final 11 year historical period fig 13 shows the simulated spatial average reduction of the 85th percentile value of cse and of the median c n o 3 n over the last 11 years of the simulation period for each of the 54 bmps while these results offer a general indicator of the overall effectiveness of the bmps the degree of effectiveness varies along the river and over time for both single and combined bmps there is a general correspondence between the predicted change in concentration either positive or negative and the level of implementation the erb is found to be the most effective single bmp for lowering both cse and c n o 3 n resulting in an average reduction of 51 and 33 respectively at the aggressive level furthermore cs rf erb is the most effective type of combined bmp resulting in an average reduction of 53 and 28 respectively at the aggressive level interestingly the ri lf cs rf erb type of combined bmp is predicted to be less effective in lowering concentrations than the erb alone at the aggressive level this is attributed to the significant reduction in groundwater return flow rate that occurs in the implementation of the combined bmp since the erb chemically reduces solutes as they return through the riparian area diminished return flow causes the bmp to be less effective furthermore though ri is generally ineffective in lowering cse as a single bmp in combination with the cs bmp it results in a modest increase about 2 percentage points in the reduction of cse when compared to cs alone at the aggressive level this is attributed in part to alterations in flow patterns under the joint bmp implementation that contribute to its being more effective than the respective single bmps comparing decrease in mass loading fig 10a and reduction in stream concentration fig 13 reveals that there is not necessarily a direct correspondence between the two while bmps such as ri and lf show significant decreases in mass loading simulated stream concentrations remains unchanged or even increase slightly in such cases the reduction in mass loading corresponds primarily to a reduction in return flow rates back to the arkansas river and its tributaries rather than to major alterations in solute processes this is important to note when evaluating the effectiveness of bmps based on impacts to solute mass loading alone fig 13b depicts a number of bmps that are predicted to result in reductions or only small increases in stream c n o 3 n these include the lf erb and rf single bmps lf rf cs rf amd ri rf types of combinations ri lf rf ri cs rf lf cs rf and cs rf erb combinations and the ri lf cs rf erb combination indicating that water bmps in combination with land bmps can result in modest reductions in stream c sewhile keeping increases in c n o 3 n at a minimum 5 summary and conclusions a calibrated stream aquifer flow and solute transport model provides a framework for evaluating the potential of alternative water and land best management practices bmps to decrease se and no3 concentrations in groundwater mass loading to streams and stream concentrations relative to baseline conditions in the lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado many stand alone and combined bmps were simulated for a 40 year period using modflow sfr linked with rt3d otis with the interactive nature of se and no3 allowing for the potential of bmps to lower contamination from both solutes results from this study also could prove useful for other regions facing similar issues offering insight into methods for improving water quality affected by irrigated agriculture modeling outcomes point to several means for achieving significantly lower se and no3 concentrations in the region broad implementation of canal sealing to reduce seepage cs reduced fertilizer application rf and enhanced riparian buffers erb bmps alone and in combination are simulated to effectively decrease the se concentration within the stream and groundwater systems while the land bmps rf and erb are found effective at lowering the no3 concentration results further indicate the benefit of implementing bmps in combination with one another for example jointly implementing cs and rf is predicted to result in a large decrease of se concentration in the river and has some positive effect on no3 concentration as well furthermore the model suggests that joint implementation of cs and reduced irrigation ri or lease fallowing of land lf would enhance the effectiveness of cs alone though ri and lf are not impactful as stand alone bmps the cs80 rf30 erb10 combination appears to hold out the greatest promise for curtailing both se and no3 pollution however it is noteworthy that compliance with the se chronic standard could not be achieved by even the most aggressive simulated bmps this study also highlights the marked spatial and temporal variability in the bmp impacts using this regional scale modeling of broad bmp application as a guide future analysis should focus on gaining an understanding of the best areas within the study region to target localized implementation of bmps additional work is being undertaken to shed light on the economic viability of using these bmps not only to reduce se and no3 concentrations but also to control salinity which adversely impacts crop yield in the hopes of understanding which effective bmps would be most practically feasible other future work should entail understanding the possible effects of bmp implementation on crop yield through changes in water stress and

6946,low impact development lid practices are effective in restoring natural hydrological processes but they may be affected by groundwater and pose additional risk to groundwater dynamics and contamination in shallow groundwater conditions their performance in shallow groundwater is not well understood due to monitoring difficulty and the deficiency of modeling tools the storm water management model swmm is an urban hydrology hydraulic model that has been widely used to evaluate the performance of lid practices however it cannot accurately simulate the hydrological processes of lid practices in shallow groundwater this study presents the development calibration validation and testing of a modified swmm swmm lid gw that incorporates groundwater feedbacks into lid simulations the hydrological performance of lid practices under different environmental conditions was simulated based on which the impacts of initial groundwater table depth rainfall type and in situ soil type were evaluated and a number of general nonlinear multivariate formulas were proposed to predict the hydrologic performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater environment and support the feasibility analysis of lid practices before project implementation the reduction of exfiltration and increase of groundwater drainage in shallow groundwater accounted for a significant proportion of the water budget of lid practices the influence of shallow groundwater was greater for shallower groundwater tables in less permeable in situ soils and for events of higher intensities and longer durations however due to the dominant role of shallow groundwater the impacts of both rainfall type and in situ soil type on the hydrological performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater were minimal in general in contrast to the impacts on deep groundwater tables the swmm lid gw outperformed the current swmm for a wide range of groundwater conditions particularly for locations in which the groundwater table frequently rises to 1 0 m or less below ground keywords stormwater management swmm low impact development green infrastructure shallow groundwater sponge city 1 introduction amidst efforts to mitigate urban water problems low impact development lid practices fletcher et al 2015 have received a great deal of attention in recent years due to their good performance in

however the implementation and performances of lid practices can be restricted in shallow groundwater areas zhang and chui 2017 lid practices may form groundwater mounds ku et al 1992 göbel et al 2004 locatelli et al 2015 which may limit infiltration from the surface and exfiltration to in situ soils brown et al 2013 heilweil et al 2015 fox et al 2018 in addition lid practices may lead to groundwater contamination because infiltrated water only travels a short distance over a relatively short time before reaching the groundwater table weiss et al 2008 finally groundwater a valuable water resource may also be drained out and become additional water load to downstream drainage infrastructures i e pipelines storage tanks when the groundwater table rises above the underdrain herrera 2013 although the problems associated with shallow groundwater are clear the performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater has not been widely studied and well understood so far he and davis 2010 evaluated the impact of multiple design features i e media and in situ soil types initial soil moisture and area ratio on the underdrain outflow of a single bioretention cell using comsol multiphysics however they did not consider the dynamics of groundwater and only simulated one fixed groundwater table locatelli et al 2015 and zhang and chui 2017 evaluated the impact of different design features i e media soil type underdrain size and environmental conditions i e in situ soil type thickness of the unsaturated zone on the hydrologic performance of infiltration trench and bioretention cell respectively they offered recommendations on the minimum distance between the lid bottom and the groundwater table and media soil type however they were limited at facility scale while catchment scale understanding are also of importance a few studies have examined either the hydrologic performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater trinh and chui 2013 chui and trinh 2016 or the impact of lid practices on groundwater at catchment scale endreny and collins 2009 bhaskar et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 however they did not consider situations in which the groundwater table reaches or approaches the bottom of the lid practices and the underdrain their findings are also site specific and are difficult to be generalized to other places with different environmental conditions lid groundwater interactions can be effectively examined using numerical models different model parameters can be easily varied to evaluate their influence to the hydrological performance of lid practices there are a number of existing models that have potential to simulate lid practices in shallow groundwater environment for instance some variably saturated flow software e g comsol multiphysics vs2d hydrus 1d 2d 3d can solve richards equation to simulate subsurface hydrological conditions beneath lid practices he and davis 2010 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 however these kinds of models normally can only simulate lid practices in a facility scale and they cannot accurately evaluate processes of surface runoff generation particularly at larger scale some surface subsurface hydrological models e g mike she gsflow shetran gssha velma and swat modflow are also possible choices they are more powerful in rainfall runoff simulation and can handle larger scale studies trinh and chui 2013 hoghooghi et al 2018 however most of these models operate in very coarse temporal resolutions i e daily or sub daily and coarse spatial resolutions i e few square kilometers with spatial resolution of 50 m so lid practices can only be simulated in an aggregated configuration e g 50 m 50 m some models have also been developed or improved recently to better simulate the subsurface processes of lid practices i e bioretention cells and vegetated filter strips in shallow groundwater condition more accurately i e sw mm vfsmod roldin et al 2013 locatelli et al 2015 herrera et al 2017 massoudieh et al 2017 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 however the performance of these models in simulating lid practices have not been widely recognized among all different models that can simulate lid practices the storm water management model swmm is one of the most reputable and widely applied ones mainly due to its open source code simple structure and low input requirement rossman 2015 swmm formed the basis of the lid modules in a number of hydrological models e g mike urban sustain infoswmm mwh soft inc 2005 lee et al 2012 and has been applied in different lid practice related studies for example it has been applied to verify the hydrological and pollution control performance of lid practices abi aad et al 2009 petrucci et al 2012 lee et al 2013 and to identify the dominant factors that influence lid performance qin et al 2013 palla and gnecco 2015 abdul aziz and al amin 2016 furthermore the integrated performance of a series of lid practices i e treatment train system eric et al 2013 jayasooriya et al 2016 and the performance of conventional drainage integrated systems in handling extreme rainfall events chui et al 2016 kong et al 2017 and combined sewer overflows montalto et al 2007 have been evaluated using swmm in addition swmm was applied to determine the optimal selection yang and chui 2018b design e g

cuerva et al 2018 huang et al 2018 however swmm is not as applicable for shallow groundwater for two major reasons first it only assumes a linearized soil water retention curve for the unsaturated flow and the routing of groundwater flow is spatially lumped lee et al 2018 second the exfiltration out of lid practices is simulated using a fixed rate which together with other hydrological processes of lid practices the percolation rate from the soil layer to the storage layer the underdrain flow out of lid practices etc are separated from groundwater conditions some preliminary studies integrated swmm with other software for subsurface flow simulations for example sansalone et al 2013 chen 2014 and mooers et al 2018 used swmm or pcswmm to simulate the rainfall runoff processes of lid but they used vs2d or modflow to simulate subsurface flows however they only realized one way coupling rowan 2001 and yergeau 2010 coupled swmm with modflow on a two way basis but did not focus on lid simulations as there was no lid module in swmm at that time in addition lee et al 2018 is working on a project to improve the subsurface flow algorithm of lid practices in swmm but the work is still in progress to address the research gaps described previously this study develops an improved swmm swmm lid gw by creating an interface to link processes of lid practices with groundwater it should be noted that the swmm lid gw is not a fully integrated surface subsurface hydrological model it improves the simulation of lid practices in swmm by better accounting for groundwater conditions to the best of our knowledge there is no similar improvement made to swmm in peer review literature moreover we calibrate and validate swmm lid gw through a multi objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii based on a field case study with lid implementations in kitsap county united states finally we conduct a group of hypothetical case studies to compare the performance of swmm lid gw with the current swmm identify the situations in which swmm lid gw is more applicable and evaluate the impact of different environmental conditions i e different rainfall intensities rainfall durations groundwater conditions in situ soil types on the hydrological performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater generalized the results into a few dimensionless formulas to predict the hydrological performance of lid in shallow groundwater environment and identify the situations in which swmm lid gw is more applicable 2 methodology 2 1 swmm lid gw development 2 1 1 hydrological calculation of lid practice an lid practice is conceptualized as a combination of multiple horizontal layers in swmm in which water is stored and moved between layers as shown in the top left corner of fig 1 different lid practices differ in the number and type of layers for example bioretention cells can include surface soil and storage layers while porous pavements can have an additional pavement layer between the surface layer and the soil layer or storage layer during each simulation swmm calculates the amount of water stores within each layer and moving between layers water can infiltrate into the pavement layer or the soil layer from the surface layer and water in excess of the infiltration capacity can become surface runoff furthermore water can evaporate or percolate from the soil layer into the storage layer after which it can either exfiltrate into the surrounding soil or be drained out if there is an underdrain overflow can be generated when the lid practice is filled up rossman 2015 fig 1 to incorporate groundwater feedback into swmm the governing equations of the exfiltration and underdrain flow of lid practices were modified to be functions of groundwater table depth the exfiltration and underdrain flow are the two hydrological processes of lid practices that are most closely linked to groundwater they are also the two major outflows of the lid practices brown et al 2013 walsh et al 2014 although the equation of percolation from the soil layer to the storage layer was not modified the situation of the groundwater table reaching the soil layer is considered through water balance budgeting 1 underdrain flow the lower left corner of fig 1 shows the governing equations of the underdrain flow and exfiltration in swmm lid gw and the current swmm in the current swmm the underdrain is simulated as a submerged orifice the flow out of which is calculated as a function of the storage depth within the lid practice in an exponential form upper part of eq 1 the two coefficients are determined by the size of the underdrain and the density of the perforations on the underdrain surface walsh et al 2014 however the current swmm neglects the situation in which the groundwater table rises beyond the underdrain and exceeds the storage depth within the lid practice in this situation it the height of the groundwater table above the underdrain should determine the magnitude of the underdrain flow but not the storage depth thus the governing equation has been modified when the height of the groundwater table above the underdrain is less than the water storage depth inside the lid practice the underdrain flow follows the same equation as the current swmm however the height of the groundwater table above the bottom of the lid practice is used instead of the storage depth when the groundwater table is shallower than the water storage level lower part of eq 1 1 f drain coeff h h offset expon i f h h gw c o e f f h gw h offset expon i f h h gw where coeff and expon are the two coefficients of underdrain h offset is the offset height of underdrain representing the distance between the underdrain and the bottom of lid practice h is the storage depth within the lid practice and h gw is the distance between groundwater table and the bottom of lid practice 2 exfiltration in the current swmm the maximum exfiltration rate out of the storage layer of lid practice is equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the in situ soil fig 1 this simplification implies a vertical head gradient of one however the moisture content and thus the head gradient of the in situ soils fluctuates in shallow groundwater and the maximum exfiltration rate may then change accordingly the exfiltration rate has been modified to be a function of the moisture content of the in situ soils based on an analytical equation for the exfiltration rate from the bottom of infiltration systems eq 2 this equation was proposed by crosbie et al 2005 and was shown to be valid for infiltration trenches by roldin et al 2013 and locatelli et al 2015 the moisture content of in situ soil near the bottom of lid practice required in eq 2 is calculated based on the van genuchten 1980 equation which describes the soil moisture as a function of the pressure head near the bottom of lid practice eq 3 2 f exfil θ s θ θ s θ i k s 3 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the in situ soils θ r θ s and θ i are the residual saturated and initial moisture content of in situ soils θ is the current moisture content of in situ soils near the bottom of lid practice which varies between θ r and θ s ψ is the pressure head near the bottom of lid practice assuming hydraulic equilibrium and thus equals the distance between the bottom of lid practice and groundwater table and α and n are the parameters in the van genuchten equation the maximum exfiltration rate changes and equals k s when the soil moisture is equal to the initial value with no groundwater mound it can reach higher than k s when the groundwater table soil moisture is lower than the initial values it can also gradually approach zero when soil reaches saturation and the groundwater table rises to the bottom of lid practice the exfiltration rate would be better estimated as the dissipation rate of the groundwater mound when the wetting front of a groundwater mound reaches or rises beyond the bottom of lid practice marino 1974 however it is assumed to be zero in this study because the dissipation rate is considered negligible compared to the other water fluxes during large rainfall events this same simplification has been adopted by locatelli et al 2015 when the equation was applied to infiltration trenches 3 water balance within lid practice to ensure a water balance within the lid practice the current swmm monitors and restricts inflows and outflows of each layer at each time step using bioretention cells as an example when the storage layer is fully saturated the percolation from the soil to the storage layer i e inflow of the storage layer would not exceed the summation of the exfiltration and underdrain flow i e outflow of the storage layer if the calculated percolation rate is higher than the outflow the percolation rate would be set to equal the outflow if the percolation rate is lower than the outflow the exfiltration rate would be verified to be less than the percolation rate and the underdrain flow would be set to be the difference between the percolation rate and the exfiltration rate however when groundwater table rises beyond the bottom of lid practice groundwater can enter the lid practice affecting the water balance and the inflow outflow relationships the right side of fig 1 briefly illustrates the modified restrictions regarding the water flows between the layers in swmm lid gw using bioretention cells as an example other lid practices e g porous pavement or infiltration trench can mostly follow the same method with some minor modifications depending on the actual system configurations more specifically when the groundwater table is shallower than the bottom of lid practice scenario 1 in fig 1 the exfiltration out of lid practice is restricted there are then two possible sub scenarios first if there is no storage layer scenario 1 1 the evaporation and underdrain flow from the storage layer are zero the exfiltration rate equals the percolation rate and the infiltration rate should not exceed the summation of the percolation rate and the evaporation from the soil layer if there is a storage layer it can be further split into two sub scenarios depending on whether groundwater immerses the underdrain if the underdrain is immersed with groundwater scenario 1 2 1 the exfiltration rate and underdrain flow are governed by groundwater instead of percolation thus the percolation rate should not exceed the summation of the exfiltration and the underdrain flow in this case and the infiltration should not exceed the percolation rate if the groundwater table is lower than the underdrain scenario 1 2 2 the outflows of lid practice are governed by the infiltration and percolation rates for the soil layer the percolation rate cannot exceed the difference between infiltration and soil evaporation in terms of the storage layer because the exfiltration rate is set to be zero the underdrain flow should not exceed the difference between the percolation and the storage evaporation if the groundwater table is lower than the bottom of lid practice scenario 2 then the restrictions remain the same as those of the current swmm it should be noted that swmm lid gw has simplified the dynamics of groundwater lid practices are assumed to respond instantaneously to groundwater table changes and the rate of groundwater flow into the lid practices is unlimited fig 2 illustrates these modifications in the source code of swmm lid gw each of the five boxes represents a source code file with the file name in the grey section the yellow sections list the parameters declared within that file and the data structures that these parameters belong to the blue sections show the major functions related to the modifications that are declared or used in the corresponding files arrows with solid lines represent data exchanges in between the files while arrows with dashed lines represent variable or function declaration relationships without data exchanges fig 2 the new parameters related to groundwater and in situ soils are declared in the data structure of tstoragelayer in the source code file of lid h the parameters include several van genuchten parameters α n residual soil moisture θ r saturated soil moisture θ s and initial soil moisture θ i without groundwater mound and the groundwater table depth the values of these parameters can be read from the input files and stored in the structure of the tlidproc storage of each lid practice by calling the function of readstoragedata in the source code file of lid c these parameters can then be used in the calculations of the underdrain flow and exfiltration rate the calculation was conducted using the function of getstorageexfilrate and getstoragedrainrate in the source code file of lidproc c the functions of pavementfluxrates biocellfluxrates and trenchfluxrates that control the water balance of different lid practices also used these parameters fig 2 2 1 2 hot start function the other part of incorporating groundwater feedback in swmm lid gw is enabling the storing and reading of lid hydrological states through the swmm hot start function the hydrological states include 1 water depth in the surface layer 2 water depth in the pavement layer 3 water depth in the storage layer and 4 soil moisture in the soil layer fig 2 the hot start function enables swmm to store simulation results in the hot start file at the end of each simulation which can be read by future simulations one common application of this hot start function is to run a warm up simulation and store the results for future use here this function is used to provide time dependent groundwater depths during simulations more specifically each simulation is separated into multiple sub simulations the temporal resolution of which depends on the total length of the whole simulation e g 1 min for a 1 hour rainfall event 30 min for a 1 year continuous simulation at the start of each sub simulation the groundwater table depth is added or updated in the input file then after each sub simulation the lid hydrological states at the end are outputted into the hot start file the next sub simulation then extracts the stored lid hydrological states from the hot start file updates the groundwater table depth in the input file and repeats the process fig 2 the groundwater table depth can be fed from a field monitoring time series or simulation results from a groundwater model however in the current swmm only a limited number of hydrological states can be stored in and read from the hot start file including the hydrological states related to infiltration i e cumulative infiltrated volume soil moisture deficit for the green ampt model groundwater i e soil moisture max infiltrated volume snowpack and some water quality states fig 2 but does not account for those related to lid practices as listed above thus the source code of the hot start function in swmm has been modified to enable the storing reading lid hydrological states in the hot start function two functions lid setstate and lid getstate have been added to the source code file of lid c to read and extract lid hydrological states respectively from the hot start file in addition another two functions of readrunoff and saverunoff have been added to the source code file of hotstart c fig 2 at the end of each sub simulation the function of saverunoff is called which then calls lid getstate to save the lid hydrological states into the hot start file in ascii format in addition at the start of each sub simulation if the hot start file is read specified in the input file these hydrological states can be extracted through the function of readrunoff in the hotstart c file which then calls lid setstate declared in the lid c file fig 2 it should be noted that all of the modifications were conducted using swmm 5 1 012 which was the most updated version at the time of this manuscript preparation in addition the groundwater table depth used to run swmm lid gw in this study came from on site groundwater monitoring data it can also come from other sources i e simulated groundwater head if swmm lid gw can be coupled with other groundwater models 2 2 study area and data the model was first applied to one urban catchment at central kitsap county campus ckcc located in kitsap county washington united states on a peninsula surrounded by puget sound the blue shaded region in fig 3 the precipitation averaged at 1023 6 mm year during the period of 1981 2010 with maximum and minimum precipitation occurring in december 256 0 mm month and july 22 1 mm month respectively the reference evapotranspiration was around 741 7 mm year the site is covered by a layer of sandy and silty fine sand with 0 5 m in thickness below that are layers of vashon recessional outwash vashon till vashon advanced outwash and pre vashon sediment from the top to the bottom the groundwater table at the site is relatively shallow the depth of which varies from 0 5 to 1 1 m based on the monitoring data of 2011 2012 the ckcc site is about 2 63 ha in size there are nine bioretention cells at the site and about 35 of the site mostly located at the western part of the site and 0 93 ha in size is covered by porous pavement in the form of parking lots the porous pavement can be roughly separated into 10 parcels based on location and topography the location of the site and the layout of the lid practices are shown in fig 3 these lid practices were constructed as the result of the lid demonstration project conducted in autumn 2010 which was funded by ecology s stormwater implementation grant program herrera 2013 the storage course of each parcel of porous pavement was 750 mm total in depth including a 300 mm upper layer of fine gravel and a 450 mm lower layer of coarse gravel bioretention cells were designed to receive surface runoff from porous or impervious asphalt pavement as post treatment each bioretention cell was sized to treat 91 of runoff volume from the drainage area which has a ponding depth of 100 mm a soil layer of 400 mm and a storage layer of 380 mm the soil layer was filled with 40 compost and 60 aggregate a pvc perforated underdrain 150 mm in diameter was installed with a certain offset height above the bottom of these lid practices herrera 2013 the underdrains were connected to the stormwater drains throughout the site fig 3 and all of the collected water was drained to the outlet of the catchment the details of the designs and configurations of the lid practices are shown in table 1 at the site the underdrain flow of one parcel of porous pavement called pp 0 17 ha the surface runoff from one parcel of impervious pavement 0 068 ha the surface runoff from the roof area 0 46 ha and the total hydraulic load at the outlet of the site 2 63 ha were monitored from october 2011 to september 2012 at 5 min intervals the four monitoring stations at which the data were collected pp ud ip sr roof sr and outlet are shown in fig 3 the collected data were continuously transferred to the two data stations for storage the approaches used to acquire the data are listed in table 2 at the monitoring stations of pp ud and ip sr the flow i e underdrain flow or surface runoff was measured as a water head at a stilling well in an 8 inch thel mar weir with a pressure transducer the water head was then transformed to a flow rate using a look up table provided by the manufacturer at the stations of roof sr and outlet the water level was measured by a northwest aquistar pt12 sdi 12 pressure transducer which was installed inside a stilling well in a 15 inch palmer bowlus flume it was transformed to a flow rate using an empirical equation of the 15 inch palmer bowlus flume table 2 in addition the groundwater table elevation was monitored by a groundwater monitoring well at the gw station which is near the station of pp ud fig 3 it was captured by a northwest aquistar pt12 sdi 12 pressure transducer within the well and stored by a cr800 data logger at data station 2 table 2 the groundwater table elevation was transformed into groundwater table depth which ranged from 0 5 to 1 1 m below ground over the monitoring period the precipitation data which averaged 1088 mm year for the monitoring period were collected from the silverdale rainfall station which is the nearest available rain gauge the monthly evaporation rate was retrieved from the statistics of the western regional climate center wrcc the temporal resolutions of the precipitation and groundwater monitoring were consistent at 5 min which is the same as in other datasets 2 3 model calibration and validation many parameters are provided in the project report herrera 2013 including the basic characteristics of the site i e area slope storm drain layout the geophysical characteristics of the site i e in situ soil type and the basic designs of porous pavement and bioretention cells i e drainage area media composition thickness of each media layer surface ponding depth size of the underdrain as shown in table 1 however some of the parameters required for swmm are not available or physically observable and thus need to be calibrated they include parameters related to the underdrain of lid practice e g offset height drainage coefficient and exponent of underdrain and some parameters related to subcatchment characteristics and flow routing e g manning s n for overland flow roughness of conduit depression storage of impervious area saturated hydraulic conductivity and the suction head for the green ampt infiltration equation all of the continuous monitoring data mentioned above were used for model calibration and validation precipitation and groundwater table depths were used as model inputs and the underdrain flow of pp ud surface runoff of ip sr roof sr and hydraulic load at the catchment outlet outlet were used as the targeted outputs the hydraulic load was the summation of the surface runoff and underdrain flow of the whole catchment the monitoring data during the first five months i e from october 1 2011 to february 29 2012 were used for calibration while the data for the last seven months i e from march 1 to september 30 2012 were used for validation five months were chosen for calibration because there were more intense rainfall events during the first six months and fewer in the following months so the intense events during the sixth month were retained for validation the time steps for surface runoff wet step and pipe flow routing step routing using the dynamic wave approach were 10 s all of the results were reported in 5 min intervals due to the use of hot start functions in swmm lid gw the whole simulation was separated into 8760 sub simulations with 1 hour intervals and there were 12 time steps within each sub simulation 5 min each thus the model calibration was conducted at a 1 hour resolution by averaging the results e g pp ud ip sr roof sr and outlet within each sub simulation for consistency although the current swmm did not use the hot start function its results were also averaged over 12 time steps and then calibrated at a 1 hour temporal resolution the logic of model calibration is shown in fig 4 swmm lid gw and the current swmm were first compiled as two separate console applications a matlab toolbox was then developed to execute and to post process the results of the two swmm applications in swmm lid gw hot start functions were implemented such that the groundwater table depth in the swmm input file was updated for each sub simulation fig 4 the matlb toolbox was integrated with swmm applications to form coupled swmm matlab console applications which can take an input file and return the post processed simulation results e g surface runoff time series for both versions of swmm the parameters of the two models were calibrated using a multi objective evolutionary algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 which was implemented in the r programming language tsou 2013 mersmann 2014 the optimization problem was formulated as follows 4 maximize q 1 θ q 2 θ q n θ 4 θ θ min θ max where θ is the vector of the parameters to be optimized and θ min and θ max are the lower and upper bounds of θ respectively q 1 to q n are the n quality or goodness of fit assessment functions of θ the quality of θ can be measured by the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the root mean square error rmse etc of the time series of different datasets in this study four quality assessment functions were used nse of pp ud ip sr roof sr and outlet the standard nse was used here eq 5 because it was found to have better performance when the time series of large quantities i e the surface runoff and underdrain times series are of interest krause et al 2005 the quality of the candidate solutions was assessed using r and was then used to select the parents for breeding the next generation after population ranking fig 4 the r toolbox can modify the input file according to the chromosome of the candidate solutions through processes of crossover crossover probability 0 9 and mutation mutation probability 0 1 and can invoke the execution of the coupled swmm matlab console application fig 4 to accelerate the computation the coupled application was executed in parallel on different cores of the desktop cpus for each generation the parallel computation was achieved by setting up multiple r sessions running in parallel and communicating over sockets using the functions provided in the parallel package r core team 2017 the final solution was manually selected from the last generation of populations on the pareto frontier by a loose standard of maximizing the nse of pp ud without compromising the results of the other quality assessment functions to the extent possible the nse of pp ud was selected to be maximized because the underdrain flow is an important process that should be accurately simulated for lid practices in shallow groundwater the root mean square error rmse and misclassification rate mcr of the calibration and validation results were also calculated eqs 6 7 mcr is commonly used in classification problems to evaluate the accuracy of the model in classifying groups of values considering that a great proportion of the instantaneous monitored surface runoff and underdrain flow was zero or nearly zero the rmse between the simulated and monitored results may not accurately reflect the efficiency of the model because the rmse may be still low even though the model produced many unrealistic results thus mcr can help by quantifying the accuracy of the model in capturing zero and non zero values 5 nse 1 t 1 n s t m t 2 t 1 n m t m 2 6 rmse t 1 n s t m t 2 n 7 mcr 1 n t 1 n 1 m t 0 s t 0 1 m t 0 s t 0 100 where n is the total length of the simulation which is 3648 h for calibration and 5012 h for validation s t and m t are the simulated and monitored results either surface runoff underdrain flow or hydraulic load at time step t m is the averaged monitored result during the period 1 m t 0 s t 0 equals 1 if s t 0 when m t 0 and similarly for 1 m t 0 s t 0 the data were deemed as zero or non zero when they were lower higher than 1 of the maximum value over the period either calibration or validation 2 4 hypothetical case studies to evaluate the hydrological performance of lid practices in a wider range of environmental conditions and to determine the situations in which swmm lid gw is more accurate than the current swmm a number of hypothetical event based case studies were conducted using both models parameters related to the catchment and lid practices remained the same in the different case studies however in situ soil type rainfall type and resulting groundwater fluctuation varied in total 675 hypothetical cases were studied using different climatic and geophysical conditions specifically 15 different initial groundwater table depths i e ranging from 0 1 m to 5 m below ground 9 different rainfall types i e intensities of 132 mm h 216 mm h and 353 mm h durations of 0 5 h 2 0 h and 6 0 h and 5 different in situ soils types i e loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam with different van genuchten parameters i e α n saturated hydraulic conductivity k s initial soil moisture θ i residual soil moisture θ r and saturated soil moisture θ s were used detailed information about the hypothetical cases is provided in table 3 the range of initial groundwater table depth 0 1 5 0 m was selected because it is considered shallow enough to affect lid practices and is between the ranges obtained by locatelli et al 2015 and zhang and chui 2017 within the range of 0 1 m to 1 0 m a finer interval i e 0 1 m was chosen because a minor change in the groundwater table depth should have a more significant impact on lid practices when the groundwater table was relatively shallow zhang and chui 2017 a coarser interval i e 0 5 m was chosen when the groundwater table depth was between 1 0 m and 3 0 m the in situ soil types were chosen as the most representative ones in which lid practices are installed he and davis 2010 assuming hydraulic equilibrium the initial soil moistures near the bottom of lid practices were determined using the van genuchten equation considering various initial groundwater table depths for different in situ soil types the peak intensity and rainfall pattern of the synthetic rainfalls were determined using the alternating block method and the intensity durationfrequency curves of locations in different continental areas i e hong kong sar in china london the united kingdom auckland new zealand rwanda and austin and arlington in the united states table 3 the intensities corresponded to the events with 2 yr 10 yr and 100 yr return periods with different durations in the different locations durations of 0 5 hr 2 0 hr and 6 0 hr were selected to cover the most representative durations for synthetic event based rainfalls fhwa 2009 dsd 2013 the physically based semi empirical model developed by park and parker 2008 was used to derive groundwater fluctuations based on rainfall time series there are a large number of approaches to estimating groundwater fluctuations such as water table fluctuation methods healy and cook 2002 lumped conceptual groundwater models mackay et al 2014 linear and nonlinear regression methods jirasirilak et al 2015 and machine learning algorithms yoon et al 2016 this approach a water table fluctuation method was adopted because of its simplicity and reasonably good results compared with newly developed analytical models park et al 2011 jeong and park 2017 the governing equation for obtaining groundwater table elevations through iterations is shown in eq 8 8 h i 1 h i e x p k δ t i α p i e x p k δ t i 1 kn where h i is the groundwater table elevation at the time step i δ t i is the time interval between the time steps i and i 1 k is the hydraulic conductivity α is the recharge precipitation ratio which represents the proportion of rainfall runoff that can be recharged and n is the fillable porosity defined by sophocleous 1991 that indicates the water required for a unit rise in the groundwater table the parameters listed above were estimated using the monitoring data at the ckcc site using a multivariable nonlinear optimization method through matlab although this method assumes a fixed percentage of groundwater recharge from precipitation and simplifies the calculation by neglecting certain groundwater drainage characteristics e g delayed recharge flux and lumping a number of groundwater drainage related variables together it is overall considered sufficiently accurate for the event based estimation of this study the underdrain flow and exfiltration rate of pp and the hydraulic load of the whole catchment were extracted to indicate the hydrological performance of lid practices the impact of each environmental condition on each performance indicator was evaluated a pearson correlation analysis was also performed to evaluate the cross impact of different environmental conditions and the cross correlation between environmental conditions and hydrological performance based on the general physical processes of lid practices three semi physical nonlinear multivariate formulas were proposed to predict hydrologic performance of lid practices peak underdrain flow peak exfiltration rate and peak hydraulic load of the catchment based on different environmental conditions and lid designs the coefficients were obtained based on the simulation results of hypothetical cases aforementioned among 675 hypothetical cases 338 were used for calibration and the rest 337 were used for validation more specifically cases of same rainfall intensity duration and in situ soil type were divided equally into calibration and validation pools while cases of initial groundwater table depth of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 7 m 0 9 m 1 5 m 2 5 m and 5 m were used for calibration while the rest were used for validation to derive more generic formulas dimensionless terms were developed based on the basic principle of hydrological processes of lid practices the formula of exfiltration eq 10 differs slightly from the other two eq 9 and eq 11 in that the first and third terms are inverted 9 ud ri a 1 d lid d gw a 2 ri a drain k media a lid a 3 k media k insitu a 4 10 ex ri b 1 d gw d lid b 2 ri a drain k media a lid b 3 k insitu k media b 4 11 hl ri c 1 d lid d

represents the depth of lid practices relative to the depth of groundwater table ri a drain k media a lid represents the relative rainfall intensity wu et al 2018 and k media k insitu represents the relative permeability of the lid practices the product of these three dimensionless terms is related to the rate of water infiltrating into and being stored within the lid practices which could then become underdrain flow exfiltration or catchment hydraulic load in addition to evaluate the applicability of swmm lid gw the relative difference between swmm lid gw and the current swmm represented as the indicator of the symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape was calculated eq 12 this indicator was used because a large proportion of the instantaneous monitored underdrain flow and exfiltration rate was zero or nearly zero smape does not produce mathematical values of infinities and it narrows the relative difference within the range of 0 to 100 which is more meaningful 12 smape

objective evolutionary algorithm the goodness of fit represented as nse improved gradually over generations and all of the datasets including pp ud ip sr roof sr and outlet remained almost constant after 20 generations fig 5 displays the nse of different datasets for the 36 populations of the last generation which has optimal goodness of fit the figure includes a number of scatter plots which are arranged in a semi matrix format the values of the x and y axes indicate the nse value for the corresponding dataset listed in the grey box near each axis for example fig 5b compares the nse value between outlet x axis and pp ud y axis there is an obvious tradeoff as parameters that lead to better pp ud values resulted in poorer goodness of fit for outlet and vice versa fig 5b mainly because a great proportion of underdrain flow entered the drainage system forming part of the flow at the outlet seen in the layout of underdrain pipes and stormwater drains in fig 1 the model tended to underestimate pp ud but overestimate outlet so higher pp ud resulted in better goodness of fit for pp ud but lower goodness of fit for outlet the nse of ip sr was positively correlated with those of pp ud fig 5c and roof sr fig 5e but negatively correlated with outlet fig 5a the nse of ip sr was positively related to those of pp ud and roof sr because they were all correlated positively with manning s n and were all underestimated by the model an increase in any one of them can increase the values of the other two and improve their goodness of fit outlet was overestimated while ip sr was underestimated although ip sr and outlet increased simultaneously the goodness of fit of outlet decreased but that of ip sr increased comparatively no obvious relationship was observed between pp ud and roof sr fig 5f which was expected one set of parameters was selected manually as calibrated from the last generation evolved from nsga ii these are indicated as red circles in fig 5 then the pp ud roof sr ip sr and outlet simulated using that set of parameters were compared with the monitoring data using root mean square error rmse nash sutcliff efficiency nse and misclassification rate mcr the final calibrated parameters of both swmm lid gw and the current swmm are shown in table 4 it should be noted that the parameters of the underdrain coefficient exponent and offset height were only calibrated for swmm lid gw while those of the current swmm were pre specified because they were found to exert minimal influence on the results of the current swmm fig 6 a shows the precipitation and groundwater table fluctuations of the calibration and validation periods while fig 6b and 6c display all of the simulated and field monitored time series for two representative events during calibration and validation respectively each sub figure of fig 7 compares one of the simulated series with the field monitored one during both calibration and validation it also shows the exceedance of probability of both swmm lid gw and the current swmm table 5 lists the goodness of fit of all of the simulated datasets compared with the field monitored ones first the underdrain flow of swmm lid gw agreed with the monitoring data reasonably well during both calibration and validation with nse of 0 32 and 0 55 during calibration and validation respectively in addition the rmse 3 89 mm h and 0 79 mm h for calibration and validation and the mcr 2 17 and 0 66 for calibration and validation respectively were very low table 5 swmm lid gw slightly underestimated the underdrain flow generated by extreme rainfall events e g event on nov 23 2011 but accurately captured the underdrain flow of most of the rainfall events fig 7a the poorer nse and mcr values of pp ud during calibration compared with validation table 5 were possibly due to the difference in the range of data between calibration and validation as there were more major rainfall events and a higher groundwater table during calibration than during validation fig 6a comparatively the current swmm was not able to capture the generation of the underdrain flow e g fig 6 b 1 6 c 1 7 a 1 and 7 a 2 the nse value was 0 01 during both calibration and validation the goodness of fit represented by rmse 4 73 mm h and 0 99 mm h during calibration and validation and mcr 3 84 and 0 95 during calibration and validation was significantly poorer than that of swmm lid gw table 5 swmm lid gw has thus significantly improved the simulation of the underdrain flow of lid practices in shallow groundwater compared with the current swmm it was deemed a highly effective improvement considering the minor modifications made and the simple equation used as for the surface runoff ip sr and roof sr although both swmm lid gw and the current swmm underestimated some peak runoffs e g fig 6 c 2 7 b 1 and 7 c 1 they obtained reasonably good fits and the goodness of fit of the two models was very close e g fig 7 b 1 7 b 2 7 c 1 and 7 c 2 the nse rmse and mcr values were 0 36 and 0 37 1 05 10 4 m3 s and 1 13 10 4 m3 s 6 11 and 4 01 for swmm lid gw and were 0 41 and 0 39 1 01 10 4 m3 s and 9 36 10 5 m3 s 7 92 and 5 34 for the current swmm during calibration and validation respectively table 5 the minor differences in ip sr and roof sr between the two models were mainly caused by the differences in the underdrain flow more specifically the underdrain flow of all of the bioretention cells and porous pavements obtained by swmm lid gw was significantly larger than that of the current swmm and was all collected and drained to the outlet of the catchment i e outlet to strike a balance in fitting both pp ud and outlet the calibrated manning s n of the overland flow of swmm lid gw for example was higher than that of the current swmm table 4 this thus leads to a slight difference in the surface runoff results i e ip sr and roof sr between the two models the two models produced very different results for the hydraulic load of the catchment i e outlet although their goodness of fit was quite close with an nse value of 0 56 0 46 for swmm lid gw and 0 60 0 53 for the current swmm during calibration validation table 5 swmm lid gw obtained a better fit with only minor overestimation the current swmm significantly underestimated it fig 7 d 1 during calibration the rmse was 1 90 10 3 m3 s and 1 80 10 3 m3 s and the mcr was 24 56 and 24 86 for swmm lid gw and the current swmm respectively during validation the rmse was 5 40 10 3 m3 s and 8 76 10 4 m3 s and the mcr was 12 72 and 11 50 for swmm lid gw and the current swmm respectively table 5 however both models misclassified a great proportion of the hydraulic load outlet the mcr was several times larger than that of other datasets but it was considered acceptable because the mcr value was reduced by more than 50 or 85 if the criterion for filtering can be relaxed from 1 to 2 or 5 respectively 3 2 impact of environmental conditions on the hydrological performance of lid practices the model for generating groundwater fluctuations were firstly calibrated before conducting hypothetical case studies the calibration results and an example of synthetic rainfall and groundwater fluctuation are displayed in fig 8 b obviously the groundwater table rose to a certain height due to precipitation and dissipated gradually afterwards it should be noted that the y axis of fig 8a represents the groundwater head while that in fig 8b represents the groundwater table depth below ground 3 2 1 impact of initial groundwater table depth based on the results of the hypothetical case studies the time series of underdrain flow and exfiltration rate of the pp and the hydraulic load of the catchment for different initial groundwater table depths are shown in fig 9 a 9e and 9i respectively the curves represent the averaged values for different conditions at the specified groundwater table depths since they highly overlap together as expected the underdrain flow was greater when groundwater table was shallower the peak underdrain flow increased from 5 to 15 mm h when the groundwater table was 1 0 5 0 m below ground to 32 mm h 42 mm h and 53 mm h for groundwater table depths of 0 6 m 0 4 m and 0 2 m respectively fig 9a the underdrain flow obtained increased sharply when the groundwater table rose from 1 0 m to 0 6 m below ground which was understandable because the underdrain was at 0 75 m below ground in addition the exfiltration rate from the pp was greater when the groundwater table was deeper fig 9e the peak exfiltration rate was 27 mm h and 17 mm h when groundwater table was 5 0 m and 2 5 m below ground but became zero when the bottom of the pp was submerged i e the water table was less than 1 0 m below ground the hydraulic load of the catchment showed a similar temporal pattern as that of the exfiltration rate during the rainfall period fig 9e and 9i it reached the peak very quickly fluctuated during the event and dropped after rainfall stopped however the hydraulic load did not drop to zero as exfiltration but reached a near equilibrium with only a slight decrease over time the load during this period was sustained by the underdrain flow of multiple lid practices within the catchment because the groundwater table responded and dropped more gradually fig 10 a shows the water budget of the pp for different initial groundwater table depths obviously the volume and proportion of underdrain flow in the water budget obtained by swmm lid gw were greater when the groundwater table was shallower the event based volume of the underdrain flow was 2044 m3 93 when the groundwater table was 0 2 m below ground but dropped to 1219 m3 80 and 588 m3 79 when the groundwater table was 0 6 m and 0 8 m below ground respectively it further decreased to around 30 100 m3 when the groundwater table dropped further fig 10a in contrast the volume and proportion of exfiltration were greater when the groundwater table was deeper the volume of exfiltration was zero when the groundwater table was 0 2 0 7 m below ground but increased to 100 153 m3 when groundwater dropped to 1 5 5 m below ground fig 10a this was expected because when the groundwater table was shallower less water can exfiltrate out due to more saturated in situ soil and a lower hydraulic gradient from the lid to the surrounding area the last column in fig 10a shows the water budget results of the current swmm which was similar to that calculated by swmm lid gw when the groundwater table was deeper than 1 5 m obviously the current swmm highly underestimated the underdrain flow and the overall water budget of pp when the groundwater was shallow 3 2 2 impact of rainfall type the time series for different rainfall intensities and durations are shown in fig 9b 9f 9j and 9c 9g 9k respectively as expected the underdrain flow was greater for events of greater intensities and longer durations fig 9b c the peak underdrain flow was 22 8 mm h 23 0 mm h and 25 3 mm h for rainfall intensities of 132 mm h 216 mm h and 353 mm h fig 9b and was 23 8 mm h 24 9 mm h and 26 1 mm h for durations of 0 5 h 2 h and 6 h fig 9c the exfiltration rate was slightly greater for rainfall events of greater intensities but was not affected by rainfall duration fig 9f and 9g in addition the impact of the rainfall type on the hydraulic load of the catchment differed during and after the rainfall event during the rainfall event initial 6 h similar to the case of exfiltration the hydraulic load of the catchment was greater for rainfall events of greater intensities fig 9j but was not affected by rainfall duration fig 9k however after a rainfall event both rainfall intensity and duration affected the hydraulic load slightly because the hydraulic load mainly came from the underdrain flow after rainfall stopped which was dependent on groundwater table depth but not rainfall type fig 10b shows the water budget of the pp for different rainfall types the columns on the left and right of each group correspond to the results of swmm lid gw and the current swmm respectively the volume and proportion of the underdrain flow obtained by swmm lid gw was slightly greater when rainfall intensity and duration were greater the volume of underdrain flow increased from 721 m3 81 to 1104 m3 84 when rainfall intensity and duration increased from 132 mm h 0 5 h to 353 mm h 6 h fig 10b exfiltration was also slightly greater for rainfall events of greater intensities rainfall duration did not show an obvious impact on the exfiltration of swmm lid gw but it affected the results of the current swmm positively the volume of exfiltration calculated by the current swmm increased from 20 30 m3 to 40 80 m3 and 110 160 m3 moving from rainfall events of 0 5 h to 2 0 h and 3 0 h which correspond to proportions of 17 36 29 48 and 40 60 respectively fig 10c which was significantly higher than that obtained by swmm lid gw 3 2 3 impact of in situ soil type the time series for different in situ soil types are shown in fig 9d 9 h and 9 l the underdrain flow was slightly greater for less permeable soils peak at 25 27 mm h for sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam but lower for more permeable soils peak at 22 23 mm h for loamy sand and sandy loam fig 9d the exfiltration of the pp surrounded by more permeable soils i e loamy sand was greater than others so less water accumulated within the pp which could be drained out from the underdrain this explanation was supported by the results of exfiltration as shown in fig 9h the exfiltration rate peaked at 15 mm h for loamy sand and sandy loam but was 5 mm h 2 5 mm h and 1 5 mm h for sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam respectively however in situ soil type did not affect the results of the hydraulic load of the catchment because its impact on underdrain flow was negligible compared to the overall surface runoff from the whole catchment fig 9l fig 10c shows the water budget of the pp for different in situ soil types the volume and proportion of the underdrain flow was very close for different in situ soil types but was slightly greater for less permeable soils the volume was 839 m3 81 7 and 831 m3 81 5 for loamy sand and sandy loam but increased to 864 m3 82 1 878 m3 82 4 and 885 m3 82 5 for sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam respectively fig 10c this was consistent with the phenomenon observed in fig 9d which was a result of different exfiltration amounts for different in situ soil types as shown in fig 10c the volumes of exfiltration were 63 m3 6 2 and 74 m3 7 3 for loamy sand and sandy loam but the volumes were 39 m3 3 7 24 m3 2 3 and 17 m3 1 6 for sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam respectively fig 10c a similar pattern was captured by the current swmm the volume of exfiltration was 146 m3 113 m3 61 m3 24 m3 and 15 m3 for in situ soils of loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam which correspond to proportions of 80 62 33 13 and 8 respectively fig 10c 3 2 4 cross impact analysis fig 11 shows the pearson correlation matrix between different environmental conditions i e initial groundwater table depth rainfall intensity rainfall duration and in situ soil type and hydrological performance i e peak underdrain flow peak exfiltration and peak hydraulic load the numbers within the matrix are the pearson correlation coefficients which represent the correlation between two terms values closer to 1 and 1 mean high correlation while values closer to 0 mean low correlation the results confirm some observations obtained above for example compared with rainfall intensity and duration initial groundwater table depth and in situ soil type played more significant roles in generating the underdrain flow coefficients of 0 26 and 0 31 versus 0 03 and 0 08 exfiltration coefficients of 0 32 and 0 38 versus 0 00 and 0 11 and hydraulic load of the catchment coefficients of 0 16 and 0 09 versus 0 04 and 0 01 the underdrain flow was found to be closely related to exfiltration with a coefficient of 0 69 some correlation existed between the underdrain flow and hydraulic load of the catchment as mentioned above with a coefficient of 0 32 3 3 general formulas to predict hydrologic performance of lid practices the final calibrated formulas for peak underdrain flow peak exfiltration and peak hydraulic load of the catchment has been shown in eqs 13 15 below 13 u d r i 0 270 d lid d gw 0 478 ri a drain k m e d i a a lid 0 805 k media k insitu 0 0226 14 e x r i 0 234 d gw d lid 0 826 ri a drain k m e d i a a lid 0 964 k insitu k media 0 637 15 h l r i 0 286 d lid d gw 0 095 ri a drain k m e d i a a lid 0 313 k media k insitu 0 0063 fig 12 compares the predicted values with the monitoring values in both calibration and validation although there is some discrepancy in the prediction of exfiltration small exfiltration values were overestimated while great exfiltration values were underestimated a little bit fig 12b in overall three formulas obtained reasonably good fits in both calibration and validation the nse were 0 812 and 0 809 for peak underdrain flow 0 628 and 0 591 for peak exfiltration 0 619 and 0 616 for peak hydraulic load during calibration and validation respectively the coefficients of the formulas also reflect the relative impact of different environmental conditions on the hydrologic performance of lid practices initial groundwater table depth and rainfall intensity showed more dominant roles in generating underdrain flow than soil conditions given their relatively larger coefficients 0 478 and 0 805 versus 0 0226 the impacts of different factors on exfiltration were comparable to each other 0 826 0 964 and 0 637 while rainfall intensity governed the hydraulic load of the catchment than initial groundwater table depth and soil conditions 0 725 versus 0 055 and 0 0046 although these formulas were generated based on the modeling results of only one site they are deemed as representative because they have incorporated hundreds of hypothetical cases and have involved and normalized the most influential parameters they can potentially be used in other places during feasibility analysis in which the hydrologic performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater needs to be evaluated however it should be noted that the formula of catchment hydraulic load should be used with caution because catchment hydraulic load also depends on some site characteristics e g number of lid practices imperviousness and layout of stormwater sewers that have not been accounted for 3 4 model applicability analysis the relative differences in the underdrain flow exfiltration and hydraulic load between swmm lid gw and the current swmm over different initial groundwater table depths for different rainfall types and in situ soil types represented by the smape value are shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively the underdrain flow obtained by swmm lid gw differed significantly from that of the current swmm when the groundwater table was shallower than the underdrain less than 0 8 m below ground figs 13a and 14a the relative difference between the two models represented by the smape value was 100 when the groundwater table was 0 4 0 6 m below ground and it gradually dropped to 70 100 and 25 50 when the groundwater table dropped to 0 8 m and 1 0 m below ground respectively figs 13a and 14a because swmm lid gw can capture the increase of the underdrain flow when the groundwater table becomes shallower eq 3 when the groundwater table dropped below the lid practice i e 1 5 5 0 m below ground the smape value reached an almost constant range with variances caused by different rainfall types figs 13a and 14a the pattern of hydraulic load influenced by initial groundwater table depth was very similar to that of the underdrain flow because a huge proportion of the hydraulic load came from the underdrain flow as observed in fig 10 while the initial groundwater table depth did not show a significant impact on the relative difference in exfiltration between the two models the smape was relatively stable around 0 25 for all of the different groundwater table depths with minor variances figs 13b and 14b the underdrain flow of the two models was not influenced by the rainfall type when the groundwater table was shallower than 0 6 m i e the depth of the underdrain and it was mainly determined by the groundwater table depth however it was affected by the rainfall type when the groundwater table was deeper at which the relative difference in the underdrain flow between the two models was slightly greater for rainfall events of greater intensities fig 13a in addition the relative difference in the exfiltration rate between the two models was greater for rainfall events of longer duration when groundwater was shallower than the bottom of lid practice i e 0 2 1 0 m below ground the averaged smape of the exfiltration rate increased from 2 to 3 to 8 9 and around 25 when rainfall duration increased from 0 5 h to 2 0 h and 6 0 h respectively fig 13b in this case the exfiltration rate obtained by swmm lid gw was consistently at zero and was not influenced by rainfall type however rainfall events of longer duration can lead to a greater exfiltration rate for the current swmm thus the relative difference between the two models was greater for events of longer durations when the groundwater table was deeper than the bottom of lid practice the impact of rainfall type became non obvious fig 13b in addition it was found that when groundwater was shallower than the underdrain i e 0 2 0 6 m below ground the smape of the hydraulic load between the two models was slightly greater for rainfall events of smaller durations and lower intensities fig 13c is because the hydraulic load obtained by swmm lid gw was mainly dominated by the underdrain flow in this case which was mainly caused by shallow groundwater instead of rainfall thus increasing the intensity or duration of rainfall events had a higher impact on the results of current swmm but a lower impact on swmm lid gw leading to a lower relative difference between the two models however this effect was not obvious when the groundwater table elevation further decreased the relative differences in underdrain flow exfiltration and hydraulic load between the two models were not affected by the in situ soil type when the groundwater table was less than 1 0 m below ground fig 14 however a slight impact was observed when the groundwater table was relatively deep 1 0 m below ground fig 14a and c in this case the relative difference in the underdrain flow and hydraulic load between the two models was higher for less permeable in situ soils the smape values for in situ soils of loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam were around 0 1 11 8 34 12 44 and 12 49 for underdrain flow fig 14a and 5 28 6 39 15 48 21 54 and 24 58 for hydraulic load fig 14c due to different exfiltration rates for different in situ soils as mentioned above thus the relative difference in exfiltration was also slightly greater for less permeable soils fig 14b the results of pearson correlation analysis further confirm the observations obtained above fig 15 the smape of the underdrain flow and hydraulic load were only closely related to the initial groundwater table depth both having coefficients of 0 75 which was consistent with that observed above the smape of the underdrain flow was closely related to the smape of hydraulic load with a coefficient of 0 98 while the smape of exfiltration was less affected by these environmental conditions fig 15 compared with other conditions the initial groundwater table depth affected exfiltration more with a coefficient of 0 19 fig 15 generally swmm lid gw obtained more accurate underdrain flow and a greater overall hydraulic load of the catchment for a wide range of groundwater table depths particularly when the groundwater table was shallower than 1 0 m below ground the difference in exfiltration between swmm lid gw and the current swmm was not as significant as that of the underdrain flow and hydraulic load but it still varied a great deal for rainfall events of longer duration and less permeable in situ soils thus studies related to the hydrological processes of lid practices at locations with relatively shallow groundwater conditions less than 5 m below ground can potentially benefit from swmm lid gw those related to lid underdrain flow should use swmm lid gw particularly if groundwater table depth frequently rises to 1 0 m or less below ground during storm events rainfall type and in situ soil type are not the major factors influencing the choice of swmm lid gw over the current swmm however places with more high intensity and long duration events and less permeable soils are more recommended to use swmm lid gw mainly due to the higher rise in groundwater 4 conclusions a modified swmm swmm lid gw was developed to evaluate the hydrological performance of lid in shallow groundwater different from the current swmm which separates lid practices from the groundwater system swmm lid gw integrates groundwater table depth into the governing equations of underdrain flow and exfiltration and considers the variably saturated groundwater heads of the in situ soils during lid simulations shallow groundwater was found to exert a significant influence on the hydrological performance of lid practices groundwater has a high risk of being drained through the underdrain flow of lid practices in shallow groundwater which accounts for a significant proportion of the water budget of lid practices when groundwater was shallower the exfiltration rate was lower but the underdrain flow and hydraulic load were greater in addition due to the dominant role of shallow groundwater rainfall intensity and duration showed very limited influence on the underdrain flow exfiltration rate and catchment hydraulic load this is different from locations with deeper groundwater table in which the impact of rainfall intensity and duration could be significant in addition in situ soil type was important for exfiltration but showed minimal impact on the underdrain flow and hydraulic load of the catchment three semi physical nonlinear multivariate formulas have been generated to predict the peak underdrain flow peak exfiltration and peak hydraulic load of the catchment based on different environmental conditions i e initial groundwater table depth rainfall intensity hydraulic conductivity of in situ soil and lid designs i e depth and media soil of lid practices the formulas can potentially be utilized to predict the hydrologic performance and support the feasibility analysis of lid practices in shallow groundwater environment comparatively the current swmm underestimated underdrain flow but overestimated the exfiltration of lid practices in shallow groundwater swmm lid gw was better than the current swmm in simulating the underdrain flow exfiltration rate and hydraulic load for a range of groundwater table depths swmm lid gw produced more accurate results in shallow groundwater with few additional inputs and is thus a simple and practical tool that can facilitate the performance evaluation and design of lid practices it is recommended for areas with shallow groundwater e g 5 0 m or less below ground and it is particularly accurate in simulating the underdrain flow of lid practices in which the groundwater table rises to 1 0 m or less below ground during storm events although rainfall type and in situ soil type are not the major factors influencing the choice of swmm lid gw over the current swmm swmm lid gw is recommended for locations surrounded by less lower permeable soils and locations that have more high intensity and long duration rainfall events mainly due to the higher rise in the groundwater table based on the results obtained by swmm lid gw lid practices should be highly beneficial to locations with groundwater depletion due to enhanced infiltration for places with stormwater management problems and shallow groundwater special attention should be given to the design of lid practices to obtain an optimal tradeoff between surface runoff control and groundwater protection for example the underdrain pipe can be elevated to be farther away from the groundwater table or the lid can be lined with an impermeable liner to prevent the effects of groundwater the liner may slightly affect surface runoff control performance but can greatly minimize the impact of lid practices on groundwater and further prevent additional hydraulic load from draining groundwater some limitations of this study present future research opportunities first only the calculations of underdrain flow and exfiltration of lid practices have been modified in swmm lid gw other environmental processes e g evapotranspiration that may also be affected by shallow groundwater have not been accounted for in addition only the variable saturation of shallow groundwater and its impact on in situ soils have been considered in swmm lid gw those related to the soil media inside lid practices have not furthermore this study has only made use of groundwater table depths that were pre specified to realize a two way coupling between lid practices and groundwater systems swmm lid gw can potentially be coupled with groundwater models that provide real time groundwater table depths during simulations in addition lid practices are seldom implemented in shallow groundwater environments and it is rare for such sites to be equipped with both surface runoff and groundwater table depth monitoring the model used in this study was therefore only calibrated to one year of monitoring data for one site although the results and conclusions obtained are considered meaningful and representative given the one real case study and various hypothetical case studies a longer period of monitoring data from multiple sites could improve the validity of the model and results finally with the use of a hot start function and the consideration of groundwater in the water balance calculation the water balance of the entire simulation cannot be directly extracted from output files and must to be further post processed the hot start function also involves external file input and outputs which slows down the computations of swmm lid gw future work can therefore look into more efficient coding and data exchanges acknowledgements this work was funded by the seed funding programme for basic research of the

6946,low impact development lid practices are effective in restoring natural hydrological processes but they may be affected by groundwater and pose additional risk to groundwater dynamics and contamination in shallow groundwater conditions their performance in shallow groundwater is not well understood due to monitoring difficulty and the deficiency of modeling tools the storm water management model swmm is an urban hydrology hydraulic model that has been widely used to evaluate the performance of lid practices however it cannot accurately simulate the hydrological processes of lid practices in shallow groundwater this study presents the development calibration validation and testing of a modified swmm swmm lid gw that incorporates groundwater feedbacks into lid simulations the hydrological performance of lid practices under different environmental conditions was simulated based on which the impacts of initial groundwater table depth rainfall type and in situ soil type were evaluated and a number of general nonlinear multivariate formulas were proposed to predict the hydrologic performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater environment and support the feasibility analysis of lid practices before project implementation the reduction of exfiltration and increase of groundwater drainage in shallow groundwater accounted for a significant proportion of the water budget of lid practices the influence of shallow groundwater was greater for shallower groundwater tables in less permeable in situ soils and for events of higher intensities and longer durations however due to the dominant role of shallow groundwater the impacts of both rainfall type and in situ soil type on the hydrological performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater were minimal in general in contrast to the impacts on deep groundwater tables the swmm lid gw outperformed the current swmm for a wide range of groundwater conditions particularly for locations in which the groundwater table frequently rises to 1 0 m or less below ground keywords stormwater management swmm low impact development green infrastructure shallow groundwater sponge city 1 introduction amidst efforts to mitigate urban water problems low impact development lid practices fletcher et al 2015 have received a great deal of attention in recent years due to their good performance in

however the implementation and performances of lid practices can be restricted in shallow groundwater areas zhang and chui 2017 lid practices may form groundwater mounds ku et al 1992 göbel et al 2004 locatelli et al 2015 which may limit infiltration from the surface and exfiltration to in situ soils brown et al 2013 heilweil et al 2015 fox et al 2018 in addition lid practices may lead to groundwater contamination because infiltrated water only travels a short distance over a relatively short time before reaching the groundwater table weiss et al 2008 finally groundwater a valuable water resource may also be drained out and become additional water load to downstream drainage infrastructures i e pipelines storage tanks when the groundwater table rises above the underdrain herrera 2013 although the problems associated with shallow groundwater are clear the performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater has not been widely studied and well understood so far he and davis 2010 evaluated the impact of multiple design features i e media and in situ soil types initial soil moisture and area ratio on the underdrain outflow of a single bioretention cell using comsol multiphysics however they did not consider the dynamics of groundwater and only simulated one fixed groundwater table locatelli et al 2015 and zhang and chui 2017 evaluated the impact of different design features i e media soil type underdrain size and environmental conditions i e in situ soil type thickness of the unsaturated zone on the hydrologic performance of infiltration trench and bioretention cell respectively they offered recommendations on the minimum distance between the lid bottom and the groundwater table and media soil type however they were limited at facility scale while catchment scale understanding are also of importance a few studies have examined either the hydrologic performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater trinh and chui 2013 chui and trinh 2016 or the impact of lid practices on groundwater at catchment scale endreny and collins 2009 bhaskar et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 however they did not consider situations in which the groundwater table reaches or approaches the bottom of the lid practices and the underdrain their findings are also site specific and are difficult to be generalized to other places with different environmental conditions lid groundwater interactions can be effectively examined using numerical models different model parameters can be easily varied to evaluate their influence to the hydrological performance of lid practices there are a number of existing models that have potential to simulate lid practices in shallow groundwater environment for instance some variably saturated flow software e g comsol multiphysics vs2d hydrus 1d 2d 3d can solve richards equation to simulate subsurface hydrological conditions beneath lid practices he and davis 2010 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 however these kinds of models normally can only simulate lid practices in a facility scale and they cannot accurately evaluate processes of surface runoff generation particularly at larger scale some surface subsurface hydrological models e g mike she gsflow shetran gssha velma and swat modflow are also possible choices they are more powerful in rainfall runoff simulation and can handle larger scale studies trinh and chui 2013 hoghooghi et al 2018 however most of these models operate in very coarse temporal resolutions i e daily or sub daily and coarse spatial resolutions i e few square kilometers with spatial resolution of 50 m so lid practices can only be simulated in an aggregated configuration e g 50 m 50 m some models have also been developed or improved recently to better simulate the subsurface processes of lid practices i e bioretention cells and vegetated filter strips in shallow groundwater condition more accurately i e sw mm vfsmod roldin et al 2013 locatelli et al 2015 herrera et al 2017 massoudieh et al 2017 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 however the performance of these models in simulating lid practices have not been widely recognized among all different models that can simulate lid practices the storm water management model swmm is one of the most reputable and widely applied ones mainly due to its open source code simple structure and low input requirement rossman 2015 swmm formed the basis of the lid modules in a number of hydrological models e g mike urban sustain infoswmm mwh soft inc 2005 lee et al 2012 and has been applied in different lid practice related studies for example it has been applied to verify the hydrological and pollution control performance of lid practices abi aad et al 2009 petrucci et al 2012 lee et al 2013 and to identify the dominant factors that influence lid performance qin et al 2013 palla and gnecco 2015 abdul aziz and al amin 2016 furthermore the integrated performance of a series of lid practices i e treatment train system eric et al 2013 jayasooriya et al 2016 and the performance of conventional drainage integrated systems in handling extreme rainfall events chui et al 2016 kong et al 2017 and combined sewer overflows montalto et al 2007 have been evaluated using swmm in addition swmm was applied to determine the optimal selection yang and chui 2018b design e g

cuerva et al 2018 huang et al 2018 however swmm is not as applicable for shallow groundwater for two major reasons first it only assumes a linearized soil water retention curve for the unsaturated flow and the routing of groundwater flow is spatially lumped lee et al 2018 second the exfiltration out of lid practices is simulated using a fixed rate which together with other hydrological processes of lid practices the percolation rate from the soil layer to the storage layer the underdrain flow out of lid practices etc are separated from groundwater conditions some preliminary studies integrated swmm with other software for subsurface flow simulations for example sansalone et al 2013 chen 2014 and mooers et al 2018 used swmm or pcswmm to simulate the rainfall runoff processes of lid but they used vs2d or modflow to simulate subsurface flows however they only realized one way coupling rowan 2001 and yergeau 2010 coupled swmm with modflow on a two way basis but did not focus on lid simulations as there was no lid module in swmm at that time in addition lee et al 2018 is working on a project to improve the subsurface flow algorithm of lid practices in swmm but the work is still in progress to address the research gaps described previously this study develops an improved swmm swmm lid gw by creating an interface to link processes of lid practices with groundwater it should be noted that the swmm lid gw is not a fully integrated surface subsurface hydrological model it improves the simulation of lid practices in swmm by better accounting for groundwater conditions to the best of our knowledge there is no similar improvement made to swmm in peer review literature moreover we calibrate and validate swmm lid gw through a multi objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii based on a field case study with lid implementations in kitsap county united states finally we conduct a group of hypothetical case studies to compare the performance of swmm lid gw with the current swmm identify the situations in which swmm lid gw is more applicable and evaluate the impact of different environmental conditions i e different rainfall intensities rainfall durations groundwater conditions in situ soil types on the hydrological performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater generalized the results into a few dimensionless formulas to predict the hydrological performance of lid in shallow groundwater environment and identify the situations in which swmm lid gw is more applicable 2 methodology 2 1 swmm lid gw development 2 1 1 hydrological calculation of lid practice an lid practice is conceptualized as a combination of multiple horizontal layers in swmm in which water is stored and moved between layers as shown in the top left corner of fig 1 different lid practices differ in the number and type of layers for example bioretention cells can include surface soil and storage layers while porous pavements can have an additional pavement layer between the surface layer and the soil layer or storage layer during each simulation swmm calculates the amount of water stores within each layer and moving between layers water can infiltrate into the pavement layer or the soil layer from the surface layer and water in excess of the infiltration capacity can become surface runoff furthermore water can evaporate or percolate from the soil layer into the storage layer after which it can either exfiltrate into the surrounding soil or be drained out if there is an underdrain overflow can be generated when the lid practice is filled up rossman 2015 fig 1 to incorporate groundwater feedback into swmm the governing equations of the exfiltration and underdrain flow of lid practices were modified to be functions of groundwater table depth the exfiltration and underdrain flow are the two hydrological processes of lid practices that are most closely linked to groundwater they are also the two major outflows of the lid practices brown et al 2013 walsh et al 2014 although the equation of percolation from the soil layer to the storage layer was not modified the situation of the groundwater table reaching the soil layer is considered through water balance budgeting 1 underdrain flow the lower left corner of fig 1 shows the governing equations of the underdrain flow and exfiltration in swmm lid gw and the current swmm in the current swmm the underdrain is simulated as a submerged orifice the flow out of which is calculated as a function of the storage depth within the lid practice in an exponential form upper part of eq 1 the two coefficients are determined by the size of the underdrain and the density of the perforations on the underdrain surface walsh et al 2014 however the current swmm neglects the situation in which the groundwater table rises beyond the underdrain and exceeds the storage depth within the lid practice in this situation it the height of the groundwater table above the underdrain should determine the magnitude of the underdrain flow but not the storage depth thus the governing equation has been modified when the height of the groundwater table above the underdrain is less than the water storage depth inside the lid practice the underdrain flow follows the same equation as the current swmm however the height of the groundwater table above the bottom of the lid practice is used instead of the storage depth when the groundwater table is shallower than the water storage level lower part of eq 1 1 f drain coeff h h offset expon i f h h gw c o e f f h gw h offset expon i f h h gw where coeff and expon are the two coefficients of underdrain h offset is the offset height of underdrain representing the distance between the underdrain and the bottom of lid practice h is the storage depth within the lid practice and h gw is the distance between groundwater table and the bottom of lid practice 2 exfiltration in the current swmm the maximum exfiltration rate out of the storage layer of lid practice is equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the in situ soil fig 1 this simplification implies a vertical head gradient of one however the moisture content and thus the head gradient of the in situ soils fluctuates in shallow groundwater and the maximum exfiltration rate may then change accordingly the exfiltration rate has been modified to be a function of the moisture content of the in situ soils based on an analytical equation for the exfiltration rate from the bottom of infiltration systems eq 2 this equation was proposed by crosbie et al 2005 and was shown to be valid for infiltration trenches by roldin et al 2013 and locatelli et al 2015 the moisture content of in situ soil near the bottom of lid practice required in eq 2 is calculated based on the van genuchten 1980 equation which describes the soil moisture as a function of the pressure head near the bottom of lid practice eq 3 2 f exfil θ s θ θ s θ i k s 3 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the in situ soils θ r θ s and θ i are the residual saturated and initial moisture content of in situ soils θ is the current moisture content of in situ soils near the bottom of lid practice which varies between θ r and θ s ψ is the pressure head near the bottom of lid practice assuming hydraulic equilibrium and thus equals the distance between the bottom of lid practice and groundwater table and α and n are the parameters in the van genuchten equation the maximum exfiltration rate changes and equals k s when the soil moisture is equal to the initial value with no groundwater mound it can reach higher than k s when the groundwater table soil moisture is lower than the initial values it can also gradually approach zero when soil reaches saturation and the groundwater table rises to the bottom of lid practice the exfiltration rate would be better estimated as the dissipation rate of the groundwater mound when the wetting front of a groundwater mound reaches or rises beyond the bottom of lid practice marino 1974 however it is assumed to be zero in this study because the dissipation rate is considered negligible compared to the other water fluxes during large rainfall events this same simplification has been adopted by locatelli et al 2015 when the equation was applied to infiltration trenches 3 water balance within lid practice to ensure a water balance within the lid practice the current swmm monitors and restricts inflows and outflows of each layer at each time step using bioretention cells as an example when the storage layer is fully saturated the percolation from the soil to the storage layer i e inflow of the storage layer would not exceed the summation of the exfiltration and underdrain flow i e outflow of the storage layer if the calculated percolation rate is higher than the outflow the percolation rate would be set to equal the outflow if the percolation rate is lower than the outflow the exfiltration rate would be verified to be less than the percolation rate and the underdrain flow would be set to be the difference between the percolation rate and the exfiltration rate however when groundwater table rises beyond the bottom of lid practice groundwater can enter the lid practice affecting the water balance and the inflow outflow relationships the right side of fig 1 briefly illustrates the modified restrictions regarding the water flows between the layers in swmm lid gw using bioretention cells as an example other lid practices e g porous pavement or infiltration trench can mostly follow the same method with some minor modifications depending on the actual system configurations more specifically when the groundwater table is shallower than the bottom of lid practice scenario 1 in fig 1 the exfiltration out of lid practice is restricted there are then two possible sub scenarios first if there is no storage layer scenario 1 1 the evaporation and underdrain flow from the storage layer are zero the exfiltration rate equals the percolation rate and the infiltration rate should not exceed the summation of the percolation rate and the evaporation from the soil layer if there is a storage layer it can be further split into two sub scenarios depending on whether groundwater immerses the underdrain if the underdrain is immersed with groundwater scenario 1 2 1 the exfiltration rate and underdrain flow are governed by groundwater instead of percolation thus the percolation rate should not exceed the summation of the exfiltration and the underdrain flow in this case and the infiltration should not exceed the percolation rate if the groundwater table is lower than the underdrain scenario 1 2 2 the outflows of lid practice are governed by the infiltration and percolation rates for the soil layer the percolation rate cannot exceed the difference between infiltration and soil evaporation in terms of the storage layer because the exfiltration rate is set to be zero the underdrain flow should not exceed the difference between the percolation and the storage evaporation if the groundwater table is lower than the bottom of lid practice scenario 2 then the restrictions remain the same as those of the current swmm it should be noted that swmm lid gw has simplified the dynamics of groundwater lid practices are assumed to respond instantaneously to groundwater table changes and the rate of groundwater flow into the lid practices is unlimited fig 2 illustrates these modifications in the source code of swmm lid gw each of the five boxes represents a source code file with the file name in the grey section the yellow sections list the parameters declared within that file and the data structures that these parameters belong to the blue sections show the major functions related to the modifications that are declared or used in the corresponding files arrows with solid lines represent data exchanges in between the files while arrows with dashed lines represent variable or function declaration relationships without data exchanges fig 2 the new parameters related to groundwater and in situ soils are declared in the data structure of tstoragelayer in the source code file of lid h the parameters include several van genuchten parameters α n residual soil moisture θ r saturated soil moisture θ s and initial soil moisture θ i without groundwater mound and the groundwater table depth the values of these parameters can be read from the input files and stored in the structure of the tlidproc storage of each lid practice by calling the function of readstoragedata in the source code file of lid c these parameters can then be used in the calculations of the underdrain flow and exfiltration rate the calculation was conducted using the function of getstorageexfilrate and getstoragedrainrate in the source code file of lidproc c the functions of pavementfluxrates biocellfluxrates and trenchfluxrates that control the water balance of different lid practices also used these parameters fig 2 2 1 2 hot start function the other part of incorporating groundwater feedback in swmm lid gw is enabling the storing and reading of lid hydrological states through the swmm hot start function the hydrological states include 1 water depth in the surface layer 2 water depth in the pavement layer 3 water depth in the storage layer and 4 soil moisture in the soil layer fig 2 the hot start function enables swmm to store simulation results in the hot start file at the end of each simulation which can be read by future simulations one common application of this hot start function is to run a warm up simulation and store the results for future use here this function is used to provide time dependent groundwater depths during simulations more specifically each simulation is separated into multiple sub simulations the temporal resolution of which depends on the total length of the whole simulation e g 1 min for a 1 hour rainfall event 30 min for a 1 year continuous simulation at the start of each sub simulation the groundwater table depth is added or updated in the input file then after each sub simulation the lid hydrological states at the end are outputted into the hot start file the next sub simulation then extracts the stored lid hydrological states from the hot start file updates the groundwater table depth in the input file and repeats the process fig 2 the groundwater table depth can be fed from a field monitoring time series or simulation results from a groundwater model however in the current swmm only a limited number of hydrological states can be stored in and read from the hot start file including the hydrological states related to infiltration i e cumulative infiltrated volume soil moisture deficit for the green ampt model groundwater i e soil moisture max infiltrated volume snowpack and some water quality states fig 2 but does not account for those related to lid practices as listed above thus the source code of the hot start function in swmm has been modified to enable the storing reading lid hydrological states in the hot start function two functions lid setstate and lid getstate have been added to the source code file of lid c to read and extract lid hydrological states respectively from the hot start file in addition another two functions of readrunoff and saverunoff have been added to the source code file of hotstart c fig 2 at the end of each sub simulation the function of saverunoff is called which then calls lid getstate to save the lid hydrological states into the hot start file in ascii format in addition at the start of each sub simulation if the hot start file is read specified in the input file these hydrological states can be extracted through the function of readrunoff in the hotstart c file which then calls lid setstate declared in the lid c file fig 2 it should be noted that all of the modifications were conducted using swmm 5 1 012 which was the most updated version at the time of this manuscript preparation in addition the groundwater table depth used to run swmm lid gw in this study came from on site groundwater monitoring data it can also come from other sources i e simulated groundwater head if swmm lid gw can be coupled with other groundwater models 2 2 study area and data the model was first applied to one urban catchment at central kitsap county campus ckcc located in kitsap county washington united states on a peninsula surrounded by puget sound the blue shaded region in fig 3 the precipitation averaged at 1023 6 mm year during the period of 1981 2010 with maximum and minimum precipitation occurring in december 256 0 mm month and july 22 1 mm month respectively the reference evapotranspiration was around 741 7 mm year the site is covered by a layer of sandy and silty fine sand with 0 5 m in thickness below that are layers of vashon recessional outwash vashon till vashon advanced outwash and pre vashon sediment from the top to the bottom the groundwater table at the site is relatively shallow the depth of which varies from 0 5 to 1 1 m based on the monitoring data of 2011 2012 the ckcc site is about 2 63 ha in size there are nine bioretention cells at the site and about 35 of the site mostly located at the western part of the site and 0 93 ha in size is covered by porous pavement in the form of parking lots the porous pavement can be roughly separated into 10 parcels based on location and topography the location of the site and the layout of the lid practices are shown in fig 3 these lid practices were constructed as the result of the lid demonstration project conducted in autumn 2010 which was funded by ecology s stormwater implementation grant program herrera 2013 the storage course of each parcel of porous pavement was 750 mm total in depth including a 300 mm upper layer of fine gravel and a 450 mm lower layer of coarse gravel bioretention cells were designed to receive surface runoff from porous or impervious asphalt pavement as post treatment each bioretention cell was sized to treat 91 of runoff volume from the drainage area which has a ponding depth of 100 mm a soil layer of 400 mm and a storage layer of 380 mm the soil layer was filled with 40 compost and 60 aggregate a pvc perforated underdrain 150 mm in diameter was installed with a certain offset height above the bottom of these lid practices herrera 2013 the underdrains were connected to the stormwater drains throughout the site fig 3 and all of the collected water was drained to the outlet of the catchment the details of the designs and configurations of the lid practices are shown in table 1 at the site the underdrain flow of one parcel of porous pavement called pp 0 17 ha the surface runoff from one parcel of impervious pavement 0 068 ha the surface runoff from the roof area 0 46 ha and the total hydraulic load at the outlet of the site 2 63 ha were monitored from october 2011 to september 2012 at 5 min intervals the four monitoring stations at which the data were collected pp ud ip sr roof sr and outlet are shown in fig 3 the collected data were continuously transferred to the two data stations for storage the approaches used to acquire the data are listed in table 2 at the monitoring stations of pp ud and ip sr the flow i e underdrain flow or surface runoff was measured as a water head at a stilling well in an 8 inch thel mar weir with a pressure transducer the water head was then transformed to a flow rate using a look up table provided by the manufacturer at the stations of roof sr and outlet the water level was measured by a northwest aquistar pt12 sdi 12 pressure transducer which was installed inside a stilling well in a 15 inch palmer bowlus flume it was transformed to a flow rate using an empirical equation of the 15 inch palmer bowlus flume table 2 in addition the groundwater table elevation was monitored by a groundwater monitoring well at the gw station which is near the station of pp ud fig 3 it was captured by a northwest aquistar pt12 sdi 12 pressure transducer within the well and stored by a cr800 data logger at data station 2 table 2 the groundwater table elevation was transformed into groundwater table depth which ranged from 0 5 to 1 1 m below ground over the monitoring period the precipitation data which averaged 1088 mm year for the monitoring period were collected from the silverdale rainfall station which is the nearest available rain gauge the monthly evaporation rate was retrieved from the statistics of the western regional climate center wrcc the temporal resolutions of the precipitation and groundwater monitoring were consistent at 5 min which is the same as in other datasets 2 3 model calibration and validation many parameters are provided in the project report herrera 2013 including the basic characteristics of the site i e area slope storm drain layout the geophysical characteristics of the site i e in situ soil type and the basic designs of porous pavement and bioretention cells i e drainage area media composition thickness of each media layer surface ponding depth size of the underdrain as shown in table 1 however some of the parameters required for swmm are not available or physically observable and thus need to be calibrated they include parameters related to the underdrain of lid practice e g offset height drainage coefficient and exponent of underdrain and some parameters related to subcatchment characteristics and flow routing e g manning s n for overland flow roughness of conduit depression storage of impervious area saturated hydraulic conductivity and the suction head for the green ampt infiltration equation all of the continuous monitoring data mentioned above were used for model calibration and validation precipitation and groundwater table depths were used as model inputs and the underdrain flow of pp ud surface runoff of ip sr roof sr and hydraulic load at the catchment outlet outlet were used as the targeted outputs the hydraulic load was the summation of the surface runoff and underdrain flow of the whole catchment the monitoring data during the first five months i e from october 1 2011 to february 29 2012 were used for calibration while the data for the last seven months i e from march 1 to september 30 2012 were used for validation five months were chosen for calibration because there were more intense rainfall events during the first six months and fewer in the following months so the intense events during the sixth month were retained for validation the time steps for surface runoff wet step and pipe flow routing step routing using the dynamic wave approach were 10 s all of the results were reported in 5 min intervals due to the use of hot start functions in swmm lid gw the whole simulation was separated into 8760 sub simulations with 1 hour intervals and there were 12 time steps within each sub simulation 5 min each thus the model calibration was conducted at a 1 hour resolution by averaging the results e g pp ud ip sr roof sr and outlet within each sub simulation for consistency although the current swmm did not use the hot start function its results were also averaged over 12 time steps and then calibrated at a 1 hour temporal resolution the logic of model calibration is shown in fig 4 swmm lid gw and the current swmm were first compiled as two separate console applications a matlab toolbox was then developed to execute and to post process the results of the two swmm applications in swmm lid gw hot start functions were implemented such that the groundwater table depth in the swmm input file was updated for each sub simulation fig 4 the matlb toolbox was integrated with swmm applications to form coupled swmm matlab console applications which can take an input file and return the post processed simulation results e g surface runoff time series for both versions of swmm the parameters of the two models were calibrated using a multi objective evolutionary algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 which was implemented in the r programming language tsou 2013 mersmann 2014 the optimization problem was formulated as follows 4 maximize q 1 θ q 2 θ q n θ 4 θ θ min θ max where θ is the vector of the parameters to be optimized and θ min and θ max are the lower and upper bounds of θ respectively q 1 to q n are the n quality or goodness of fit assessment functions of θ the quality of θ can be measured by the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the root mean square error rmse etc of the time series of different datasets in this study four quality assessment functions were used nse of pp ud ip sr roof sr and outlet the standard nse was used here eq 5 because it was found to have better performance when the time series of large quantities i e the surface runoff and underdrain times series are of interest krause et al 2005 the quality of the candidate solutions was assessed using r and was then used to select the parents for breeding the next generation after population ranking fig 4 the r toolbox can modify the input file according to the chromosome of the candidate solutions through processes of crossover crossover probability 0 9 and mutation mutation probability 0 1 and can invoke the execution of the coupled swmm matlab console application fig 4 to accelerate the computation the coupled application was executed in parallel on different cores of the desktop cpus for each generation the parallel computation was achieved by setting up multiple r sessions running in parallel and communicating over sockets using the functions provided in the parallel package r core team 2017 the final solution was manually selected from the last generation of populations on the pareto frontier by a loose standard of maximizing the nse of pp ud without compromising the results of the other quality assessment functions to the extent possible the nse of pp ud was selected to be maximized because the underdrain flow is an important process that should be accurately simulated for lid practices in shallow groundwater the root mean square error rmse and misclassification rate mcr of the calibration and validation results were also calculated eqs 6 7 mcr is commonly used in classification problems to evaluate the accuracy of the model in classifying groups of values considering that a great proportion of the instantaneous monitored surface runoff and underdrain flow was zero or nearly zero the rmse between the simulated and monitored results may not accurately reflect the efficiency of the model because the rmse may be still low even though the model produced many unrealistic results thus mcr can help by quantifying the accuracy of the model in capturing zero and non zero values 5 nse 1 t 1 n s t m t 2 t 1 n m t m 2 6 rmse t 1 n s t m t 2 n 7 mcr 1 n t 1 n 1 m t 0 s t 0 1 m t 0 s t 0 100 where n is the total length of the simulation which is 3648 h for calibration and 5012 h for validation s t and m t are the simulated and monitored results either surface runoff underdrain flow or hydraulic load at time step t m is the averaged monitored result during the period 1 m t 0 s t 0 equals 1 if s t 0 when m t 0 and similarly for 1 m t 0 s t 0 the data were deemed as zero or non zero when they were lower higher than 1 of the maximum value over the period either calibration or validation 2 4 hypothetical case studies to evaluate the hydrological performance of lid practices in a wider range of environmental conditions and to determine the situations in which swmm lid gw is more accurate than the current swmm a number of hypothetical event based case studies were conducted using both models parameters related to the catchment and lid practices remained the same in the different case studies however in situ soil type rainfall type and resulting groundwater fluctuation varied in total 675 hypothetical cases were studied using different climatic and geophysical conditions specifically 15 different initial groundwater table depths i e ranging from 0 1 m to 5 m below ground 9 different rainfall types i e intensities of 132 mm h 216 mm h and 353 mm h durations of 0 5 h 2 0 h and 6 0 h and 5 different in situ soils types i e loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam with different van genuchten parameters i e α n saturated hydraulic conductivity k s initial soil moisture θ i residual soil moisture θ r and saturated soil moisture θ s were used detailed information about the hypothetical cases is provided in table 3 the range of initial groundwater table depth 0 1 5 0 m was selected because it is considered shallow enough to affect lid practices and is between the ranges obtained by locatelli et al 2015 and zhang and chui 2017 within the range of 0 1 m to 1 0 m a finer interval i e 0 1 m was chosen because a minor change in the groundwater table depth should have a more significant impact on lid practices when the groundwater table was relatively shallow zhang and chui 2017 a coarser interval i e 0 5 m was chosen when the groundwater table depth was between 1 0 m and 3 0 m the in situ soil types were chosen as the most representative ones in which lid practices are installed he and davis 2010 assuming hydraulic equilibrium the initial soil moistures near the bottom of lid practices were determined using the van genuchten equation considering various initial groundwater table depths for different in situ soil types the peak intensity and rainfall pattern of the synthetic rainfalls were determined using the alternating block method and the intensity durationfrequency curves of locations in different continental areas i e hong kong sar in china london the united kingdom auckland new zealand rwanda and austin and arlington in the united states table 3 the intensities corresponded to the events with 2 yr 10 yr and 100 yr return periods with different durations in the different locations durations of 0 5 hr 2 0 hr and 6 0 hr were selected to cover the most representative durations for synthetic event based rainfalls fhwa 2009 dsd 2013 the physically based semi empirical model developed by park and parker 2008 was used to derive groundwater fluctuations based on rainfall time series there are a large number of approaches to estimating groundwater fluctuations such as water table fluctuation methods healy and cook 2002 lumped conceptual groundwater models mackay et al 2014 linear and nonlinear regression methods jirasirilak et al 2015 and machine learning algorithms yoon et al 2016 this approach a water table fluctuation method was adopted because of its simplicity and reasonably good results compared with newly developed analytical models park et al 2011 jeong and park 2017 the governing equation for obtaining groundwater table elevations through iterations is shown in eq 8 8 h i 1 h i e x p k δ t i α p i e x p k δ t i 1 kn where h i is the groundwater table elevation at the time step i δ t i is the time interval between the time steps i and i 1 k is the hydraulic conductivity α is the recharge precipitation ratio which represents the proportion of rainfall runoff that can be recharged and n is the fillable porosity defined by sophocleous 1991 that indicates the water required for a unit rise in the groundwater table the parameters listed above were estimated using the monitoring data at the ckcc site using a multivariable nonlinear optimization method through matlab although this method assumes a fixed percentage of groundwater recharge from precipitation and simplifies the calculation by neglecting certain groundwater drainage characteristics e g delayed recharge flux and lumping a number of groundwater drainage related variables together it is overall considered sufficiently accurate for the event based estimation of this study the underdrain flow and exfiltration rate of pp and the hydraulic load of the whole catchment were extracted to indicate the hydrological performance of lid practices the impact of each environmental condition on each performance indicator was evaluated a pearson correlation analysis was also performed to evaluate the cross impact of different environmental conditions and the cross correlation between environmental conditions and hydrological performance based on the general physical processes of lid practices three semi physical nonlinear multivariate formulas were proposed to predict hydrologic performance of lid practices peak underdrain flow peak exfiltration rate and peak hydraulic load of the catchment based on different environmental conditions and lid designs the coefficients were obtained based on the simulation results of hypothetical cases aforementioned among 675 hypothetical cases 338 were used for calibration and the rest 337 were used for validation more specifically cases of same rainfall intensity duration and in situ soil type were divided equally into calibration and validation pools while cases of initial groundwater table depth of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 7 m 0 9 m 1 5 m 2 5 m and 5 m were used for calibration while the rest were used for validation to derive more generic formulas dimensionless terms were developed based on the basic principle of hydrological processes of lid practices the formula of exfiltration eq 10 differs slightly from the other two eq 9 and eq 11 in that the first and third terms are inverted 9 ud ri a 1 d lid d gw a 2 ri a drain k media a lid a 3 k media k insitu a 4 10 ex ri b 1 d gw d lid b 2 ri a drain k media a lid b 3 k insitu k media b 4 11 hl ri c 1 d lid d

represents the depth of lid practices relative to the depth of groundwater table ri a drain k media a lid represents the relative rainfall intensity wu et al 2018 and k media k insitu represents the relative permeability of the lid practices the product of these three dimensionless terms is related to the rate of water infiltrating into and being stored within the lid practices which could then become underdrain flow exfiltration or catchment hydraulic load in addition to evaluate the applicability of swmm lid gw the relative difference between swmm lid gw and the current swmm represented as the indicator of the symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape was calculated eq 12 this indicator was used because a large proportion of the instantaneous monitored underdrain flow and exfiltration rate was zero or nearly zero smape does not produce mathematical values of infinities and it narrows the relative difference within the range of 0 to 100 which is more meaningful 12 smape

objective evolutionary algorithm the goodness of fit represented as nse improved gradually over generations and all of the datasets including pp ud ip sr roof sr and outlet remained almost constant after 20 generations fig 5 displays the nse of different datasets for the 36 populations of the last generation which has optimal goodness of fit the figure includes a number of scatter plots which are arranged in a semi matrix format the values of the x and y axes indicate the nse value for the corresponding dataset listed in the grey box near each axis for example fig 5b compares the nse value between outlet x axis and pp ud y axis there is an obvious tradeoff as parameters that lead to better pp ud values resulted in poorer goodness of fit for outlet and vice versa fig 5b mainly because a great proportion of underdrain flow entered the drainage system forming part of the flow at the outlet seen in the layout of underdrain pipes and stormwater drains in fig 1 the model tended to underestimate pp ud but overestimate outlet so higher pp ud resulted in better goodness of fit for pp ud but lower goodness of fit for outlet the nse of ip sr was positively correlated with those of pp ud fig 5c and roof sr fig 5e but negatively correlated with outlet fig 5a the nse of ip sr was positively related to those of pp ud and roof sr because they were all correlated positively with manning s n and were all underestimated by the model an increase in any one of them can increase the values of the other two and improve their goodness of fit outlet was overestimated while ip sr was underestimated although ip sr and outlet increased simultaneously the goodness of fit of outlet decreased but that of ip sr increased comparatively no obvious relationship was observed between pp ud and roof sr fig 5f which was expected one set of parameters was selected manually as calibrated from the last generation evolved from nsga ii these are indicated as red circles in fig 5 then the pp ud roof sr ip sr and outlet simulated using that set of parameters were compared with the monitoring data using root mean square error rmse nash sutcliff efficiency nse and misclassification rate mcr the final calibrated parameters of both swmm lid gw and the current swmm are shown in table 4 it should be noted that the parameters of the underdrain coefficient exponent and offset height were only calibrated for swmm lid gw while those of the current swmm were pre specified because they were found to exert minimal influence on the results of the current swmm fig 6 a shows the precipitation and groundwater table fluctuations of the calibration and validation periods while fig 6b and 6c display all of the simulated and field monitored time series for two representative events during calibration and validation respectively each sub figure of fig 7 compares one of the simulated series with the field monitored one during both calibration and validation it also shows the exceedance of probability of both swmm lid gw and the current swmm table 5 lists the goodness of fit of all of the simulated datasets compared with the field monitored ones first the underdrain flow of swmm lid gw agreed with the monitoring data reasonably well during both calibration and validation with nse of 0 32 and 0 55 during calibration and validation respectively in addition the rmse 3 89 mm h and 0 79 mm h for calibration and validation and the mcr 2 17 and 0 66 for calibration and validation respectively were very low table 5 swmm lid gw slightly underestimated the underdrain flow generated by extreme rainfall events e g event on nov 23 2011 but accurately captured the underdrain flow of most of the rainfall events fig 7a the poorer nse and mcr values of pp ud during calibration compared with validation table 5 were possibly due to the difference in the range of data between calibration and validation as there were more major rainfall events and a higher groundwater table during calibration than during validation fig 6a comparatively the current swmm was not able to capture the generation of the underdrain flow e g fig 6 b 1 6 c 1 7 a 1 and 7 a 2 the nse value was 0 01 during both calibration and validation the goodness of fit represented by rmse 4 73 mm h and 0 99 mm h during calibration and validation and mcr 3 84 and 0 95 during calibration and validation was significantly poorer than that of swmm lid gw table 5 swmm lid gw has thus significantly improved the simulation of the underdrain flow of lid practices in shallow groundwater compared with the current swmm it was deemed a highly effective improvement considering the minor modifications made and the simple equation used as for the surface runoff ip sr and roof sr although both swmm lid gw and the current swmm underestimated some peak runoffs e g fig 6 c 2 7 b 1 and 7 c 1 they obtained reasonably good fits and the goodness of fit of the two models was very close e g fig 7 b 1 7 b 2 7 c 1 and 7 c 2 the nse rmse and mcr values were 0 36 and 0 37 1 05 10 4 m3 s and 1 13 10 4 m3 s 6 11 and 4 01 for swmm lid gw and were 0 41 and 0 39 1 01 10 4 m3 s and 9 36 10 5 m3 s 7 92 and 5 34 for the current swmm during calibration and validation respectively table 5 the minor differences in ip sr and roof sr between the two models were mainly caused by the differences in the underdrain flow more specifically the underdrain flow of all of the bioretention cells and porous pavements obtained by swmm lid gw was significantly larger than that of the current swmm and was all collected and drained to the outlet of the catchment i e outlet to strike a balance in fitting both pp ud and outlet the calibrated manning s n of the overland flow of swmm lid gw for example was higher than that of the current swmm table 4 this thus leads to a slight difference in the surface runoff results i e ip sr and roof sr between the two models the two models produced very different results for the hydraulic load of the catchment i e outlet although their goodness of fit was quite close with an nse value of 0 56 0 46 for swmm lid gw and 0 60 0 53 for the current swmm during calibration validation table 5 swmm lid gw obtained a better fit with only minor overestimation the current swmm significantly underestimated it fig 7 d 1 during calibration the rmse was 1 90 10 3 m3 s and 1 80 10 3 m3 s and the mcr was 24 56 and 24 86 for swmm lid gw and the current swmm respectively during validation the rmse was 5 40 10 3 m3 s and 8 76 10 4 m3 s and the mcr was 12 72 and 11 50 for swmm lid gw and the current swmm respectively table 5 however both models misclassified a great proportion of the hydraulic load outlet the mcr was several times larger than that of other datasets but it was considered acceptable because the mcr value was reduced by more than 50 or 85 if the criterion for filtering can be relaxed from 1 to 2 or 5 respectively 3 2 impact of environmental conditions on the hydrological performance of lid practices the model for generating groundwater fluctuations were firstly calibrated before conducting hypothetical case studies the calibration results and an example of synthetic rainfall and groundwater fluctuation are displayed in fig 8 b obviously the groundwater table rose to a certain height due to precipitation and dissipated gradually afterwards it should be noted that the y axis of fig 8a represents the groundwater head while that in fig 8b represents the groundwater table depth below ground 3 2 1 impact of initial groundwater table depth based on the results of the hypothetical case studies the time series of underdrain flow and exfiltration rate of the pp and the hydraulic load of the catchment for different initial groundwater table depths are shown in fig 9 a 9e and 9i respectively the curves represent the averaged values for different conditions at the specified groundwater table depths since they highly overlap together as expected the underdrain flow was greater when groundwater table was shallower the peak underdrain flow increased from 5 to 15 mm h when the groundwater table was 1 0 5 0 m below ground to 32 mm h 42 mm h and 53 mm h for groundwater table depths of 0 6 m 0 4 m and 0 2 m respectively fig 9a the underdrain flow obtained increased sharply when the groundwater table rose from 1 0 m to 0 6 m below ground which was understandable because the underdrain was at 0 75 m below ground in addition the exfiltration rate from the pp was greater when the groundwater table was deeper fig 9e the peak exfiltration rate was 27 mm h and 17 mm h when groundwater table was 5 0 m and 2 5 m below ground but became zero when the bottom of the pp was submerged i e the water table was less than 1 0 m below ground the hydraulic load of the catchment showed a similar temporal pattern as that of the exfiltration rate during the rainfall period fig 9e and 9i it reached the peak very quickly fluctuated during the event and dropped after rainfall stopped however the hydraulic load did not drop to zero as exfiltration but reached a near equilibrium with only a slight decrease over time the load during this period was sustained by the underdrain flow of multiple lid practices within the catchment because the groundwater table responded and dropped more gradually fig 10 a shows the water budget of the pp for different initial groundwater table depths obviously the volume and proportion of underdrain flow in the water budget obtained by swmm lid gw were greater when the groundwater table was shallower the event based volume of the underdrain flow was 2044 m3 93 when the groundwater table was 0 2 m below ground but dropped to 1219 m3 80 and 588 m3 79 when the groundwater table was 0 6 m and 0 8 m below ground respectively it further decreased to around 30 100 m3 when the groundwater table dropped further fig 10a in contrast the volume and proportion of exfiltration were greater when the groundwater table was deeper the volume of exfiltration was zero when the groundwater table was 0 2 0 7 m below ground but increased to 100 153 m3 when groundwater dropped to 1 5 5 m below ground fig 10a this was expected because when the groundwater table was shallower less water can exfiltrate out due to more saturated in situ soil and a lower hydraulic gradient from the lid to the surrounding area the last column in fig 10a shows the water budget results of the current swmm which was similar to that calculated by swmm lid gw when the groundwater table was deeper than 1 5 m obviously the current swmm highly underestimated the underdrain flow and the overall water budget of pp when the groundwater was shallow 3 2 2 impact of rainfall type the time series for different rainfall intensities and durations are shown in fig 9b 9f 9j and 9c 9g 9k respectively as expected the underdrain flow was greater for events of greater intensities and longer durations fig 9b c the peak underdrain flow was 22 8 mm h 23 0 mm h and 25 3 mm h for rainfall intensities of 132 mm h 216 mm h and 353 mm h fig 9b and was 23 8 mm h 24 9 mm h and 26 1 mm h for durations of 0 5 h 2 h and 6 h fig 9c the exfiltration rate was slightly greater for rainfall events of greater intensities but was not affected by rainfall duration fig 9f and 9g in addition the impact of the rainfall type on the hydraulic load of the catchment differed during and after the rainfall event during the rainfall event initial 6 h similar to the case of exfiltration the hydraulic load of the catchment was greater for rainfall events of greater intensities fig 9j but was not affected by rainfall duration fig 9k however after a rainfall event both rainfall intensity and duration affected the hydraulic load slightly because the hydraulic load mainly came from the underdrain flow after rainfall stopped which was dependent on groundwater table depth but not rainfall type fig 10b shows the water budget of the pp for different rainfall types the columns on the left and right of each group correspond to the results of swmm lid gw and the current swmm respectively the volume and proportion of the underdrain flow obtained by swmm lid gw was slightly greater when rainfall intensity and duration were greater the volume of underdrain flow increased from 721 m3 81 to 1104 m3 84 when rainfall intensity and duration increased from 132 mm h 0 5 h to 353 mm h 6 h fig 10b exfiltration was also slightly greater for rainfall events of greater intensities rainfall duration did not show an obvious impact on the exfiltration of swmm lid gw but it affected the results of the current swmm positively the volume of exfiltration calculated by the current swmm increased from 20 30 m3 to 40 80 m3 and 110 160 m3 moving from rainfall events of 0 5 h to 2 0 h and 3 0 h which correspond to proportions of 17 36 29 48 and 40 60 respectively fig 10c which was significantly higher than that obtained by swmm lid gw 3 2 3 impact of in situ soil type the time series for different in situ soil types are shown in fig 9d 9 h and 9 l the underdrain flow was slightly greater for less permeable soils peak at 25 27 mm h for sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam but lower for more permeable soils peak at 22 23 mm h for loamy sand and sandy loam fig 9d the exfiltration of the pp surrounded by more permeable soils i e loamy sand was greater than others so less water accumulated within the pp which could be drained out from the underdrain this explanation was supported by the results of exfiltration as shown in fig 9h the exfiltration rate peaked at 15 mm h for loamy sand and sandy loam but was 5 mm h 2 5 mm h and 1 5 mm h for sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam respectively however in situ soil type did not affect the results of the hydraulic load of the catchment because its impact on underdrain flow was negligible compared to the overall surface runoff from the whole catchment fig 9l fig 10c shows the water budget of the pp for different in situ soil types the volume and proportion of the underdrain flow was very close for different in situ soil types but was slightly greater for less permeable soils the volume was 839 m3 81 7 and 831 m3 81 5 for loamy sand and sandy loam but increased to 864 m3 82 1 878 m3 82 4 and 885 m3 82 5 for sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam respectively fig 10c this was consistent with the phenomenon observed in fig 9d which was a result of different exfiltration amounts for different in situ soil types as shown in fig 10c the volumes of exfiltration were 63 m3 6 2 and 74 m3 7 3 for loamy sand and sandy loam but the volumes were 39 m3 3 7 24 m3 2 3 and 17 m3 1 6 for sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam respectively fig 10c a similar pattern was captured by the current swmm the volume of exfiltration was 146 m3 113 m3 61 m3 24 m3 and 15 m3 for in situ soils of loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam which correspond to proportions of 80 62 33 13 and 8 respectively fig 10c 3 2 4 cross impact analysis fig 11 shows the pearson correlation matrix between different environmental conditions i e initial groundwater table depth rainfall intensity rainfall duration and in situ soil type and hydrological performance i e peak underdrain flow peak exfiltration and peak hydraulic load the numbers within the matrix are the pearson correlation coefficients which represent the correlation between two terms values closer to 1 and 1 mean high correlation while values closer to 0 mean low correlation the results confirm some observations obtained above for example compared with rainfall intensity and duration initial groundwater table depth and in situ soil type played more significant roles in generating the underdrain flow coefficients of 0 26 and 0 31 versus 0 03 and 0 08 exfiltration coefficients of 0 32 and 0 38 versus 0 00 and 0 11 and hydraulic load of the catchment coefficients of 0 16 and 0 09 versus 0 04 and 0 01 the underdrain flow was found to be closely related to exfiltration with a coefficient of 0 69 some correlation existed between the underdrain flow and hydraulic load of the catchment as mentioned above with a coefficient of 0 32 3 3 general formulas to predict hydrologic performance of lid practices the final calibrated formulas for peak underdrain flow peak exfiltration and peak hydraulic load of the catchment has been shown in eqs 13 15 below 13 u d r i 0 270 d lid d gw 0 478 ri a drain k m e d i a a lid 0 805 k media k insitu 0 0226 14 e x r i 0 234 d gw d lid 0 826 ri a drain k m e d i a a lid 0 964 k insitu k media 0 637 15 h l r i 0 286 d lid d gw 0 095 ri a drain k m e d i a a lid 0 313 k media k insitu 0 0063 fig 12 compares the predicted values with the monitoring values in both calibration and validation although there is some discrepancy in the prediction of exfiltration small exfiltration values were overestimated while great exfiltration values were underestimated a little bit fig 12b in overall three formulas obtained reasonably good fits in both calibration and validation the nse were 0 812 and 0 809 for peak underdrain flow 0 628 and 0 591 for peak exfiltration 0 619 and 0 616 for peak hydraulic load during calibration and validation respectively the coefficients of the formulas also reflect the relative impact of different environmental conditions on the hydrologic performance of lid practices initial groundwater table depth and rainfall intensity showed more dominant roles in generating underdrain flow than soil conditions given their relatively larger coefficients 0 478 and 0 805 versus 0 0226 the impacts of different factors on exfiltration were comparable to each other 0 826 0 964 and 0 637 while rainfall intensity governed the hydraulic load of the catchment than initial groundwater table depth and soil conditions 0 725 versus 0 055 and 0 0046 although these formulas were generated based on the modeling results of only one site they are deemed as representative because they have incorporated hundreds of hypothetical cases and have involved and normalized the most influential parameters they can potentially be used in other places during feasibility analysis in which the hydrologic performance of lid practices in shallow groundwater needs to be evaluated however it should be noted that the formula of catchment hydraulic load should be used with caution because catchment hydraulic load also depends on some site characteristics e g number of lid practices imperviousness and layout of stormwater sewers that have not been accounted for 3 4 model applicability analysis the relative differences in the underdrain flow exfiltration and hydraulic load between swmm lid gw and the current swmm over different initial groundwater table depths for different rainfall types and in situ soil types represented by the smape value are shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively the underdrain flow obtained by swmm lid gw differed significantly from that of the current swmm when the groundwater table was shallower than the underdrain less than 0 8 m below ground figs 13a and 14a the relative difference between the two models represented by the smape value was 100 when the groundwater table was 0 4 0 6 m below ground and it gradually dropped to 70 100 and 25 50 when the groundwater table dropped to 0 8 m and 1 0 m below ground respectively figs 13a and 14a because swmm lid gw can capture the increase of the underdrain flow when the groundwater table becomes shallower eq 3 when the groundwater table dropped below the lid practice i e 1 5 5 0 m below ground the smape value reached an almost constant range with variances caused by different rainfall types figs 13a and 14a the pattern of hydraulic load influenced by initial groundwater table depth was very similar to that of the underdrain flow because a huge proportion of the hydraulic load came from the underdrain flow as observed in fig 10 while the initial groundwater table depth did not show a significant impact on the relative difference in exfiltration between the two models the smape was relatively stable around 0 25 for all of the different groundwater table depths with minor variances figs 13b and 14b the underdrain flow of the two models was not influenced by the rainfall type when the groundwater table was shallower than 0 6 m i e the depth of the underdrain and it was mainly determined by the groundwater table depth however it was affected by the rainfall type when the groundwater table was deeper at which the relative difference in the underdrain flow between the two models was slightly greater for rainfall events of greater intensities fig 13a in addition the relative difference in the exfiltration rate between the two models was greater for rainfall events of longer duration when groundwater was shallower than the bottom of lid practice i e 0 2 1 0 m below ground the averaged smape of the exfiltration rate increased from 2 to 3 to 8 9 and around 25 when rainfall duration increased from 0 5 h to 2 0 h and 6 0 h respectively fig 13b in this case the exfiltration rate obtained by swmm lid gw was consistently at zero and was not influenced by rainfall type however rainfall events of longer duration can lead to a greater exfiltration rate for the current swmm thus the relative difference between the two models was greater for events of longer durations when the groundwater table was deeper than the bottom of lid practice the impact of rainfall type became non obvious fig 13b in addition it was found that when groundwater was shallower than the underdrain i e 0 2 0 6 m below ground the smape of the hydraulic load between the two models was slightly greater for rainfall events of smaller durations and lower intensities fig 13c is because the hydraulic load obtained by swmm lid gw was mainly dominated by the underdrain flow in this case which was mainly caused by shallow groundwater instead of rainfall thus increasing the intensity or duration of rainfall events had a higher impact on the results of current swmm but a lower impact on swmm lid gw leading to a lower relative difference between the two models however this effect was not obvious when the groundwater table elevation further decreased the relative differences in underdrain flow exfiltration and hydraulic load between the two models were not affected by the in situ soil type when the groundwater table was less than 1 0 m below ground fig 14 however a slight impact was observed when the groundwater table was relatively deep 1 0 m below ground fig 14a and c in this case the relative difference in the underdrain flow and hydraulic load between the two models was higher for less permeable in situ soils the smape values for in situ soils of loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam silt loam and clay loam were around 0 1 11 8 34 12 44 and 12 49 for underdrain flow fig 14a and 5 28 6 39 15 48 21 54 and 24 58 for hydraulic load fig 14c due to different exfiltration rates for different in situ soils as mentioned above thus the relative difference in exfiltration was also slightly greater for less permeable soils fig 14b the results of pearson correlation analysis further confirm the observations obtained above fig 15 the smape of the underdrain flow and hydraulic load were only closely related to the initial groundwater table depth both having coefficients of 0 75 which was consistent with that observed above the smape of the underdrain flow was closely related to the smape of hydraulic load with a coefficient of 0 98 while the smape of exfiltration was less affected by these environmental conditions fig 15 compared with other conditions the initial groundwater table depth affected exfiltration more with a coefficient of 0 19 fig 15 generally swmm lid gw obtained more accurate underdrain flow and a greater overall hydraulic load of the catchment for a wide range of groundwater table depths particularly when the groundwater table was shallower than 1 0 m below ground the difference in exfiltration between swmm lid gw and the current swmm was not as significant as that of the underdrain flow and hydraulic load but it still varied a great deal for rainfall events of longer duration and less permeable in situ soils thus studies related to the hydrological processes of lid practices at locations with relatively shallow groundwater conditions less than 5 m below ground can potentially benefit from swmm lid gw those related to lid underdrain flow should use swmm lid gw particularly if groundwater table depth frequently rises to 1 0 m or less below ground during storm events rainfall type and in situ soil type are not the major factors influencing the choice of swmm lid gw over the current swmm however places with more high intensity and long duration events and less permeable soils are more recommended to use swmm lid gw mainly due to the higher rise in groundwater 4 conclusions a modified swmm swmm lid gw was developed to evaluate the hydrological performance of lid in shallow groundwater different from the current swmm which separates lid practices from the groundwater system swmm lid gw integrates groundwater table depth into the governing equations of underdrain flow and exfiltration and considers the variably saturated groundwater heads of the in situ soils during lid simulations shallow groundwater was found to exert a significant influence on the hydrological performance of lid practices groundwater has a high risk of being drained through the underdrain flow of lid practices in shallow groundwater which accounts for a significant proportion of the water budget of lid practices when groundwater was shallower the exfiltration rate was lower but the underdrain flow and hydraulic load were greater in addition due to the dominant role of shallow groundwater rainfall intensity and duration showed very limited influence on the underdrain flow exfiltration rate and catchment hydraulic load this is different from locations with deeper groundwater table in which the impact of rainfall intensity and duration could be significant in addition in situ soil type was important for exfiltration but showed minimal impact on the underdrain flow and hydraulic load of the catchment three semi physical nonlinear multivariate formulas have been generated to predict the peak underdrain flow peak exfiltration and peak hydraulic load of the catchment based on different environmental conditions i e initial groundwater table depth rainfall intensity hydraulic conductivity of in situ soil and lid designs i e depth and media soil of lid practices the formulas can potentially be utilized to predict the hydrologic performance and support the feasibility analysis of lid practices in shallow groundwater environment comparatively the current swmm underestimated underdrain flow but overestimated the exfiltration of lid practices in shallow groundwater swmm lid gw was better than the current swmm in simulating the underdrain flow exfiltration rate and hydraulic load for a range of groundwater table depths swmm lid gw produced more accurate results in shallow groundwater with few additional inputs and is thus a simple and practical tool that can facilitate the performance evaluation and design of lid practices it is recommended for areas with shallow groundwater e g 5 0 m or less below ground and it is particularly accurate in simulating the underdrain flow of lid practices in which the groundwater table rises to 1 0 m or less below ground during storm events although rainfall type and in situ soil type are not the major factors influencing the choice of swmm lid gw over the current swmm swmm lid gw is recommended for locations surrounded by less lower permeable soils and locations that have more high intensity and long duration rainfall events mainly due to the higher rise in the groundwater table based on the results obtained by swmm lid gw lid practices should be highly beneficial to locations with groundwater depletion due to enhanced infiltration for places with stormwater management problems and shallow groundwater special attention should be given to the design of lid practices to obtain an optimal tradeoff between surface runoff control and groundwater protection for example the underdrain pipe can be elevated to be farther away from the groundwater table or the lid can be lined with an impermeable liner to prevent the effects of groundwater the liner may slightly affect surface runoff control performance but can greatly minimize the impact of lid practices on groundwater and further prevent additional hydraulic load from draining groundwater some limitations of this study present future research opportunities first only the calculations of underdrain flow and exfiltration of lid practices have been modified in swmm lid gw other environmental processes e g evapotranspiration that may also be affected by shallow groundwater have not been accounted for in addition only the variable saturation of shallow groundwater and its impact on in situ soils have been considered in swmm lid gw those related to the soil media inside lid practices have not furthermore this study has only made use of groundwater table depths that were pre specified to realize a two way coupling between lid practices and groundwater systems swmm lid gw can potentially be coupled with groundwater models that provide real time groundwater table depths during simulations in addition lid practices are seldom implemented in shallow groundwater environments and it is rare for such sites to be equipped with both surface runoff and groundwater table depth monitoring the model used in this study was therefore only calibrated to one year of monitoring data for one site although the results and conclusions obtained are considered meaningful and representative given the one real case study and various hypothetical case studies a longer period of monitoring data from multiple sites could improve the validity of the model and results finally with the use of a hot start function and the consideration of groundwater in the water balance calculation the water balance of the entire simulation cannot be directly extracted from output files and must to be further post processed the hot start function also involves external file input and outputs which slows down the computations of swmm lid gw future work can therefore look into more efficient coding and data exchanges acknowledgements this work was funded by the seed funding programme for basic research of the

6947,it is widely recognized that the prediction of transport of contaminants in a fractured rock mass requires models that preserve several distinctive features of the inner fracture network like heterogeneity and directionality in this respect discrete fracture networks dfns play a significant role the solution of the associated equations would claim a high computational demand that could be met only by using agile and robust numerical techniques in this note a new numerical technique fully validated from a mathematical standpoint is applied to engineering problems also introducing dispersion models for the description of non stationary transport phenomena the method results in a fast and scalable resolution tool based on a pde constrained optimization approach designed to avoid mesh generation problems and allowing for transport simulations with an eulerian approach examples are reported to show the quality of the solution obtained even by using relatively coarse meshes and quite geometrically complex dfns keywords discrete fracture networks contaminant transport optimization process 1 introduction in several fields of geomechanical engineering the prediction of fluid flow and transport of contaminants in fractured rocks is a crucial issue as for example for the design of deep geological repositories of high level radioactive nuclear waste however pursuing the numerical solution of the associated equations is challenging for the complicated geometries and high computational demand berkowitz 2002 macquarrie and mayer 2005 and neuman 2005 provided a review of the available models for fractured rocks and related applicability from the many contributions in scientific literature it is apparent that heterogeneity and directionality are peculiar features of fractured rocks that should be included in any predictive model since the pioneering works of schwartz et al 1983 and smith and schwartz 1984 discrete fracture networks dfns emerged as the only models fully including these features dfns are stochastic networks generated by extracting from specific probability density functions geometrical and hydraulic properties of planar objects located in a simulation domain such objects are assimilated to the fractures of the rock mass under analysis dershowitz and einstein 1988 in a statistical sense a dfn is an adequate replica of a fracture network for the solution of the equations governing fluid flow and contaminant transport in a dfn two dimensional or three dimensional networks are used the flow regime is computed first it constitutes the basis for the solution of the contaminant mass balance equation or advection dispersion equation ade such a solution is pursued by resorting to a lagrangian approach or to an eulerian approach generally in the context of finite element fe discretizations of the simulation domain in the lagrangian approach for a purely advective transport the mass of contaminant is condensed into particles that are introduced at various locations to follow path lines at each time step the contaminant concentration derives by counting the number of particles in each sub domain in which the flow domain has been subdivided the contribution of the hydrodynamical dispersion tensor is considered by using random walks rws techniques like the rwpt random walk particle tracking technique well suited to capture motion and spreading of a contaminant in an advecting flow field even in disordered flows like the ones occurring in fractured media an overview of the available rwpt techniques in the context of fractured media is reported in noetinger et al 2016 cacas et al 1990 used a rwpt technique for the transport simulation in systems of one dimensional conductors pipes derived from three dimensional fracture networks miller 1990 implemented rwpt in the three dimensional fem code mafic for discrete fractures and porous blocks rwpt was also used by painter et al 2005 and frampton and cvetkovic 2011 roubinet et al 2010 used a rwpt approach to two dimensional systems of fractures and blocks under the assumptions of pure advection in fractures and one dimensional diffusion in matrix blocks a rwpt approach was also used by liu et al 2000 to handle advection dispersion in a dual porosity medium recently a new computational scheme to generate three dimensional networks and solve flow and transport problems from a lagrangian standpoint has been proposed by hyman et al 2015 a similar scheme has been adopted also by makedonska et al 2015 as far as the eulerian approach for two dimensional or three dimensional dfns is concerned literature is much poorer of contributions codes in which the governing equations for both steady state fluid flow and contaminant transport are solved by using a fem discretization are fractran sudicky and mclaren 1998 polymin molson et al 2007 and frac3dvs graf and therrien 2005 in the last contribution the solution is extended to the rock blocks considered as pervious it is to remark that the main difficulty in defining the fluid velocities resides in the generation of a conforming mesh of the network i e a mesh whose elements are perfectly matching at the traces obviously for dfns with a large number of fractures the number of geometrical constraints of the conforming mesh could cause the failure of the meshing process or lead to the generation of elongated elements with detrimental effects on the quality of the computed flow regime many authors are currently working on new methods in order to circumvent this drawback among the others mustapha et al 2011 mustapha 2014 ehrel et al 2009 and pichot et al 2012 suggest the use of mortar methods and or modifications of the dfn geometry in order to ease the meshing however these strategies might be insufficient when dealing with highly intricate networks as for example in stochastically generated dfns in fact in order to ensure partial conformity see later at traces and good quality of the mesh a large number of elements is likely to be required when traces intersect with very small angles when very small traces appear or when very close non intersecting traces are generated in hyman et al 2014 a new algorithm is devised that is capable of detecting and rejecting any randomly generated geometrical entity smaller than a prescribed length scale in noetinger and jarrige 2012 and noetinger 2015 the geometrical complexities are tackled by reducing the fracture dimensionality fourno et al 2016 recently proposed an alternative meshing method the fracture cut method for meshing frac in which each fracture is decomposed into a set of connected closed contours mesh generation in huang et al 2016 relies somehow on the same ideas the mesh elements are conforming at the common segments and there is no removal of traces intersection points are displaced or added to preserve the quality of the mesh ngo et al 2017 used frac to derive conforming meshes to be superposed by control cells of the finite volume method code dumux flemisch et al 2011 that is characterized by a high level euclidean based transport modeling capability other authors propose the use of unconventional discretization strategies as for example fumagalli and scotti 2014 with the extended finite element method xfem of fries and belytschko 2010 that allows a non conforming mesh at the interfaces or methods handling even badly shaped polygonal elements as the virtual element method vem of beirão da veiga et al 2013 for which polygonal conforming meshes are constructed see benedetto et al 2014 2016 2017 and references therein other methods recently developed in different contexts in order to circumvent mesh generation problems in complex geometries are cutfem burman et al 2014 fictitious domain methods immersed boundaries peskin 2002 polygonal methods such as hybrid high order chave et al 2018 gradient methods brenner et al 2016 xing et al 2017 xing et al 2017 this recent substantial literature motivates the development of alternative meshing techniques capable of handling arbitrarily complex geometries without any modification of the dfn geometry in this note an eulerian fem based technique consisting of the combination of two weak formulations one for the flux equation and one for the ade equation non conforming meshing and an optimization process is proposed with the limitation of impervious rock matrix the weak formulations are introduced to define both flux and ade equations whereas for the errors of the continuity conditions at the traces and flux balance a cost functional is introduced to be minimized for the fulfillment of these conditions through optimization the technique allows one to use meshes independently generated on each fracture and as such non matching at fracture intersections these meshes are named non conforming the optimization process has been described and fully validated in previous works see berrone et al 2013 berrone et al 2016 berrone et al 2017 and references therein and typical error estimates are available berrone et al 2016 in addition with reference to the steady state fluid flow a large number of numerical tests has been proposed showing the robustness of the method when dealing with strong geometrical complexities and also with respect to the preservation of the fluid continuity pieraccini and scialò 2016 finally the technique can be easily parallelizable therefore it is suitable for efficiently handling monster networks berrone et al 2015 herein the above mentioned optimization approach is applied in the framework of unsteady advection diffusion simulations to engineering problems characterized by complex realistic networks several dispersion models are also considered yielding full symmetric non uniform diffusivity tensors depending on the computed velocity advective field in this context mass conservation is a key issue and several numerical tests are devoted to numerically prove both local on traces and global on the network mass conservation properties for the proposed approach some indicators are proposed to easily check the quality of the numerical solution these indicators are tested with respect to a moderate mesh refinement for a relatively large time interval the proposed numerical tests also address the issue of global mass conservation when locally at the traces the flux balance is imposed in a weak sense showing the mass conservation properties of the optimization approach also for long time scale simulations in complex networks thus proving the viability of the proposed approach in what follows the governing equations are described in detail section 2 along with the weak formulations and the optimization process section 3 in section 4 the described technique is applied to validation examples based on networks of increasing complexity aiming at proving robustness and stability of the approach with respect to geometrical complexities and addressing quite general unsteady models in table 1 a glossary of terms is reported as reference for what follows 2 governing equations given a dfn with n f fractures in fracture i the darcy law applies 1 q x t i x h x where x x 1 x 2 is the coordinate system in i q x is the fluid discharge across a fracture void of unit width t i x is the isotropic transmissivity of fracture i and h x is the hydraulic head note that the density driven fluid flow is not considered the fluid velocities inside the fracture voids are assumed parallel to the mean plane therefore there are no components normal to this plane it follows 2 v x q x e i x being e i x the fracture aperture and v x the mean velocity from the volumetric balance under steady state conditions the following equation derives for fracture i 3 q x 0 by combining eqs 1 and 3 the laplace equation is obtained 4 t i x h x 0 note that the domain of definition of eqs 3 and 4 is strictly the fracture plane with the exclusion of the traces note also that the area of the traces in the fracture plane is assumed infinitesimal fractures of a dfn are usually represented as polygons whose sides are insulated and a no flow condition is applied the flow regime in each fracture is affected by the traces acting as linear sources or sinks thus possibly causing discontinuities for the discharge q of the fracture for each trace j in fracture i with j 1 n t i n t i being the number of traces in fracture i a local coordinate x j can be defined then the quantity q t x j represents the fluid discharge per unit trace length entering or exiting the trace since each trace is interpreted as a slit namely it is seen as a rectangle of infinitesimal width in the plane of a fracture elsworth 1986 dershowitz and fidelibus 1999 quantity q t x j is equal to 5 q t x j t i x j h n 1 x j h n 2 x j with the subscripts 1 and 2 referring to the two regions in which the fracture i is divided by the trace line as displayed in fig 1 n 1 denoting the outward unit normal to the trace for region 1 and q n 1 t i h n 1 similar definitions apply to n 2 and q n 2 if the intersection of fracture i with fracture k is labelled j i in the list of traces of fracture i and l k in the list of traces of fracture k a point of coordinate x j i in j i corresponds to a point of coordinate x l k in l k the following equations apply 6 h x j i h x l k 7 q t x j i q t x l k 0 representing the continuity of the hydraulic head and the conservation of fluid volume respectively constituting constraints for eq 4 as previously mentioned the dispersion model used herein includes molecular diffusion mechanical dispersion and taylor s dispersion in formula modified from roux et al 1998 8 d τ d d i d d t in which d is the fracture hydrodynamic dispersion tensor τ is a tortuosity coefficient introduced to take into account the reduced rate of molecular diffusion in geometrically complex void spaces d d is the molecular diffusion d is the mechanical dispersion tensor and d t is the taylor s dispersion tensor tensor d is as follows d d 11 d 12 d 21 d 22 with d 11 α l v 1 2 α t v 2 2 v d 22 α t v 1 2 α l v 2 2 v d 12 d 21 α l α t v 1 v 2 v being α l α t the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities respectively tensor d t is d t α t v 2 i where α t is a coefficient accounting for taylor s dispersion mechanism for a parallel plate fracture of constant aperture e and subject to a uniform flow v this coefficient is e 2 210 d d fischer et al 1979 given eq 2 d and d t become d 11 α l q 1 2 α t q 2 2 q e i d 22 α t q 1 2 α l q

unit fracture width is 9 j e i d c c q where c is the contaminant concentration from eq 9 the mass balance of contaminant derives as follows shikaze et al 1998 10 d c 1 e i q c c t and by considering eq 2 eq 10 becomes 11 d c v c c t note again that the domain of definition of eqs 10 and 11 is the internal part of the fracture with the exclusion of the traces as for the fluid flow two constraints for eq 10 are imposed at traces 12 c x j i c x l k 13 j t x j i j t x l k 0 where j t is the advective dispersive mass flux at the trace see fig 1 14 j t x j e i x j d c n 1 x j d c n 2 x j cq t x j moreover j n ℓ x j e i x j d c n ℓ x j cq n ℓ x j for ℓ 1 2 is defined it is to remark that a complete mixing at fracture intersections is envisaged herein thus a unique concentration value is assigned to each node of the intersections even if this condition occurs in limited cases berkowitz et al 1994 it is assumed here for the sake of simplicity nonetheless the presented approach can handle more general models eqs 4 and 10 with constraints 6 7 and 12 13 respectively endowed with suitable conditions at the outer boundaries of the dfn are the governing equations to be solved with the proposed technique that is described in details in the next section 3 the numerical technique a conventional local fem representation is used for h and c in fracture i 15 h x k 1 n n i h k φ k x 16 c x t k 1 n n i c k t φ k x where n n i is the number of nodes for fracture i h k c k t for k 1 n n i are the nodal values and φ k x are the shape functions by considering the n t i traces of fracture i the integral forms of eq 4 10 are as follows 17 f i t i h φ k df i j 1 n t i s j q t φ k ds j and 18 f i d c φ k 1 e i q c φ k c t φ k df i j 1 n t i s j j t φ k ds j a standard discretization of a fracture entails the elements around the traces be adjusted to form a so called conforming mesh i e the nodes of the fractures pertaining to the same trace do coincide however as previously mentioned since the traces in a fracture are randomly distributed a conforming mesh may result in elongated low quality elements and the mesh generation work may result more demanding it is therefore worthwhile to resort to non conforming meshes see fig 2 in which there are no nodes on the traces or at least not necessarily thus the mesh generation is faster and the number of nodes and unknowns are reduced the fluid discharge q t and the advective dispersive flux j t along the trace j of fracture i can be written as a linear combination of n s j shape functions ψ k 19 q t x j k 1 n s j q t k ψ k x j where q t k are the nodal values and similarly for j t x j note that the shape functions ψ k on the same trace can be different for the two intersecting fractures forming the trace a fully implicit scheme is considered for the time derivative in eq 18 by discretizing in m time intervals the following approximation applies 20 c t x t m 1 c x t m 1 c x t m δ t where m 1 and m are the new and old time levels respectively in what follows c m is used as a shorthand for c x t m by considering eqs 15 16 and 20 eqs 17 18 can be re written as follows 21 a h h j 1 n t i g j q t j 22 a c b 1 δ t e c m 1 1 δ ec m j 1 n t i g j j t j where a h a c b e are matrices of coefficients resulting from the computation of the integrals in the left hand sides of eqs 17 18 and matrices g j result instead from the numerical approximation of integrals on the right hand sides of eqs 17 18 the matrix b includes the values of q deriving from the solution of eq 17 that is obviously performed first vectors q t j j t j collect the nodal values of the corresponding quantities q t x j i j t x j i the overall solution is then pursued by means of the following optimization approach considering the matching conditions 6 7 and 12 13 the following functionals defined only at traces are introduced 23 f h h q t 1 2 i 1 n f j 1 n t i h x j i h x l k 2 q t x j i q t x l k 2 24 f c m c m j t m 1 2 i 1 n f j 1 n t i c m x j i c m x l k 2 j t m x j i j t m x l k 2 where x j i in trace j of fracture i corresponds to x l k in the same trace but labelled l of the intersecting fracture k and the norms are defined as 25 h x j i h x l k 2 s j h x j i h x l k 2 ds j for the sake of clarity the functionals herein are proposed in their simplest formulation extensions to more general cases can be found in berrone et al 2016 and references therein note that the h k and c k values are functionally related to the h and c values of the nodes of the elements intersected by the trace j through the shape functions whereas q t j t are directly defined the above mentioned nodal values of h and c plus the q t and j t values constitute the main unknowns that are found by minimizing f h and f c m indeed eqs 4 6 7 are simultaneously solved by minimizing f h given by 23 and subject to constraints 21 in practice the exact fulfillment of the matching conditions 6 and 7 is replaced by the minimization of the functional f h that measures the approximation related to both head continuity and fluid volume conservation note that the errors introduced through the minimization are comparable to the discretization errors already introduced one may shortly write 26 min f h h q t subject to 21 therefore the variable q t acts in 26 as a control variable of the minimization process a similar scheme is applied at each time level m for the concentration c namely for each m it follows 27 min f c m c m j t m subject to 22 it can be shown that with these constraints the functional f h has one minimum only berrone et al 2013 the same applies to f c m at each fixed time level m berrone et al 2017 to summarize the steps of the proposed technique are reported below 1 the dfn under analysis is discretized one fracture at a time without conforming the meshes at the traces 2 the functional f h in 23 is minimized with the constraint 21 i e the numerical form of the laplace equation 4 and the discharge field is defined the optimization procedure for the minimization is based on the conjugate gradient method starting with an initial guess for the local values of q t of all the traces 3 a time marching process is performed in which at the time level m the functional f c m is minimized subjected to the constraint 22 and by considering the concentration field at the previous time level m 1 the optimization procedure is applied as in 2 4 validation examples in order to show flexibility and robustness of the proposed technique the results of three validation examples are reported the first example refers to a simple geometrical configuration on which the results obtained by the proposed optimization approach and those obtained using standard finite element on an equivalent domain are compared the second example addresses a more complex network despite being not very large it exhibits features which are challenging from the mesh generation point of view such as narrow angles between intersecting traces traces of different length scale in the same fracture small traces with respect to the fracture size and traces very close to each other this network is used to show both global and local mass conservation properties of the proposed method also introducing suitable error indicators finally the last example deals with a larger and still complex network showing that the good global mass conservation properties of the approach are not altered when used for more realistic networks and for long time scale simulations despite the increase in the number of fractures and traces thus showing the viability of the method for problems of engineering interest 4 1 simple staircase network with reference to fig 3 the first example consists of a staircase network composed by fractures of a horizontal set treads and of a vertical set risers both treads and risers are subdivided in coplanar fractures the intersections among treads and risers and among two adjacent and coplanar fractures of the same tread are horizontal and normal to the flow direction intersections do not host a fluid flow rather are loci for mass exchange between the relative fractures therefore given the geometry of the network both fluid flow and contaminant transport are not conditioned by the intersections in other words fluid flow and contaminant transport in the staircase and in a plane domain of same width and total length see fig 4 do not quantitatively differ gravitational effects being neglected and aiming at showing the accuracy of the solution obtained by the proposed approach the simulation of the staircase with the above mentioned conditions is compared to the finite element simulation of the fluid flow and contaminant transport in the equivalent plane domain the equivalent plane is such that the size of the boundary γ p is equal to the size of the boundary γ s of the staircase network fracture transmissivity t is uniform in each fracture and equal to 1 0 10 6 m2 s for all fractures only molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion are considered with d d 10 9 m2 s 1 α l 0 01 m and α t 0 02 m everywhere specific boundary conditions are imposed to obtain a stationary fluid flow whose discharge vectors are oriented as if it were a fall see fig 3 the discharge q through the equivalent plane domain is 10 6 m2 s everywhere a contaminant source of given extent is applied at time t 0 at the top boundary the concentration at the source is a step wise function with maximum value c 0 1 and minimum value equal to zero in fig 5 the c c 0 values obtained for the plane network and for the staircase network are reported at a final simulation time t f 500 δ t being δ t equal to 0 1 time units each unit being equal to 10 5 s thus t f corresponds to 580 days in fig 6 the concentration c c 0 at t f for the plane domain is shown and compared to the solution for the staircase network it is clear from the comparisons of the concentration patterns in figs 5 and 6 that in spite of the use of non conforming meshes and of the inexact imposition of matching conditions the solution provided by the optimization approach perfectly agrees with the reference solution obtained by standard fem also after a long time interval 4 2 synthetic dfn the second validation example consists of a dfn dense of the above mentioned criticalities for mesh generation the dfn has been generated only for the purpose of testing the proposed technique and does not descend from physically consistent data or conform to accepted geometrical models for dfns it consists of 134 fractures fig 7 whose mutual intersections form 604 traces fractures are rectangular and center coordinates are generated by an extraction from uniform and uncorrelated distributions uniform distributions are also used for the orientations with dip and dip direction of the fracture plane uncorrelated and sizes the ratio α l e i α t e i is set to 1 for each fracture i 1 134 α t is set to zero the network has a challenging geometry for the mesh generation process as shown in figs 8 10 in several fractures traces mutually intersect forming angles even smaller than one sexagesimal degree as shown in fig 8 where the distribution of angles formed by pairs of traces intersecting in a fracture is reported with a zoom of the plot for the lowest values of the angles also there are many traces running almost parallel and that may be even very close one respect to the other as illustrated by the distribution of fig 9 where the distribution of the minimum distance between pairs of non intersecting traces in a fracture is also reported fig 10 reports the distribution of trace length spanning over three orders of magnitude in fig 11 the distribution of the number of traces per fracture is shown and it can be seen of traces per fracture is shown and it can be seen that there are ten fractures having more than twenty traces in order to avoid elongated and bad quality elements for these simulations standard triangular finite elements are used forming in each fracture a mesh not conforming at the traces the generated mesh has about 52 10 3 degrees of freedom with reference to fig 7 a steady state flow is imposed by applying specific boundary conditions on a source fracture source and on two sink fractures sink 1 sink 2 a head drop of 50 m is set between source and sink 1 and sink 2 two simulations are performed corresponding to two different fracture transmissivity distributions in a first case the fracture transmissivity t is assumed uniform in each fracture and equal to 1 m2 s for all the fractures ct case fig 12 in a second case t still uniform in each fracture is randomly extracted from a uniform distribution rt case fig 13 the distribution of the steady state hydraulic head h is computed and shown in fig 12 a for the ct case and in fig 13 a for the rt case the distribution of t for the rt case is reported in fig 13 b a contaminant is injected in the bottom edge of source with a concentration c 0 1 starting from the initial time t 0 0 the coefficient d d is equal to 10 5 and α l α t 1 2 e simulations are then performed by considering a spatial mesh with about 400 cells per fracture and 3 10 3 time steps δ t of 10 s obtaining the distributions of c for the ct case at five selected time frames reported in fig 12 b f and for the rt case at one selected time frame reported in fig 13 c in fig 14 the mean values of c c 0 on the discharge edges of sink 1 and sink 2 are plotted against time t for both ct plot at the left and rt at the right cases it can be seen that in the rt case the sink fractures are reached consistently later than in the ct case as expected in consideration of the considerable difference in terms of transmissivities in particular sink 1 at t f final simulation time is still not reached by the contaminant in the simulation of contaminant transport ensuring conservation of contaminant mass is a relevant issue a good quality numerical solution should asymptotically satisfy mass conservation and for a fixed given mesh the error in conservation is expected to be related to the level of accuracy of the solution consequently errors in conservation may be used to measure the accuracy of the solution this is a classical strategy for example in the framework of a posteriori analysis for fem in which a classical result relies on flux conservation mismatch at element interfaces as a main term of error estimators verfürth 2013 in the context of the proposed technique at fracture intersections mass conservation is imposed through the functional 23 24 thus in practice imposed in a weak sense in order to quantify to what extent mass balance is not exactly fulfilled herein at each time step m the errors may be condensed into the following quantities e c m c m x j i c m x l k 2 1 2 c m e u m u 1 m x j i u 2 m x l k 2 1 2 q m e q q t x j i q t x l k 2 1 2 q t x j i 2 q t x l k 2 1 2 where u ℓ m d c m n ℓ as in 14 ℓ 1 2 and c m and q m are computed as c m 1 2 max m 1 m c m x j i 2 1 2 max m 1 m c m x l k 2 1 2 q m 1 2 max m 1 m u 1 m x j i 2 1 2 max m 1 m u 2 m x l k 2 1 2 the quantity e c m represents the relative error of the continuity condition for c at the trace j i in fracture i coincident with l k in k whereas e u m measures the relative error of the mass conservation e q is a measure of the flux unbalance of the darcy flow here it is constant in time in order to show that the proposed technique offers an acceptable preservation of the mass conservation in fig 15 the evolution against the time steps of e c m and e u m is reported for the ct case for three selected traces numbers 90 332 340 whose location is shown in fig 7 it can be noticed that for all time steps e c m is less than 2 and e u m is less than 0 1 quantity e q is equal to 3 9 10 4 on trace 90 1 4 10 3 on trace 340 and 1 1 10 3 on trace 332 we remark that the continuity and conservation errors e c m and e u m remain small within time steps fig 16 shows for trace number 332 the effect of mesh refinement on the quantities e c m and e u m three mesh sizes are considered a reference mesh corresponding to approximately 400 elements on each fracture a coarse mesh with approximately 100 elements per fracture a fine mesh with approximately 1600 elements per fracture quantities c m and q m previously defined are here computed on the finest mesh it can be seen that across all the considered time frames the errors are reduced the rate of error decay is in general in good agreement with theoretical convergence expectations for linear finite elements 4 3 realistic dfn the third example refers to a dfn stochastically generated from data concerning the geometrical properties of a fracture system documented in svensk 2010 the dfn is shown in fig 17 it is included in 700 m 900 m 250 m generation box along x y and z respectively and consists of 2014 fractures forming 3737 traces thus resulting in a larger network than the one in the previous example in particular the number of traces is here an order of magnitude larger fig 18 reports the distribution of geometrical features such as narrow angles between intersecting traces close traces and traces of different length scales that would make the generation of a good quality conforming mesh an extremely hard task the following boundary conditions are prescribed h 100 m on the fracture edges lying on the y z plane at x 0 m h 10 m on the fracture edges on the y z plane at x 700 m h 110 m on the top edge of an injection fracture located at x 50 m and h 0 m on the top edge of an extraction fracture located at x 650 m see fig 17 all the other fracture edges are insulated the fracture hydraulic transmissivity t ranges between about 1 0 10 5 m2 s 1 to 5 10 6 m2 s 1 the computed hydraulic head distribution is shown in fig 17 a contaminant is injected into the network through the top edge of the injection fracture on which a constant concentration of 100 is set the ade is solved with the following hydro mechanical dispersion parameters d d 10 8 m2 s 1 α l 0 01 m α t 0 m α t 0 01 s the time step δ t is equal to 10 7 s the solution at different time steps m is shown in fig 19 in terms of c c 0 for the contaminant only concentration values higher than 10 are shown thus highlighting the paths of the contaminant fig 20 shows the solution after a longer simulation time at m 1000 time steps and fig 21 reports the mean of the contaminant relative concentration on the top edge of the extraction fracture versus the time steps the concentration also for long simulation time remains bounded in the range 0 1 as expected suggesting that no spurious sink sources of contaminant are produced by the method the concentration history on the extraction fracture top edge remains zero for a short period of time then rapidly increases up to a value of approximately 0 16 and then continues to rise with a very slow slope recall that the steady state solution is given by a uniform relative concentration equal to one throughout the whole network as a comparison an additional example is proposed retaining the same geometry of this third example but with different boundary conditions for the computation of the velocity field this is termed as validation example 3bis in figure labels an hydraulic head drop h 100 m is prescribed between the top edge of the injection fracture and the top edge of the extraction fracture all other edges being insulated the other parameters are the same as in the third validation example such that the only difference between these two tests is that now the velocity field only transports the contaminant from the injection to the extraction fracture without the presence of the additional velocity field along the x axis given by the previous boundary conditions fig 22 shows the distribution of the relative concentration of the contaminant in the network after 5000 time steps and fig 23 reports the plot of the relative concentration at the top edge of the extraction fracture for the various time steps again in both figures the relative concentration is well bounded between its theoretical limits showing that no spurious sources sinks of contaminant mass are introduced by the numerical scheme also for long simulation times fractures representing dead ends are reached only by diffusive effect and many of them are still not reached by the contaminant as it is clear from fig 22 furthermore as expected higher concentration values for a given time step in the computed range are observed for this last setting with respect to the previous one this is due to the fact that now the velocity field only transports the contaminant towards the extraction fracture and it can not be transported out of the network through fracture edges on the y z plane at x 700 m from fig 22 we clearly see that the concentration eventually approximates the expected value 1 confirming that provided a reasonable coarse mesh on the fractures the weak imposition of conservation at traces does not affect the solution introducing significant sinks or sources of contaminant mass these last examples show applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in dealing with unsteady simulations even in dfns based on real data sets avoiding the requirement of over refined meshes induced by geometrical complexities 5 concluding remarks the numerical technique described herein is designed in order to perform steady state fluid flow and unsteady transport simulations on discrete fracture networks the technique is conceived in such a way that independent meshes non conforming at the traces can be adopted on each fracture thus the meshing process results in a very fast and versatile process matching conditions at interfaces are guaranteed by the minimization of suitable functionals a dispersion model is successfully introduced within the optimization framework while other phenomena like gravity are not considered in the tests and the overall procedure has been numerically tested on different problems in a simple setting neglecting gravity effects the solution is compared to the one obtained with classical finite elements showing effectiveness of the method in describing the flow in the network in two more complicated networks displaying critical geometrical features the robustness and stability of the method are highlighted in the present work the rock matrix surrounding the fractures was assumed to be impervious however considering a dfn immersed in a porous matrix the optimization approach can be extended to manage the matrix fracture coupling still not requiring any mesh conformity at the matrix fracture interfaces acknowledgments this work has

6947,it is widely recognized that the prediction of transport of contaminants in a fractured rock mass requires models that preserve several distinctive features of the inner fracture network like heterogeneity and directionality in this respect discrete fracture networks dfns play a significant role the solution of the associated equations would claim a high computational demand that could be met only by using agile and robust numerical techniques in this note a new numerical technique fully validated from a mathematical standpoint is applied to engineering problems also introducing dispersion models for the description of non stationary transport phenomena the method results in a fast and scalable resolution tool based on a pde constrained optimization approach designed to avoid mesh generation problems and allowing for transport simulations with an eulerian approach examples are reported to show the quality of the solution obtained even by using relatively coarse meshes and quite geometrically complex dfns keywords discrete fracture networks contaminant transport optimization process 1 introduction in several fields of geomechanical engineering the prediction of fluid flow and transport of contaminants in fractured rocks is a crucial issue as for example for the design of deep geological repositories of high level radioactive nuclear waste however pursuing the numerical solution of the associated equations is challenging for the complicated geometries and high computational demand berkowitz 2002 macquarrie and mayer 2005 and neuman 2005 provided a review of the available models for fractured rocks and related applicability from the many contributions in scientific literature it is apparent that heterogeneity and directionality are peculiar features of fractured rocks that should be included in any predictive model since the pioneering works of schwartz et al 1983 and smith and schwartz 1984 discrete fracture networks dfns emerged as the only models fully including these features dfns are stochastic networks generated by extracting from specific probability density functions geometrical and hydraulic properties of planar objects located in a simulation domain such objects are assimilated to the fractures of the rock mass under analysis dershowitz and einstein 1988 in a statistical sense a dfn is an adequate replica of a fracture network for the solution of the equations governing fluid flow and contaminant transport in a dfn two dimensional or three dimensional networks are used the flow regime is computed first it constitutes the basis for the solution of the contaminant mass balance equation or advection dispersion equation ade such a solution is pursued by resorting to a lagrangian approach or to an eulerian approach generally in the context of finite element fe discretizations of the simulation domain in the lagrangian approach for a purely advective transport the mass of contaminant is condensed into particles that are introduced at various locations to follow path lines at each time step the contaminant concentration derives by counting the number of particles in each sub domain in which the flow domain has been subdivided the contribution of the hydrodynamical dispersion tensor is considered by using random walks rws techniques like the rwpt random walk particle tracking technique well suited to capture motion and spreading of a contaminant in an advecting flow field even in disordered flows like the ones occurring in fractured media an overview of the available rwpt techniques in the context of fractured media is reported in noetinger et al 2016 cacas et al 1990 used a rwpt technique for the transport simulation in systems of one dimensional conductors pipes derived from three dimensional fracture networks miller 1990 implemented rwpt in the three dimensional fem code mafic for discrete fractures and porous blocks rwpt was also used by painter et al 2005 and frampton and cvetkovic 2011 roubinet et al 2010 used a rwpt approach to two dimensional systems of fractures and blocks under the assumptions of pure advection in fractures and one dimensional diffusion in matrix blocks a rwpt approach was also used by liu et al 2000 to handle advection dispersion in a dual porosity medium recently a new computational scheme to generate three dimensional networks and solve flow and transport problems from a lagrangian standpoint has been proposed by hyman et al 2015 a similar scheme has been adopted also by makedonska et al 2015 as far as the eulerian approach for two dimensional or three dimensional dfns is concerned literature is much poorer of contributions codes in which the governing equations for both steady state fluid flow and contaminant transport are solved by using a fem discretization are fractran sudicky and mclaren 1998 polymin molson et al 2007 and frac3dvs graf and therrien 2005 in the last contribution the solution is extended to the rock blocks considered as pervious it is to remark that the main difficulty in defining the fluid velocities resides in the generation of a conforming mesh of the network i e a mesh whose elements are perfectly matching at the traces obviously for dfns with a large number of fractures the number of geometrical constraints of the conforming mesh could cause the failure of the meshing process or lead to the generation of elongated elements with detrimental effects on the quality of the computed flow regime many authors are currently working on new methods in order to circumvent this drawback among the others mustapha et al 2011 mustapha 2014 ehrel et al 2009 and pichot et al 2012 suggest the use of mortar methods and or modifications of the dfn geometry in order to ease the meshing however these strategies might be insufficient when dealing with highly intricate networks as for example in stochastically generated dfns in fact in order to ensure partial conformity see later at traces and good quality of the mesh a large number of elements is likely to be required when traces intersect with very small angles when very small traces appear or when very close non intersecting traces are generated in hyman et al 2014 a new algorithm is devised that is capable of detecting and rejecting any randomly generated geometrical entity smaller than a prescribed length scale in noetinger and jarrige 2012 and noetinger 2015 the geometrical complexities are tackled by reducing the fracture dimensionality fourno et al 2016 recently proposed an alternative meshing method the fracture cut method for meshing frac in which each fracture is decomposed into a set of connected closed contours mesh generation in huang et al 2016 relies somehow on the same ideas the mesh elements are conforming at the common segments and there is no removal of traces intersection points are displaced or added to preserve the quality of the mesh ngo et al 2017 used frac to derive conforming meshes to be superposed by control cells of the finite volume method code dumux flemisch et al 2011 that is characterized by a high level euclidean based transport modeling capability other authors propose the use of unconventional discretization strategies as for example fumagalli and scotti 2014 with the extended finite element method xfem of fries and belytschko 2010 that allows a non conforming mesh at the interfaces or methods handling even badly shaped polygonal elements as the virtual element method vem of beirão da veiga et al 2013 for which polygonal conforming meshes are constructed see benedetto et al 2014 2016 2017 and references therein other methods recently developed in different contexts in order to circumvent mesh generation problems in complex geometries are cutfem burman et al 2014 fictitious domain methods immersed boundaries peskin 2002 polygonal methods such as hybrid high order chave et al 2018 gradient methods brenner et al 2016 xing et al 2017 xing et al 2017 this recent substantial literature motivates the development of alternative meshing techniques capable of handling arbitrarily complex geometries without any modification of the dfn geometry in this note an eulerian fem based technique consisting of the combination of two weak formulations one for the flux equation and one for the ade equation non conforming meshing and an optimization process is proposed with the limitation of impervious rock matrix the weak formulations are introduced to define both flux and ade equations whereas for the errors of the continuity conditions at the traces and flux balance a cost functional is introduced to be minimized for the fulfillment of these conditions through optimization the technique allows one to use meshes independently generated on each fracture and as such non matching at fracture intersections these meshes are named non conforming the optimization process has been described and fully validated in previous works see berrone et al 2013 berrone et al 2016 berrone et al 2017 and references therein and typical error estimates are available berrone et al 2016 in addition with reference to the steady state fluid flow a large number of numerical tests has been proposed showing the robustness of the method when dealing with strong geometrical complexities and also with respect to the preservation of the fluid continuity pieraccini and scialò 2016 finally the technique can be easily parallelizable therefore it is suitable for efficiently handling monster networks berrone et al 2015 herein the above mentioned optimization approach is applied in the framework of unsteady advection diffusion simulations to engineering problems characterized by complex realistic networks several dispersion models are also considered yielding full symmetric non uniform diffusivity tensors depending on the computed velocity advective field in this context mass conservation is a key issue and several numerical tests are devoted to numerically prove both local on traces and global on the network mass conservation properties for the proposed approach some indicators are proposed to easily check the quality of the numerical solution these indicators are tested with respect to a moderate mesh refinement for a relatively large time interval the proposed numerical tests also address the issue of global mass conservation when locally at the traces the flux balance is imposed in a weak sense showing the mass conservation properties of the optimization approach also for long time scale simulations in complex networks thus proving the viability of the proposed approach in what follows the governing equations are described in detail section 2 along with the weak formulations and the optimization process section 3 in section 4 the described technique is applied to validation examples based on networks of increasing complexity aiming at proving robustness and stability of the approach with respect to geometrical complexities and addressing quite general unsteady models in table 1 a glossary of terms is reported as reference for what follows 2 governing equations given a dfn with n f fractures in fracture i the darcy law applies 1 q x t i x h x where x x 1 x 2 is the coordinate system in i q x is the fluid discharge across a fracture void of unit width t i x is the isotropic transmissivity of fracture i and h x is the hydraulic head note that the density driven fluid flow is not considered the fluid velocities inside the fracture voids are assumed parallel to the mean plane therefore there are no components normal to this plane it follows 2 v x q x e i x being e i x the fracture aperture and v x the mean velocity from the volumetric balance under steady state conditions the following equation derives for fracture i 3 q x 0 by combining eqs 1 and 3 the laplace equation is obtained 4 t i x h x 0 note that the domain of definition of eqs 3 and 4 is strictly the fracture plane with the exclusion of the traces note also that the area of the traces in the fracture plane is assumed infinitesimal fractures of a dfn are usually represented as polygons whose sides are insulated and a no flow condition is applied the flow regime in each fracture is affected by the traces acting as linear sources or sinks thus possibly causing discontinuities for the discharge q of the fracture for each trace j in fracture i with j 1 n t i n t i being the number of traces in fracture i a local coordinate x j can be defined then the quantity q t x j represents the fluid discharge per unit trace

eq 2 eq 10 becomes 11 d c v c c t note again that the domain of definition of eqs 10 and 11 is the internal part of the fracture with the exclusion of the traces as for the fluid flow two constraints for eq 10 are imposed at traces 12 c x j i c x l k 13 j t x j i j t x l k 0 where j t is the advective dispersive mass flux at the trace see fig 1 14 j t x j e i x j d c n 1 x j d c n 2 x j cq t x j moreover j n ℓ x j e i x j d c n ℓ x j cq n ℓ x j for ℓ 1 2 is defined it is to remark that a complete mixing at fracture intersections is envisaged herein thus a unique concentration value is assigned to each node of the intersections even if this condition occurs in limited cases berkowitz et al 1994 it is assumed here for the sake of simplicity nonetheless the presented approach can handle more general models eqs 4 and 10 with constraints 6 7 and 12 13 respectively endowed with suitable conditions at the outer boundaries of the dfn are the governing equations to be solved with the proposed technique that is described in details in the next section 3 the numerical technique a conventional local fem representation is used for h and c in fracture i 15 h x k 1 n n i h k φ k x 16 c x t k 1 n n i c k t φ k x where n n i is the number of nodes for fracture i h k c k t for k 1 n n i are the nodal values and φ k x are the shape functions by considering the n t i traces of fracture i the integral forms of eq 4 10 are as follows 17 f i t i h φ k df i j 1 n t i s j q t φ k ds j and 18 f i d c φ k 1 e i q c φ k c t φ k df i j 1 n t i s j j t φ k ds j a standard discretization of a fracture entails the elements around the traces be adjusted to form a so called conforming mesh i e the nodes of the fractures pertaining to the same trace do coincide however as previously mentioned since the traces in a fracture are randomly distributed a conforming mesh may result in elongated low quality elements and the mesh generation work may result more demanding it is therefore worthwhile to resort to non conforming meshes see fig 2 in which there are no nodes on the traces or at least not necessarily thus the mesh generation is faster and the number of nodes and unknowns are reduced the fluid discharge q t and the advective dispersive flux j t along the trace j of fracture i can be written as a linear combination of n s j shape functions ψ k 19 q t x j k 1 n s j q t k ψ k x j where q t k are the nodal values and similarly for j t x j note that the shape functions ψ k on the same trace can be different for the two intersecting fractures forming the trace a fully implicit scheme is considered for the time derivative in eq 18 by discretizing in m time intervals the following approximation applies 20 c t x t m 1 c x t m 1 c x t m δ t where m 1 and m are the new and old time levels respectively in what follows c m is used as a shorthand for c x t m by considering eqs 15 16 and 20 eqs 17 18 can be re written as follows 21 a h h j 1 n t i g j q t j 22 a c b 1 δ t e c m 1 1 δ ec m j 1 n t i g j j t j where a h a c b e are matrices of coefficients resulting from the computation of the integrals in the left hand sides of eqs 17 18 and matrices g j result instead from the numerical approximation of integrals on the right hand sides of eqs 17 18 the matrix b includes the values of q deriving from the solution of eq 17 that is obviously performed first vectors q t j j t j collect the nodal values of the corresponding quantities q t x j i j t x j i the overall solution is then pursued by means of the following optimization approach considering the matching conditions 6 7 and 12 13 the following functionals defined only at traces are introduced 23 f h h q t 1 2 i 1 n f j 1 n t i h x j i h x l k 2 q t x j i q t x l k 2 24 f c m c m j t m 1 2 i 1 n f j 1 n t i c m x j i c m x l k 2 j t m x j i j t m x l k 2 where x j i in trace j of fracture i corresponds to x l k in the same trace but labelled l of the intersecting fracture k and the norms are defined as 25 h x j i h x l k 2 s j h x j i h x l k 2 ds j for the sake of clarity the functionals herein are proposed in their simplest formulation extensions to more general cases can be found in berrone et al 2016 and references therein note that the h k and c k values are functionally related to the h and c values of the nodes of the elements intersected by the trace j through the shape functions whereas q t j t are directly defined the above mentioned nodal values of h and c plus the q t and j t values constitute the main unknowns that are found by minimizing f h and f c m indeed eqs 4 6 7 are simultaneously solved by minimizing f h given by 23 and subject to constraints 21 in practice the exact fulfillment of the matching conditions 6 and 7 is replaced by the minimization of the functional f h that measures the approximation related to both head continuity and fluid volume conservation note that the errors introduced through the minimization are comparable to the discretization errors already introduced one may shortly write 26 min f h h q t subject to 21 therefore the variable q t acts in 26 as a control variable of the minimization process a similar scheme is applied at each time level m for the concentration c namely for each m it follows 27 min f c m c m j t m subject to 22 it can be shown that with these constraints the functional f h has one minimum only berrone et al 2013 the same applies to f c m at each fixed time level m berrone et al 2017 to summarize the steps of the proposed technique are reported below 1 the dfn under analysis is discretized one fracture at a time without conforming the meshes at the traces 2 the functional f h in 23 is minimized with the constraint 21 i e the numerical form of the laplace equation 4 and the discharge field is defined the optimization procedure for the minimization is based on the conjugate gradient method starting with an initial guess for the local values of q t of all the traces 3 a time marching process is performed in which at the time level m the functional f c m is minimized subjected to the constraint 22 and by considering the concentration field at the previous time level m 1 the optimization procedure is applied as in 2 4 validation examples in order to show flexibility and robustness of the proposed technique the results of three validation examples are reported the first example refers to a simple geometrical configuration on which the results obtained by the proposed optimization approach and those obtained using standard finite element on an equivalent domain are compared the second example addresses a more complex network despite being not very large it exhibits features which are challenging from the mesh generation point of view such as narrow angles between intersecting traces traces of different length scale in the same fracture small traces with respect to the fracture size and traces very close to each other this network is used to show both global and local mass conservation properties of the proposed method also introducing suitable error indicators finally the last example deals with a larger and still complex network showing that the good global mass conservation properties of the approach are not altered when used for more realistic networks and for long time scale simulations despite the increase in the number of fractures and traces thus showing the viability of the method for problems of engineering interest 4 1 simple staircase network with reference to fig 3 the first example consists of a staircase network composed by fractures of a horizontal set treads and of a vertical set risers both treads and risers are subdivided in coplanar fractures the intersections among treads and risers and among two adjacent and coplanar fractures of the same tread are horizontal and normal to the flow direction intersections do not host a fluid flow rather are loci for mass exchange between the relative fractures therefore given the geometry of the network both fluid flow and contaminant transport are not conditioned by the intersections in other words fluid flow and contaminant transport in the staircase and in a plane domain of same width and total length see fig 4 do not quantitatively differ gravitational effects being neglected and aiming at showing the accuracy of the solution obtained by the proposed approach the simulation of the staircase with the above mentioned conditions is compared to the finite element simulation of the fluid flow and contaminant transport in the equivalent plane domain the equivalent plane is such that the size of the boundary γ p is equal to the size of the boundary γ s of the staircase network fracture transmissivity t is uniform in each fracture and equal to 1 0 10 6 m2 s for all fractures only molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion are considered with d d 10 9 m2 s 1 α l 0 01 m and α t 0 02 m everywhere specific boundary conditions are imposed to obtain a stationary fluid flow whose discharge vectors are oriented as if it were a fall see fig 3 the discharge q through the equivalent plane domain is 10 6 m2 s everywhere a contaminant source of given extent is applied at time t 0 at the top boundary the concentration at the source is a step wise function with maximum value c 0 1 and minimum value equal to zero in fig 5 the c c 0 values obtained for the plane network and for the staircase network are reported at a final simulation time t f 500 δ t being δ t equal to 0 1 time units each unit being equal to 10 5 s thus t f corresponds to 580 days in fig 6 the concentration c c 0 at t f for the plane domain is shown and compared to the solution for the staircase network it is clear from the comparisons of the concentration patterns in figs 5 and 6 that in spite of the use of non conforming meshes and of the inexact imposition of matching conditions the solution provided by the optimization approach perfectly agrees with the reference solution obtained by standard fem also after a long time interval 4 2 synthetic dfn the second validation example consists of a dfn dense of the above mentioned criticalities for mesh generation the dfn has been generated only for the purpose of testing the proposed technique and does not descend from physically consistent data or conform to accepted geometrical models for dfns it consists of 134 fractures fig 7 whose mutual intersections form 604 traces fractures are rectangular and center coordinates are generated by an extraction from uniform and uncorrelated distributions uniform distributions are also used for the orientations with dip and dip direction of the fracture plane uncorrelated and sizes the ratio α l e i α t e i is set to 1 for each fracture i 1 134 α t is set to zero the network has a challenging geometry for the mesh generation process as shown in figs 8 10 in several fractures traces mutually intersect forming angles even smaller than one sexagesimal degree as shown in fig 8 where the distribution of angles formed by pairs of traces intersecting in a fracture is reported with a zoom of the plot for the lowest values of the angles also there are many traces running almost parallel and that may be even very close one respect to the other as illustrated by the distribution of fig 9 where the distribution of the minimum distance between pairs of non intersecting traces in a fracture is also reported fig 10 reports the distribution of trace length spanning over three orders of magnitude in fig 11 the distribution of the number of traces per fracture is shown and it can be seen of traces per fracture is shown and it can be seen that there are ten fractures having more than twenty traces in order to avoid elongated and bad quality elements for these simulations standard triangular finite elements are used forming in each fracture a mesh not conforming at the traces the generated mesh has about 52 10 3 degrees of freedom with reference to fig 7 a steady state flow is imposed by applying specific boundary conditions on a source fracture source and on two sink fractures sink 1 sink 2 a head drop of 50 m is set between source and sink 1 and sink 2 two simulations are performed corresponding to two different fracture transmissivity distributions in a first case the fracture transmissivity t is assumed uniform in each fracture and equal to 1 m2 s for all the fractures ct case fig 12 in a second case t still uniform in each fracture is randomly extracted from a uniform distribution rt case fig 13 the distribution of the steady state hydraulic head h is computed and shown in fig 12 a for the ct case and in fig 13 a for the rt case the distribution of t for the rt case is reported in fig 13 b a contaminant is injected in the bottom edge of source with a concentration c 0 1 starting from the initial time t 0 0 the coefficient d d is equal to 10 5 and α l α t 1 2 e simulations are then performed by considering a spatial mesh with about 400 cells per fracture and 3 10 3 time steps δ t of 10 s obtaining the distributions of c for the ct case at five selected time frames reported in fig 12 b f and for the rt case at one selected time frame reported in fig 13 c in fig 14 the mean values of c c 0 on the discharge edges of sink 1 and sink 2 are plotted against time t for both ct plot at the left and rt at the right cases it can be seen that in the rt case the sink fractures are reached consistently later than in the ct case as expected in consideration of the considerable difference in terms of transmissivities in particular sink 1 at t f final simulation time is still not reached by the contaminant in the simulation of contaminant transport ensuring conservation of contaminant mass is a relevant issue a good quality numerical solution should asymptotically satisfy mass conservation and for a fixed given mesh the error in conservation is expected to be related to the level of accuracy of the solution consequently errors in conservation may be used to measure the accuracy of the solution this is a classical strategy for example in the framework of a posteriori analysis for fem in which a classical result relies on flux conservation mismatch at element interfaces as a main term of error estimators verfürth 2013 in the context of the proposed technique at fracture intersections mass conservation is imposed through the functional 23 24 thus in practice imposed in a weak sense in order to quantify to what extent mass balance is not exactly fulfilled herein at each time step m the errors may be condensed into the following quantities e c m c m x j i c m x l k 2 1 2 c m e u m u 1 m x j i u 2 m x l k 2 1 2 q m e q q t x j i q t x l k 2 1 2 q t x j i 2 q t x l k 2 1 2 where u ℓ m d c m n ℓ as in 14 ℓ 1 2 and c m and q m are computed as c m 1 2 max m 1 m c m x j i 2 1 2 max m 1 m c m x l k 2 1 2 q m 1 2 max m 1 m u 1 m x j i 2 1 2 max m 1 m u 2 m x l k 2 1 2 the quantity e c m represents the relative error of the continuity condition for c at the trace j i in fracture i coincident with l k in k whereas e u m measures the relative error of the mass conservation e q is a measure of the flux unbalance of the darcy flow here it is constant in time in order to show that the proposed technique offers an acceptable preservation of the mass conservation in fig 15 the evolution against the time steps of e c m and e u m is reported for the ct case for three selected traces numbers 90 332 340 whose location is shown in fig 7 it can be noticed that for all time steps e c m is less than 2 and e u m is less than 0 1 quantity e q is equal to 3 9 10 4 on trace 90 1 4 10 3 on trace 340 and 1 1 10 3 on trace 332 we remark that the continuity and conservation errors e c m and e u m remain small within time steps fig 16 shows for trace number 332 the effect of mesh refinement on the quantities e c m and e u m three mesh sizes are considered a reference mesh corresponding to approximately 400 elements on each fracture a coarse mesh with approximately 100 elements per fracture a fine mesh with approximately 1600 elements per fracture quantities c m and q m previously defined are here computed on the finest mesh it can be seen that across all the considered time frames the errors are reduced the rate of error decay is in general in good agreement with theoretical convergence expectations for linear finite elements 4 3 realistic dfn the third example refers to a dfn stochastically generated from data concerning the geometrical properties of a fracture system documented in svensk 2010 the dfn is shown in fig 17 it is included in 700 m 900 m 250 m generation box along x y and z respectively and consists of 2014 fractures forming 3737 traces thus resulting in a larger network than the one in the previous example in particular the number of traces is here an order of magnitude larger fig 18 reports the distribution of geometrical features such as narrow angles between intersecting traces close traces and traces of different length scales that would make the generation of a good quality conforming mesh an extremely hard task the following boundary conditions are prescribed h 100 m on the fracture edges lying on the y z plane at x 0 m h 10 m on the fracture edges on the y z plane at x 700 m h 110 m on the top edge of an injection fracture located at x 50 m and h 0 m on the top edge of an extraction fracture located at x 650 m see fig 17 all the other fracture edges are insulated the fracture hydraulic transmissivity t ranges between about 1 0 10 5 m2 s 1 to 5 10 6 m2 s 1 the computed hydraulic head distribution is shown in fig 17 a contaminant is injected into the network through the top edge of the injection fracture on which a constant concentration of 100 is set the ade is solved with the following hydro mechanical dispersion parameters d d 10 8 m2 s 1 α l 0 01 m α t 0 m α t 0 01 s the time step δ t is equal to 10 7 s the solution at different time steps m is shown in fig 19 in terms of c c 0 for the contaminant only concentration values higher than 10 are shown thus highlighting the paths of the contaminant fig 20 shows the solution after a longer simulation time at m 1000 time steps and fig 21 reports the mean of the contaminant relative concentration on the top edge of the extraction fracture versus the time steps the concentration also for long simulation time remains bounded in the range 0 1 as expected suggesting that no spurious sink sources of contaminant are produced by the method the concentration history on the extraction fracture top edge remains zero for a short period of time then rapidly increases up to a value of approximately 0 16 and then continues to rise with a very slow slope recall that the steady state solution is given by a uniform relative concentration equal to one throughout the whole network as a comparison an additional example is proposed retaining the same geometry of this third example but with different boundary conditions for the computation of the velocity field this is termed as validation example 3bis in figure labels an hydraulic head drop h 100 m is prescribed between the top edge of the injection fracture and the top edge of the extraction fracture all other edges being insulated the other parameters are the same as in the third validation example such that the only difference between these two tests is that now the velocity field only transports the contaminant from the injection to the extraction fracture without the presence of the additional velocity field along the x axis given by the previous boundary conditions fig 22 shows the distribution of the relative concentration of the contaminant in the network after 5000 time steps and fig 23 reports the plot of the relative concentration at the top edge of the extraction fracture for the various time steps again in both figures the relative concentration is well bounded between its theoretical limits showing that no spurious sources sinks of contaminant mass are introduced by the numerical scheme also for long simulation times fractures representing dead ends are reached only by diffusive effect and many of them are still not reached by the contaminant as it is clear from fig 22 furthermore as expected higher concentration values for a given time step in the computed range are observed for this last setting with respect to the previous one this is due to the fact that now the velocity field only transports the contaminant towards the extraction fracture and it can not be transported out of the network through fracture edges on the y z plane at x 700 m from fig 22 we clearly see that the concentration eventually approximates the expected value 1 confirming that provided a reasonable coarse mesh on the fractures the weak imposition of conservation at traces does not affect the solution introducing significant sinks or sources of contaminant mass these last examples show applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in dealing with unsteady simulations even in dfns based on real data sets avoiding the requirement of over refined meshes induced by geometrical complexities 5 concluding remarks the numerical technique described herein is designed in order to perform steady state fluid flow and unsteady transport simulations on discrete fracture networks the technique is conceived in such a way that independent meshes non conforming at the traces can be adopted on each fracture thus the meshing process results in a very fast and versatile process matching conditions at interfaces are guaranteed by the minimization of suitable functionals a dispersion model is successfully introduced within the optimization framework while other phenomena like gravity are not considered in the tests and the overall procedure has been numerically tested on different problems in a simple setting neglecting gravity effects the solution is compared to the one obtained with classical finite elements showing effectiveness of the method in describing the flow in the network in two more complicated networks displaying critical geometrical features the robustness and stability of the method are highlighted in the present work the rock matrix surrounding the fractures was assumed to be impervious however considering a dfn immersed in a porous matrix the optimization approach can be extended to manage the matrix fracture coupling still not requiring any mesh conformity at the matrix fracture interfaces acknowledgments this work has

6948,the coastal chaouia located on the moroccan atlantic coast comports three aquifers a first plio quaternary constitutes the cover a second cretaceous located at sw in the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka and a third primary located at se in the zone of tnine chtouka casablanca these reservoirs constitute the only exploitable water resource for the social and economic development of the region between azemmour and casablanca these aquifers are unconfined pellicular and discontinuous they feed by infiltration of rainwater and discharge at sea agricultural irrigation is carried out exclusively from the groundwater which causes a drop of the piezometric surface and the intrusion of saltwater into the aquifer at the coast the consequence is the abandonment of some wells contaminated by seawater leading to conflict situations and significant economic losses therefore delineation of the freshwater saltwater interface is very important in order to build a sustainable groundwater management system and to implement appropriate regulatory policies the purpose of this study is to determine the extent and the geometric characteristics of the saltwater contamination extent in the coastal aquifers of the coastal chaouia to achieve this 399 vertical electric soundings and 48 electrical resistivity tomography profiles were performed perpendicular to the ocean furthermore the electrical conductivity and the piezometry were measured in 344 wells distributed over the study area the study demonstrated the effectiveness of electrical methods for mapping seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers in fact the results of the interpretation of the ves and erts after calibration with the lithological data of the boreholes as well as the values of the electrical conductivity have shown that the length of the saltwater wedge penetration inland depends on the lithological nature of the aquifer formations thus in the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka characterized by the presence of cretaceous terrains the extension of the saltwater wedge exceeds 2 km towards the continent and its depth reaches 45 m on the other hand in the zone of tnine chtouka casablanca characterized by the rise of the schists surmounted by the altered schists the seawater intrusion remains limited at 700 m from the coast and at 20 m of depth keywords coastal aquifers

the demand on freshwater of the aquifers and exposes them to contamination by saltwater sherif et al 2011 the extent of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers is influenced by several factors such as the nature of geological formations the hydraulic gradient the rate of withdrawal of groundwater and its recharge freeze and cherry 1979 in fact the overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation and

javadi 2016 aslam et al 2018 moreover global warming decreases atmospheric pressure leading to the rising of the sea level and also contributes to marine intrusion chen et al 2016 colombani and

environmental economic social and cultural importance these aquifers are under intense pressure to meet the ever increasing needs as well for drinking and industrial water supply as for the irrigation leading to deterioration of the quality of groundwater affected by the marine intrusion the coastal chaouia is an example of this the unplanned exploitation of their groundwater causes decreases in piezometric levels and consequently the intrusion of saltwater into the aquifers the origins of the strong mineralization of the groundwater have been studied by some researchers amraoui 1988 younsi 2001 marjoua et al 1997 fakir et al 2001 moustadraf 2006 najib et al 2016 the present study has for objective to locate the penetration of the saltwater wedge into the aquifer of coastal chaouia from the coastal strip to the inland by the joint use of the electrical resistivity tomography ert vertical electric soundings ves and hydrochemical and hydrogeological measurements 2 study area the coastal chaouia is situated along the moroccan atlantic coast it extends between the cities of azemmour and casablanca with a surface of 1200 km2 this hydrogeological unit is limited in the southwest by oum rbiaa river in the northwest by the atlantic ocean in the northeast by the quartzite of elhank and in the southeast by the plain of berrechid this area represents a set of nether plateaus faintly inclined towards the coastline and dune cordons mark the border of the ocean the climate of the region is arid to semi arid this character is attenuated by the proximity of the ocean the annual average temperature and precipitation are 17 c and 350 mm respectively this plain is not crossed by any perennial stream and the contribution of the houara and merzeg rivers which furrows it across its width is only apparent in flood period the main economic activity of this agricultural vocation region is market gardening with irrigation due to the shallow groundwater 2 1 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area fig 2a is formed by secondary and tertiary deposits rely on primary terrains heavily folded by the hercynian orogeny bentayeb 1972 the paleozoic is constituted by schists and altered schists and by quartzites the cenomanian outcrops at the south western extremity in the lower valley of oum rbiaa in the form of marly limestones terrains which continue northwards and under plio quaternary covering the quaternary formed by a pellicular covering of conglomerate silts and clayey sands the groundwater of the coastal chaouia is unconfined circulating according to the places in the primary schists in the cretaceous or in the plio quaternary the thickness of this alteration is 40 50 m amraoui 1988 fractured quartzites can also be conductive water as evidenced by the numerous sources emerges from this formation the cretaceous terrains are constituted by a marly limestones series and outcrop at the edge of the oum rbiaa river with an average thickness of 60 m the marly passages of the cretaceous sometimes play the role of the substratum of overlying water circulations in the plio quaternary this latter constitutes by sandy limestones more or less lumachellic of 4 20 m thickness and by consolidated dunes of 10 m thickness along the coastal strip drpe 1994 3 materials and methods 3 1 piezometry and water sampling a piezometric survey of

electric soundings were carried out in 2015 between azemmour and casablanca fig 1 distributed on 20 profiles perpendicular to the atlantic ocean the schlumberger device a mn b was used in all ves with a maximum spacing between the current electrodes ab of 1 5 m and successively increased to 1000 m the data acquisition was realized with a geotrade resistivity meter with signal summations and polarity reversal and automatic ps elimination with two 400w converters the locations of the ves centres were determined by two magellan explorist 610 and xl portable gps units the geoelectric field data were processed and interpreted after inversion by the processing software of jean louis astier of geostudi jla plus the interpretation of the results was effectuated in two ways qualitatively and quantitatively the qualitative approach is based on the production of iso resistivity maps for ab 100 m and ab 300 m the quantitative approach was used to determine the geoelectric parameters thickness and resistivity that characterize each layer based on the correlation with the lithological and hydrogeological data of the boreholes available in the study area the results of this interpretation contributed to the construction of the ves models the geo electric sections and the apparent resistivity maps 3 3 electrical resistivity tomography ert in the present study 48 ert profiles were executed perpendicular to the coastline during the summer of 2015 to clarify and map the limit of saltwater intrusion between the geo electric sections obtained by the ves fig 1 whose six are presented in this article te2 te3 te6 te13 te19 and te20 72 stainless steel electrodes spaced 10 m apart were used covering a total length of 710 m for each ert profile in five cases the ert profiles were covered by 720 m in four roll along schemes in order to obtain a total length of 1430 m te11 te12 te22 and te36 the electrical resistivity measurements were carried out using a resistivity meter located at the centre of the very powerful ares ii electrode array 850 w 5a 2000 vpp with two 48 channel switches for connections these measurements were calibrated with boreholes in the vicinity of the profiles the wenner schlumberger array configuration has been used to accurately detect horizontal and vertical structures loke et al 2010 and it s well suited for the marine intrusion the apparent resistivity data obtained have been analyzed and converted into real resistivity values by the res 2dinv software developed by geotomo software using the method of inversion of the constrained iterative least squares loke and barker 1996 to produce a model of resistivity section 2d in order to compare the extent of the marine intrusion into the study area the colour scale of the resistivity values was chosen to be constant for all the erts therefore the colours from blue to dark blue were attributed to low resistivity values indicating saline water mean squared errors rms between observed and calculated resistivity values ranged from 3 6 to 5 8 on all ert lines indicating the good quality of the measured data the resistivity values obtained by the erts were correlated with the values obtained by the archie 1942 equation using the electrical conductivity and the effective porosity of the aquifer formations this parameter has a very important effect on the resistivity niwas et al 2011 tizro et al 2012 because the rocks of a high porosity show a low resistivity in the presence of seawater 2 archie equation ρ α ρ ω ϕ m s n ρ is the resistivity of the

factor which depends on the shape of the pores and the rock compaction and ranges between 1 3 and 2 2 s is the saturation dimensionless n is the saturation exponent and its value is about 2 for most of the normal porosity formations whose water content is between 20 and 100 m and n are empirical parameters and must be adjusted according to the lithological nature of the aquifer formations olsen et al 2008 wang et al 2014 4 results 4 1 piezometry and electrical conductivity the piezometric measurements carried out in december 2013 from 344 points allows drawing up the kriged piezometric map of the groundwater of coastal chaouia fig 2 b whose isopiestic line is comprised between 5 and 160 m the examination of this piezometric map shows that the flow direction is generally from the southeast to the northwest except in the southwest of tnine chtouka where a watershed divides the waters go towards the sea from those flowing to the oum rbia river and showing a natural drainage through the river in the northeast the isopiestic lines are flat and tight with an almost constant spacing the piezometric measurements show that the shallow depths of the groundwater generally less than 10 m are observed in the coastal areas these measurements also showed depressed areas in the southwest which correspond to pumping areas for agricultural greenhouse irrigation the existence of the 0 m isopiestic line inland shows the advancement of the saltwater wedge due to intensified exploitation in the south western part the electrical conductivity measured in december 2013 in 344 wells across the entire groundwater is shown in fig 3 values range from 0 2 to 11 ms cm the highest conductivities are recorded in the coastal zone by going inland the conductivities become lower in the south western part of the azemmour tnine chtouka zone where the groundwater flows in the marly limestones of cenomanian the conductivity values are very low less than 2 ms cm indicating good quality of water 4 2 evolution of the salinity in comparison with the depth in order to follow the spatial evolution of the salinity of the chaouia coastal aquifers a sampling campaign is carried out to measure the water quality in six selected groundwater samples these samples are aligned perpendicularly to the atlantic ocean fig 3 table 1 below summarizes the characteristics of these samples the evolution of the salinity in comparison with the depth at the groundwater samples remains stable by increasing the depth however salinity decreases as it moves away from the ocean this indicates that these piezometers capture only one layer of the aquifers with a low salt content the graphical representation of the salinity conductivity and dissolved matter in comparison with the depth of each groundwater sample is illustrated in fig 3 4 3 vertical electric soundings the vertical electric soundings are performed to illustrate the phenomenon of marine intrusion and to locate the limit of the saltwater contamination in the coastal chaouia aquifers the main results of the ves interpretation are described in the following 4 3 1 vertical electric soundings diagrams the interpretation of the electric soundings was calibrated with the boreholes 4103 19 and 1349 19 whose the lithology is shown in table 2 the 5ch6 electric sounding is located at 800 m from the coast in the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka the 5ch6 vertical electric sounding shows a resistant set of r0 formed with three layers and a total thickness of 22 m corresponding to the sandstones and clayey sands of the plio quaternary under this set of a conductor level c with 50 ω m and 20 m of thickness corresponds to the marly limestones of the cenomanian this level surmounts an intermediate layer with a thickness of about 60 m and 23 ω m resistivities corresponding to marly limestones and grey marls finally there is the resistant substratum rs which corresponds to the schists the decrease in the resistivity of the covering levels a and c of the resistant assembly rs is attributed to the effect of the seawater intrusion the vertical electric sounding 4ch16 is situated at 750 m from the coast in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone the 4ch16 vertical electric sounding reveals four electrical levels a less conductor level c0 with 103 ω m of resistivity and overcome a resistant assembly r0 which has a high resistivity up to 286 ω m and corresponds to the sandstones with cement limestones below a conductor cs of 48 ω m and 16 m of thickness corresponds to the altered schists the set of c0 r0 cs rests on the resistant substratum rs of schists the decrease in the resistivity of the cs level is explained by the effect of the marine intrusion 4 3 2 apparent resistivity maps the apparent resistivity maps were established from the values of the apparent resistivity of the vertical electric soundings these maps were compiled for ab 100 m and ab 300 m the apparent resistivity map in line length ab 100 m fig 4 a shows resistivities varying between 4 and 400 ω m the low resistivity values between 4 and 50 ω m appear at the atlantic ocean shoreline in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone corresponding to the conductive formations saturated with saltwater the high resistivity values are located in the zone of tnine chtouka casablanca and in the south of the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka corresponding in the first zone to the consolidated dry sand and calcareous sandstones and in the second zone to the rise of the schists the apparent resistivity map in line length ab 300 m fig 4b shows that the low resistivity values between 6 and 500 ω m are located along the atlantic coast and correspond to the conductive formations influenced by the marine intrusion strong resistivity values dominate the southern and eastern extremes of the study area these values correspond to grey marls in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone and to compact schists in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone 5 geoelectric sections 20 geoelectric sections were established from the interpretation of the 399 vertical electric soundings fig 1 in order to show the distribution of the resistivity and the limit of the advancement of the saltwater wedge in the coastal chaouia aquifers the ch6 geoelectric section oriented nnw sse perpendicular to the coast is characteristic of the sections belonging to the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka it shows the presence of three zones an area between the shoreline and the edge of the saltwater wedge characterized by a slice of terrain in particular the levels a and c completely invaded by seawater where its roof deepens as one moves away from the shore until reaching the roof of the resistant assembly rs schists between the electric soundings 7ch6 and 8ch6 the decrease in resistivity observed in this zone is attributed to the high salinity of the groundwater a mixing zone of saltwater and freshwater located between the 6ch6 and 7ch6 electrical soundings and characterized by a slight rise in resistivity a zone in the sse characterized by relatively high resistivities to those observed previously the level is electrically only the intermediate bd which corresponds to marly limestones the ch16 geoelectric section with nnw sse direction and perpendicular to the ocean is characteristic of the sections belonging to the chtouka casablanca zone this section shows that the limit of the saltwater wedge is situated between the electric soundings 3ch16 and 4ch16 and coincides with an accentuated ascent of the roof of the resistant assembly rs the slice of terrain invaded by seawater is essentially the altered schists represented by the levels r0 and cs the resistivity variation of the altered schists is related to the degree of alteration where the conductor level cs corresponds to high alteration schists and the intermediate level r0 represents the schists with moderate alteration the results derived from the interpretation of the ves show that in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone the geo electric stratigraphy consists mainly of four units the upper unit represents the plio quaternary deposits of sandstones and clayey sands and characterized by resistivity values ranging between 50 and 370 ω m the second and the third units represent the saturated zone of the cretaceous aquifer with a depth of 45 m this zone includes seawater with a resistivity not exceeding 23 ω m the deepest unit is characterized by high resistivity values of more than 1047 ω m corresponding to the schistous substratum however the tnine chtouka casablanca zone consists of three geoelectric units the first is characterized by resistivities varying between 34 and 286 ω m corresponding to the sandstone with calcareous cement of the plio quaternary the underlying unit constitutes the aquifer of altered schists saturated with seawater characterized by a resistivity which varies between 13 and 48 ω m and a depth which does not exceed 20 m the third unit with a high resistivity up to 700 ω m represents the schistous substratum the extent of the saltwater contamination in the area of azemmour tnine chtouka reaches 2 km inland with a depth of 45 m nevertheless in the zone of tnine chtouka casablanca the extension of the marine intrusion does not exceed 700 m towards the continent with 20 m of depth 5 1 electrical resistivity tomography the electrical resistivity tomography is a useful method for delineating the saltwater intrusion in coastal areas because of its ability to distinguish the high resistivity contrast between saturated layers of saltwater and freshwater the ert profiles have been calibrated with hydrogeological boreholes data taking into account the electrical conductivity measured in wells near the profiles a discussion of these profiles follows the te2 profile fig 6 a is oriented nw se perpendicularly and at 400 m from the ocean the total length of the profile is 950 m with two rolls along and a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m it shows the existence of three types of resistivities a highly resistive surface formation with resistivities ranging from 300 to 800 ω m a conductive formation with 40 m of thickness and low resistivity varying from 1 to 7 ω m and a basically formation characterized by a resistivity which ranges from 70 to 300 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te2 profile is 10 4 ms cm in a water depth of 22 m which coincides perfectly with the conductor s roof observed on the profile the calibration of the latter with the 4102 19 borehole allows attributing the resistive formation to the sand and sandstones of the plio quaternary and the conductive formation to the cretaceous marly limestones invaded by seawater resting on the schistous substratum the application of the archie formula with the porosity data of the aquifer formation 2 12 drpe 1996 and the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the profile gives resistivities varying between 3 and 65 ω m which confirms the resistivities found on the te2 profile the te3 profile fig 6b is constructed from an nw se direction perpendicularly and at 600 m from the ocean its total length is 710 m with a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m it shows three types of resistivities a surface formation with a resistivity about 40 200 ω m a conductive formation with a resistivity which varies from 3 to 40 ω m this layer is based on a resistive formation of 70 300 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te3 profile is 11 ms cm the calibration with the 1388 19 borehole allows attributing the resistive formation to the alluvium and sands of the plio quaternary and the conductive formation to the marly limestones of cretaceous invaded by seawater surmounting the schists of the primary the application of the archie formula with the porosity data of the aquifer formation 2 12 and the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the profile gives resistivities varying between 3 and 61 ω m which confirms the resistivities found on the te3 profile the te6 profile fig 6c is executed at 500 m perpendicular to the ocean it follows an nw se direction of a total length of 950 m with two rolls along and a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m this profile shows the existence of three types of resistivity a resistive surface formation with resistivities ranging between 80 and 800 ω m a conductor with low resistivities of 1 10 ω m is observed from 7 m of depth and a substratum of 100 300 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te6 profile is 9 7 ms cm in a water depth of 6 m the depth of the groundwater measured in this well corresponds perfectly to the conductor roof observed on the profile the calibration of the latter with the 1358 19 borehole allows attributing the resistant to the sandstones and sandy clay of the plio quaternary and the conductor to the marly limestones aquifer loaded with saltwater resting on the schistous substratum the application of the archie formula with the porosity of the aquifer formation and the electrical conductivity measured in the well gives resistivities ranging between 4 and 69 ω m confirming the resistivities found on the te6 profile the te13 profile fig 7 a is oriented nnw sse perpendicularly and at 320 m from the ocean its total length is 710 m with a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m it shows two types of resistivity a conductive surface formation with a resistivity not exceeding 20 ω m and a substratum with resistivities varying from 80 to 200 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te13 profile is 10 5 ms cm in a water depth of 12 m the calibration with the 1206 19 borehole allows attributing the conductor to the aquifer of altered schists loaded with saltwater resting on the schists the application of the archie formula with the porosity of the aquifer formation 2 6 drpe 1996 and the electrical conductivity measured in the well gives resistivities varying between 11 and 64 ω m confirms the resistivities found on the te13 profile the te17 profile fig 7b is realized perpendicular to the ocean its total length is 830 m with a roll along and at 180 m from the sea it extends in the nnw sse direction with a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m the results of the inversion show two types of resistivities a conductive part with low resistivity ranging from 4 to 40 ω m and a resistive part with a resistivity which varies from 100 to 800 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te19 profile is 9 4 ms cm in a water depth of 10 m the calibration with the 4057 19 borehole allows attributing the resistant to the schists and the conductor to the altered schists invaded by the seawater the resistivities obtained by the application of the archie formula with the porosity data of the aquifer formation and the electrical conductivity of the well vary between 12 and 61 ω m confirming the results obtained by the electric resistivity tomography the te20 profile fig 7c is executed perpendicularly and at 200 m from the ocean it takes the nno sse direction with a total length of 830 m a roll along and a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m this profile shows a resistivity varying from 100 to 800 ω m and a conductor with a resistivity which ranges from 4 to 40 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te20 profile is 11 ms cm in a water depth of 10 m the calibration with 1349 19 borehole allows attributing the resistant to the schists and the conductor to the altered schists and sandstones invaded by the seawater the resistivities obtained from the archie formula vary between 10 and 61 ω m confirming the resistivities found on the te20 profile the results obtained from the 48 erts profiles after calibration with the hydrogeological boreholes and the conductivities measured near the profiles show that the salinity of the coastal chaouia aquifers is related to the lithological nature of the aquifers formations and their hydrodynamic parameters the penetration of the marine intrusion into the cretaceous aquifer in the south western zone of azemmour tnine chtouka reaches 2000 m in relation to the shore due to the shallow depth and the high porosity on the other hand in the northeast zone of tnine chtouka casablanca characterized by aquifer of altered schists the attenuation of the marine intrusion remains limited to 700 m from the ocean due to the low porosity and permeability of the schists preventing the aquifer from being invaded by seawater the results of the ves ert and piezometry corroborate the distribution of the conductivity obtained from the hydrochemical study indeed the high values of the conductivity ec have been measured in the coastal band where the piezometric level is negative fig 2b similarly the resistivity values of the saline zones of the aquifer ranged from 1 to 10 ω m in the southwest and from 4 to 40 ω m in the northeast due to the lithological nature of the aquifers and the degree of salinization indeed the aquifer most affected by the marine intrusion is that of marly limestone according to the shallow depth and the high permeability facilitating the return of saline waters 6 discussion the electrical resistivity of a geological formation is a physical characteristic determines the flow of electric current in the formation this resistivity varies with the texture of the rock the nature of the mineralization and the electrical conductivity contained in the rock parkhomenko 1967 niwas and celik 2012 kazakis et al 2016a b the effect of marine intrusion is shown by the low resistivity high conductivity ec and the advance of salt wedge inland in order to obtain reliable results it is very important to combine geophysical prospecting methods with hydrogeological data lithological profiles hydraulic and hydrochemical data because each method provides significant information that complements and supports others the correlation of the ves allowed realizing geo electric sections showing the vertical configuration of the saltwater wedge in fact the low resistivity values observed on these sections are interpreted as layers containing saltwater and the high resistivity values indicate zones containing freshwater on the ch6 section fig 5 characteristic of the azemmour tnine chtouka zone the ves have retained low resistivity values up to ves 7ch6 from the coast to ves 7ch7 the entire conductive layer has been invaded by seawater however on section ch16 fig 5 characteristic of the tnine chtouka casablanca zone the low resistivity values were observed from the coast up to ves 4ch16 indicating the limit of the marine intrusion in this ves above 4ch16 the resistivities have increased to complete the results obtained by the ves and readjust the marine intrusion limit between the sections the erts were plotted between all the sections fig 1 the interpretation of the erts after calibration with the hydrogeological drilling lithology and the conductivity ec measured in the wells near the profiles has allowed determining the geometry of the extension of the marine intrusion the correlation between the ert profiles shows that the low resistivity layers generally between 1 and 10 ω m in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone and between 4 and 20 ω m in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone are attributed to saturated formations of seawater this difference in the distribution of the resistivity is related to the lithological nature of the aquifer formations and the hydrodynamic parameters indeed the azemmour tnine chtouka zone is characterized by the cretaceous aquifer marly limestone with high permeability and porosity the interface between fresh and salt water is 2 km from the coast on the other hand in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone characterized by altered schists with low permeability and porosity the marine intrusion remains limited to 700 m from the ocean in addition the electrical conductivities ec of water vary between 0 2 and 11 ms cm the highest values are located along the coastal strip and decrease significantly away from the ocean the origin of the salinity of the coastal chaouia aquifers has been addressed by several previous studies amraoui 1988 explains it by the geological nature of the terrain which strongly influences the chemical composition of the water younsi 2001 attributes it to the effect of marine intrusion however marjoua et al 1997 who used a chemical cl br and isotopic 11o 2h 14c approaches excluded the effects of seawater intrusion and evaporation in the groundwater contamination they claim that the high salinity of the groundwater is mainly due to chlorides which the origins are the leaching of existing salts in the soil and the intensive use of fertilizers fakir et al 2001 who also used an isotopic approach 18o and moustadraf 2006 concluded that intensive and uncontrolled water withdrawals combined with drought have caused a significant degradation of groundwater quality by marine intrusion especially in the southwestern part of the study area najib et al 2016 used a hydrochemical approach to confirm that salinization of aquifers is due to marine intrusion it is undeniable that the main cause of saltwater contamination in the coastal aquifers of coastal chaouia is the overexploitation of groundwater through irrigation wells located in the coastal strip in fact the coastal chaouia is the site of a groundwater pumping activity that started in 1960 fakir et al 2001 and exclusively irrigates crops the succession of drought and the scarcity of water resources have led to an intense development of the individual pumping sector whose number of motorized pump wells exceeds 3670 water points abhbc 2016 leading to an increased groundwater drawdown and the existence of isopiestic line 0 m inland mainly in irrigated areas fig 2b in addition the survey conducted by the drpe in 1995 on the state of groundwater withdrawal showed that out of the 1083 wells surveyed during the months of june and july 96 wells are no longer operational because of the drought the rest 496 wells was totally abandoned because of the high salinity that exceeds tolerable standards in agriculture according to recent surveys conducted in 2016 the total area irrigated in the study area is 10089 ha ccaa 2016 the crops are mainly located between azemmour and bir jdid in addition the region has a diverse range of crop species including cereals forages vegetables fruits corn citrus and floral crops these agricultural products are intended for both local consumption and export fruits and vegetables grown in the greenhouse and in open fields are the dominant crops due to the shallow groundwater table 3 crops distribute as follows this marine intrusion delineation study fig 8 is very important for water managers and planners in coastal chaouia whose irrigated agriculture is an essential element of the economic development of the region therefore it is necessary to carefully consider the maximum permissible pumping rates that protect against marine intrusions particularly in the coastal strip as the position and extent of the saltwater wedge will depend on the location and depth of pumping wells and flows koussis et al 2012 camp et al 2014 in addition it is recommended to convert the irrigation system by flooding and sprinkling to a drip and watering irrigation system to enable the more sustainable use of existing groundwater resources 7 conclusion the extent and geometric characteristics of saltwater contamination in the coastal chaouia aquifers were studied using vertical electric soundings in combination with electrical resistivity tomography profiles and hydrochemical and hydrogeological measurements the results showed that a significant part of the aquifers is influenced by the marine intrusion in fact in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone the extension of the saltwater contamination exceeds 2 km inland with 45 m depth due to the lithological nature of the terrain marly limestones of cretaceous and increased demand for freshwater for irrigation especially during dry periods on the other hand in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone characterized by altered schists surmounting the schists the seawater intrusion is detected near the coast penetrating 700 m towards the continent with 20 m of depth in addition the water quality sampling campaign revealed that salinity values become weak as they move away from the ocean this has also been confirmed by measurements of electrical conductivity these results will provide baseline data for improvement of future coastal groundwater management plans and demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of calibrated ves and ert methods with hydrochemical and hydrogeological data to accurately map the dimensions of marine intrusion geometry as well as they can be applied in other coastal regions acknowledgements this study benefited from financial support from the hydraulic basin agency of bouregreg and chaouia we would like to thank the agency for its support and cooperation in providing all the data required we are grateful to the national office of the agricultural council of the azemmour centre for providing the crop data 
6948,the coastal chaouia located on the moroccan atlantic coast comports three aquifers a first plio quaternary constitutes the cover a second cretaceous located at sw in the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka and a third primary located at se in the zone of tnine chtouka casablanca these reservoirs constitute the only exploitable water resource for the social and economic development of the region between azemmour and casablanca these aquifers are unconfined pellicular and discontinuous they feed by infiltration of rainwater and discharge at sea agricultural irrigation is carried out exclusively from the groundwater which causes a drop of the piezometric surface and the intrusion of saltwater into the aquifer at the coast the consequence is the abandonment of some wells contaminated by seawater leading to conflict situations and significant economic losses therefore delineation of the freshwater saltwater interface is very important in order to build a sustainable groundwater management system and to implement appropriate regulatory policies the purpose of this study is to determine the extent and the geometric characteristics of the saltwater contamination extent in the coastal aquifers of the coastal chaouia to achieve this 399 vertical electric soundings and 48 electrical resistivity tomography profiles were performed perpendicular to the ocean furthermore the electrical conductivity and the piezometry were measured in 344 wells distributed over the study area the study demonstrated the effectiveness of electrical methods for mapping seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers in fact the results of the interpretation of the ves and erts after calibration with the lithological data of the boreholes as well as the values of the electrical conductivity have shown that the length of the saltwater wedge penetration inland depends on the lithological nature of the aquifer formations thus in the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka characterized by the presence of cretaceous terrains the extension of the saltwater wedge exceeds 2 km towards the continent and its depth reaches 45 m on the other hand in the zone of tnine chtouka casablanca characterized by the rise of the schists surmounted by the altered schists the seawater intrusion remains limited at 700 m from the coast and at 20 m of depth keywords coastal aquifers

al 2015 gorgij and moghaddam 2016 santucci et al 2016 these aquifers constitute the main source of drinking water supply for almost one billion people worldwide small and nicholls 2003 this increases the demand on freshwater of the aquifers and exposes them to contamination by saltwater sherif et al 2011 the extent of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers is influenced by several factors such as the nature of geological formations the hydraulic gradient the rate of withdrawal of groundwater and its recharge freeze and cherry 1979 in fact the overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation and domestic use is the main anthropogenic factor of the coastal aquifers salinity werner and simmons 2009 ferguson and gleeson 2012 taylor 2012 ketabchi et al 2016 wassef and schüttrumpf 2016 hussain and javadi 2016 aslam et al 2018 moreover global warming decreases atmospheric pressure leading to the rising of the sea level and also contributes to marine intrusion chen et al 2016 colombani and mastrocicco 2016 therefore the implementation of sustainable management and protection measures is crucial to their preservation and to ensure the future use of these resources the mapping of marine

environmental economic social and cultural importance these aquifers are under intense pressure to meet the ever increasing needs as well for drinking and industrial water supply as for the irrigation leading to deterioration of the quality of groundwater affected by the marine intrusion the coastal chaouia is an example of this the unplanned exploitation of their groundwater causes decreases in piezometric levels and consequently the intrusion of saltwater into the aquifers the origins of the strong mineralization of the groundwater have been studied by some researchers amraoui 1988 younsi 2001 marjoua et al 1997 fakir et al 2001 moustadraf 2006 najib et al 2016 the present study has for objective to locate the penetration of the saltwater wedge into the aquifer of coastal chaouia from the coastal strip to the inland by the joint use of the electrical resistivity tomography ert vertical electric soundings ves and hydrochemical and hydrogeological measurements 2 study area the coastal chaouia is situated along the moroccan atlantic coast it extends between the cities of azemmour and casablanca with a surface of 1200 km2 this hydrogeological unit is limited in the southwest by oum rbiaa river in the northwest by the atlantic ocean in the northeast by the quartzite of elhank and in the southeast by the plain of berrechid this area represents a set of nether plateaus faintly inclined towards the coastline and dune cordons mark the border of the ocean the climate of the region is arid to semi arid this character is attenuated by the proximity of the ocean the annual average temperature and precipitation are 17 c and 350 mm respectively this plain is not crossed by any perennial stream and the contribution of the houara and merzeg rivers which furrows it across its width is only apparent in flood period the main economic activity of this agricultural vocation region is market gardening with irrigation due to the shallow groundwater 2 1 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area fig 2a is formed by secondary and tertiary deposits rely on primary terrains heavily folded by the hercynian orogeny bentayeb 1972 the paleozoic is constituted by schists and altered schists and by quartzites the cenomanian outcrops at the south western extremity in the lower valley of oum rbiaa in the form of marly limestones terrains which continue northwards and under plio quaternary covering the quaternary formed by a pellicular covering of conglomerate silts and clayey sands the groundwater of the coastal chaouia is unconfined circulating according to the places in the primary schists in the cretaceous or in the plio quaternary the thickness of this alteration is 40 50 m amraoui 1988 fractured quartzites can also be conductive water as evidenced by the numerous sources emerges from this formation the cretaceous terrains are constituted by a marly limestones series and outcrop at the edge of the oum rbiaa river with an average thickness of 60 m the marly passages of the cretaceous sometimes play the role of the substratum of overlying water circulations in the plio quaternary this latter constitutes by sandy limestones more or less lumachellic of 4 20 m thickness and by consolidated dunes of 10 m thickness along the coastal strip drpe 1994 3 materials and methods 3 1 piezometry and water sampling a piezometric survey of

electric soundings were carried out in 2015 between azemmour and casablanca fig 1 distributed on 20 profiles perpendicular to the atlantic ocean the schlumberger device a mn b was used in all ves with a maximum spacing between the current electrodes ab of 1 5 m and successively increased to 1000 m the data acquisition was realized with a geotrade resistivity meter with signal summations and polarity reversal and automatic ps elimination with two 400w converters the locations of the ves centres were determined by two magellan explorist 610 and xl portable gps units the geoelectric field data were processed and interpreted after inversion by the processing software of jean louis astier of geostudi jla plus the interpretation of the results was effectuated in two ways qualitatively and quantitatively the qualitative approach is based on the production of iso resistivity maps for ab 100 m and ab 300 m the quantitative approach was used to determine the geoelectric parameters thickness and resistivity that characterize each layer based on the correlation with the lithological and hydrogeological data of the boreholes available in the study area the results of this interpretation contributed to the construction of the ves models the geo electric sections and the apparent resistivity maps 3 3 electrical resistivity tomography ert in the present study 48 ert profiles were executed perpendicular to the coastline during the summer of 2015 to clarify and map the limit of saltwater intrusion between the geo electric sections obtained by the ves fig 1 whose six are presented in this article te2 te3 te6 te13 te19 and te20 72 stainless steel electrodes spaced 10 m apart were used covering a total length of 710 m for each ert profile in five cases the ert profiles were covered by 720 m in four roll along schemes in order to obtain a total length of 1430 m te11 te12 te22 and te36 the electrical resistivity measurements were carried out using a resistivity meter located at the centre of the very powerful ares ii electrode array 850 w 5a 2000 vpp with two 48 channel switches for connections these measurements were calibrated with boreholes in the vicinity of the profiles the wenner schlumberger array configuration has been used to accurately detect horizontal and vertical structures loke et al 2010 and it s well suited for the marine intrusion the apparent resistivity data obtained have been analyzed and converted into real resistivity values by the res 2dinv software developed by geotomo software using the method of inversion of the constrained iterative least squares loke and barker 1996 to produce a model of resistivity section 2d in order to compare the extent of the marine intrusion into the study area the colour scale of the resistivity values was chosen to be constant for all the erts therefore the colours from blue to dark blue were attributed to low resistivity values indicating saline water mean squared errors rms between observed and calculated resistivity values ranged from 3 6 to 5 8 on all ert lines indicating the good quality of the measured data the resistivity values obtained by the erts were correlated with the values obtained by the archie 1942 equation using the electrical conductivity and the effective porosity of the aquifer formations this parameter has a very important effect on the resistivity niwas et al 2011 tizro et al 2012 because the rocks of a high porosity show a low resistivity in the presence of seawater 2 archie equation ρ α ρ ω ϕ m s n ρ is the resistivity of the formation ω m α is the saturation coefficient that depends on the lithology and varies between 0 6 and 2 ρ w is the water resistivity ω m ф is the effective porosity dimensionless m is the cementation factor which depends on the shape of the pores and the rock compaction and ranges between 1 3 and 2 2 s is the saturation dimensionless n is the saturation exponent and its value is about 2 for most of the normal porosity formations whose water content is between 20 and 100 m and n are empirical parameters and must be adjusted according to the lithological nature of the aquifer formations olsen et al 2008 wang et al 2014 4 results 4 1 piezometry and electrical conductivity the piezometric measurements carried out in december 2013 from 344 points allows drawing up the kriged piezometric map of the groundwater of coastal chaouia fig 2 b whose isopiestic line is comprised between 5 and 160 m the examination of this piezometric map shows that the flow direction is generally from the southeast to the northwest except in the southwest of tnine chtouka where a watershed divides the waters go towards the sea from those flowing to the oum rbia river and showing a natural drainage through the river in the northeast the isopiestic lines are flat and tight with an almost constant spacing the piezometric measurements show that the shallow depths of the groundwater generally less than 10 m are observed in the coastal areas these measurements also showed depressed areas in the southwest which correspond to pumping areas for agricultural greenhouse irrigation the existence of the 0 m isopiestic line inland shows the advancement of the saltwater wedge due to intensified exploitation in the south western part the electrical conductivity measured in december 2013 in 344 wells across the entire groundwater is shown in fig 3 values range from 0 2 to 11 ms cm the highest conductivities are recorded in the coastal zone by going inland the conductivities become lower in the south western part of the azemmour tnine chtouka zone where the groundwater flows in the marly limestones of cenomanian the conductivity values are very low less than 2 ms cm indicating good quality of water 4 2 evolution of the salinity in comparison with the depth in order to follow the spatial evolution of the salinity of the chaouia coastal aquifers a sampling campaign is carried out to measure the water quality in six selected groundwater samples these samples are aligned perpendicularly to the atlantic ocean fig 3 table 1 below summarizes the characteristics of these samples the evolution of the salinity in comparison with the depth at the groundwater samples remains stable by increasing the depth however salinity decreases as it moves away from the ocean this indicates that these piezometers capture only one layer of the aquifers with a low salt content the graphical representation of the salinity conductivity and dissolved matter in comparison with the depth of each groundwater sample is illustrated in fig 3 4 3 vertical electric soundings the vertical electric soundings are performed to illustrate the phenomenon of marine intrusion and to locate the limit of the saltwater contamination in the coastal chaouia aquifers the main results of the ves interpretation are described in the following 4 3 1 vertical electric soundings diagrams the interpretation of the electric soundings was calibrated with the boreholes 4103 19 and 1349 19 whose the lithology is shown in table 2 the 5ch6 electric sounding is located at 800 m from the coast in the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka the 5ch6 vertical electric sounding shows a resistant set of r0 formed with three layers and a total thickness of 22 m corresponding to the sandstones and clayey sands of the plio quaternary under this set of a conductor level c with 50 ω m and 20 m of thickness corresponds to the marly limestones of the cenomanian this level surmounts an intermediate layer with a thickness of about 60 m and 23 ω m resistivities corresponding to marly limestones and grey marls finally there is the resistant substratum rs which corresponds to the schists the decrease in the resistivity of the covering levels a and c of the resistant assembly rs is attributed to the effect of the seawater intrusion the vertical electric sounding 4ch16 is situated at 750 m from the coast in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone the 4ch16 vertical electric sounding reveals four electrical levels a less conductor level c0 with 103 ω m of resistivity and overcome a resistant assembly r0 which has a high resistivity up to 286 ω m and corresponds to the sandstones with cement limestones below a conductor cs of 48 ω m and 16 m of thickness corresponds to the altered schists the set of c0 r0 cs rests on the resistant substratum rs of schists the decrease in the resistivity of the cs level is explained by the effect of the marine intrusion 4 3 2 apparent resistivity maps the apparent resistivity maps were established from the values of the apparent resistivity of the vertical electric soundings these maps were compiled for ab 100 m and ab 300 m the apparent resistivity map in line length ab 100 m fig 4 a shows resistivities varying between 4 and 400 ω m the low resistivity values between 4 and 50 ω m appear at the atlantic ocean shoreline in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone corresponding to the conductive formations saturated with saltwater the high resistivity values are located in the zone of tnine chtouka casablanca and in the south of the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka corresponding in the first zone to the consolidated dry sand and calcareous sandstones and in the second zone to the rise of the schists the apparent resistivity map in line length ab 300 m fig 4b shows that the low resistivity values between 6 and 500 ω m are located along the atlantic coast and correspond to the conductive formations influenced by the marine intrusion strong resistivity values dominate the southern and eastern extremes of the study area these values correspond to grey marls in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone and to compact schists in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone 5 geoelectric sections 20 geoelectric sections were established from the interpretation of the 399 vertical electric soundings fig 1 in order to show the distribution of the resistivity and the limit of the advancement of the saltwater wedge in the coastal chaouia aquifers the ch6 geoelectric section oriented nnw sse perpendicular to the coast is characteristic of the sections belonging to the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka it shows the presence of three zones an area between the shoreline and the edge of the saltwater wedge characterized by a slice of terrain in particular the levels a and c completely invaded by seawater where its roof deepens as one moves away from the shore until reaching the roof of the resistant assembly rs schists between the electric soundings 7ch6 and 8ch6 the decrease in resistivity observed in this zone is attributed to the high salinity of the groundwater a mixing zone of saltwater and freshwater located between the 6ch6 and 7ch6 electrical soundings and characterized by a slight rise in resistivity a zone in the sse characterized by relatively high resistivities to those observed previously the level is electrically only the intermediate bd which corresponds to marly limestones the ch16 geoelectric section with nnw sse direction and perpendicular to the ocean is characteristic of the sections belonging to the chtouka casablanca zone this section shows that the limit of the saltwater wedge is situated between the electric soundings 3ch16 and 4ch16 and coincides with an accentuated ascent of the roof of the resistant assembly rs the slice of terrain invaded by seawater is essentially the altered schists represented by the levels r0 and cs the resistivity variation of the altered schists is related to the degree of alteration where the conductor level cs corresponds to high alteration schists and the intermediate level r0 represents the schists with moderate alteration the results derived from the interpretation of the ves show that in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone the geo electric stratigraphy consists mainly of four units the upper unit represents the plio quaternary deposits of sandstones and clayey sands and characterized by resistivity values ranging between 50 and 370 ω m the second and the third units represent the saturated zone of the cretaceous aquifer with a depth of 45 m this zone includes seawater with a resistivity not exceeding 23 ω m the deepest unit is characterized by high resistivity values of more than 1047 ω m corresponding to the schistous substratum however the tnine chtouka casablanca zone consists of three geoelectric units the first is characterized by resistivities varying between 34 and 286 ω m corresponding to the sandstone with calcareous cement of the plio quaternary the underlying unit constitutes the aquifer of altered schists saturated with seawater characterized by a resistivity which varies between 13 and 48 ω m and a depth which does not exceed 20 m the third unit with a high resistivity up to 700 ω m represents the schistous substratum the extent of the saltwater contamination in the area of azemmour tnine chtouka reaches 2 km inland with a depth of 45 m nevertheless in the zone of tnine chtouka casablanca the extension of the marine intrusion does not exceed 700 m towards the continent with 20 m of depth 5 1 electrical resistivity tomography the electrical resistivity tomography is a useful method for delineating the saltwater intrusion in coastal areas because of its ability to distinguish the high resistivity contrast between saturated layers of saltwater and freshwater the ert profiles have been calibrated with hydrogeological boreholes data taking into account the electrical conductivity measured in wells near the profiles a discussion of these profiles follows the te2 profile fig 6 a is oriented nw se perpendicularly and at 400 m from the ocean the total length of the profile is 950 m with two rolls along and a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m it shows the existence of three types of resistivities a highly resistive surface formation with resistivities ranging from 300 to 800 ω m a conductive formation with 40 m of thickness and low resistivity varying from 1 to 7 ω m and a basically formation characterized by a resistivity which ranges from 70 to 300 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te2 profile is 10 4 ms cm in a water depth of 22 m which coincides perfectly with the conductor s roof observed on the profile the calibration of the latter with the 4102 19 borehole allows attributing the resistive formation to the sand and sandstones of the plio quaternary and the conductive formation to the cretaceous marly limestones invaded by seawater resting on the schistous substratum the application of the archie formula with the porosity data of the aquifer formation 2 12 drpe 1996 and the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the profile gives resistivities varying between 3 and 65 ω m which confirms the resistivities found on the te2 profile the te3 profile fig 6b is constructed from an nw se direction perpendicularly and at 600 m from the ocean its total length is 710 m with a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m it shows three types of resistivities a surface formation with a resistivity about 40 200 ω m a conductive formation with a resistivity which varies from 3 to 40 ω m this layer is based on a resistive formation of 70 300 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te3 profile is 11 ms cm the calibration with the 1388 19 borehole allows attributing the resistive formation to the alluvium and sands of the plio quaternary and the conductive formation to the marly limestones of cretaceous invaded by seawater surmounting the schists of the primary the application of the archie formula with the porosity data of the aquifer formation 2 12 and the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the profile gives resistivities varying between 3 and 61 ω m which confirms the resistivities found on the te3 profile the te6 profile fig 6c is executed at 500 m perpendicular to the ocean it follows an nw se direction of a total length of 950 m with two rolls along and a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m this profile shows the existence of three types of resistivity a resistive surface formation with resistivities ranging between 80 and 800 ω m a conductor with low resistivities of 1 10 ω m is observed from 7 m of depth and a substratum of 100 300 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te6 profile is 9 7 ms cm in a water depth of 6 m the depth of the groundwater measured in this well corresponds perfectly to the conductor roof observed on the profile the calibration of the latter with the 1358 19 borehole allows attributing the resistant to the sandstones and sandy clay of the plio quaternary and the conductor to the marly limestones aquifer loaded with saltwater resting on the schistous substratum the application of the archie formula with the porosity of the aquifer formation and the electrical conductivity measured in the well gives resistivities ranging between 4 and 69 ω m confirming the resistivities found on the te6 profile the te13 profile fig 7 a is oriented nnw sse perpendicularly and at 320 m from the ocean its total length is 710 m with a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m it shows two types of resistivity a conductive surface formation with a resistivity not exceeding 20 ω m and a substratum with resistivities varying from 80 to 200 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te13 profile is 10 5 ms cm in a water depth of 12 m the calibration with the 1206 19 borehole allows attributing the conductor to the aquifer of altered schists loaded with saltwater resting on the schists the application of the archie formula with the porosity of the aquifer formation 2 6 drpe 1996 and the electrical conductivity measured in the well gives resistivities varying between 11 and 64 ω m confirms the resistivities found on the te13 profile the te17 profile fig 7b is realized perpendicular to the ocean its total length is 830 m with a roll along and at 180 m from the sea it extends in the nnw sse direction with a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m the results of the inversion show two types of resistivities a conductive part with low resistivity ranging from 4 to 40 ω m and a resistive part with a resistivity which varies from 100 to 800 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te19 profile is 9 4 ms cm in a water depth of 10 m the calibration with the 4057 19 borehole allows attributing the resistant to the schists and the conductor to the altered schists invaded by the seawater the resistivities obtained by the application of the archie formula with the porosity data of the aquifer formation and the electrical conductivity of the well vary between 12 and 61 ω m confirming the results obtained by the electric resistivity tomography the te20 profile fig 7c is executed perpendicularly and at 200 m from the ocean it takes the nno sse direction with a total length of 830 m a roll along and a pseudo depth of investigation of 100 m this profile shows a resistivity varying from 100 to 800 ω m and a conductor with a resistivity which ranges from 4 to 40 ω m the electrical conductivity measured in the well near the te20 profile is 11 ms cm in a water depth of 10 m the calibration with 1349 19 borehole allows attributing the resistant to the schists and the conductor to the altered schists and sandstones invaded by the seawater the resistivities obtained from the archie formula vary between 10 and 61 ω m confirming the resistivities found on the te20 profile the results obtained from the 48 erts profiles after calibration with the hydrogeological boreholes and the conductivities measured near the profiles show that the salinity of the coastal chaouia aquifers is related to the lithological nature of the aquifers formations and their hydrodynamic parameters the penetration of the marine intrusion into the cretaceous aquifer in the south western zone of azemmour tnine chtouka reaches 2000 m in relation to the shore due to the shallow depth and the high porosity on the other hand in the northeast zone of tnine chtouka casablanca characterized by aquifer of altered schists the attenuation of the marine intrusion remains limited to 700 m from the ocean due to the low porosity and permeability of the schists preventing the aquifer from being invaded by seawater the results of the ves ert and piezometry corroborate the distribution of the conductivity obtained from the hydrochemical study indeed the high values of the conductivity ec have been measured in the coastal band where the piezometric level is negative fig 2b similarly the resistivity values of the saline zones of the aquifer ranged from 1 to 10 ω m in the southwest and from 4 to 40 ω m in the northeast due to the lithological nature of the aquifers and the degree of salinization indeed the aquifer most affected by the marine intrusion is that of marly limestone according to the shallow depth and the high permeability facilitating the return of saline waters 6 discussion the electrical resistivity of a geological formation is a physical characteristic determines the flow of electric current in the formation this resistivity varies with the texture of the rock the nature of the mineralization and the electrical conductivity contained in the rock parkhomenko 1967 niwas and celik 2012 kazakis et al 2016a b the effect of marine intrusion is shown by the low resistivity high conductivity ec and the advance of salt wedge inland in order to obtain reliable results it is very important to combine geophysical prospecting methods with hydrogeological data lithological profiles hydraulic and hydrochemical data because each method provides significant information that complements and supports others the correlation of the ves allowed realizing geo electric sections showing the vertical configuration of the saltwater wedge in fact the low resistivity values observed on these sections are interpreted as layers containing saltwater and the high resistivity values indicate zones containing freshwater on the ch6 section fig 5 characteristic of the azemmour tnine chtouka zone the ves have retained low resistivity values up to ves 7ch6 from the coast to ves 7ch7 the entire conductive layer has been invaded by seawater however on section ch16 fig 5 characteristic of the tnine chtouka casablanca zone the low resistivity values were observed from the coast up to ves 4ch16 indicating the limit of the marine intrusion in this ves above 4ch16 the resistivities have increased to complete the results obtained by the ves and readjust the marine intrusion limit between the sections the erts were plotted between all the sections fig 1 the interpretation of the erts after calibration with the hydrogeological drilling lithology and the conductivity ec measured in the wells near the profiles has allowed determining the geometry of the extension of the marine intrusion the correlation between the ert profiles shows that the low resistivity layers generally between 1 and 10 ω m in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone and between 4 and 20 ω m in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone are attributed to saturated formations of seawater this difference in the distribution of the resistivity is related to the lithological nature of the aquifer formations and the hydrodynamic parameters indeed the azemmour tnine chtouka zone is characterized by the cretaceous aquifer marly limestone with high permeability and porosity the interface between fresh and salt water is 2 km from the coast on the other hand in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone characterized by altered schists with low permeability and porosity the marine intrusion remains limited to 700 m from the ocean in addition the electrical conductivities ec of water vary between 0 2 and 11 ms cm the highest values are located along the coastal strip and decrease significantly away from the ocean the origin of the salinity of the coastal chaouia aquifers has been addressed by several previous studies amraoui 1988 explains it by the geological nature of the terrain which strongly influences the chemical composition of the water younsi 2001 attributes it to the effect of marine intrusion however marjoua et al 1997 who used a chemical cl br and isotopic 11o 2h 14c approaches excluded the effects of seawater intrusion and evaporation in the groundwater contamination they claim that the high salinity of the groundwater is mainly due to chlorides which the origins are the leaching of existing salts in the soil and the intensive use of fertilizers fakir et al 2001 who also used an isotopic approach 18o and moustadraf 2006 concluded that intensive and uncontrolled water withdrawals combined with drought have caused a significant degradation of groundwater quality by marine intrusion especially in the southwestern part of the study area najib et al 2016 used a hydrochemical approach to confirm that salinization of aquifers is due to marine intrusion it is undeniable that the main cause of saltwater contamination in the coastal aquifers of coastal chaouia is the overexploitation of groundwater through irrigation wells located in the coastal strip in fact the coastal chaouia is the site of a groundwater pumping activity that started in 1960 fakir et al 2001 and exclusively irrigates crops the succession of drought and the scarcity of water resources have led to an intense development of the individual pumping sector whose number of motorized pump wells exceeds 3670 water points abhbc 2016 leading to an increased groundwater drawdown and the existence of isopiestic line 0 m inland mainly in irrigated areas fig 2b in addition the survey conducted by the drpe in 1995 on the state of groundwater withdrawal showed that out of the 1083 wells surveyed during the months of june and july 96 wells are no longer operational because of the drought the rest 496 wells was totally abandoned because of the high salinity that exceeds tolerable standards in agriculture according to recent surveys conducted in 2016 the total area irrigated in the study area is 10089 ha ccaa 2016 the crops are mainly located between azemmour and bir jdid in addition the region has a diverse range of crop species including cereals forages vegetables fruits corn citrus and floral crops these agricultural products are intended for both local consumption and export fruits and vegetables grown in the greenhouse and in open fields are the dominant crops due to the shallow groundwater table 3 crops distribute as follows this marine intrusion delineation study fig 8 is very important for water managers and planners in coastal chaouia whose irrigated agriculture is an essential element of the economic development of the region therefore it is necessary to carefully consider the maximum permissible pumping rates that protect against marine intrusions particularly in the coastal strip as the position and extent of the saltwater wedge will depend on the location and depth of pumping wells and flows koussis et al 2012 camp et al 2014 in addition it is recommended to convert the irrigation system by flooding and sprinkling to a drip and watering irrigation system to enable the more sustainable use of existing groundwater resources 7 conclusion the extent and geometric characteristics of saltwater contamination in the coastal chaouia aquifers were studied using vertical electric soundings in combination with electrical resistivity tomography profiles and hydrochemical and hydrogeological measurements the results showed that a significant part of the aquifers is influenced by the marine intrusion in fact in the azemmour tnine chtouka zone the extension of the saltwater contamination exceeds 2 km inland with 45 m depth due to the lithological nature of the terrain marly limestones of cretaceous and increased demand for freshwater for irrigation especially during dry periods on the other hand in the tnine chtouka casablanca zone characterized by altered schists surmounting the schists the seawater intrusion is detected near the coast penetrating 700 m towards the continent with 20 m of depth in addition the water quality sampling campaign revealed that salinity values become weak as they move away from the ocean this has also been confirmed by measurements of electrical conductivity these results will provide baseline data for improvement of future coastal groundwater management plans and demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of calibrated ves and ert methods with hydrochemical and hydrogeological data to accurately map the dimensions of marine intrusion geometry as well as they can be applied in other coastal regions acknowledgements this study benefited from financial support from the hydraulic basin agency of bouregreg and chaouia we would like to thank the agency for its support and cooperation in providing all the data required we are grateful to the national office of the agricultural council of the azemmour centre

in chief with the assistance of giorgio mannina associate editor hydraulic redistribution hr in sites with shallow soils and its response to random droughts during the summer rainy season in humid areas remains poorly understood we investigated the soil moisture dynamics hr and water buffer of shallow soils by monitoring the soil moisture content at multiple depths during a random drought event in the summer rainy season in typical forestland and orchard in a subtropical area soil moisture sensors were installed at depths of 5 10 15 20 and 30 cm at three sites forest peach1 and peach2 the total and net daily water use and water buffer capacity of the root zone were defined and calculated during the short term drought the hr of soil moisture occurred at all sites suggesting that it could be an important process in both forest and orchard land in response to short term drought hr occurred at both daily and multiple day timescales in the shallow soils the net daily water use had less difference between the sites than the total daily water use principal component analysis of the total and net daily water use showed only evident clustering characteristics for the total daily water use indicating an important plant soil interaction effect the depth averaged magnitude of daily hr varied from 0 385 mm 0 0077 m3 m 3 at the forest site to 0 725 mm 0 0145 m3 m 3 at the peach1 site the redistributed water replenished over 75 of the water depleted from the shallow soil in particular soil moisture was better retained in 15 20 cm root zone than in other soil layers furthermore the water buffer capacity of the forest site was not higher than those of the two peach sites where land use converted from forest indicating that land use conversion does not necessarily weaken soil water retention the study results highlighted that hr has a significant influence on water recharge and water retention in humid area thus benefiting plant drought tolerance and total water utilization this study provides more insights to evaluate hr s effect on water retention and enhance our understanding of hr in shallow soils during random droughts in the summer rainy season in humid areas keywords soil moisture shallow soil water use buffer capacity random drought 1 introduction soil moisture is a key factor controlling plant growth and ecological and hydrological processes across multiple spatial scales in terrestrial ecosystems brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 tang et al 2015 vereecken et al 2014 zehe et al 2010 zhao et al 2016a soil moisture dynamics are closely related to plant activities and many other hydrological processes such as transpiration water retention storage overland flow initiation and even floods de boer euser et al 2016 domec et al 2010 luo et al 2016 oswald et al 2011 shaw et al 2013 spence et al 2010 sun et al 2016b yang et al 2014 yang et al 2012 zehe et al 2010 many areas of earth are covered with shallow soils underlain by bedrock gaines et al 2016 hasenmueller et al 2017 schwinning 2010 where stored soil water is limited and prone to loss however this limited water resource is important for plant water use dawson 1993 gaines et al 2016 the limited water storage of shallow soil usually results in temporary water shortages even in humid climates clermont dauphin et al 2013 fu et al 2007 miyamoto et al 2004 sun et al 2006 therefore clear characterization of soil moisture variations and water retention in shallow soils is important even in humid areas gaines et al 2016 isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 besides land use and vegetation soil moisture variation is closely related to soil properties such as texture bulk density and porosity lee et al 2007 meißner et al 2014 zhao et al 2016a in particular soil porosity commonly determines the potential soil water storage de boer euser et al 2016 zhao et al 2016a soil porosity and bulk density are usually related to water infiltration and retention zehe et al 2010 soil properties significantly influence soil moisture movement and storage however soil moisture is more prone to being affected by land use which mainly concerns plants good et al 2015 lu et al 2013 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 zhao et al 2016a plants play an important role in hydrological processes in ecosystems as well as soil moisture dynamics isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 lu et al 2013 tan et al 2011 for instance transpiration water loss can exceed water uptake by plant roots during growing seasons when water is in low supply dawson 1993 luo et al 2016 in such cases plants respond to drought by reducing their transpiration by stomatal closure to prevent excessive water deficits domec et al 2010 isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 importantly plant roots as an integral component of the root zone can release water stored in deep soil layers to the upper layers via hydraulic redistribution hr during drought periods brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 gaines et al 2016 guswa 2008 priyadarshini et al 2016 quijano and kumar 2015 the occurrence of chronic or random droughts during growing seasons could lead to trees capable of hr i e the movement of water from moist to dry soil through their roots brooks et al 2002 cavender bares and bazzaz 2000 dawson 1993 gaines et al 2016 neumann and cardon 2012 schwinning 2010 hr is movement from moist soil to drier soil in the upward hydraulic lift downward and lateral directions brooks et al 2002 yu and d odorico 2014 hr increases the water potential in drier soil layers during the night dawson 1993 and other periods when transpiration is reduced brooks et al 2002 luo et al 2016 nadezhdina et al 2010 hr is usually reflected by diel fluctuations oscillations in soil moisture content brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 neumann and cardon 2012 for example dawson 1993 reported hr induced diel fluctuations in soil moisture content at 20 and 35 cm soil depths and at 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m from the base of mature sugar maple trees redistributed water is available for reabsorption by the same plant or neighboring plants brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 ishikawa and bledsoe 2000 richards and caldwell 1987 hr has been recognized worldwide within a range of ecosystems and plant species however most studies have been conducted in temperate and semi arid environments jordi and josep 2014 nadezhdina et al 2010 neumann and cardon 2012 priyadarshini et al 2016 yu and d odorico 2014 yu et al 2013 or ecosystems with long summer droughts or even those receiving high precipitation brooks et al 2006 hr in sites with shallow soils and its response to random droughts during the summer rainy season in humid areas remains poorly investigated hr may be an important determinant of soil moisture dynamics and associated water retention storage bishop et al 2011 de boer euser et al 2016 isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 oswald et al 2011 spence 2007 given the hr effect on soil moisture and soil plant interactions soil moisture variations in the shallow root zone are expected to be more complex in humid areas than previously understood isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 luo et al 2016 neumann and cardon 2012 prieto et al 2012 priyadarshini et al 2016 hr has been measured for decades and recent studies have primarily focused on its effects on nutrient cycling plant interactions drought tolerance and climate change while less characterization of its effect on water retention storage has been completed armas et al 2012 brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 domec et al 2010 neumann and cardon 2012 priyadarshini et al 2016 richards and caldwell 1987 tang et al 2015 yu and d odorico 2014 in this study we investigated soil moisture dynamics in shallow soil layers in response to a typical random drought during the rainy season our hypothesis is that soil moisture would exhibit a non monotonically declining trend and different water retention at different depths in the root zone a related question regards whether and when hr occurred during the random drought in this period the primary objectives of this study were 1 to characterize soil moisture variations at multiple depths 2 to determine whether and when hr was triggered and 3 to characterize the capacity of the water buffer at multiple depths during the random drought under different vegetation covers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental sites the study area is situated in a humid area of eastern china 29 48 n 121 19 e fig 1 the soil types in this area are mainly red yellow and paddy soil the soil layer in the watershed is shallow ca 30 cm on average and is dominated by a silt loam in the 0 20 cm soil profile and sandy loam in the 20 30 cm soil profile beneath the shallow soil 30 cm is generally weathered fractured rock the region has a moderate subtropical monsoon climate with warm and humid weather from april to september the region has an annual mean temperature of 17 4 c and mean annual precipitation of 1463 mm evapotranspiration is about 730 mm 45 of which occurs during summer june august three experimental sites were selected a forest site and two peach orchards in the area the camphor tree cinnamomum bodinieri levl is the dominant tree species in the forest site the two peach amygdalus persica l orchards are located on a hillslope with similar topographical features to the forest site the orchards were converted from forestland approximately 10 years ago there are many understory plants perennial grass and bush in the forest while the orchards are bare of other plants due to weeding the variations in humidity and temperature during the study period are shown in table 1 and fig 2 2 2 soil moisture monitoring soil moisture sensors ec5 s smc m005 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa were used to monitor the soil moisture content at five depths 5 10 15 20 and 30 cm at the three sites ca 0 6 m from the base of trees the soil moisture sensors were installed horizontally in undisturbed soil and connected to a data logger hobo u30 nrc onset the instrument accuracy is 0 031 m3 m 3 3 1 with a resolution of 0 0007 m3 m 3 0 07 the volumetric soil moisture content was recorded every 5 min soil moisture storage expressed as millimeters of water was calculated by multiplying the soil volumetric moisture content by 50 a short term drought which started on 14 july 2017 and ended on 28 july 2017 was selected to explore the soil moisture variations in response to drought in the summer rainy season in shallow soils fig 3 high frequency soil moisture content monitoring is a common method used in hr studies neumann and cardon 2012 2 3 definition of soil moisture buffer capacity the daily range of soil moisture content total daily water use δθ m3 m 3 was defined as the difference between the maximum θmax m3 m 3 and minimum θmin m3 m 3 soil moisture contents within a calendar day daily time period calculated as 1 δ θ θ max n θ min n where n is a calendar day the decrement of soil moisture content net daily water use δθ m3 m 3 was defined as the difference between two adjacent extremum soil moisture contents on two calendar days from one day to the next i e the difference between one diel s maximum minimum and the next diel s maximum minimum soil moisture contents the net daily water use was calculated as 2 δ θ θ max n θ max n 1 θ min n θ min n 1 2 we defined the buffer capacity of the root zone θ bc as 3 θ bc n 1 n δ θ δ θ δ θ n 1 n 1 n δ θ δ θ n θ bc 1 means δθ is the net soil moisture increase e g water recharge by hr or rainwater infiltration θ bc 1 means that the soil moisture content holds steady or the water loss equals the water recharge θ bc 1 means the net loss of soil water θ bc 0 i e δθ equals δθ means steady decline monotonical decrease in soil moisture content implying no increase in soil moisture content e g bare soil undergoing continuous water loss generally the buffer capacity reflects the root zone s ability to hold moisture 2 4 soil property analysis soil samples were collected in triplicate at 10 cm intervals to determine the basic soil properties related to soil aeration and water movement zehe et al 2010 table1 the soil bulk density bd was measured by oven drying using steel rings 5 cm diameter the particle size distribution of each soil sample was determined using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england followed by the classification in the classification system of the usda soil taxonomy the capillary porosity cp and total porosity of the soil samples were determined using the water saturation method these parameters usually indicate the soil water storage chen et al 2004 liu et al 2011 sun et al 2016a yang et al 2018 zehe et al 2010 2 5 statistical analysis the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to determine the data normality sun et al 2016b differences in soil moisture contents among the three sites were determined using the non parametric kruskal wallis one way anova test feng et al 2018 principal component analysis pca was used to cluster the variables that showed similar behavior to identify potential clustering characteristics and relationships mandal et al 2008 tests were considered to indicate statistical significance at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed in ibm spss statistics 23 0 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics total and net daily water use during the short term drought in the summer rainy season the temperature was high in the daytime and there was only one small rainfall event with less than 5 mm rainfall on 20 july fig 2 the time course of the soil moisture content at different depths for the three experimental sites is shown in fig 3 distinct and repeated diel fluctuations in the soil moisture content indicated that hr occurred at different soil depths at the three sites figs 3 5 which will be discussed later the diel fluctuations in the soil moisture content were more obvious in the orchard sites than the forest site the soil moisture content in the surface layer was usually lower than that of deeper soils even after the small rainfall replenishment on 20 july for example at the two orchard sites the soil moisture content at 5 cm depth was lower than that at other depths the soil moisture content at 5 cm depth at the forest site was lower than that at other depths after 22 july the soil moisture content in the 15 cm soil layer was usually higher than that at other depths at all three sites the total daily water use at different depths is shown in fig 4 the relatively high value of total daily water use reflected water input by rainfall or hr such as the high ranges around 20 july caused by rainfall the high range at 10 cm depth on 27 july at the forest site and the high range on 19 july at the peach1 site caused by hr the changes in total daily water use fig 4a and soil moisture dynamics fig 3 were essentially synchronous generally the total daily water use showed little variability and a general decreasing trend with soil depth a comparison of the changes in total daily water use at the different sites and soil depths is shown in fig 4b the maximum total daily water use values were found at 10 cm 20 cm and 5 cm depth for the forest peach1 and peach2 sites respectively despite the rainfall s impact the maximum total daily water use denotes the largest change in soil moisture content due to evapotranspiration the largest depth averaged total daily water use was at the peach1 site 0 0171 m3 m 3 followed by the peach2 0 0134 m3 m 3 and forest 0 0096 m3 m 3 sites fig 4b the net daily water use at different soil depths is shown in fig 5 in fig 5a the negative values indicate the increments of soil moisture content for example the rainfall event induced negative values around 20 july while hr induced a negative value at 10 cm depth on 27 july at the forest site the peach1 site exhibited hr induced negative values at 15 cm and 20 cm depths on both 18 and 19 july the peach2 site exhibited similar hr induced soil moisture increasing in tandem with the peach1 site during the study period however it should be noted that this rarely occurred the more frequent situation was δθ δθ because the expected situation is δθ δθ without hr a comparison of the changes in net daily water use is shown in fig 5b the minimal value for each box indicates the effect of rainwater or hr on soil moisture content the soil moisture at 10 cm depth at the forest site and 5 cm depth at the peach2 site had relatively large soil moisture increments compared to other depths despite the soil moisture increment induced by rainfall the 10 15 cm deep soil at the forest site 15 20 cm deep soil at the peach1 site and 20 30 cm deep soil at the peach2 site may have had the highest volumes of redistributed water for the average net daily water use the minimum value occurred at 10 cm depth at the forest site 15 cm depth at the peach1 site and 30 cm depth at the peach2 site the depth averaged net daily water use is 0 0023 m3 m 3 for the forest site 0 0025 m3 m 3 for the peach1 site and 0 0034 m3 m 3 for the peach2 site pca was used to cluster the total and net daily water use compared to the net daily water use the total daily water use showed evident clustering fig 6 that is significantly different clustering characteristics were found between total daily water use and net daily water use 3 2 occurrence and magnitude of hydraulic redistribution the occurrence of maximum soil moisture content at five soil depths in a 24 h time series is shown in fig 7 the maximum soil moisture content occurred between midnight and midday and mainly fell in the time ranges from 00 00 am to 00 59 am and from 8 00 am to 9 59 am the time of maximal moisture content can reflect the end of daily hr the highest frequency of maximum soil moisture content was shown around nine o clock am and the different soil depths followed the same pattern compared to the forest site the peach sites consumed a large amount of soil moisture in daytime after 10 00 am and replenished a large amount of soil moisture in the next morning from 8 00 am to 10 00 am fig 7 there was a small rainfall event 2 mm on the morning of 13 july which was excluded from this study according to the rainfall dates 13 and 20 july the daily hr induced diel fluctuations in soil moisture content occurred returned within 1 d figs 3 5a and 6a for the forest soils the considerable hr in contrast to the daily hr occurred seven days after the rainfall on 20 july basically a 1 day drought period of no rainfall was enough for the occurrence of daily hr and 5 7 days of drought could trigger considerable hr in this study the difference between δθ and δθ can be used to express the magnitude of water recharge by hr the differences between the depth averaged δθ and δθ were 0 365 mm 0 0073 m3 m 3 for the forest site 0 730 mm 0 0146 m3 m 3 for the peach1 site and 0 500 mm 0 0100 m3 m 3 for the peach2 site when the rainfall s effect was excluded the depth averaged magnitude of daily hr varied from 0 385 mm 0 0077 m3 m 3 at the forest site to 0 725 mm 0 0145 m3 m 3 at the peach1 site the effect of rainfall on the depth averaged δθ and δθ was less than 0 02 mm 0 0004 m3 m 3 the maximum hr magnitude was 2 30 mm 0 046 m3 m 3 at 10 cm depth at the forest site on 28 july based on depth averaged values redistributed water replenished approximately 76 85 and 75 of the total daily water use from the shallow soil at the forest peach1 and peach2 sties respectively 3 3 buffer capacity of soils the water buffer capacities at different soil depths at the forest peach1 and peach2 sites during the short period drought are shown in fig 8 within the range of 5 20 cm depths the buffer capacities of the forest soil ranged between those of the two orchards while below 20 cm the buffer capacities of the forest soil were lower than those of the two peach sites generally the buffer capacities at the 15 and 20 cm depths were greater than at other soil depths 4 discussion 4 1 difference in soil moisture dynamics and daily water use the low soil moisture content in surface soil 5 cm depth at the forest site after 22 july was mainly caused by the high temperature induced soil evaporation and associated hr and soil structure e g preferential flows leading rainwater to bypass the surface soil profile the soil moisture content in the 15 cm soil layer usually had higher values than the other depths at all three sites indicating the possible high capacity of water retention and magnitude of hr dawson 1993 scholz et al 2002 the larger depth averaged total daily water use at the peach sites peach1 0 0171 m3 m 3 peach2 0 0134 m3 m 3 than the forest site 0 0096 m3 m 3 fig 4b indicated that the peach sites had more total daily water use or depletion possibly due to larger evapotranspiration the minimum value of net daily water use indicates the lowest net water use at that depth and the differences between depths occurred because of the interactive effect of soil heterogeneity and root distribution hao et al 2013 neumann and cardon 2012 zou et al 2005 lower mean values indicated that more soil moisture was recharged by rainfall or hr nevertheless the few statistically significant differences in net daily water use at different depths in the shallow soils implied that the net daily water use may more prone to influence from meteorological environmental conditions e g temperature rainfall soil heterogeneity etc than roots and soil e g tree species and related root distributions soil properties etc gaines et al 2016 neumann and cardon 2012 the obvious clustering characteristics of total daily water use for the three clustered areas indicate that the changes in total daily water use were primarily determined by the roots and soil in situ in contrast the almost overlapping dot areas of the net daily water use for the three experimental sites imply that the net daily water use in the shallow soils are likely to be determined by meteorological or environmental factors as mentioned above there is evidence that the net daily water use had fewer differences between the experimental sites than the total daily water use compared to the forest site the peach sites consumed a large amount of soil moisture in the daytime after 10 00 am and recharged a large amount of soil moisture the following morning 8 00 am to 10 00 am fig 7 the less marked diel fluctuation in forest than orchard could perhaps be attributed to the understory plants e g tree and grass coexistence because the understory plants could use the redistributed hydraulically lifted water and diminished the diel fluctuations in soil moisture content brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 priyadarshini et al 2016 4 2 hydraulic redistribution in soil layers the distinct and repeated diel fluctuations in soil moisture content at different soil depths at the three experimental sites figs 3 5 were consistent with previous studies that reported diel changes or nocturnal redistribution of soil moisture by plant roots brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 neumann and cardon 2012 the time of the soil moisture content increase indicated that the diel fluctuations in soil moisture could be explained by neither relatively high air humidity around midnight nor capillary rise from the shallow water table because of the thick bedrock beneath the shallow soil czachor 2006 dawson 1993 jorenush and sepaskhah 2003 diel changes in soil moisture content named daily hr in this study were common in the shallow root zone compared to the diel fluctuations soil moisture content exhibited more considerable increases such as at the 10 cm depth on the night of 27 july at the forest site at the 5 15 and 20 cm depths at the peach1 site on 19 july and at the 5 cm depth at the peach2 site in early 20 july fig 3 both the diel fluctuations and the considerable increase in soil moisture content were considered as the hr that released deep soil rock water to topsoil via the plant roots neumann and cardon 2012 the relatively higher soil moisture content in the subsoils than surface soils such as the high level of soil moisture content in the 15 cm depth soils may be partly due to surface evaporation and hr generally hr widely occurred in the study area suggesting that it plays an important role in regulating soil moisture content when facing short term drought during the summer rainy season even in humid areas the daily hr replenishment of soil moisture in the morning was similar to that found in previous studies brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 hao et al 2013 investigated the daily sap velocity change patterns in both taproots and lateral roots in desert riparian forests and found that both processes showed similar features the sap velocity was relatively stable between 00 00 and 08 00 am and then begin to dramatically increase until it reached a high level at 10 00 am the time duration was perfectly consistent with the present study furthermore in this study the maximum soil moisture content generally occurred at 9 00 am which was consistent with hao et al 2013 whose maximal soil moisture content occurred at 9 00 am at 20 120 cm soil depths in the desert riparian forests in this study hr occurred during two time ranges the night range from 00 00 am to 00 59 am and the morning dawn range from 8 00 am to 9 59 am both ranges are known as nocturnal hr but the latter was the most frequent situation brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 hao et al 2013 dawson 1993 found that rainfall in summer can diminish fluctuations in upper soil moisture content and diel fluctuations return within 9 days after soils have begun to dry out dawson s 1993 study period was much longer than that of this study the heavy rainfall saturating the upper 25 cm of soil and thick soil layer 90 cm in dawson 1993 in contrast to the shallow soil 30 cm on average and little rainfall 5 mm in this study may be attributed to the long time for drying soil and fluctuation return neumann and cardon 2012 found that the average magnitude of hr varies by nearly two orders of magnitude across ecosystems from 0 04 to 1 3 mm per day in the empirical literature and from 0 1 to 3 23 mm per day in the modeling literature in this study both the depth averaged magnitude of hr from 0 365 to 0 730 mm and the maximal magnitude 2 30 mm fell in this range 4 3 effect of hydraulic redistribution on water retention storage the redistributed water replenished 75 of the total daily water use these contributions of hr to water replenishment were considerably higher than the result found by brooks et al 2006 in which redistributed water replenished approximately 40 of the water depleted from upper soil on a daily basis hydraulically redistributed water has a significant effect on soil moisture recharge and thus may benefit plants drought tolerance and total water utilization and buffer trees against the potentially damaging effects of random water deficits brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 wan et al 2000 the buffer capacities at 15 and 20 cm depths were greater than at other soil depths indicating that soil moisture in the 15 20 cm soil layer was relatively steadily retained with less loss or more recharge compared to other soil depths a possible explanation for this is that shallow soil is the main constraint on root distribution gaines et al 2016 according to the high proportion 75 of redistributed water to total daily water use the large buffer capacity was attributed to the hr that is a large amount of water released by plant roots was absorbed from deep rock fissures or rock moisture gaines et al 2016 hasenmueller et al 2017 schwinning 2008 this was similar to the results of scholz et al 2010 who found that ca 50 of redistributed water is released into the top 10 cm of soils the buffer capacities of the forest soil fell in the range of the two orchards suggesting that land use conversion the orchards were converted from forest does not necessarily weaken the root zone s ability to retain water i e land use conversion does not result in a potential reduction in water status in the shallow root zone this may be attributed to the inherent traits of plants associated with root distribution and hr gaines et al 2016 hasenmueller et al 2017 a wide variety of morphological anatomical and physiological characteristics that either serve as drought adaptation or a buffer against the damaging effects of water deficits have been reported dawson 1993 luo et al 2016 tang et al 2015 yu and d odorico 2014 the buffer capacity calculated during a short term drought in this study can also be used under the condition of frequent precipitation to characterize the water retention ability the buffer capacity cannot be simply used to compare different types of bare soils without hr because δθ would equal δθ without hr which would lead the buffer capacities eq 3 to be zero θ bc 0 however when bare soils receive frequent precipitation the buffer capacity can be used to describe their different retention ability for infiltrated rainwater because plant activities usually exhibit great temporal and spatial heterogeneity or variability buffer capacity may also show seasonality which needs further study this study emphasized the importance of investigating the hr in shallow soils during random droughts in the summer rainy season in humid areas and also tried to incorporate the root soil interaction effects into the characterization of soil moisture status and associated water retention storage the study s results can broaden our knowledge of hr in humid areas and enhance our understanding of ecosystem water budgets balances hydrological variability and even climate change across multiple spatial scales under similar conditions brooks et al 2002 david et al 2013 dawson 1993 fu et al 2018 luo et al 2016 tang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016b moreover long term and high frequency soil moisture monitoring are important to further obtain an in depth understanding of the seasonality of hr and its influence on buffer capacity water conservation 5 conclusion this study investigated the soil moisture variations hydraulic redistribution and water buffer through soil moisture monitoring at multiple depths during a typical short term drought in the summer rainy season in forest and orchard lands in a subtropical area the orchard sites had more total daily water use than forest site together with evident clustering characteristics of total daily water use the results suggested the integral role of root soil in total daily water use especially in contrast to net daily water use the depth averaged magnitude of daily hr varied from 0 385 mm 0 0077 m3 m 3 to 0 725 mm 0 0145 m3 m 3 the wide occurrence of hr reveals that the hr is an important hydrological process activated in response to short term droughts during the summer rainy season in humid areas not only in traditionally recognized water deficit areas redistributed water replenished over 75 of the total daily water use from the shallow soils at the studied sites this study revealed that hydraulically redistributed water has a significant effect on water recharge especially in the 15 20 cm root zone and thus may have potential benefits for plants drought tolerance and water utilization this study provides more insights into hr and its effect on water retention during random droughts in the summer rainy season in humid areas acknowledgements this work

in chief with the assistance of giorgio mannina associate editor hydraulic redistribution hr in sites with shallow soils and its response to random droughts during the summer rainy season in humid areas remains poorly understood we investigated the soil moisture dynamics hr and water buffer of shallow soils by monitoring the soil moisture content at multiple depths during a random drought event in the summer rainy season in typical forestland and orchard in a subtropical area soil moisture sensors were installed at depths of 5 10 15 20 and 30 cm at three sites forest peach1 and peach2 the total and net daily water use and water buffer capacity of the root zone were defined and calculated during the short term drought the hr of soil moisture occurred at all sites suggesting that it could be an important process in both forest and orchard land in response to short term drought hr occurred at both daily and multiple day timescales in the shallow soils the net daily water use had less difference between the sites than the total daily water use principal component analysis of the total and net daily water use showed only evident clustering characteristics for the total daily water use indicating an important plant soil interaction effect the depth averaged magnitude of daily hr varied from 0 385 mm 0 0077 m3 m 3 at the forest site to 0 725 mm 0 0145 m3 m 3 at the peach1 site the redistributed water replenished over 75 of the water depleted from the shallow soil in particular soil moisture was better retained in 15 20 cm root zone than in other soil layers furthermore the water buffer capacity of the forest site was not higher than those of the two peach sites where land use converted from forest indicating that land use conversion does not necessarily weaken soil water retention the study results highlighted that hr has a significant influence on water recharge and water retention in humid area thus benefiting plant drought tolerance and total water utilization this study provides more insights to evaluate hr s effect on water retention and enhance our understanding of hr in shallow soils during random droughts in the summer rainy season in humid areas keywords soil moisture shallow soil water use buffer capacity random drought 1 introduction soil moisture is a key factor controlling plant growth and ecological and hydrological processes across multiple spatial scales in terrestrial ecosystems brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 tang et al 2015 vereecken et al 2014 zehe et al 2010 zhao et al 2016a soil moisture dynamics are closely related to plant activities and many other hydrological processes such as transpiration water retention storage overland flow initiation and even floods de boer euser et al 2016 domec et al 2010 luo et al 2016 oswald et al 2011 shaw et al 2013 spence et al 2010 sun et al 2016b yang et al 2014 yang et al 2012 zehe et al 2010 many areas of earth are covered with shallow soils underlain by bedrock gaines et al 2016 hasenmueller et al 2017 schwinning 2010 where stored soil water is limited and prone to loss however this limited water resource is important for plant water use dawson 1993 gaines et al 2016 the limited water storage of shallow soil usually results in temporary water shortages even in humid climates clermont dauphin et al 2013 fu et al 2007 miyamoto et al 2004 sun et al 2006 therefore clear characterization of soil moisture variations and water retention in shallow soils is important even in humid areas gaines et al 2016 isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 besides land use and vegetation soil moisture variation is closely related to soil properties such as texture bulk density and porosity lee et al 2007 meißner et al 2014 zhao et al 2016a in particular soil porosity commonly determines the potential soil water storage de boer euser et al 2016 zhao et al 2016a soil porosity and bulk density are usually related to water infiltration and retention zehe et al 2010 soil properties significantly influence soil moisture movement and storage however soil moisture is more prone to being affected by land use which mainly concerns plants good et al 2015 lu et al 2013 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 zhao et al 2016a plants play an important role in hydrological processes in ecosystems as well as soil moisture dynamics isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 lu et al 2013 tan et al 2011 for instance transpiration water loss can exceed water uptake by plant roots during growing seasons when water is in low supply dawson 1993 luo et al 2016 in such cases plants respond to drought by reducing their transpiration by stomatal closure to prevent excessive water deficits domec et al 2010 isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 importantly plant roots as an integral component of the root zone can release water stored in deep soil layers to the upper layers via hydraulic redistribution hr during drought periods brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 gaines et al 2016 guswa 2008 priyadarshini et al 2016 quijano and kumar 2015 the occurrence of chronic or random droughts during growing seasons could lead to trees capable of hr i e the movement of water from moist to dry soil through their roots brooks et al 2002 cavender bares and bazzaz 2000 dawson 1993 gaines et al 2016 neumann and cardon 2012 schwinning 2010 hr is movement from moist soil to drier soil in the upward hydraulic lift downward and lateral directions brooks et al 2002 yu and d odorico 2014 hr increases the water potential in drier soil layers during the night dawson 1993 and other periods when transpiration is reduced brooks et al 2002 luo et al 2016 nadezhdina et al 2010 hr is usually reflected by diel fluctuations oscillations in soil moisture content brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 neumann and cardon 2012 for example dawson 1993 reported hr induced diel fluctuations in soil moisture content at 20 and 35 cm soil depths and at 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m from the base of mature sugar maple trees redistributed water is available for reabsorption by the same plant or neighboring plants brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 ishikawa and bledsoe 2000 richards and caldwell 1987 hr has been recognized worldwide within a range of ecosystems and plant species however most studies have been conducted in temperate and semi arid environments jordi and josep 2014 nadezhdina et al 2010 neumann and cardon 2012 priyadarshini et al 2016 yu and d odorico 2014 yu et al 2013 or ecosystems with long summer droughts or even those receiving high precipitation brooks et al 2006 hr in sites with shallow soils and its response to random droughts during the summer rainy season in humid areas remains poorly investigated hr may be an important determinant of soil moisture dynamics and associated water retention storage bishop et al 2011 de boer euser et al 2016 isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 oswald et al 2011 spence 2007 given the hr effect on soil moisture and soil plant interactions soil moisture variations in the shallow root zone are expected to be more complex in humid areas than previously understood isarangkool na ayutthaya et al 2011 luo et al 2016 neumann and cardon 2012 prieto et al 2012 priyadarshini et al 2016 hr has been measured for decades and recent studies have primarily focused on its effects on nutrient cycling plant interactions drought tolerance and climate change while less characterization of its effect on water retention storage has been completed armas et al 2012 brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 domec et al 2010 neumann and cardon 2012 priyadarshini et al 2016 richards and caldwell 1987 tang et al 2015 yu and d odorico 2014 in this study we investigated soil moisture dynamics in shallow soil layers in response to a typical random drought during the rainy season our hypothesis is that soil moisture would exhibit a non monotonically declining trend and different water retention at different depths in the root zone a related question regards whether and when hr occurred during the random drought in this period the primary objectives of this study were 1 to characterize soil moisture variations at multiple depths 2 to determine whether and when hr was triggered and 3 to characterize the capacity of the water buffer at multiple depths during the random drought under different vegetation covers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental sites the study area is situated in a humid area of eastern china 29 48 n 121 19 e fig 1 the soil types in this area are mainly red yellow and paddy soil the soil layer in the watershed is shallow ca 30 cm on average and is dominated by a silt loam in the 0 20 cm soil profile and sandy loam in the 20 30 cm soil profile beneath the shallow soil 30 cm is generally weathered fractured rock the region has a moderate subtropical monsoon climate with warm and humid weather from april to september the region has an annual mean temperature of 17 4 c and mean annual precipitation of 1463 mm evapotranspiration is about 730 mm 45 of which occurs during summer june august three experimental sites were selected a forest site and two peach orchards in the area the camphor tree cinnamomum bodinieri levl is the dominant tree species in the forest site the two peach amygdalus persica l orchards are located on a hillslope with similar topographical features to the forest site the orchards were converted from forestland approximately 10 years ago there are many understory plants perennial grass and bush in the forest while the orchards are bare of other plants due to weeding the variations in humidity and temperature during the study period are shown in table 1 and fig 2 2 2 soil moisture monitoring soil moisture sensors ec5 s smc m005 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa were used to monitor the soil moisture content at five depths 5 10 15 20 and 30 cm at the three sites ca 0 6 m from the base of trees the soil moisture sensors were installed horizontally in undisturbed soil and connected to a data logger hobo u30 nrc onset the instrument accuracy is 0 031 m3 m 3 3 1 with a resolution of 0 0007 m3 m 3 0 07 the volumetric soil moisture content was recorded every 5 min soil moisture storage expressed as millimeters of water was calculated by multiplying the soil volumetric moisture content by 50 a short term drought which started on 14 july 2017 and ended on 28 july 2017 was selected to explore the soil moisture variations in response to drought in the summer rainy season in shallow soils fig 3 high frequency soil moisture content monitoring is a common method used in hr studies neumann and cardon 2012 2 3 definition of soil moisture buffer capacity the daily range of soil moisture content total daily water use δθ m3 m 3 was defined as the difference between the maximum θmax m3 m 3 and minimum θmin m3 m 3 soil moisture contents within a calendar day daily time period calculated as 1 δ θ θ max n θ min n where n is a calendar day the decrement of soil moisture content net daily water use δθ m3 m 3 was defined as the difference between two adjacent extremum soil moisture contents on two calendar days from one day to the next i e the difference between one diel s maximum minimum and the next diel s maximum minimum soil moisture contents the net daily water use was calculated as 2 δ θ θ max n θ max n 1 θ min n θ min n 1 2 we defined the buffer capacity of the root zone θ bc as 3 θ bc n 1 n δ θ δ θ δ θ n 1 n 1 n δ θ δ θ n θ bc 1 means δθ is the net soil moisture increase e g water recharge by hr or rainwater infiltration θ bc 1 means that the soil moisture content holds steady or the water loss equals the water recharge θ bc 1 means the net loss of soil water θ bc 0 i e δθ equals δθ means steady decline monotonical decrease in soil moisture content implying no increase in soil moisture content e g bare soil undergoing continuous water loss generally the buffer capacity reflects the root zone s ability to hold moisture 2 4 soil property analysis soil samples were collected in triplicate at 10 cm intervals to determine the basic soil properties related to soil aeration and water movement zehe et al 2010 table1 the soil bulk density bd was measured by oven drying using steel rings 5 cm diameter the particle size distribution of each soil sample was determined using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england followed by the classification in the classification system of the usda soil taxonomy the capillary porosity cp and total porosity of the soil samples were determined using the water saturation method these parameters usually indicate the soil water storage chen et al 2004 liu et al 2011 sun et al 2016a yang et al 2018 zehe et al 2010 2 5 statistical analysis the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to determine the data normality sun et al 2016b differences in soil moisture contents among the three sites were determined using the non parametric kruskal wallis one way anova test feng et al 2018 principal component analysis pca was used to cluster the variables that showed similar behavior to identify potential clustering characteristics and relationships mandal et al 2008 tests were considered to indicate statistical significance at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed in ibm spss statistics 23 0 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics total and net daily water use during the short term drought in the summer rainy season the temperature was high in the daytime and there was only one small rainfall event with less than 5 mm rainfall on 20 july fig 2 the time course of the soil moisture content at different depths for the three experimental sites is shown in fig 3 distinct and repeated diel fluctuations in the soil moisture content indicated that hr occurred at different soil depths at the three sites figs 3 5 which will be discussed later the diel fluctuations in the soil moisture content were more obvious in the orchard sites than the forest site the soil moisture content in the surface layer was usually lower than that of deeper soils even after the small rainfall replenishment on 20 july for example at the two orchard sites the soil moisture content at 5 cm depth was lower than that at other depths the soil moisture content at 5 cm depth at the forest site was lower than that at other depths after 22 july the soil moisture content in the 15 cm soil layer was usually higher than that at other depths at all three sites the total daily water use at different depths is shown in fig 4 the relatively high value of total daily water use reflected water input by rainfall or hr such as the high ranges around 20 july caused by rainfall the high range at 10 cm depth on 27 july at the forest site and the high range on 19 july at the peach1 site caused by hr the changes in total daily water use fig 4a and soil moisture dynamics fig 3 were essentially synchronous generally the total daily water use showed little variability and a general decreasing trend with soil depth a comparison of the changes in total daily water use at the different sites and soil depths is shown in fig 4b the maximum total daily water use values were found at 10 cm 20 cm and 5 cm depth for the forest peach1 and peach2 sites respectively despite the rainfall s impact the maximum total daily water use denotes the largest change in soil moisture content due to evapotranspiration the largest depth averaged total daily water use was at the peach1 site 0 0171 m3 m 3 followed by the peach2 0 0134 m3 m 3 and forest 0 0096 m3 m 3 sites fig 4b the net daily water use at different soil depths is shown in fig 5 in fig 5a the negative values indicate the increments of soil moisture content for example the rainfall event induced negative values around 20 july while hr induced a negative value at 10 cm depth on 27 july at the forest site the peach1 site exhibited hr induced negative values at 15 cm and 20 cm depths on both 18 and 19 july the peach2 site exhibited similar hr induced soil moisture increasing in tandem with the peach1 site during the study period however it should be noted that this rarely occurred the more frequent situation was δθ δθ because the expected situation is δθ δθ without hr a comparison of the changes in net daily water use is shown in fig 5b the minimal value for each box indicates the effect of rainwater or hr on soil moisture content the soil moisture at 10 cm depth at the forest site and 5 cm depth at the peach2 site had relatively large soil moisture increments compared to other depths despite the soil moisture increment induced by rainfall the 10 15 cm deep soil at the forest site 15 20 cm deep soil at the peach1 site and 20 30 cm deep soil at the peach2 site may have had the highest volumes of redistributed water for the average net daily water use the minimum value occurred at 10 cm depth at the forest site 15 cm depth at the peach1 site and 30 cm depth at the peach2 site the depth averaged net daily water use is 0 0023 m3 m 3 for the forest site 0 0025 m3 m 3 for the peach1 site and 0 0034 m3 m 3 for the peach2 site pca was used to cluster the total and net daily water use compared to the net daily water use the total daily water use showed evident clustering fig 6 that is significantly different clustering characteristics were found between total daily water use and net daily water use 3 2 occurrence and magnitude of hydraulic redistribution the occurrence of maximum soil moisture content at five soil depths in a 24 h time series is shown in fig 7 the maximum soil moisture content occurred between midnight and midday and mainly fell in the time ranges from 00 00 am to 00 59 am and from 8 00 am to 9 59 am the time of maximal moisture content can reflect the end of daily hr the highest frequency of maximum soil moisture content was shown around nine o clock am and the different soil depths followed the same pattern compared to the forest site the peach sites consumed a large amount of soil moisture in daytime after 10 00 am and replenished a large amount of soil moisture in the next morning from 8 00 am to 10 00 am fig 7 there was a small rainfall event 2 mm on the morning of 13 july which was excluded from this study according to the rainfall dates 13 and 20 july the daily hr induced diel fluctuations in soil moisture content occurred returned within 1 d figs 3 5a and 6a for the forest soils the considerable hr in contrast to the daily hr occurred seven days after the rainfall on 20 july basically a 1 day drought period of no rainfall was enough for the occurrence of daily hr and 5 7 days of drought could trigger considerable hr in this study the difference between δθ and δθ can be used to express the magnitude of water recharge by hr the differences between the depth averaged δθ and δθ were 0 365 mm 0 0073 m3 m 3 for the forest site 0 730 mm 0 0146 m3 m 3 for the peach1 site and 0 500 mm 0 0100 m3 m 3 for the peach2 site when the rainfall s effect was excluded the depth averaged magnitude of daily hr varied from 0 385 mm 0 0077 m3 m 3 at the forest site to 0 725 mm 0 0145 m3 m 3 at the peach1 site the effect of rainfall on the depth averaged δθ and δθ was less than 0 02 mm 0 0004 m3 m 3 the maximum hr magnitude was 2 30 mm 0 046 m3 m 3 at 10 cm depth at the forest site on 28 july based on depth averaged values redistributed water replenished approximately 76 85 and 75 of the total daily water use from the shallow soil at the forest peach1 and peach2 sties respectively 3 3 buffer capacity of soils the water buffer capacities at different soil depths at the forest peach1 and peach2 sites during the short period drought are shown in fig 8 within the range of 5 20 cm depths the buffer capacities of the forest soil ranged between those of the two orchards while below 20 cm the buffer capacities of the forest soil were lower than those of the two peach sites generally the buffer capacities at the 15 and 20 cm depths were greater than at other soil depths 4 discussion 4 1 difference in soil moisture dynamics and daily water use the low soil moisture content in surface soil 5 cm depth at the forest site after 22 july was mainly caused by the high temperature induced soil evaporation and associated hr and soil structure e g preferential flows leading rainwater to bypass the surface soil profile the soil moisture content in the 15 cm soil layer usually had higher values than the other depths at all three sites indicating the possible high capacity of water retention and magnitude of hr dawson 1993 scholz et al 2002 the larger depth averaged total daily water use at the peach sites peach1 0 0171 m3 m 3 peach2 0 0134 m3 m 3 than the forest site 0 0096 m3 m 3 fig 4b indicated that the peach sites had more total daily water use or depletion possibly due to larger evapotranspiration the minimum value of net daily water use indicates the lowest net water use at that depth and the differences between depths occurred because of the interactive effect of soil heterogeneity and root distribution hao et al 2013 neumann and cardon 2012 zou et al 2005 lower mean values indicated that more soil moisture was recharged by rainfall or hr nevertheless the few statistically significant differences in net daily water use at different depths in the shallow soils implied that the net daily water use may more prone to influence from meteorological environmental conditions e g temperature rainfall soil heterogeneity etc than roots and soil e g tree species and related root distributions soil properties etc gaines et al 2016 neumann and cardon 2012 the obvious clustering characteristics of total daily water use for the three clustered areas indicate that the changes in total daily water use were primarily determined by the roots and soil in situ in contrast the almost overlapping dot areas of the net daily water use for the three experimental sites imply that the net daily water use in the shallow soils are likely to be determined by meteorological or environmental factors as mentioned above there is evidence that the net daily water use had fewer differences between the experimental sites than the total daily water use compared to the forest site the peach sites consumed a large amount of soil moisture in the daytime after 10 00 am and recharged a large amount of soil moisture the following morning 8 00 am to 10 00 am fig 7 the less marked diel fluctuation in forest than orchard could perhaps be attributed to the understory plants e g tree and grass coexistence because the understory plants could use the redistributed hydraulically lifted water and diminished the diel fluctuations in soil moisture content brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 priyadarshini et al 2016 4 2 hydraulic redistribution in soil layers the distinct and repeated diel fluctuations in soil moisture content at different soil depths at the three experimental sites figs 3 5 were consistent with previous studies that reported diel changes or nocturnal redistribution of soil moisture by plant roots brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 neumann and cardon 2012 the time of the soil moisture content increase indicated that the diel fluctuations in soil moisture could be explained by neither relatively high air humidity around midnight nor capillary rise from the shallow water table because of the thick bedrock beneath the shallow soil czachor 2006 dawson 1993 jorenush and sepaskhah 2003 diel changes in soil moisture content named daily hr in this study were common in the shallow root zone compared to the diel fluctuations soil moisture content exhibited more considerable increases such as at the 10 cm depth on the night of 27 july at the forest site at the 5 15 and 20 cm depths at the peach1 site on 19 july and at the 5 cm depth at the peach2 site in early 20 july fig 3 both the diel fluctuations and the considerable increase in soil moisture content were considered as the hr that released deep soil rock water to topsoil via the plant roots neumann and cardon 2012 the relatively higher soil moisture content in the subsoils than surface soils such as the high level of soil moisture content in the 15 cm depth soils may be partly due to surface evaporation and hr generally hr widely occurred in the study area suggesting that it plays an important role in regulating soil moisture content when facing short term drought during the summer rainy season even in humid areas the daily hr replenishment of soil moisture in the morning was similar to that found in previous studies brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 hao et al 2013 investigated the daily sap velocity change patterns in both taproots and lateral roots in desert riparian forests and found that both processes showed similar features the sap velocity was relatively stable between 00 00 and 08 00 am and then begin to dramatically increase until it reached a high level at 10 00 am the time duration was perfectly consistent with the present study furthermore in this study the maximum soil moisture content generally occurred at 9 00 am which was consistent with hao et al 2013 whose maximal soil moisture content occurred at 9 00 am at 20 120 cm soil depths in the desert riparian forests in this study hr occurred during two time ranges the night range from 00 00 am to 00 59 am and the morning dawn range from 8 00 am to 9 59 am both ranges are known as nocturnal hr but the latter was the most frequent situation brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 hao et al 2013 dawson 1993 found that rainfall in summer can diminish fluctuations in upper soil moisture content and diel fluctuations return within 9 days after soils have begun to dry out dawson s 1993 study period was much longer than that of this study the heavy rainfall saturating the upper 25 cm of soil and thick soil layer 90 cm in dawson 1993 in contrast to the shallow soil 30 cm on average and little rainfall 5 mm in this study may be attributed to the long time for drying soil and fluctuation return neumann and cardon 2012 found that the average magnitude of hr varies by nearly two orders of magnitude across ecosystems from 0 04 to 1 3 mm per day in the empirical literature and from 0 1 to 3 23 mm per day in the modeling literature in this study both the depth averaged magnitude of hr from 0 365 to 0 730 mm and the maximal magnitude 2 30 mm fell in this range 4 3 effect of hydraulic redistribution on water retention storage the redistributed water replenished 75 of the total daily water use these contributions of hr to water replenishment were considerably higher than the result found by brooks et al 2006 in which redistributed water replenished approximately 40 of the water depleted from upper soil on a daily basis hydraulically redistributed water has a significant effect on soil moisture recharge and thus may benefit plants drought tolerance and total water utilization and buffer trees against the potentially damaging effects of random water deficits brooks et al 2002 dawson 1993 wan et al 2000 the buffer capacities at 15 and 20 cm depths were greater than at other soil depths indicating that soil moisture in the 15 20 cm soil layer was relatively steadily retained with less loss or more recharge compared to other soil depths a possible explanation for this is that shallow soil is the main constraint on root distribution gaines et al 2016 according to the high proportion 75 of redistributed water to total daily water use the large buffer capacity was attributed to the hr that is a large amount of water released by plant roots was absorbed from deep rock fissures or rock moisture gaines et al 2016 hasenmueller et al 2017 schwinning 2008 this was similar to the results of scholz et al 2010 who found that ca 50 of redistributed water is released into the top 10 cm of soils the buffer capacities of the forest soil fell in the range of the two orchards suggesting that land use conversion the orchards were converted from forest does not necessarily weaken the root zone s ability to retain water i e land use conversion does not result in a potential reduction in water status in the shallow root zone this may be attributed to the inherent traits of plants associated with root distribution and hr gaines et al 2016 hasenmueller et al 2017 a wide variety of morphological anatomical and physiological characteristics that either serve as drought adaptation or a buffer against the damaging effects of water deficits have been reported dawson 1993 luo et al 2016 tang et al 2015 yu and d odorico 2014 the buffer capacity calculated during a short term drought in this study can also be used under the condition of frequent precipitation to characterize the water retention ability the buffer capacity cannot be simply used to compare different types of bare soils without hr because δθ would equal δθ without hr which would lead the buffer capacities eq 3 to be zero θ bc 0 however when bare soils receive frequent precipitation the buffer capacity can be used to describe their different retention ability for infiltrated rainwater because plant activities usually exhibit great temporal and spatial heterogeneity or variability buffer capacity may also show seasonality which needs further study this study emphasized the importance of investigating the hr in shallow soils during random droughts in the summer rainy season in humid areas and also tried to incorporate the root soil interaction effects into the characterization of soil moisture status and associated water retention storage the study s results can broaden our knowledge of hr in humid areas and enhance our understanding of ecosystem water budgets balances hydrological variability and even climate change across multiple spatial scales under similar conditions brooks et al 2002 david et al 2013 dawson 1993 fu et al 2018 luo et al 2016 tang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016b moreover long term and high frequency soil moisture monitoring are important to further obtain an in depth understanding of the seasonality of hr and its influence on buffer capacity water conservation 5 conclusion this study investigated the soil moisture variations hydraulic redistribution and water buffer through soil moisture monitoring at multiple depths during a typical short term drought in the summer rainy season in forest and orchard lands in a subtropical area the orchard sites had more total daily water use than forest site together with evident clustering characteristics of total daily water use the results suggested the integral role of root soil in total daily water use especially in contrast to net daily water use the depth averaged magnitude of daily hr varied from 0 385 mm 0 0077 m3 m 3 to 0 725 mm 0 0145 m3 m 3 the wide occurrence of hr reveals that the hr is an important hydrological process activated in response to short term droughts during the summer rainy season in humid areas not only in traditionally recognized water deficit areas redistributed water replenished over 75 of the total daily water use from the shallow soils at the studied sites this study revealed that hydraulically redistributed water has a significant effect on water recharge especially in the 15 20 cm root zone and thus may have potential benefits for plants drought tolerance and water utilization this study provides more insights into hr and its effect on water retention during random droughts in the summer rainy season in humid areas acknowledgements this work
