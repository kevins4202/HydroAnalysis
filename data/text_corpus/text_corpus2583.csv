12915,norfloxacin a third generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic is increasingly used in the treatment of human and animal diseases and being frequently detected in the environment norfloxacin has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity so few bacteria can degrade norfloxacin effectively this is the first report on norfloxacin biodegradation by aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 response surface methodology was employed to optimize the bacterial growth and degradation of norfloxacin of strain n215 1 in flask scale the maximum yield of 0 31 in od60f0 and 25 0 in degradation efficiency in 24 h were obtained when using rsm optimized medium which improved strain growth and degradation by 3 88 and 5 68 fold respectively the kinetic analysis indicated that strain n215 1 could grow with the maximum specific growth rate inhibit constant ki and semi saturation ks constant of 0 2640 h 23 9909 mg l and 1 9817 mg l respectively furthermore the optimized medium was applied in an 85 l modified aao reactor with 2 n215 1 bioaugmentation an increased norfloxacin removal rate from 56 0 to 81 2 was achieved this study highlights a significant potential of using microbial co metabolic culture for microbial remedied of norfloxacin contaminated environments graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 norfloxacin degradation culturing condition response surface methodology inhibition kinetics 1 introduction norfloxacin a third generation broad spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic has been widely and increasingly used to prevent and treat human and animal bacterial infections 1 3 generally norfloxacin is difficult to be absorbed and utilized by human and animal and more than 60 of norfloxacin is eventually excreted into the environment especially in the water environment 4 the concentration of norfloxacin detected in the groundwater surface water pharmaceutical wastewater hospital wastewater and aquaculture wastewater range from several hundred to several thousand μg l 5 8 as one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in wastewater norfloxacin has potential harm to aquatic environment such as biological toxicity transmission of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistance genes its removal becomes an issue of widespread concern and has necessitated the need of effective methods for their elimination from contaminated water 1 9 physical chemical and microbial processes are the main methods used for norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment 10 12 among these processes microbial treatment process is an efficient green method in which microbial metabolism is used to environmentally eliminate pollutants 11 13 generally biodegradation of antibiotics is realized through two mechanisms catabolism and co metabolism 14 15 catabolism includes pure microbial isolates or mixed microorganisms that can utilize specific antibiotics as the sole carbon source 15 16 previously a number of microorganisms that are capable to catabolize norfloxacin have been isolated including strain of labrys portuchlense 17 microbacterium 18 escherichia coli 19 staphylococcus aureus 20 acinetobacter oleivorans 21 however the decontamination efficiencies of these bacteria are quite low co metabolism enables the transformation of non growth substrate with suitable growth substrates which provide the energy and or cofactors needed for supporting cell growth and induce exogenous transformation thereby ensuring the conversion rate of the refractory substances 14 22 microbial co metabolism is widely applied in various refractory pollutants removal because of its high metabolic conversion efficiency while requirements for widely available inexpensive primary growing substrate 23 24 however there are few studies on the co metabolic degradation of norfloxacin and only studies used piperazines an intermediate in norfloxacin production as a co metabolic substrate dae wi kim et al 25 isolated a microbacterium sp norfloxacin degrading strain which could defluorinate and hydroxylate norfloxacin in n phenylpiperazine containing co metabolic medium piperazine was used as co metabolic substrate and the maximum norfloxacin degradation efficiency of 0 481 mg l d was achieved by staphylococcus caprae sp nor 36 26 due to the biotoxicity and biodegradability of piperazines the co metabolism based on piperazine did not significantly improve the metabolic efficiency of norfloxacin and its induction also increased the risk of secondary pollution in natural environment norfloxacin is generally coexists with conventional pollutants and easily degradable substrate as co metabolic substrates may play an important role in norfloxacin biodegradation process in most case hence it is necessary to isolate a new bacterium which can effectively degrade norfloxacin in the coexistence of conventional carbon source as co metabolic substrates moreover while many studies illustrate norfloxacin degradation microorganisms in pure culture validation is absent to indicate that these microorganisms are capable to strengthen norfloxacin biodegradation in complex microbial communities such capability has practical significances and application for bioaugmentation bioremediation strategies in norfloxacin contaminated environment in the present study the optimal culturing conditions for microbial growth and norfloxacin degradation were examined by rsm based on box behnken design bbd the inhibition kinetics of norfloxacin on stain growth and norfloxacin degradation in the presence of soluble starch as the co metabolic substrate was also investigated finally the norfloxacin degradation strain n215 1 was used to validate the capability of the strain to enhance the degradation of norfloxacin containing wastewater and verify the capability of the strain to promote the biodegradation of norfloxacin in complex microbial communities which has practical significance for the bioremediation of norfloxacin contaminated waste sites our findings establish the biodegradation of norfloxacin though co metabolism which is great significance for wastewater treatment or environmental bioremediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 strain isolation and characterization active sludge obtained from a long running laboratory a o mbr for multi antibiotics containing wastewater treatment was used as the initial inoculant the activated sludge diluent 5 ml of the 1 1000 dilution was added into 250 ml norfloxacin selection medium nsm text s1 the enrichment was cultivated at 25 c and 125 rpm for 168 h and then repeated the above steps for three times the final culture 100 μl of 1 1000 dilution was plated on agar plates containing 20 mg l norfloxacin for separation of single colony the selection bacterial colonies were purified and their potential for norfloxacin degrading was compared table s1 an isolate named n215 1 showed highest biodegradability to norfloxacin was selected for further study strain n215 1 was identified according to the sequence analysis of 16s rrna gene and bergey s manual of determinative bacteriology 27 genomic dna was extracted from n215 1 using a dna extraction kit omega usa according to the manufacturer s instructions pcr amplification and sequence were performed by sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china the sequence was compared with the sequence in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database using the basic local alignment search tool blast program alignment of 16s rrna gene sequences was performed using clustalx 1 8 3 with the default settings phylogenesis trees were built by the neighbor joining method in mega version 5 1 23 2 2 experimental design for single factor experiments the effects of three variates temperature ph and c n ratio on stain growth and norfloxacin degradation were initially determined through single factor experiments the three variates were arranged as temperature 10 20 30 and 40 c ph 5 6 7 and 8 and c n ratio 2 0 3 5 5 0 when one condition was changed the other two remained constant the culturing solution consisted of 50 ml mineral salt medium msm test s1 20 mg l norfloxacin nh4 2so4 and soluble starch where nh4 2so4 and soluble starch was used to regulate c n ratio 1 m l hcl and naoh were used to regulate ph the solutions were inoculated with 1 v v culture and incubated at 125 rpm for 16 h in a temperature controlled shaker all experiments were performed in triplicate to calculate mean values and standard deviations 2 3 optimization of strain growth and norfloxacin degradation conditions the specific ranges based on the preliminary single factor experiments were used as reference levels in addition the optimum conditions of temperature ph and c n ratio were further studied by rsm to this end a fifteen run bbd experiments were performed in triplicate to minimize the unexplained variability and systematic errors the experimental data were analyzed by a second order polynomial equation text s2 design expert 7 0 version 10 0 1 stat ease inc minneapolis usa was used for graphical and regression analyses as well as analysis of variance anova the response surface was plotted as a function of two independent variables while the third variable remained unchanged and equal to its average to verify the predicted values experiments under the optimal condition of temperature ph and c n ratio was carried out 2 4 degradation and inhibition kinetics assays degradation kinetics experiment of strain n215 1 was also performed under the optimal degradation conditions the co metabolic substrate containing 5 mg l norfloxacin was inoculated with 0 1 enriched culture od600 0 983 and cultivated in the shaking incubator for 116 h all experiments were performed in triplicate inhibition kinetics experiments with different initial norfloxacin concentrations 5 10 20 30 50 70 90 110 130 mg l on bacterial growth of n215 1 were carried out under the optimal condition as described below no norfloxacin cultures were served as the control the bacterial growth of n215 1 was determined by monitoring the optical density at 600 nm od600 value using bioscreen c automated growth curves analysis system fp 6500 jasco japan 2 5 bioaugmentation experiments the bioaugmentation experiments were performed in flask scale and bench scale respectively the flask scale bioaugmentation experiment was conducted into three groups in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks to verify the feasibility of using strain n215 1 for enhanced degradation of norfloxacin containing wastewater group i 150 ml norfloxacin containing wastewater 0 6 g mlss dead sludge activated sludge after sterilization for 30 min 2 strain n215 1 od600 0 98 volume ratio group ii 150 ml norfloxacin containing wastewater 0 6 g mlss activated sludge 2 strain n215 1 od600 0 98 volume ratio group iii 150 ml norfloxacin containing wastewater 2 strain n215 1 od600 0 98 volume ratio each treatment was carried out in triplicate the bench scale bioaugmentation experiment was conducted in a modified aao reactor with a total volume of 85 l fig s1 which consisted of a 10 l anaerobic tank a 10 l anoxic tank a 32 l baffled aerobic tank a 16 5 l sludge filter of and a 16 5 l sludge concentration tank the sludge filter tank and the sludge concentration tank were used to effectively retain the sludge and prevent the loss of strain n215 1 bioaugmentation effects of n215 1 on norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment were assessed by comparing the performance in two stages stage i 0 27 days with no n215 1 addition stage ii 28 62 days during which 2 of strain n215 1 od600 0 98 volume ratio was added into the reactor the sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor were 11 d and 111 h respectively experimental water was local domestic sewage and the concentrations of cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp nh4 n and norfloxacin in the water were control in ranges of 280 430 mg l 53 80 mg l 4 3 5 8 mg l 38 67 mg l and 2 5 3 2 mg l respectively with tap water and norfloxacin 2 6 analytical methods the cod nh4 n tn and tp concentrations were determined by standard methods 28 norfloxacin was determined using the high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu japan equipped with an eelipsexdb c18 column agilent usa and a uv detector at 20 nm wavelength the mobile phase was a mixture of 0 1 methane acid water and methanol 65 35 v v with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the sample was injected at a constant injection volume of 20 ml and the norfloxacin concentration was calculated by comparing with the calibration curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 strain isolation and identification a norfloxacin degradation designed as n215 1 was isolated for further study strain n215 1 was a gram negative long rod bacterium without flagella and spores the length of n215 1 was 2 35 μm under atomic force microscope afm fig s2 the colonies grown on the selection agar plate were ivory smooth surface neat edge and convex in the middle fig s3 the 16s rdna gene sequences exhibited high similarity with the member of aeromonas hydrophila genus and had a maximum sequence identity with aeromonas hydrophila sp atcc7966 98 fig s4 the sequence of strain n215 1 was submitted to ncbi database under accession number mh298219 as is known there is no strain from aeromonas hydrophila genus reported to be capable to degrade norfloxacin the co metabolism of norfloxacin in the coexistence of soluble starch as conventional carbon source by aeromonas hydrophila sp is investigated in this research for the first time aeromonas hydrophila sp is widely distributed in antibiotics contaminated environment and has been applied in bioremediation processes vivekanandhan et al 29 isolated 319 strains of aeromonas hydrophila from 536 fish and 278 shrimp and the resistance rate to methicillin and rifampicin was 100 it has been reported that aeromonas hydrophila ae036 chromosome carries cpha gene responsible for degradation of carbapenem antibiotics 30 aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 has potential for norfloxacin degradation and can be used as a model strain for studying inhibition kinetics 3 2 norfloxacin removal in batch experiments in order to verify whether norfloxacin could be co metabolized by the enriched strain n215 1 three batch experiments were conducted in different conditions in triplicate text 2 it can be seen from fig s5 in the inactivation control group 500 mg l nan3 was added into the substrate to inactivate the biological activity of strain n215 1 the average norfloxacin removal efficiency was 2 85 in the inactivation control theoretically the abiotic removal includes photolysis volatilization and adsorption the contribution of volatilization could be ignored due to the low henry s law constant of norfloxacin 8 70 10 19 atm m3 mol 31 the photolysis was circumvented since the experiments were conducted in the dark shaking incubator thus the 2 85 removal of norfloxacin was mainly caused by biomass adsorption in the non cometabolism control group 32 22 of norfloxacin was removed by the end of the experiment as no soluble starch and ammonium salt were added the strain could obtain the substrate from nowhere except for norfloxacin to support biological activities therefore all the 32 22 removal efficiency for norfloxacin was contributed by catabolism and biomass adsorption of strain n215 1 in the co metabolism group norfloxacin soluble starch and ammonium sulfate were added to the substrate with the initial c n ratio of 3 8 by the end of the experiment 77 40 of the norfloxacin was removed compared with the two control groups it is obvious that the co metabolism group had higher norfloxacin removal efficiency which was contributed mainly by co metabolism of strain n215 1 3 3 effect of different factors on strain growth and norfloxacin degradation single factor experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of three variates temperature ph and c n ratio on stain growth and norfloxacin degradation in flasks the effects of temperature on the strain growth and norfloxacin degradation of strain n215 1 are shown in fig 1 a both strain growth and norfloxacin degradation were improved at 20 and 30 c compared to those at 10 and 40 c it was due to that the functional enzymes involved in growth and metabolism are temperature dependent too low or too high temperature will suppress the functional enzymes activities 32 34 the result is consistent with most norfloxacin degradation strains 17 20 fig 1 b shows the strain growth and norfloxacin degradation of strain n215 1 at different initial ph strain n215 1 growth and norfloxacin degradation showed better performance at ph of 6 7 compared to those at ph of 5 and 8 ph is an important factor affecting the bacterial metabolism which can change the surface charge and permeability of bacterial membrane strain n215 1 showed better performance in strain growth and norfloxacin degradation in neutral environment which was consistent with most norfloxacin degradation bacteria 21 35 in co metabolism the induction of moderate growth substrate on non growth substrate metabolic enzymes can effectively improve microbial biomass and its metabolic activity to refractory pollutants however excessive growth substrate plays a competitive role with the non growth substrate in the utilization of non specific degrading enzymes 36 a proper range of c n ratio plays an important role in the growth of strain and the utilization of functional enzymes 37 the effect of c n ratio on strain growth and norfloxacin degradation of strain n215 1 is shown in fig 1 c there were some differences under different c n ratios strain n215 1 exhibited better performance for strain growth and norfloxacin removal when the c n ratio was 3 5 1 therefore c n ratio of 3 5 was used in further study according to the single factor experiments the appropriate culturing conditions for the strain growth and norfloxacin degradation were obtained the temperature ranges from 20 to 30 c the initial ph was between 6 and 7 and the initial c n ratio was about 3 5 in order to get the best culturing conditions for strain growth and norfloxacin degradation of n215 1 the above three factors were further simulated and optimized by rsm 3 4 optimal culturing conditions for strain growth and norfloxacin degradation 3 4 1 optimal culturing condition for strain growth and its confirmation a three factor bbd with fifteen experimental runs was carried out table s2 to further optimize the strain growth table s3 shows the od600 values corresponding to combined effect of the three factors the fitting results of the second order response surface model of the anova are shown in table 1 the fittingness anova of rsm results indicated that the ph x2 significantly influenced od600 value p 0 0003 0 05 the temperature x1 and the c n ratios x3 had no significant influence on the strain growth p 0 05 but the square of the temperature x1 2 p 0 0363 0 05 ph x2 2 p 0 0014 0 05 and c n ratios x3 2 p 0 0029 0 05 were the influential ones therefore ph was the key factor influencing the strain growth of strain n215 1 even though temperature and c n ratio did not significantly influence the od600 values and norfloxacin degradation efficiencies they should not be ignored as their square values also had a significant effect on od600 values based on these data the second order polynomial equation eq 1 was established respectively to predict the strain growth and norfloxacin degradation using multiple regression analysis 1 y od 600 2 04 10 2 x 1 0 74 x 2 0 12 x 3 2 54 10 3 x 1 x 2 8 33 10 5 x 1 x 3 6 78 10 3 x 2 x 3 7 31 10 4 x 1 2 0 06 x 2 2 0 02 x 3 2 2 79 where yod600 is predicted od600 values x1 is temperature c x2 is ph x3 is c n ratio the anova of the quadratic regression model showed that the model has high significance as was evident from f test with a low p value 0 0029 0 01 the determination coefficient r2 0 9691 indicated the adequacy of model and 96 91 of the response variability could be attributed to the independent variables the adjusted determination coefficient adj r2 0 9134 was also high which again supported the significance of the model in general the quadratic model of od600 value fitted well and could be used to simulate and predict the strain growth to investigate the relationship among responses od600 values and the experimental variables x1 x3 by keeping one parameter constant and varying the other two parameters over experimental range 3d plots and the contour plots were analyzed fig 2 a c it can be seen when the culturing temperature was 26 2 c the initial ph was 7 0 and the initial c n ratio was 3 8 the theoretical optimal strain growth od600 values was 0 27 which could be used as the conditions for the rapid cultivation of strain n215 1 in order to further confirm the optimal culturing conditions for the growth of strain n215 1 the predicted optimal culturing parameters were applied to the culture of strain n215 1 and the od600 value was obtained as 0 31 the related error between the calculated od600 values and the predicted values was 12 90 this indicated that the predicted od600 value was close to the actual value therefore the obtained culturing conditions were reliable for the cultivation of the strain n215 3 4 2 optimal culturing condition for norfloxacin degradation and its confirmation the suitable culturing condition for norfloxacin degradation obtained by single factor experiments were similar to the strain growth conditions temperature 20 to 30 c initial ph 6 to 7 initial c n ratio 2 5 to 5 5 therefore the degradation norfloxacin by strain n215 1 were carried out under the same bbd conditions and the norfloxacin degradation efficiencies corresponding to combined effect of the three factors are shown in table s3 the fitting of anova indicated that the initial ph x2 significantly affected the norfloxacin biodegradation effects of the temperature x1 p 0 9103 0 05 and the initial c n ratio x3 p 0 0566 0 05 was not significant related to the norfloxacin biodegradation but the square of the temperature x1 2 p 0 0220 0 05 the initial ph x2 2 p 0 0021 0 05 and the initial c n ratio x3 2 p 0 00259 0 05 had highly significance with norfloxacin biodegradation the multiple regression analysis was used to predict the experimental results as eq 2 2 y nde 3 29 x 1 65 93 x 2 12 33 x 3 0 27 x 1 x 2 0 15 x 1 x 3 0 88 x 2 x 3 0 08 x 1 2 5 43 x 2 2 1 90 x 3 2 276 54 where ynde is predicted norfloxacin degradation efficiencies x1 is temperature c x2 is ph x3 is c n ratio the model has high significance as was seen from f test with a low p value of 0 0029 0 01 the p value of the fitting module p 0 0029 0 01 lack of fit p 0 5483 0 05 r2 0 9689 and adj r2 0 9130 indicated that the obtained fitting model eq 2 was suitable to represent the relationship between the norfloxacin biodegradation and the culturing condition the changes of the norfloxacin degradation are visualized in the response surfaces fig 3 a c it can be seen when the temperature was 26 5 c the initial ph was 7 0 and the initial c n ratio was 3 8 the theoretical optimal degradation efficiency of norfloxacin was 23 8 in order to further verify the optimal conditions for strain n215 1 to degrade norfloxacin the predicted optimal culturing parameters were applied to the culture of strain n215 1 and the degradation efficiency of norfloxacin in 24 h was 25 0 the relative error between the calculated norfloxacin degradation efficiency and the predicted norfloxacin degradation efficiency was 12 41 it indicated that the predicted degradation efficiency of norfloxacin was close to the actual value therefore the obtained culturing conditions were reliable for strain n215 1 to biodegrade norfloxacin this condition was similar to the optimal growth conditions of the strain 3 5 degradation and inhibition kinetics of strain n215 1 3 5 1 degradation kinetics of norfloxacin by strain n215 1 aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 efficiently utilized the norfloxacin as the growth substrate as shown in fig 4a degradation started rapidly at the beginning of incubation apparently there was no lag phase after 116 h incubation 77 5 norfloxacin was degraded to confirm the effects on degradation of norfloxacin by strain n215 1 the biodegradation process was fitted to a first order kinetic model the norfloxacin degradation by strain n215 1 followed the algorithm ct 4 99822 exp 0 01374 t fig 4a where ct is the amount of substrate mg l at time t h the coefficient of determination r2 0 9963 was established to be 0 9963 indicating the experimental data are well correlated with the model the half life t1 2 of norfloxacin degradation by strain n215 1 was 50 6 h there are some earlier reports on the norfloxacin biodegradation under different conditions and the reported t1 2 for norfloxacin in water varied from hundreds to thousands hours 17 the t1 2 for norfloxacin degradation of by labrys portucalensis f11 under an initial concentration of 30 μm was 34 7 days 17 staphylococcus caprae nor 36 was able to degrade nearly 50 of 5 mg l of norfloxacin only after 5 days of incubation 26 in constant the t1 2 of n215 1 was drastically shortened demonstrating that n215 1 is suitable for rapid and efficient bioremediation of norfloxacin contaminated environments 3 5 2 inhibition kinetics of norfloxacin on the strain growth as is known the degradation of toxic compounds via co metabolism pathway necessitates the need of suitable growth substrates which act as sources of carbon and energy 14 26 understanding the substrate inhibition kinetics of norfloxacin on strain growth is significant to bioaugmentation and bioremediation of norfloxacin biodegradation by strain n215 1 in order to explore the effect of norfloxacin concentration on strain growth strain n215 1 was cultured under norfloxacin concentration ranging from 0 to 130 mg l as shown in fig s6 strain n215 1 could survive with norfloxacin up to as high as 130 mg l the lag phase was extended at higher norfloxacin concentrations the maximum growth rates were close to the control group 0 081 h at no norfloxacin addition of 0 092 0 077 0 076 and 0 083 h at norfloxacin concentration of 5 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively however the growth rate was inhibited at higher concentration and the growth rate was only 0 09 h when norfloxacin was 130 mg l the decrease in growth rate of strain n215 1 with an increase in the initial norfloxacin concentration indicated that norfloxacin might act as an inhibitor to the co metabolism of norfloxacin by strain n215 1 when norfloxacin exceeded 30 mg l therefore the substrate inhibition model adapted from luong 38 was used to explain the inhibition kinetics on the growth of n215 1 by norfloxacin co metabolism as shown in eq 3 3 μ μ max s s k s s 2 k i where μ h is the specific growth rate μmax h is the maximum specific growth rate ki mg l is the substrate inhibition constant ks mg l is the semi saturation constant s mg l is the norfloxacin concentration and sm mg l is a critical norfloxacin concentration corresponding a turning point of specific growth rate the relationship between the specific growth rate and initial norfloxacin concentration is shown in fig 4 b the kinetics parameters μmax ks and ki were estimated with the non linear regression analysis to be 0 2640 h 1 9817 mg l and 23 9909 mg l respectively the critical inhibitor concentration sm was established to be 6 90 mg l the r2 was 0 9745 which indicated the experimental data have good correlation with the model as indicated in fig 4 a when norfloxacin concentration was lower than 6 90 mg l the specific growth rate increased gradually with the increase of norfloxacin concentration norfloxacin at low concentrations could act as growth substrate to provide energy and or cofactors for strain n215 1 to induce exogenous conversion and support cell growth at higher concentrations inhibition by norfloxacin was substantial and the specific growth rate value decreased proportionally in dose dependent manner to our knowledge our study on the norfloxacin inhibition kinetics is first report 39 it has been proved that growth activity of strain n215 1 could be accelerated at low norfloxacin concentration compared to the control group without norfloxacin addition at low norfloxacin concentration which is undoubtedly beneficial to minimize the norfloxacin pollution and provides another direction for microbial remediation and bioaugmentation 3 6 bioaugmentation for norfloxacin containing wastewater using n215 1 the concentration of norfloxacin in the influent was 2 5 2 8 mg l which was below the established sm value in the inhibition kinetics experiment the removal of norfloxacin in the flask scale experiment is shown in fig s7 the norfloxacin removal efficiency of the original activated sludge group i was limited due to the lack of efficient norfloxacin degrading bacteria when train n215 1 was added group ii and iii the norfloxacin degradation efficiency was remarkably enhanced the results demonstrated that strain n215 1 can be used as bioaugmentation strain to enhance the norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment to further verify the feasibility and long term bioaugmentation stability of strain n215 1 on norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment the bench scale bioaugmentation experiment was performed in an 85 l modified aao reactor after 62 days of experiment bioaugmentation performance using n215 1 on norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment was shown in fig s8 and table 2 in stage i the concentration of norfloxacin in the effluent was 1 27 0 15 mg l and the average removal rate of norfloxacin reached 56 0 after adding n215 1 the degradation of norfloxacin was significantly improved the residual norfloxacin in the effluent decreased to 0 54 0 10 mg l with an increased removal efficiency of 81 2 p 2 72 10 14 0 01 indicating the overall degradation of norfloxacin which was attributed to the combination of hydrolysis and biodegradation showed an overall increase with the inoculum of strain n215 1 meanwhile the effluent concentrations of cod tn and tp were 40 40 5 93 14 92 0 80 and 0 48 0 05 mg l respectively in stage i and 33 37 3 69 14 6 0 99 and 0 49 0 05 mg l in stage ii there was no significant difference in the removal of cod tn and tp between stage i and stage ii overall the addition of strain n215 1 can strengthen the reduction of norfloxacin but not affect the removal of conventional pollutants the results indicated that strain n215 1 could stably and efficiently enhance norfloxacin biodegradation in norfloxacin containing wastewater the removal of cod tn and tp were stable as well therefore our data indicate potential benefits of using strain n215 1 as a bioaugmentation agent in wastewater treatment process to enhance the pollutant removal capacity under a typical operation condition the technical feasibility of applying strain n215 1 for norfloxacin in this study indicates that maintenance and population dynamics of strain n215 1 and environmental operational factors that affect norfloxacin bioremediation performances will be tested in pilot and full scale wastewater treatment systems in future 4 conclusions a new bacterium aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 was isolated and characterized in this study which could biodegrade norfloxacin though co metabolism additionally rsm was well exercised in obtained the optimal media for strain growth and norfloxacin degradation the optimal conditions were 26 2 26 5 c ph 7 0 and c n ratio 3 5 furthermore to largely enhance and accelerate the norfloxacin degradation the inhibition kinetics was firstly investigated finally bioaugmentation of 2 n215 1 for norfloxacin containing wastewater significantly increased norfloxacin removal rates at an environmentally relevant level these findings will deepen our understanding of the degradation of norfloxacin and provide a useful way to alleviate or eliminate the norfloxacin pollution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12915,norfloxacin a third generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic is increasingly used in the treatment of human and animal diseases and being frequently detected in the environment norfloxacin has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity so few bacteria can degrade norfloxacin effectively this is the first report on norfloxacin biodegradation by aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 response surface methodology was employed to optimize the bacterial growth and degradation of norfloxacin of strain n215 1 in flask scale the maximum yield of 0 31 in od60f0 and 25 0 in degradation efficiency in 24 h were obtained when using rsm optimized medium which improved strain growth and degradation by 3 88 and 5 68 fold respectively the kinetic analysis indicated that strain n215 1 could grow with the maximum specific growth rate inhibit constant ki and semi saturation ks constant of 0 2640 h 23 9909 mg l and 1 9817 mg l respectively furthermore the optimized medium was applied in an 85 l modified aao reactor with 2 n215 1 bioaugmentation an increased norfloxacin removal rate from 56 0 to 81 2 was achieved this study highlights a significant potential of using microbial co metabolic culture for microbial remedied of norfloxacin contaminated environments graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 norfloxacin degradation culturing condition response surface

water 1 9 physical chemical and microbial processes are the main methods used for norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment 10 12 among these processes microbial treatment process is an efficient green method in which microbial metabolism is used to environmentally eliminate pollutants 11 13 generally biodegradation of antibiotics is realized through two mechanisms catabolism and co metabolism 14 15 catabolism includes pure microbial isolates or mixed microorganisms that can utilize specific antibiotics as the sole carbon source 15 16 previously a number of microorganisms that are capable to catabolize norfloxacin have been isolated including strain of labrys portuchlense 17 microbacterium 18 escherichia coli 19 staphylococcus aureus 20 acinetobacter oleivorans 21 however the decontamination efficiencies of these bacteria are quite low co metabolism enables the transformation of non growth substrate with suitable growth substrates which provide the energy and or cofactors needed for supporting cell growth and induce exogenous transformation thereby ensuring the conversion rate of the refractory substances 14 22 microbial co metabolism is widely applied in various refractory pollutants removal because of its high metabolic conversion efficiency while requirements for widely available inexpensive primary growing substrate 23 24 however there are few studies on the co metabolic degradation of norfloxacin and only studies used piperazines an intermediate in norfloxacin production as a co metabolic substrate dae wi kim et al 25 isolated a microbacterium sp norfloxacin degrading strain which could defluorinate and hydroxylate norfloxacin in n phenylpiperazine containing co metabolic medium piperazine was used as co metabolic substrate and the maximum norfloxacin degradation efficiency of 0 481 mg l d was achieved by staphylococcus caprae sp nor 36 26 due to the biotoxicity and biodegradability of piperazines the co metabolism based on piperazine did not significantly improve the metabolic efficiency of norfloxacin and its induction also increased the risk of secondary pollution in natural environment norfloxacin is generally coexists with conventional pollutants and easily degradable substrate as co metabolic substrates may play an important role in norfloxacin biodegradation process in most case hence it is necessary to isolate a new bacterium which can effectively degrade norfloxacin in the coexistence of conventional carbon source as co metabolic substrates moreover while many studies illustrate norfloxacin degradation microorganisms in pure culture validation is absent to indicate that these microorganisms are capable to strengthen norfloxacin biodegradation in complex microbial communities such capability has practical significances and application for bioaugmentation bioremediation strategies in norfloxacin contaminated environment in the present study the optimal culturing conditions for microbial growth and norfloxacin degradation were examined by rsm based on box behnken design bbd the inhibition kinetics of norfloxacin on stain growth and norfloxacin degradation in the presence of soluble starch as the co metabolic substrate was also investigated finally the norfloxacin degradation strain n215 1 was used to validate the capability of the strain to enhance the degradation of norfloxacin containing wastewater and verify the capability of the strain to promote the biodegradation of norfloxacin in complex microbial communities which has practical significance for the bioremediation of norfloxacin contaminated waste sites our findings establish the biodegradation of norfloxacin though co metabolism which is great significance for wastewater treatment or environmental bioremediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 strain isolation and characterization active sludge obtained from a long running laboratory a o mbr for multi antibiotics containing wastewater treatment was used as the initial inoculant the activated sludge diluent 5 ml of the 1 1000 dilution was added into 250 ml norfloxacin selection medium nsm text s1 the enrichment was cultivated at 25 c and 125 rpm for 168 h and then repeated the above steps for three times the final culture 100 μl of 1 1000 dilution was plated on agar plates containing 20 mg l norfloxacin for separation of single colony the selection bacterial colonies were purified and their potential for norfloxacin degrading was compared table s1 an isolate named n215 1 showed highest biodegradability to norfloxacin was selected for further study strain n215 1 was identified according to the sequence analysis of 16s rrna gene and bergey s manual of determinative bacteriology 27 genomic dna was extracted from n215 1 using a dna extraction kit omega usa according to the manufacturer s instructions pcr amplification and sequence were performed by sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china the sequence was compared with the sequence in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database using the basic local alignment search tool blast program alignment of 16s rrna gene sequences was performed using clustalx 1 8 3 with the default settings phylogenesis trees were built by the neighbor joining method in mega version 5 1 23 2 2 experimental design for single factor experiments the effects of three variates temperature ph and c n ratio on stain growth and norfloxacin degradation were initially determined through single factor experiments the three variates were arranged as temperature 10 20 30 and 40 c ph 5 6 7 and 8 and c n ratio 2 0 3 5 5 0 when one condition was changed the other two remained constant the culturing solution consisted of 50 ml mineral salt medium msm test s1 20 mg l norfloxacin nh4 2so4 and soluble starch where nh4 2so4 and soluble starch was used to regulate c n ratio 1 m l hcl and naoh were used to regulate ph the solutions were inoculated with 1 v v culture and incubated at 125 rpm for 16 h in a temperature controlled shaker all experiments were performed in triplicate to calculate mean values and standard deviations 2 3 optimization of strain growth and norfloxacin degradation conditions the specific ranges based on the preliminary single factor experiments were used as reference levels in addition the optimum conditions of temperature ph and c n ratio were further studied by rsm to this end a fifteen run bbd experiments were performed in triplicate to minimize the unexplained variability and systematic errors the experimental data were analyzed by a second order polynomial equation text s2 design expert 7 0 version 10 0 1 stat ease inc minneapolis usa was used for graphical and regression analyses as well as analysis of variance anova the response surface was plotted as a function of two independent variables while the third variable remained unchanged and equal to its average to verify the predicted values experiments under the optimal condition of temperature ph and c n ratio was carried out 2 4 degradation and inhibition kinetics assays degradation kinetics experiment of strain n215 1 was also performed under the optimal degradation conditions the co metabolic substrate containing 5 mg l norfloxacin was inoculated with 0 1 enriched culture od600 0 983 and cultivated in the shaking incubator for 116 h all experiments were performed in triplicate inhibition kinetics experiments with different initial norfloxacin concentrations 5 10 20 30 50 70 90 110 130 mg l on bacterial growth of n215 1 were carried out under the optimal condition as described below no norfloxacin cultures were served as the control the bacterial growth of n215 1 was determined by monitoring the optical density at 600 nm od600 value using bioscreen c automated growth curves analysis system fp 6500 jasco japan 2 5 bioaugmentation experiments the bioaugmentation experiments were performed in flask scale and bench scale respectively the flask scale bioaugmentation experiment was conducted into three groups in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks to verify the feasibility of using strain n215 1 for enhanced degradation of norfloxacin containing wastewater group i 150 ml norfloxacin containing wastewater 0 6 g mlss dead sludge activated sludge after sterilization for 30 min 2 strain n215 1 od600 0 98 volume ratio group ii 150 ml norfloxacin containing wastewater 0 6 g mlss activated sludge 2 strain n215 1 od600 0 98 volume ratio group iii 150 ml norfloxacin containing wastewater 2 strain n215 1 od600 0 98 volume ratio each treatment was carried out in triplicate the bench scale bioaugmentation experiment was conducted in a modified aao reactor with a total volume of 85 l fig s1 which consisted of a 10 l anaerobic tank a 10 l anoxic tank a 32 l baffled aerobic tank a 16 5 l sludge filter of and a 16 5 l sludge concentration tank the sludge filter tank and the sludge concentration tank were used to effectively retain the sludge and prevent the loss of strain n215 1 bioaugmentation effects of n215 1 on norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment were assessed by comparing the performance in two stages stage i 0 27 days with no n215 1 addition stage ii 28 62 days during which 2 of strain n215 1 od600 0 98 volume ratio was added into the reactor the sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor were 11 d and 111 h respectively experimental water was local domestic sewage and the concentrations of cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp nh4 n and norfloxacin in the water were control in ranges of 280 430 mg l 53 80 mg l 4 3 5 8 mg l 38 67 mg l and 2 5 3 2 mg l respectively with tap water and norfloxacin 2 6 analytical methods the cod nh4 n tn and tp concentrations were determined by standard methods 28 norfloxacin was determined using the high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu japan equipped with an eelipsexdb c18 column agilent usa and a uv detector at 20 nm wavelength the mobile phase was a mixture of 0 1 methane acid water and methanol 65 35 v v with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the sample was injected at a constant injection volume of 20 ml and the norfloxacin concentration was calculated by comparing with the calibration curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 strain isolation and identification a norfloxacin degradation designed as n215 1 was isolated for further study strain n215 1 was a gram negative long rod bacterium without flagella and spores the length of n215 1 was 2 35 μm under atomic force microscope afm fig s2 the colonies grown on the selection agar plate were ivory smooth surface neat edge and convex in the middle fig s3 the 16s rdna gene sequences exhibited high similarity with the member of aeromonas hydrophila genus and had a maximum sequence identity with aeromonas hydrophila sp atcc7966 98 fig s4 the sequence of strain n215 1 was submitted to ncbi database under accession number mh298219 as is known there is no strain from aeromonas hydrophila genus reported to be capable to degrade norfloxacin the co metabolism of norfloxacin in the coexistence of soluble starch as conventional carbon source by aeromonas hydrophila sp is investigated in this research for the first time aeromonas hydrophila sp is widely distributed in antibiotics contaminated environment and has been applied in bioremediation processes vivekanandhan et al 29 isolated 319 strains of aeromonas hydrophila from 536 fish and 278 shrimp and the resistance rate to methicillin and rifampicin was 100 it has been reported that aeromonas hydrophila ae036 chromosome carries cpha gene responsible for degradation of carbapenem antibiotics 30 aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 has potential for norfloxacin degradation and can be used as a model strain for studying inhibition kinetics 3 2 norfloxacin removal in batch experiments in order to verify whether norfloxacin could be co metabolized by the enriched strain n215 1 three batch experiments were conducted in different conditions in triplicate text 2 it can be seen from fig s5 in the inactivation control group 500 mg l nan3 was added into the substrate to inactivate the biological activity of strain n215 1 the average norfloxacin removal efficiency was 2 85 in the inactivation control theoretically the abiotic removal includes photolysis volatilization and adsorption the contribution of volatilization could be ignored due to the low henry s law constant of norfloxacin 8 70 10 19 atm m3 mol 31 the photolysis was circumvented since the experiments were conducted in the dark shaking incubator thus the 2 85 removal of norfloxacin was mainly caused by biomass adsorption in the non cometabolism control group 32 22 of norfloxacin was removed by the end of the experiment as no soluble starch and ammonium salt were added the strain could obtain the substrate from nowhere except for norfloxacin to support biological activities therefore all the 32 22 removal efficiency for norfloxacin was contributed by catabolism and biomass adsorption of strain n215 1 in the co metabolism group norfloxacin soluble starch and ammonium sulfate were added to the substrate with the initial c n ratio of 3 8 by the end of the experiment 77 40 of the norfloxacin was removed compared with the two control groups it is obvious that the co metabolism group had higher norfloxacin removal efficiency which was contributed mainly by co metabolism of strain n215 1 3 3 effect of different factors on strain growth and norfloxacin degradation single factor experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of three variates temperature ph and c n ratio on stain growth and norfloxacin degradation in flasks the effects of temperature on the strain growth and norfloxacin degradation of strain n215 1 are shown in fig 1 a both strain growth and norfloxacin degradation were improved at 20 and 30 c compared to those at 10 and 40 c it was due to that the functional enzymes involved in growth and metabolism are temperature dependent too low or too high temperature will suppress the functional enzymes activities 32 34 the result is consistent with most norfloxacin degradation strains 17 20 fig 1 b shows the strain growth and norfloxacin degradation of strain n215 1 at different initial ph strain n215 1 growth and norfloxacin degradation showed better performance at ph of 6 7 compared to those at ph of 5 and 8 ph is an important factor affecting the bacterial metabolism which can change the surface charge and permeability of bacterial membrane strain n215 1 showed better performance in strain growth and norfloxacin degradation in neutral environment which was consistent with most norfloxacin degradation bacteria 21 35 in co metabolism the induction of moderate growth substrate on non growth substrate metabolic enzymes can effectively improve microbial biomass and its metabolic activity to refractory pollutants however excessive growth substrate plays a competitive role with the non growth substrate in the utilization of non specific degrading enzymes 36 a proper range of c n ratio plays an important role in the growth of strain and the utilization of functional enzymes 37 the effect of c n ratio on strain growth and norfloxacin degradation of strain n215 1 is shown in fig 1 c there were some differences under different c n ratios strain n215 1 exhibited better performance for strain growth and norfloxacin removal when the c n ratio was 3 5 1 therefore c n ratio of 3 5 was used in further study according to the single factor experiments the appropriate culturing conditions for the strain growth and norfloxacin degradation were obtained the temperature ranges from 20 to 30 c the initial ph was between 6 and 7 and the initial c n ratio was about 3 5 in order to get the best culturing conditions for strain growth and norfloxacin degradation of n215 1 the above three factors were further simulated and optimized by rsm 3 4 optimal culturing conditions for strain growth and norfloxacin degradation 3 4 1 optimal culturing condition for strain growth and its confirmation a three factor bbd with fifteen experimental runs was carried out table s2 to further optimize the strain growth table s3 shows the od600 values corresponding to combined effect of the three factors the fitting results of the second order response surface model of the anova are shown in table 1 the fittingness anova of rsm results indicated that the ph x2 significantly influenced od600 value p 0 0003 0 05 the temperature x1 and the c n ratios x3 had no significant influence on the strain growth p 0 05 but the square of the temperature x1 2 p 0 0363 0 05 ph x2 2 p 0 0014 0 05 and c n ratios x3 2 p 0 0029 0 05 were the influential ones therefore ph was the key factor influencing the strain growth of strain n215 1 even though temperature and c n ratio did not significantly influence the od600 values and norfloxacin degradation efficiencies they should not be ignored as their square values also had a significant effect on od600 values based on these data the second order polynomial equation eq 1 was established respectively to predict the strain growth and norfloxacin degradation using multiple regression analysis 1 y od 600 2 04 10 2 x 1 0 74 x 2 0 12 x 3 2 54 10 3 x 1 x 2 8 33 10 5 x 1 x 3 6 78 10 3 x 2 x 3 7 31 10 4 x 1 2 0 06 x 2 2 0 02 x 3 2 2 79 where yod600 is predicted od600 values x1 is temperature c x2 is ph x3 is c n ratio the anova of the quadratic regression model showed that the model has high significance as was evident from f test with a low p value 0 0029 0 01 the determination coefficient r2 0 9691 indicated the adequacy of model and 96 91 of the response variability could be attributed to the independent variables the adjusted determination coefficient adj r2 0 9134 was also high which again supported the significance of the model in general the quadratic model of od600 value fitted well and could be used to simulate and predict the strain growth to investigate the relationship among responses od600 values and the experimental variables x1 x3 by keeping one parameter constant and varying the other two parameters over experimental range 3d plots and the contour plots were analyzed fig 2 a c it can be seen when the culturing temperature was 26 2 c the initial ph was 7 0 and the initial c n ratio was 3 8 the theoretical optimal strain growth od600 values was 0 27 which could be used as the conditions for the rapid cultivation of strain n215 1 in order to further confirm the optimal culturing conditions for the growth of strain n215 1 the predicted optimal culturing parameters were applied to the culture of strain n215 1 and the od600 value was obtained as 0 31 the related error between the calculated od600 values and the predicted values was 12 90 this indicated that the predicted od600 value was close to the actual value therefore the obtained culturing conditions were reliable for the cultivation of the strain n215 3 4 2 optimal culturing condition for norfloxacin degradation and its confirmation the suitable culturing condition for norfloxacin degradation obtained by single factor experiments were similar to the strain growth conditions temperature 20 to 30 c initial ph 6 to 7 initial c n ratio 2 5 to 5 5 therefore the degradation norfloxacin by strain n215 1 were carried out under the same bbd conditions and the norfloxacin degradation efficiencies corresponding to combined effect of the three factors are shown in table s3 the fitting of anova indicated that the initial ph x2 significantly affected the norfloxacin biodegradation effects of the temperature x1 p 0 9103 0 05 and the initial c n ratio x3 p 0 0566 0 05 was not significant related to the norfloxacin biodegradation but the square of the temperature x1 2 p 0 0220 0 05 the initial ph x2 2 p 0 0021 0 05 and the initial c n ratio x3 2 p 0 00259 0 05 had highly significance with norfloxacin biodegradation the multiple regression analysis was used to predict the experimental results as eq 2 2 y nde 3 29 x 1 65 93 x 2 12 33 x 3 0 27 x 1 x 2 0 15 x 1 x 3 0 88 x 2 x 3 0 08 x 1 2 5 43 x 2 2 1 90 x 3 2 276 54 where ynde is predicted norfloxacin degradation efficiencies x1 is temperature c x2 is ph x3 is c n ratio the model has high significance as was seen from f test with a low p value of 0 0029 0 01 the p value of the fitting module p 0 0029 0 01 lack of fit p 0 5483 0 05 r2 0 9689 and adj r2 0 9130 indicated that the obtained fitting model eq 2 was suitable to represent the relationship between the norfloxacin biodegradation and the culturing condition the changes of the norfloxacin degradation are visualized in the response surfaces fig 3 a c it can be seen when the temperature was 26 5 c the initial ph was 7 0 and the initial c n ratio was 3 8 the theoretical optimal degradation efficiency of norfloxacin was 23 8 in order to further verify the optimal conditions for strain n215 1 to degrade norfloxacin the predicted optimal culturing parameters were applied to the culture of strain n215 1 and the degradation efficiency of norfloxacin in 24 h was 25 0 the relative error between the calculated norfloxacin degradation efficiency and the predicted norfloxacin degradation efficiency was 12 41 it indicated that the predicted degradation efficiency of norfloxacin was close to the actual value therefore the obtained culturing conditions were reliable for strain n215 1 to biodegrade norfloxacin this condition was similar to the optimal growth conditions of the strain 3 5 degradation and inhibition kinetics of strain n215 1 3 5 1 degradation kinetics of norfloxacin by strain n215 1 aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 efficiently utilized the norfloxacin as the growth substrate as shown in fig 4a degradation started rapidly at the beginning of incubation apparently there was no lag phase after 116 h incubation 77 5 norfloxacin was degraded to confirm the effects on degradation of norfloxacin by strain n215 1 the biodegradation process was fitted to a first order kinetic model the norfloxacin degradation by strain n215 1 followed the algorithm ct 4 99822 exp 0 01374 t fig 4a where ct is the amount of substrate mg l at time t h the coefficient of determination r2 0 9963 was established to be 0 9963 indicating the experimental data are well correlated with the model the half life t1 2 of norfloxacin degradation by strain n215 1 was 50 6 h there are some earlier reports on the norfloxacin biodegradation under different conditions and the reported t1 2 for norfloxacin in water varied from hundreds to thousands hours 17 the t1 2 for norfloxacin degradation of by labrys portucalensis f11 under an initial concentration of 30 μm was 34 7 days 17 staphylococcus caprae nor 36 was able to degrade nearly 50 of 5 mg l of norfloxacin only after 5 days of incubation 26 in constant the t1 2 of n215 1 was drastically shortened demonstrating that n215 1 is suitable for rapid and efficient bioremediation of norfloxacin contaminated environments 3 5 2 inhibition kinetics of norfloxacin on the strain growth as is known the degradation of toxic compounds via co metabolism pathway necessitates the need of suitable growth substrates which act as sources of carbon and energy 14 26 understanding the substrate inhibition kinetics of norfloxacin on strain growth is significant to bioaugmentation and bioremediation of norfloxacin biodegradation by strain n215 1 in order to explore the effect of norfloxacin concentration on strain growth strain n215 1 was cultured under norfloxacin concentration ranging from 0 to 130 mg l as shown in fig s6 strain n215 1 could survive with norfloxacin up to as high as 130 mg l the lag phase was extended at higher norfloxacin concentrations the maximum growth rates were close to the control group 0 081 h at no norfloxacin addition of 0 092 0 077 0 076 and 0 083 h at norfloxacin concentration of 5 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively however the growth rate was inhibited at higher concentration and the growth rate was only 0 09 h when norfloxacin was 130 mg l the decrease in growth rate of strain n215 1 with an increase in the initial norfloxacin concentration indicated that norfloxacin might act as an inhibitor to the co metabolism of norfloxacin by strain n215 1 when norfloxacin exceeded 30 mg l therefore the substrate inhibition model adapted from luong 38 was used to explain the inhibition kinetics on the growth of n215 1 by norfloxacin co metabolism as shown in eq 3 3 μ μ max s s k s s 2 k i where μ h is the specific growth rate μmax h is the maximum specific growth rate ki mg l is the substrate inhibition constant ks mg l is the semi saturation constant s mg l is the norfloxacin concentration and sm mg l is a critical norfloxacin concentration corresponding a turning point of specific growth rate the relationship between the specific growth rate and initial norfloxacin concentration is shown in fig 4 b the kinetics parameters μmax ks and ki were estimated with the non linear regression analysis to be 0 2640 h 1 9817 mg l and 23 9909 mg l respectively the critical inhibitor concentration sm was established to be 6 90 mg l the r2 was 0 9745 which indicated the experimental data have good correlation with the model as indicated in fig 4 a when norfloxacin concentration was lower than 6 90 mg l the specific growth rate increased gradually with the increase of norfloxacin concentration norfloxacin at low concentrations could act as growth substrate to provide energy and or cofactors for strain n215 1 to induce exogenous conversion and support cell growth at higher concentrations inhibition by norfloxacin was substantial and the specific growth rate value decreased proportionally in dose dependent manner to our knowledge our study on the norfloxacin inhibition kinetics is first report 39 it has been proved that growth activity of strain n215 1 could be accelerated at low norfloxacin concentration compared to the control group without norfloxacin addition at low norfloxacin concentration which is undoubtedly beneficial to minimize the norfloxacin pollution and provides another direction for microbial remediation and bioaugmentation 3 6 bioaugmentation for norfloxacin containing wastewater using n215 1 the concentration of norfloxacin in the influent was 2 5 2 8 mg l which was below the established sm value in the inhibition kinetics experiment the removal of norfloxacin in the flask scale experiment is shown in fig s7 the norfloxacin removal efficiency of the original activated sludge group i was limited due to the lack of efficient norfloxacin degrading bacteria when train n215 1 was added group ii and iii the norfloxacin degradation efficiency was remarkably enhanced the results demonstrated that strain n215 1 can be used as bioaugmentation strain to enhance the norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment to further verify the feasibility and long term bioaugmentation stability of strain n215 1 on norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment the bench scale bioaugmentation experiment was performed in an 85 l modified aao reactor after 62 days of experiment bioaugmentation performance using n215 1 on norfloxacin containing wastewater treatment was shown in fig s8 and table 2 in stage i the concentration of norfloxacin in the effluent was 1 27 0 15 mg l and the average removal rate of norfloxacin reached 56 0 after adding n215 1 the degradation of norfloxacin was significantly improved the residual norfloxacin in the effluent decreased to 0 54 0 10 mg l with an increased removal efficiency of 81 2 p 2 72 10 14 0 01 indicating the overall degradation of norfloxacin which was attributed to the combination of hydrolysis and biodegradation showed an overall increase with the inoculum of strain n215 1 meanwhile the effluent concentrations of cod tn and tp were 40 40 5 93 14 92 0 80 and 0 48 0 05 mg l respectively in stage i and 33 37 3 69 14 6 0 99 and 0 49 0 05 mg l in stage ii there was no significant difference in the removal of cod tn and tp between stage i and stage ii overall the addition of strain n215 1 can strengthen the reduction of norfloxacin but not affect the removal of conventional pollutants the results indicated that strain n215 1 could stably and efficiently enhance norfloxacin biodegradation in norfloxacin containing wastewater the removal of cod tn and tp were stable as well therefore our data indicate potential benefits of using strain n215 1 as a bioaugmentation agent in wastewater treatment process to enhance the pollutant removal capacity under a typical operation condition the technical feasibility of applying strain n215 1 for norfloxacin in this study indicates that maintenance and population dynamics of strain n215 1 and environmental operational factors that affect norfloxacin bioremediation performances will be tested in pilot and full scale wastewater treatment systems in future 4 conclusions a new bacterium aeromonas hydrophila sp n215 1 was isolated and characterized in this study which could biodegrade norfloxacin though co metabolism additionally rsm was well exercised in obtained the optimal media for strain growth and norfloxacin degradation the optimal conditions were 26 2 26 5 c ph 7 0 and c n ratio 3 5 furthermore to largely enhance and accelerate the norfloxacin degradation the inhibition kinetics was firstly investigated finally bioaugmentation of 2 n215 1 for norfloxacin containing wastewater significantly increased norfloxacin removal rates at an environmentally relevant level these findings will deepen

12916,anaerobic digestion can biotransform the biodegradable fraction of sewage sludge into biogas while the symbiotic action of algal bacterial consortia can remove both the co2 and h2s from biogas

removals of 48 20 were recorded in the digester the ch4 concentration in the biomethane gradually decreased to 87 6 2 0 and 85 1 1 3 at the end of stage i and ii respectively attributed to the loss of

microorganisms bioconvert the biodegradable fraction of wwtp sludge into a biogas mainly composed of ch4 and co2 and a nutrient rich effluent is also generated this process is carried out in four consecutive steps namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis in the absence of oxygen 3 4 the ad of mixed sludge minimizes wwtp costs as a result of the significant sludge volume reduction and electricity heat generation from biogas 1 the biogas generated from sewage sludge anaerobic digestion has been typically used for heat and or power chp generation since it contains high

kwh nm 3 and 0 15 0 2 nm 3 while the co2 separated from biogas is typically discarded to the atmosphere in recent years biotechnologies based on the symbiotic action of algal bacterial consortia have attracted an increasing attention as a result of their potential for co2 fixation in the form of biomass and their low operating costs and environmental impacts indeed the co2 present in biogas is bioassimilated by photosynthetic microorganisms microalgae and cyanobacteria by using solar radiation while sulfur oxidizing bacteria rapidly oxidize the h2s contained in biogas using the oxygen generated by photosynthetic activity algal bacterial photobioreactors have been effectively used for bioremediation purposes such as organic matter stabilization or nutrient removal from wastewaters in fact the n p and other trace elements present in the liquid fraction of digestates can be used as nutrient source to support the growth of microalgae and bacteria 7 10 thus centrates the liquid fraction of digestates obtained from the ad of mixed wwtp sludge represent an inexpensive cultivation broth for microalgae and sulfur oxidizing bacteria in this context photosynthetic biogas upgrading coupled with nutrient recovery from centrate has been validated under indoor and outdoor conditions in multiple photobioreactor configurations interconnected to external biogas scrubbing units where biogas was sparged into a recirculating algal cultivation broth to promote gas liquid mass transfer 11 14 nevertheless most of these works were conducted using synthetic biogas or mineral salt media mimicking digestates a recent techno economic analysis of this technology compared to an activated carbon filter coupled with a pressurized water scrubber showed a reduction in the electricity demand from 0 3 to 0 08 kwh nm 3 and a decrease in operating cost from 0 2 to 0 03 nm 3 15 this work aimed at validating for the first time the integration of wwtp sludge digestion with photosynthetic biogas upgrading at pilot scale under outdoor conditions in order to obtain biomethane and algal biomass as the main by products from mixed sludge stabilization the influence of photobioreactor operation inside a greenhouse and the ph and alkalinity of the centrate on the quality of biomethane was investigated under long term operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 inocula and feedstock the algal bacterial photobioreactor was inoculated with a microalgae cake containing 127 6 g total solids ts kg 1 and 64 6 g volatile solids vs kg 1 this inoculum was initially grown in mineral salt medium with a high carbonate content under outdoors conditions in a 270 m2 high rate algal pond hrap located at urbaser technological innovation center of zaragoza spain the microalgae population in the hrap was composed of chlorella sp 15 tetradesmus obliquus 33 lindavia sp 24 and synechococcus sp 28 percentages expressed in number of cells the mineral media used as a nutrient and water source for the cultivation of microalgae and bacteria in the photobioreactor was centrate daily obtained from the centrifugation 10 000 rpm for 5 min of the effluent from the pilot anaerobic digester treating mixed wwtp sludge centrate from the wwtp of valladolid was used to compensate the differences observed between centrifugation processes among laboratory scale and industrial scale the average composition of the centrate was total organic carbon toc concentration of 323 0 84 3 mg l 1 inorganic carbon ic concentration of 736 9 130 1 mg l 1 and total nitrogen tn concentration of 791 0 137 9 mg l 1 fresh anaerobic broth from the full scale digester of the wwtp located in the city of valladolid spain was herein used as inoculum of the pilot anaerobic digester the anaerobic inoculum exhibited a vs ts ratio of 66 mixed primary secondary sludge from valladolid wwtp was used as feedstock in the pilot anaerobic digester fresh mixed sludge was obtained every two weeks and stored at 4 c prior to use the mixed sludge presented an average total solid ts and volatile solid vs concentration of 34 5 10 0 and 22 3 6 1 g l 1 respectively and a chemical oxygen demand cod of 49 0 14 7 g o2 l 1 the variations observed in the sludge composition during the 8 month experimental period were ascribed to the typical fluctuations in real wwtp sludge 2 2 experimental set up the experimental pilot plant was located at the institute of sustainable processes of valladolid university spain under outdoors conditions the experimental set up was composed of an anaerobic digester with a total volume of 130 l and a working volume of 100 l of anaerobic broth the digester was operated under mesophilic conditions 35 2 c with a constant mixing of the anaerobic broth using a recirculation pump 621 series watson marlow working at 1 4 l min 1 the anaerobic digester was coupled to the algal bacterial photobioreactor which was engineered as an outdoors hrap with a working volume of 180 l and an illuminated surface area of 1 2 m2 length 170 cm depth 15 cm width 82 cm the hrap was interconnected to a 1 8 m biogas absorption column ac of 2 5 l through a conical settler of 8 l providing a total volume of 190 l for the entire algal system a metallic diffuser of 2 μm pore size was installed at the bottom of ac to maximize the mass transfer of co2 and h2s to the recirculating algal broth 6 the biomass accumulated at the bottom of the settler was continuously recirculated to the hrap using a watson marlow recirculation pump 100 series watson marlow usa at a flow rate of 7 2 l d 1 the cultivation broth inside the hrap was recirculated by a 6 blade paddlewheel at a velocity of 20 cm s 1 fig 1 2 3 operational conditions and sampling procedures the anaerobic digester was initially inoculated with 100 l of fresh anaerobic sludge with an initial vs concentration of 18 2 g kg 1 mixed sludge was daily fed to the anaerobic digester at a flow rate of 5 l d 1 to maintain a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days and an organic loading rate olr of 1 1 0 3 g vs l 1 d 1 the flow rates of biogas and digestate produced in the anaerobic digester were daily measured 100 ml of mixed sludge and digestate were drawn twice a week in order to determine the concentrations of ts and vs chemical oxygen demand cod as well as the concentrations of ic toc tn n no3 n no2 p po4 3 s so4 2 and volatile fatty acids vfa in the digestate four operational stages were defined as a function of the operational conditions implemented namely i ii iii and iv table 1 the hrap was initially inoculated with 2 l of microalgal inoculum in order to reach an initial biomass concentration of 760 mg vss l 1 biomass productivity was set to 22 5 g m 2 d 1 by daily harvesting 26 5 g dry algal bacterial biomass from the bottom of the settler in order to provide a constant growth of microalgae with the exception of the first week where no biomass removal from the bottom of the settler was performed to allow the adaptation of the algal bacterial biomass the settled algal bacterial biomass daily removed was centrifuged and the supernatant was returned into the hrap in order to maintain a zero effluent operation centrate from the pilot anaerobic digester was used as a nutrient and water source in the hrap at a daily flowrate of 4 l d 1 additionally 0 5 l d 1 of centrate from valladolid wwtp was used to compensate the differences between centrifugation processes where 0 9 l of centrate per l of sludge are produced in full scale wwtps and only 0 8 l of centrate per l of sludge are produced in the pilot plant herein used the raw biogas obtained from the pilot anaerobic digester was injected into the ac at flow rates of 30 86 l d 1 under co current liquid flow operation at a l g ratio of 2 0 during the entire experimental period the hrap was installed inside a greenhouse during stage i feb may in order to mitigate the low temperatures in the algal cultivation broth and therefore enhance algal activity during winter conditions tap water was supplied to the photobioreactor at a flow rate between 0 and 12 l d 1 in order to compensate water evaporation losses during stages ii to iv in stage ii may july the greenhouse was dismantled as a result of the more favorable environmental conditions in stage iii july sept the cultivation broth of the hrap was supplemented with 5 2 g l 1 of nahco3 and 2 2 g l 1 of na2co3 in order to achieve an initial concentration of 1000 mg ic l 1 in addition the hrap was daily supplemented with 1 4 l d 1 of a solution containing 5 3 g l 1 na2co3 and 7 9 g l 1 nahco3 in order to maintain a stable ic concentration in the hrap in stage iv sept oct centrate was supplemented with an ic solution containing 15 g l 1 na2co3 in order to increase its ph to 11 5 the ph of the cultivation broth in the hrap and digestate were daily measured at 9 00 am daily monitoring at 9 00 a m and 4 00 p m was carried out for photosynthetic active radiation par and temperature both measured outdoors and inside the greenhouse as well as temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentration in the hrap culture broth gas samples of 100 μl were taken in duplicate at 10

cultivation broth according to sournia 19 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge the biogas produced in the anaerobic digester which was continuously pumped into the biogas absorption column presented a constant composition of 63 7 2 9 ch4 33 7 1 9 co2 0 45 0 28 o2 and 1 59 1 05 n2 interestingly h2s was not detected in the raw biogas the biogas yield and production rate during the treatment of mixed sludge accounted for 969 239 l kg vsin 1 and 92 22 l d 1 respectively with an average methane production yields of 324 7 75 8 ml ch4 g vsin 1 fig 2a biogas production rate averaged 70 3 12 1 l d 1 throughout most of the operational period and decreased to 22 l d 1 at the end of the experiment concomitantly with a sudden reduction in feedstock organic matter content interestingly biogas composition was not affected by the organic matter fluctuations inherent to mixed sludge variability in real wwtp 20 21 these results were in accordance with literature 22 for instance cho et al 23 reported yields of 120 150 l biogas kg vsin 1 when using raw waste activated sludge which increased by a factor of 8 3 under alkaline pretreatment the anaerobic biodegradability of waste activated sludge is often restricted by the recalcitrance of the bacterial cell walls the low c n ratio of this organic feedstock and the presence of inorganic material 24 hence co digestion with other organic substrates is typically recommended 25 mahdy et al 26 obtained 3 3 fold higher methane yields when digesting primary sludge compared with secondary sludge this synergy might explain the higher biogas yields obtained in this work using mixed sludge as a substrate of anaerobic digestion the mixed sludge fed into the anaerobic digester exhibited a total cod tcod ranging from 12 to 77 g o2 l 1 and soluble cod scod from 1 to 13 g o2 l 1 fig 2b these fluctuations observed are typically encountered in primary and secondary sludge in real wwtps which are subjected to large variations in the composition and flow of the wastewater to be treated and in the seasonal climatic conditions 27 in this context tcod in the mixed sludge remained approximately constant at 52 3 12 8 g o2 l 1 during the first 200 days of experiment and gradually decreased to 12 2 g o2 l 1 interestingly scod in the mixed sludge remained stable throughout the entire operational period at 4 7 3 2 g o2 l 1 tcod and scod in the digestate remained relatively constant at 26 0 5 3 and 0 9 0 2 g o2 l 1 respectively while a slight decrease to 17 9 3 5 g o2 l 1 was recorded at the end of the operational period concomitantly with the lower olr in this context tcod res and scod res of 48 20 and 76 12 were obtained respectively similar values were reported by houtmeyers et al 24 during the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge tcod in the digestate of 27 3 g o2 l 1 and tcod res of 33 the mixed sludge exhibited ts and vs content of 34 5 10 and 22 3 3 1 g kg 1 respectively while the anaerobic digestate was characterized by 23 6 5 0 g ts kg 1 and a 57 5 of vs content the vs concentrations of the effluent remained stable throughout the experimental period where slight fluctuations were observed mainly ascribed to feedstock variations that did not compromise the stability of the anaerobic digester the anaerobic digester exhibited average vs res of 41 1 14 1 higher vs res were obtained by carballa et al 28 who reported removals of 64 0 2 in a cstr anaerobic digester operated under mesophilic conditions with mixed sludge at a hrt of 20d nh4 and free ammonia nh3 are the most abundant forms of inorganic nitrogen present in anaerobic digesters free nh3 being the most toxic since it can permeate through the cell membrane in this context high ph values in the digester broth would entail the shift in the nh4 nh3 equilibrium towards nh3 which can ultimately result in process instability leading to an increase in the vfa concentrations in the anaerobic broth 1 in present work tn concentration in the centrate gradually decreased from 1053 mg n l 1 at day 23 to 500 mg n l 1 by the end of the experiment additionally n nh4 concentration ranged from 411 to 1055 mg l 1 with a gradual decreasing trend throughout the operational period low vfa concentrations ranging from 0 to 2200 mg l 1 med 16 8 mg l 1 concentration calculated on an equivalent acetic acid basis were recorded throughout the main operational period which agreed with the stability observed in the ph of the digestate a gradual acetic acid increase was observed from day 40 to 100 reaching a maximal concentration of 2200 mg l 1 which did not affect the anaerobic digestion performance likewise a slight increase in butyric isobutyric valeric and isovaleric acids concentrations which ranged 5 2 641 mg l 1 med 103 3 mg l 1 was observed from day 195 onwards 3 2 environmental parameters in the hrap environmental parameters experienced significant variations according to the seasonal climatic conditions table 1 the average environmental temperature increased from stage i february to stage iii july with a significant decrease in stage iv september the ambient temperatures averaged 7 6 15 2 18 6 and 11 9 c in the morning and 16 7 25 1 30 1 and 22 1 c in the afternoon in stages i ii iii and iv respectively fig a 1 the low temperatures prevailing during winter season required the use of a greenhouse in order to avoid freezing of the culture broth during the night 7 29 in this context the temperatures recorded inside the greenhouse during stage i ranged from 4 to 48 c the latter values were in accordance with those recorded by marín et al 13 during a similar seasonal period 2 0 to 43 0 c on the other hand the temperature in the hrap culture broth during stages i to iv ranged from 10 9 to 23 2 13 9 to 26 6 16 3 to 29 0 and 12 0 to 19 5 c the similar range of temperatures recorded in the cultivation broth of the hrap in stage i and ii confirmed the effectiveness of the greenhouse in maintaining the temperature of the culture broth the ambient par recorded in stages i ii iii and iv ranged from 42 to 1774 48 to 1804 31 to 1708 and 38 to 1580 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig a 2 the values herein observed were in accordance to those previously reported by marín et al 13 under similar climatic conditions in the same location the par recorded inside the greenhouse during stage i ranged from 18 to 1388 μmol m 2 s 1 thus providing a reduction of 40 50 of ambient par significant changes in the dissolved oxygen concentration and evaporation rate were recorded within and between stages since these parameters are highly influenced by variations in par and temperatures in this context the water losses by evaporation in the hrap averaged 2 5 1 4 6 1 2 6 7 7 3 5 and 2 6 3 2 l m 2 d 1 in stages i ii iii and iv respectively table 1 the evaporation rates fig a 3 herein recorded were similar to those values previously reported by marín et al 15 and posadas et al 29 in a 180 l outdoors hrap located at valladolid during comparable climatic conditions these rates were attributed to the temperatures of the cultivation broth and turbulence at the hrap surface caused by the paddlewheel the maximum do values fig a 4 in the culture broth were observed in the afternoon 6 7 4 7 6 0 3 9 8 7 3 3 and 14 6 3 9 mg o2 l 1 in stages i ii iii and iv respectively do values remained below inhibitory levels for microalgae activity 20 25 mg o2 l 1 31 32 the minimum do concentrations 2 6 2 9 1 6 1 3 1 3 1 0 and 5 1 1 9 mg o2 l 1 were measured during the morning as a result of the absence of photosynthetic activity during nighttime and the concomitant oxygenic respiration of the algal bacterial biomass 33 the slight increase observed in stage iv was attributed to the decrease of temperatures during autumn which likely resulted in a reduction in microbial aerobic respiration 34 combined with an increase in the o2 solubility in the cultivation broth 14 35 36 3 3 centrate treatment in the hrap the ph of the centrate remained constant throughout the entire experimental period with an average value of 7 6 1 3 the ph of the hrap culture broth ph which was initially set at 9 0 slowly decreased during stage i till 8 3 and continued decreasing during stage ii to 7 1 fig 3a the drop observed in ph was correlated with the gradual decrease in ic concentration fig 3b observed during stages i and ii with an average loss of 13 mg ic l 1 d 1 this gradual ic depletion under continuous biogas supply was attributed to an active photosynthetic fixation since microalgae were able to use different carbon species present in the hrap cultivation broth and convert them to organic forms through the calvin cycle 37 likewise a gradual reduction of ph was also observed in the biogas absorption column concomitantly to that observed in the hrap which was always lower than the ph of the algal bacterial broth due to the acidification of the co2 directly transferred from the biogas to the culture broth 38 stage iii was characterized by an external ic supplementation to the hrap in order to increase the buffer capacity of the hrap culture broth and additionally to compensate the daily loss of ic during this stage the ph in the hrap and ac increased up to 9 3 and 9 2 both experiencing a slight decrease throughout stage iii down to 8 7 and 8 4 respectively in contrast the ph recorded in the hrap and ac during stage iv increased up to a final value of 9 2 and 8 8 respectively due to the higher ph provided by the carbonate solution the ic concentration during stage iii remained constant at an average concentration of 1169 1 73 8 mg ic l 1 and slightly decreased in stage iv to reach a final value of 818 mg ic l 1 in this context this unexpected reduction observed in ic concentration despite the external na2co3 supplementation was likely due to the decrease in ic concentration of the centrate the dissolved toc concentration in the centrate remained stable in stages i and ii at average values of 367 3 50 8 mgc l 1 and decreased during stages iii and iv down to 140 mgc l 1 at the end of the experimental period fig a 5 in contrast the dissolved toc concentrations in the algal bacterial broth remained stable during stage i and gradually increased from stage ii until the beginning of stage iv where a slight decrease was observed concomitantly to the rapid decrease in toc concentration in the centrate the accumulation of dissolved toc in the hrap confirmed the recalcitrant nature of the organic compounds present in the centrate 30 on the other hand centrate tn concentration steadily decreased from 1053 mg n l 1 at day 23 to 500 mg n l 1 by the end of stage iv however the tn concentration recorded in the hrap steadily increased from 700 mg n l 1 at the beginning of stage i up to 1100 mg l 1 at the end of stage i fig 4a reaching the steady state by day 40 with tn res of 100 as a result of the zero effluent operation of the hrap since neither tn accumulation nor depletion occurred in the hrap culture broth a rapid increase was then observed during stage ii reaching a value of 1600 mg n l 1 and during stage iii where a maximum tn concentration of 1800 mg n l 1 was achieved this accumulation of tn in the hrap indicated a nitrogen input into the system greater than the rate of nitrogen consumption by microorganisms and stripping the increase in tn concentration recorded in stage ii and iii was likely due to the higher biomass concentrations which entailed higher cell lysis and organic nitrogen accumulation and the higher nitrification activity which prevented nh3 stripping and fixed nitrogen in the form of nitrate however the decrease in tn concentration of the centrate mediated a gradual decrease in the tn concentration of the cultivation broth to 1240 mg n l 1 by the end of stage iv the percentage of ammonia stripping was calculated based on a maximum ammonia conversion of 57 observed in the afternoon when temperatures higher at this point it should be noted that despite the higher ph in stage iv ammonia stripping was not enough to be considered as a nitrogen limiting mechanism or a cause of tn depletion since similar values were observed in stage iii with no tn reduction as well as the increase in nitrification observed throughout the total experimental period thus nh4 supply was sufficient to support no2 no3 formation the n nh4 concentration of the centrate averaged 768 167 mg l 1 and slightly decreased throughout the experimental period fig 4b on the other hand the n nh4 concentration in the hrap culture broth remained almost negligible in the four operational stages with an average value of 20 18 mg n l 1 this low ammonium concentration was mainly supported by microbial nitrogen fixation since nh4 is one of the preferred sources of nitrogen for microalgae 37 and by nitrification of nh4 to no2 and no3 32 the key role of nitrification was confirmed by the high n no3 concentrations in the hrap culture broth fig 4d a preliminary nitrogen mass balance estimated nitrogen recoveries in the form of biomass of 56 9 7 7 46 9 12 8 52 5 4 8 and 62 9 6 2 in stages i ii iii and iv respectively based on an experimental nitrogen algal bacterial biomass content of 6 8 1 1 in this context n no2 concentration in the hrap culture broth accounted for 582 0 18 7 mg l 1 during the first 62 days of experiments and was completely depleted at the beginning of stage ii a concomitant increase in n no3 concentration was observed as result of no2 oxidation up to 940 1540 and 1690 mg n no3 l 1 at the end of stages i ii and iii respectively n no3 concentration gradually decreased to 1160 mg l 1 during stage iv mediated by the lower tn concentrations in the centrate in this context marín et al 13 also reported a similar partial nitrification of nh4 under oxygen sufficient conditions followed by a rapid conversion of no2 into no3 however the mechanisms underlying this shift in nitrification patterns still remain unclear 39 finally p po4 3 concentration remained stable in the culture broth throughout stage i 87 6 mg l with p res of 100 mediated by the zero effluent operational strategy slightly increased during stage ii up to steady concentrations of 109 8 mg l 1 and gradually decreased along stages iii and iv to 40 mg l 1 this reduction in p po4 3 concentration was likely mediated by the decrease in the p po4 3 concentration of the centrate similarly s so4 2 concentration remained constant along the entire operational time with an average concentration of 41 2 18 4 and 9 2 5 4 mg l 1 in the hrap culture broth and centrate respectively 3 4 algal bacterial biomass in the hrap the biomass concentration in the hrap averaged 1 39 0 04 1 58 0 18 1 80 0 18 and 1 13 0 18 g vss l 1 in stages i ii iii and iv respectively fig 5a the hrap was initially inoculated at 0 76 g vss l 1 with an algal bacterial consortium whose concentration drastically decreased to 0 25 g vss l 1 in the following 13 days this sharp reduction was attributed to the initial adaptation of the biomass to the cultivation broth since an increase was subsequently observed from day 13 to day 60 of operation the removal of the greenhouse during stage ii entailed an increase in biomass from 1 4 to 1 84 g vss l 1 caused by the greater par impinging in the culture broth of the hrap a sharp decrease in biomass concentration was observed between days 110 and 120 due to a decrease in ambient temperature however the algal bacterial biomass rapidly grew to finally stabilize at 1 7 g vss l 1 by the end of stage iii the reduction in the number of hours of solar irradiations temperature and par induced a gradual decrease in vss concentration in the hrap in stage iv interestingly the inoculated mixture of microalgae was mainly replaced by tetradesmus obliquus during stage i fig 5b which gradually increased its share from 33 to 85 during the first 40 days of operation the second and third most abundant genera in the initial microalgae consortium lindavia sp and synechococcus sp completely disappeared in less than 10 days interestingly chlorella sp became the major species 93 after 60 days of operation the dominance of chlorella sp on t obliquus could be explained by the gradual increase in the temperature of the culture broth and therefore a better adaptation of this microalga in stage ii a rapid reduction in the number of individuals of chlorella sp which continued during stage iii was observed this transient decrease in chlorella sp population concomitant with an increase of the cyanobacteria pseudoanabaena sp 35 was probably mediated by the higher irradiations during this period it has been previously reported that cyanobacteria exhibit a competitive advantage over chlorophyte due to their ability to prevent sedimentation in warmer waters and resistance to grazing 40 41 during stage iii chlorella sp accounted for 91 of microalgae population while pseudoanabaena sp represented only 9 at the end of this stage the abundance of both species may have been caused by the increased temperatures combined with the increased alkalinities since both photosynthetic species are able to grow at high ph and carbonate concentrations 42 43 finally at the end of stage iv chlorella sp pseudoanabaena sp and nitzschia sp represented 87 6 and 7 of the total population 3 5 biogas upgrading ch4 concentration averaged 89 9 1 3 during the first 21 days of operation and gradually decreased to 87 6 2 0 and 85 1 1 3 at the end of stage i and ii respectively fig 6a the reduction in methane content was attributed to the gradual loss of ic in the hrap culture broth and the gradual reduction of ph which hindered co2 absorption in ac during the first stages thus the decrease in the ph of the cultivation broth shifted the equilibrium of carbonate species from hco3 towards co2 in the aqueous medium 29 which combined with the reduction of gas solubility derived from the gradual increase in temperatures according to the henry s law constant 14 30 35 reduced the gas liquid co2 concentration gradient indeed co2 res decreased from an initial 95 5 1 1 at the beginning of the experiment to 91 3 1 2 and 89 6 1 2 at the end of stages i and ii respectively concomitantly to the reduction in ch4 content in the upgraded biogas the biomethane co2 concentrations in stages i and ii accounted for 4 8 1 5 and 6 7 1 7 respectively during stage iii an increase in the ch4 content to 90 4 1 5 concomitant with a decrease in co2 content to 2 6 0 9 corresponding to a co2 re of 95 7 was recorded as a result of the ic addition which mediated an increase in the ph and buffer capacity of the hrap culture broth these phenomena enhanced co2 mass transfer from the biogas into the liquid broth during stage iv where the ph of the hrap culture broth increased the ch4 content increased and remained at 91 2 0 7 along with an enhancement in co2 res up to 97 6 and a biomethane co2 concentration of 1 6 0 7 taking into account the extra cost derived from the use of carbonate solution in order to compensate ic losses an economic estimate of the additional expenses was carried out in this context considering a standard industrial cost of na2co3 of 200 per ton the cost was increased to 0 062 nm 3 treated biogas the o2 content in the raw biogas ranged from 0 15 to 1 75 during all experimental period which slightly increased to 0 20 2 77 in the biomethane as a result of o2 stripping from the algal cultivation broth in the biogas scrubbing column fig 6b the o2 stripping in ac was more severe during stage i as a result of the higher do observed in the hrap culture broth this value slightly decreased during stage ii onwards the o2 concentration in the upgraded biogas did not comply with international regulations 1 during most of the experiment which requires further optimization of the technology in this context an increased ph in the microalgal liquor along with a reduction in the liquid to biogas ratio would support a reduction in the o2 content in the treated biogas additionally it has been reported that the presence of h2s in the biogas would entail sulfur oxidation in presence of o2 even in the absence of sulfur oxidizing bacteria which would also entail a reduction in the o2 content in the upgraded biogas 44 h2s is a typical contaminant of biogas when digesting protein or sulphate rich feedstocks n2 concentration in the raw biogas remained constant throughout the entire experimental period at average values of 1 5 0 8 with minor fluctuations however the biomethane n2 content did not present a clear tendency despite the different operational conditions tested averaging 6 7 2 3 fig 6c similar values of n2 content in the biomethane were reported by posadas et al 30 at a l g ratio 2 in a similar experimental set up while increased n2 desorption was obtained at higher ratios it is worth mentioning that n2 levels higher than 4 were recorded in the raw biogas likely due to the pilot nature of the anaerobic digester 4 conclusions the photosynthetic upgrading of the biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of wwtp mixed sludge coupled with nutrient recovery from centrates was confirmed for the first time at pilot scale under outdoors conditions the pilot mesophilic anaerobic digester supported methane yields of 324 7 75 8 ml ch4 g vsin 1 and tcod res and scod res of 48 20 and 76 12 respectively the high photosynthetic activity of microalgae during stage i and ii mediated an active consumption of alkalinity and a concomitant decrease in ph which decreased ch4 concentration in the upgraded biogas to 85 the external supplementation of inorganic carbon supported stable ch4 contents of 91 process operation under a zero effluent strategy in addition to increased ic and ph entailed a complete removal of the nitrogen and phosphorous present in the centrate the ic content and ph in the absorption column were key parameters governing biomethane quality and suggests that this technology can be fully optimized via ph control adjustment of the liquid to biogas ratio cultivation broth degassing and enhanced microalgae activity via nanoparticle supplementation despite tetradesmus obliquus dominated the culture broth during stage i chlorella sp represented the most abundant photosynthetic species

12916,anaerobic digestion can biotransform the biodegradable fraction of sewage sludge into biogas while the symbiotic action of algal bacterial consortia can remove both the co2 and h2s from biogas and nutrients from digestate a 100 l anaerobic digester operated at 20 days of retention time coupled with a 180 l high rate algal pond hrap engineered to upgrade the biogas and treat the liquid fraction of the pilot digester was optimized along four operational stages i operation with a greenhouse during winter ii operation without greenhouse iii process supplementation with nahco3 iv process supplementation with na2co3 the biogas produced was composed of 63 7 2 9 ch4 33 7 1 9 co2 0 5 0 3 o2 and 1 6 1 1 n2 an average methane productivity of 324 7 75 8 ml ch4 g vsin 1 and total cod removals of 48 20 were recorded in the digester the ch4 concentration in the biomethane gradually decreased to 87 6 2 0 and 85 1 1 3 at the end of stage i and ii respectively attributed to the loss of inorganic carbon in the hrap the supplementation of nahco3 and na2co3 mediated an increase in the ch4 content to 90 4 1 5 and 91 2 0 7 in stages iii and iv respectively steady state co2 removals of 90

biomethane sludge management 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps generate primary and secondary sludge as a result of wastewater management sludge disposal is a major concern and operational cost in most wwtps as a result of the large volumes of sludge annually generated 1 2 in this context anaerobic digestion ad is a well stablished biotechnology where specialized microorganisms bioconvert the biodegradable fraction of wwtp sludge into a biogas mainly composed of ch4 and co2 and a nutrient rich effluent is also generated this process is carried out in four consecutive steps namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis in the absence of oxygen 3 4 the ad of mixed sludge minimizes wwtp costs as a result of the significant sludge volume reduction and electricity heat generation from biogas 1 the biogas generated from sewage sludge anaerobic digestion has been typically used for heat and or power chp generation since it contains high concentrations of ch4 55 65 but also significant concentrations of contaminants such as co2 30 40 n2 0 3 h2o 5 10 o2 0 1 and h2s 0 10 000 ppmv 1 5 raw biogas requires a partial or active purification prior use in internal combustion engines or turbines and a stricter purification when used as a transportation fuel or injected into natural gas grids the composition of the upgraded biogas commonly named biomethane depends on national or regional standards that typically require ch4 90 95 co2 2 4 o2 1 and negligible amounts of h2s 6 a number of physical chemical technologies such as pressurized water scrubbing organic scrubbing chemical scrubbing membrane separation or adsorption have been developed for biogas upgrading and currently dominate the market however these technologies are highly energy and chemicals intensive which can jeopardize the economic and environmental sustainability of biomethane 2 5 for instance the electricity demand and cost of biogas upgrading range from 0 2 0 3 kwh nm 3 and 0 15 0 2 nm 3 while the co2 separated from biogas is typically discarded to the atmosphere in recent years biotechnologies based on the symbiotic action of algal bacterial consortia have attracted an increasing attention as a result of their potential for co2 fixation in the form of biomass and their low operating costs and environmental impacts indeed the co2 present in biogas is bioassimilated by photosynthetic microorganisms microalgae and cyanobacteria by using solar radiation while sulfur oxidizing bacteria rapidly oxidize the h2s contained in biogas using the oxygen generated by photosynthetic activity algal bacterial photobioreactors have been effectively used for bioremediation purposes such as organic matter stabilization or nutrient removal from wastewaters in fact the n p and other trace elements present in the liquid fraction of digestates can be used as nutrient source to support the growth of microalgae and bacteria 7 10 thus centrates the liquid fraction of digestates obtained from the ad of mixed wwtp sludge represent an inexpensive cultivation broth for microalgae and sulfur oxidizing bacteria in this context photosynthetic biogas upgrading coupled with nutrient recovery from centrate has been validated under indoor and outdoor conditions in multiple photobioreactor configurations interconnected to external biogas scrubbing units where biogas was sparged into a recirculating algal cultivation broth to promote gas liquid mass transfer 11 14 nevertheless most of these works were conducted using synthetic biogas or mineral salt media mimicking digestates a recent techno economic analysis of this technology compared to an activated carbon filter coupled with a pressurized water scrubber showed a reduction in the electricity demand from 0 3 to 0 08 kwh nm 3 and a decrease in operating cost from 0 2 to 0 03 nm 3 15 this work aimed at validating for the first time the integration of wwtp sludge digestion with photosynthetic biogas upgrading at pilot scale under outdoor conditions in order to obtain biomethane and algal biomass as the main by products from mixed sludge stabilization the influence of photobioreactor operation inside a greenhouse and the ph and alkalinity of the centrate on the quality of biomethane was investigated under long term operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 inocula and feedstock the algal bacterial photobioreactor was inoculated with a microalgae cake containing 127 6 g total solids ts kg 1 and 64 6 g volatile solids vs kg 1 this inoculum was initially grown in mineral salt medium with a high carbonate content under outdoors conditions in a 270 m2 high rate algal pond hrap located at urbaser technological innovation center of zaragoza spain the microalgae population in the hrap was composed of chlorella sp 15 tetradesmus obliquus 33 lindavia sp 24 and synechococcus sp 28 percentages expressed in number of cells the mineral media used as a nutrient and water source for the cultivation of microalgae and bacteria in the photobioreactor was centrate daily obtained from the centrifugation 10 000 rpm for 5 min of the effluent from the pilot anaerobic digester treating mixed wwtp sludge centrate from the wwtp of valladolid was used to compensate the differences observed between centrifugation processes among laboratory scale and industrial scale the average composition of the centrate was total organic carbon toc concentration of 323 0 84 3 mg l 1 inorganic carbon ic concentration of 736 9 130 1 mg l 1 and total nitrogen tn concentration of 791 0 137 9 mg l 1 fresh anaerobic broth from the full scale digester of the wwtp located in the city of valladolid spain was herein used as inoculum of the pilot anaerobic digester the anaerobic inoculum exhibited a vs ts ratio of 66 mixed primary secondary sludge from valladolid wwtp was used as feedstock in the pilot anaerobic digester fresh mixed sludge was obtained every two weeks and stored at 4 c prior to use the mixed sludge presented an average total solid ts and volatile solid vs concentration of 34 5 10 0 and 22 3 6 1 g l 1 respectively and a chemical oxygen demand cod of 49 0 14 7 g o2 l 1 the variations observed in the sludge composition during the 8 month experimental period were ascribed to the typical fluctuations in real wwtp sludge 2 2 experimental set up the experimental pilot plant was located at the institute of sustainable processes of valladolid university spain under outdoors conditions the experimental set up was composed of an anaerobic digester with a total volume of 130 l and a working volume of 100 l of anaerobic broth the digester was operated under mesophilic conditions 35 2 c with a constant mixing of the anaerobic broth using a recirculation pump 621 series watson marlow working at 1 4 l min 1 the anaerobic digester was coupled to the algal bacterial photobioreactor which was engineered as an outdoors hrap with a working volume of 180 l and an illuminated surface area of 1 2 m2 length 170 cm depth 15 cm width 82 cm the hrap was interconnected to a 1 8 m biogas absorption column ac of 2 5 l through a conical settler of 8 l providing a total volume of 190 l for the entire algal system a metallic diffuser of 2 μm pore size was installed at the bottom of ac to maximize the mass transfer of co2 and h2s to the recirculating algal broth 6 the biomass accumulated at the bottom of the settler was continuously recirculated to the hrap using a watson marlow recirculation pump 100 series watson marlow usa at a flow rate of 7 2 l d 1 the cultivation broth inside the hrap was recirculated by a 6 blade paddlewheel at a velocity of 20 cm s 1 fig 1 2 3 operational conditions and sampling procedures the anaerobic digester was initially inoculated with 100 l of fresh anaerobic sludge with an initial vs concentration of 18 2 g kg 1 mixed sludge was daily fed to the anaerobic digester at a flow rate of 5 l d 1 to maintain a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days and an organic loading rate olr of 1 1 0 3 g vs l 1 d 1 the flow rates of biogas and digestate produced in the anaerobic digester were daily measured 100 ml of mixed sludge and digestate were drawn twice a week in order to determine the concentrations of ts and vs chemical oxygen demand cod as well as the concentrations of ic toc tn n no3 n no2 p po4 3 s so4 2 and volatile fatty acids vfa in the digestate four operational stages were defined as a function of the operational conditions implemented namely i ii iii and iv table 1 the hrap was initially inoculated with 2 l of microalgal inoculum in order to reach an initial biomass concentration of 760 mg vss l 1 biomass productivity was set to 22 5 g m 2 d 1 by daily harvesting 26 5 g dry algal bacterial biomass from the bottom of the settler in order to provide a constant growth of microalgae with the exception of the first week where no biomass removal from the bottom of the settler was performed to allow the adaptation of the algal bacterial biomass the settled algal bacterial biomass daily removed was centrifuged and the supernatant was returned into the hrap in order to maintain a zero effluent operation centrate from the pilot anaerobic digester was used as a nutrient and water source in the hrap at a daily flowrate of 4 l d 1 additionally 0 5 l d 1 of centrate from valladolid wwtp was used to compensate the differences between centrifugation processes where 0 9 l of centrate per l of sludge are produced in full scale wwtps and only 0 8 l of centrate per l of sludge are produced in the pilot plant herein used the raw biogas obtained from the pilot anaerobic digester was injected into the ac at flow rates of 30 86 l d 1 under co current liquid flow operation at a l g ratio of 2 0 during the entire experimental period the hrap was installed inside a greenhouse during stage i feb may in order to mitigate the low temperatures in the algal cultivation broth and therefore enhance algal activity during winter conditions tap water was supplied to the photobioreactor at a flow rate between 0 and 12 l d 1 in order to compensate water evaporation losses during stages ii to iv in stage ii may july the greenhouse was dismantled as a result of the more favorable environmental conditions in stage iii july sept the cultivation broth of the hrap was supplemented with 5 2 g l 1 of nahco3 and 2 2 g l 1 of na2co3 in order to achieve an initial concentration of 1000 mg ic l 1 in addition the hrap was daily supplemented with 1 4 l d 1 of a solution containing 5 3 g l 1 na2co3 and 7 9 g l 1 nahco3 in order to maintain a stable ic concentration in the hrap in stage iv sept oct centrate was supplemented with an ic solution containing 15 g l 1 na2co3 in order to increase its ph to

cultivation broth according to sournia 19 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge the biogas produced in the anaerobic digester which was continuously pumped into the biogas absorption column presented a constant composition of 63 7 2 9 ch4 33 7 1 9 co2 0 45 0 28 o2 and 1 59 1 05 n2 interestingly h2s was not detected in the raw biogas the biogas yield and production rate during the treatment of mixed sludge accounted for 969 239 l kg vsin 1 and 92 22 l d 1 respectively with an average methane production yields of 324 7 75 8 ml ch4 g vsin 1 fig 2a biogas production rate averaged 70 3 12 1 l d 1 throughout most of the operational period and decreased to 22 l d 1 at the end of the experiment concomitantly with a sudden reduction in feedstock organic matter content interestingly biogas composition was not affected by the organic matter fluctuations inherent to mixed sludge variability in real wwtp 20 21 these results were in accordance with literature 22 for instance cho et al 23 reported yields of 120 150 l biogas kg vsin 1 when using raw waste activated sludge which increased by a factor of 8 3 under alkaline pretreatment the anaerobic biodegradability of waste activated sludge is often restricted by the recalcitrance of the bacterial cell walls the low c n ratio of this organic feedstock and the presence of inorganic material 24 hence co digestion with other organic substrates is typically recommended 25 mahdy et al 26 obtained 3 3 fold higher methane yields when digesting primary sludge compared with secondary sludge this synergy might explain the higher biogas yields obtained in this work using mixed sludge as a substrate of anaerobic digestion the mixed sludge fed into the anaerobic digester exhibited a total cod tcod ranging from 12 to 77 g o2 l 1 and soluble cod scod from 1 to 13 g o2 l 1 fig 2b these fluctuations observed are typically encountered in primary and secondary sludge in real wwtps which are subjected to large variations in the composition and flow of the wastewater to be treated and in the seasonal climatic conditions 27 in this context tcod in the mixed sludge remained approximately constant at 52 3 12 8 g o2 l 1 during the first 200 days of experiment and gradually decreased to 12 2 g o2 l 1 interestingly scod in the mixed sludge remained stable throughout the entire operational period at 4 7 3 2 g o2 l 1 tcod and scod in the digestate remained relatively constant at 26 0 5 3 and 0 9 0 2 g o2 l 1 respectively while a slight decrease to 17 9 3 5 g o2 l 1 was recorded at the end of the operational period concomitantly with the lower olr in this context tcod res and scod res of 48 20 and 76 12 were obtained respectively similar values were reported by houtmeyers et al 24 during the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge tcod in the digestate of 27 3 g o2 l 1 and tcod res of 33 the mixed sludge exhibited ts and vs content of 34 5 10 and 22 3 3 1 g kg 1 respectively while the anaerobic digestate was characterized by 23 6 5 0 g ts kg 1 and a 57 5 of vs content the vs concentrations of the effluent remained stable throughout the experimental period where slight fluctuations were observed mainly ascribed to feedstock variations that did not compromise the stability of the anaerobic digester the anaerobic digester exhibited average vs res of 41 1 14 1 higher vs res were obtained by carballa et al 28 who reported removals of 64 0 2 in a cstr anaerobic digester operated under mesophilic conditions with mixed sludge at a hrt of 20d nh4 and free ammonia nh3 are the most abundant forms of inorganic nitrogen present in anaerobic digesters free nh3 being the most toxic since it can permeate through the cell membrane in this context high ph values in the digester broth would entail the shift in the nh4 nh3 equilibrium towards nh3 which can ultimately result in process instability leading to an increase in the vfa concentrations in the anaerobic broth 1 in present work tn concentration in the centrate gradually decreased from 1053 mg n l 1 at day 23 to 500 mg n l 1 by the end of the experiment additionally n nh4 concentration ranged from 411 to 1055 mg l 1 with a gradual decreasing trend throughout the operational period low vfa concentrations ranging from 0 to 2200 mg l 1 med 16 8 mg l 1 concentration calculated on an equivalent acetic acid basis were recorded throughout the main operational period which agreed with the stability observed in the ph of the digestate a gradual acetic acid increase was observed from day 40 to 100 reaching a maximal concentration of 2200 mg l 1 which did not affect the anaerobic digestion performance likewise a slight increase in butyric isobutyric valeric and isovaleric acids concentrations which ranged 5 2 641 mg l 1 med 103 3 mg l 1 was observed from day 195 onwards 3 2 environmental parameters in the hrap environmental parameters experienced significant variations according to the seasonal climatic conditions table 1 the average environmental temperature increased from stage i february to stage iii july with a significant decrease in stage iv september the ambient temperatures averaged 7 6 15 2 18 6 and 11 9 c in the morning and 16 7 25 1 30 1 and 22 1 c in the afternoon in stages i ii iii and iv respectively fig a 1 the low temperatures prevailing during winter season required the use of a greenhouse in order to avoid freezing of the culture broth during the night 7 29 in this context the temperatures recorded inside the greenhouse during stage i ranged from 4 to 48 c the latter values were in accordance with those recorded by marín et al 13 during a similar seasonal period 2 0 to 43 0 c on the other hand the temperature in the hrap culture broth during stages i to iv ranged from 10 9 to 23 2 13 9 to 26 6 16 3 to 29 0 and 12 0 to 19 5 c the similar range of temperatures recorded in the cultivation broth of the hrap in stage i and ii confirmed the effectiveness of the greenhouse in maintaining the temperature of the culture broth the ambient par recorded in stages i ii iii and iv ranged from 42 to 1774 48 to 1804 31 to 1708 and 38 to 1580 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig a 2 the values herein observed were in accordance to those previously reported by marín et al 13 under similar climatic conditions in the same location the par recorded inside the greenhouse during stage i ranged from 18 to 1388 μmol m 2 s 1 thus providing a reduction of 40 50 of ambient par significant changes in the dissolved oxygen concentration and evaporation rate were recorded within and between stages since these parameters are highly influenced by variations in par and temperatures in this context the water losses by evaporation in the hrap averaged 2 5 1 4 6 1 2 6 7 7 3 5 and 2 6 3 2 l m 2 d 1 in stages i ii iii and iv respectively table 1 the evaporation rates fig a 3 herein recorded were similar to those values previously reported by marín et al 15 and posadas et al 29 in a 180 l outdoors hrap located at valladolid during comparable climatic conditions these rates were attributed to the temperatures of the cultivation broth and turbulence at the hrap surface caused by the paddlewheel the maximum do values fig a 4 in the culture broth were observed in the afternoon 6 7 4 7 6 0 3 9 8 7 3 3 and 14 6 3 9 mg o2 l 1 in stages i ii iii and iv respectively do values remained below inhibitory levels for microalgae activity 20 25 mg o2 l 1 31 32 the minimum do concentrations 2 6 2 9 1 6 1 3 1 3 1 0 and 5 1 1 9 mg o2 l 1 were measured during the morning as a result of the absence of photosynthetic activity during nighttime and the concomitant oxygenic respiration of the algal bacterial biomass 33 the slight increase observed in stage iv was attributed to the decrease of temperatures during autumn which likely resulted in a reduction in microbial aerobic respiration 34 combined with an increase in the o2 solubility in the cultivation broth 14 35 36 3 3 centrate treatment in the hrap the ph of the centrate remained constant throughout the entire experimental period with an average value of 7 6 1 3 the ph of the hrap culture broth ph which was initially set at 9 0 slowly decreased during stage i till 8 3 and continued decreasing during stage ii to 7 1 fig 3a the drop observed in ph was correlated with the gradual decrease in ic concentration fig 3b observed during stages i and ii with an average loss of 13 mg ic l 1 d 1 this gradual ic depletion under continuous biogas supply was attributed to an active photosynthetic fixation since microalgae were able to use different carbon species present in the hrap cultivation broth and convert them to organic forms through the calvin cycle 37 likewise a gradual reduction of ph was also observed in the biogas absorption column concomitantly to that observed in the hrap which was always lower than the ph of the algal bacterial broth due to the acidification of the co2 directly transferred from the biogas to the culture broth 38 stage iii was characterized by an external ic supplementation to the hrap in order to increase the buffer capacity of the hrap culture broth and additionally to compensate the daily loss of ic during this stage the ph in the hrap and ac increased up to 9 3 and 9 2 both experiencing a slight decrease throughout stage iii down to 8 7 and 8 4 respectively in contrast the ph recorded in the hrap and ac during stage iv increased up to a final value of 9 2 and 8 8 respectively due to the higher ph provided by the carbonate solution the ic concentration during stage iii remained constant at an average concentration of 1169 1 73 8 mg ic l 1 and slightly decreased in stage iv to reach a final value of 818 mg ic l 1 in this context this unexpected reduction observed in ic concentration despite the external na2co3 supplementation was likely due to the decrease in ic concentration of the centrate the dissolved toc concentration in the centrate remained stable in stages i and ii at average values of 367 3 50 8 mgc l 1 and decreased during stages iii and iv down to 140 mgc l 1 at the end of the experimental period fig a 5 in contrast the dissolved toc concentrations in the algal bacterial broth remained stable during stage i and gradually increased from stage ii until the beginning of stage iv where a slight decrease was observed concomitantly to the rapid decrease in toc concentration in the centrate the accumulation of dissolved toc in the hrap confirmed the recalcitrant nature of the organic compounds present in the centrate 30 on the other hand centrate tn concentration steadily decreased from 1053 mg n l 1 at day 23 to 500 mg n l 1 by the end of stage iv however the tn concentration recorded in the hrap steadily increased from 700 mg n l 1 at the beginning of stage i up to 1100 mg l 1 at the end of stage i fig 4a reaching the steady state by day 40 with tn res of 100 as a result of the zero effluent operation of the hrap since neither tn accumulation nor depletion occurred in the hrap culture broth a rapid increase was then observed during stage ii reaching a value of 1600 mg n l 1 and during stage iii where a maximum tn concentration of 1800 mg n l 1 was achieved this accumulation of tn in the hrap indicated a nitrogen input into the system greater than the rate of nitrogen consumption by microorganisms and stripping the increase in tn concentration recorded in stage ii and iii was likely due to the higher biomass concentrations which entailed higher cell lysis and organic nitrogen accumulation and the higher nitrification activity which prevented nh3 stripping and fixed nitrogen in the form of nitrate however the decrease in tn concentration of the centrate mediated a gradual decrease in the tn concentration of the cultivation broth to 1240 mg n l 1 by the end of stage iv the percentage of ammonia stripping was calculated based on a maximum ammonia conversion of 57 observed in the afternoon when temperatures higher at this point it should be noted that despite the higher ph in stage iv ammonia stripping was not enough to be considered as a nitrogen limiting mechanism or a cause of tn depletion since similar values were observed in stage iii with no tn reduction as well as the increase in nitrification observed throughout the total experimental period thus nh4 supply was sufficient to support no2 no3 formation the n nh4 concentration of the centrate averaged 768 167 mg l 1 and slightly decreased throughout the experimental period fig 4b on the other hand the n nh4 concentration in the hrap culture broth remained almost negligible in the four operational stages with an average value of 20 18 mg n l 1 this low ammonium concentration was mainly supported by microbial nitrogen fixation since nh4 is one of the preferred sources of nitrogen for microalgae 37 and by nitrification of nh4 to no2 and no3 32 the key role of nitrification was confirmed by the high n no3 concentrations in the hrap culture broth fig 4d a preliminary nitrogen mass balance estimated nitrogen recoveries in the form of biomass of 56 9 7 7 46 9 12 8 52 5 4 8 and 62 9 6 2 in stages i ii iii and iv respectively based on an experimental nitrogen algal bacterial biomass content of 6 8 1 1 in this context n no2 concentration in the hrap culture broth accounted for 582 0 18 7 mg l 1 during the first 62 days of experiments and was completely depleted at the beginning of stage ii a concomitant increase in n no3 concentration was observed as result of no2 oxidation up to 940 1540 and 1690 mg n no3 l 1 at the end of stages i ii and iii respectively n no3 concentration gradually decreased to 1160 mg l 1 during stage iv mediated by the lower tn concentrations in the centrate in this context marín et al 13 also reported a similar partial nitrification of nh4 under oxygen sufficient conditions followed by a rapid conversion of no2 into no3 however the mechanisms underlying this shift in nitrification patterns still remain unclear 39 finally p po4 3 concentration remained stable in the culture broth throughout stage i 87 6 mg l with p res of 100 mediated by the zero effluent operational strategy slightly increased during stage ii up to steady concentrations of 109 8 mg l 1 and gradually decreased along stages iii and iv to 40 mg l 1 this reduction in p po4 3 concentration was likely mediated by the decrease in the p po4 3 concentration of the centrate similarly s so4 2 concentration remained constant along the entire operational time with an average concentration of 41 2 18 4 and 9 2 5 4 mg l 1 in the hrap culture broth and centrate respectively 3 4 algal bacterial biomass in the hrap the biomass concentration in the hrap averaged 1 39 0 04 1 58 0 18 1 80 0 18 and 1 13 0 18 g vss l 1 in stages i ii iii and iv respectively fig 5a the hrap was initially inoculated at 0 76 g vss l 1 with an algal bacterial consortium whose concentration drastically decreased to 0 25 g vss l 1 in the following 13 days this sharp reduction was attributed to the initial adaptation of the biomass to the cultivation broth since an increase was subsequently observed from day 13 to day 60 of operation the removal of the greenhouse during stage ii entailed an increase in biomass from 1 4 to 1 84 g vss l 1 caused by the greater par impinging in the culture broth of the hrap a sharp decrease in biomass concentration was observed between days 110 and 120 due to a decrease in ambient temperature however the algal bacterial biomass rapidly grew to finally stabilize at 1 7 g vss l 1 by the end of stage iii the reduction in the number of hours of solar irradiations temperature and par induced a gradual decrease in vss concentration in the hrap in stage iv interestingly the inoculated mixture of microalgae was mainly replaced by tetradesmus obliquus during stage i fig 5b which gradually increased its share from 33 to 85 during the first 40 days of operation the second and third most abundant genera in the initial microalgae consortium lindavia sp and synechococcus sp completely disappeared in less than 10 days interestingly chlorella sp became the major species 93 after 60 days of operation the dominance of chlorella sp on t obliquus could be explained by the gradual increase in the temperature of the culture broth and therefore a better adaptation of this microalga in stage ii a rapid reduction in the number of individuals of chlorella sp which continued during stage iii was observed this transient decrease in chlorella sp population concomitant with an increase of the cyanobacteria pseudoanabaena sp 35 was probably mediated by the higher irradiations during this period it has been previously reported that cyanobacteria exhibit a competitive advantage over chlorophyte due to their ability to prevent sedimentation in warmer waters and resistance to grazing 40 41 during stage iii chlorella sp accounted for 91 of microalgae population while pseudoanabaena sp represented only 9 at the end of this stage the abundance of both species may have been caused by the increased temperatures combined with the increased alkalinities since both photosynthetic species are able to grow at high ph and carbonate concentrations 42 43 finally at the end of stage iv chlorella sp pseudoanabaena sp and nitzschia sp represented 87 6 and 7 of the total population 3 5 biogas upgrading ch4 concentration averaged 89 9 1 3 during the first 21 days of operation and gradually decreased to 87 6 2 0 and 85 1 1 3 at the end of stage i and ii respectively fig 6a the reduction in methane content was attributed to the gradual loss of ic in the hrap culture broth and the gradual reduction of ph which hindered co2 absorption in ac during the first stages thus the decrease in the ph of the cultivation broth shifted the equilibrium of carbonate species from hco3 towards co2 in the aqueous medium 29 which combined with the reduction of gas solubility derived from the gradual increase in temperatures according to the henry s law constant 14 30 35 reduced the gas liquid co2 concentration gradient indeed co2 res decreased from an initial 95 5 1 1 at the beginning of the experiment to 91 3 1 2 and 89 6 1 2 at the end of stages i and ii respectively concomitantly to the reduction in ch4 content in the upgraded biogas the biomethane co2 concentrations in stages i and ii accounted for 4 8 1 5 and 6 7 1 7 respectively during stage iii an increase in the ch4 content to 90 4 1 5 concomitant with a decrease in co2 content to 2 6 0 9 corresponding to a co2 re of 95 7 was recorded as a result of the ic addition which mediated an increase in the ph and buffer capacity of the hrap culture broth these phenomena enhanced co2 mass transfer from the biogas into the liquid broth during stage iv where the ph of the hrap culture broth increased the ch4 content increased and remained at 91 2 0 7 along with an enhancement in co2 res up to 97 6 and a biomethane co2 concentration of 1 6 0 7 taking into account the extra cost derived from the use of carbonate solution in order to compensate ic losses an economic estimate of the additional expenses was carried out in this context considering a standard industrial cost of na2co3 of 200 per ton the cost was increased to 0 062 nm 3 treated biogas the o2 content in the raw biogas ranged from 0 15 to 1 75 during all experimental period which slightly increased to 0 20 2 77 in the biomethane as a result of o2 stripping from the algal cultivation broth in the biogas scrubbing column fig 6b the o2 stripping in ac was more severe during stage i as a result of the higher do observed in the hrap culture broth this value slightly decreased during stage ii onwards the o2 concentration in the upgraded biogas did not comply with international regulations 1 during most of the experiment which requires further optimization of the technology in this context an increased ph in the microalgal liquor along with a reduction in the liquid to biogas ratio would support a reduction in the o2 content in the treated biogas additionally it has been reported that the presence of h2s in the biogas would entail sulfur oxidation in presence of o2 even in the absence of sulfur oxidizing bacteria which would also entail a reduction in the o2 content in the upgraded biogas 44 h2s is a typical contaminant of biogas when digesting protein or sulphate rich feedstocks n2 concentration in the raw biogas remained constant throughout the entire experimental period at average values of 1 5 0 8 with minor fluctuations however the biomethane n2 content did not present a clear tendency despite the different operational conditions tested averaging 6 7 2 3 fig 6c similar values of n2 content in the biomethane were reported by posadas et al 30 at a l g ratio 2 in a similar experimental set up while increased n2 desorption was obtained at higher ratios it is worth mentioning that n2 levels higher than 4 were recorded in the raw biogas likely due to the pilot nature of the anaerobic digester 4 conclusions the photosynthetic upgrading of the biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of wwtp mixed sludge coupled with nutrient recovery from centrates was confirmed for the first time at pilot scale under outdoors conditions the pilot mesophilic anaerobic digester supported methane yields of 324 7 75 8 ml ch4 g vsin 1 and tcod res and scod res of 48 20 and 76 12 respectively the high photosynthetic activity of microalgae during stage i and ii mediated an active consumption of alkalinity and a concomitant decrease in ph which decreased ch4 concentration in the upgraded biogas to 85 the external supplementation of inorganic carbon supported stable ch4 contents of 91 process operation under a zero effluent strategy in addition to increased ic and ph entailed a complete removal of the nitrogen and phosphorous present in the centrate the ic content and ph in the absorption column were key parameters governing biomethane quality and suggests that this technology can be fully optimized via ph control adjustment of the liquid to biogas ratio cultivation broth degassing and enhanced microalgae activity via nanoparticle supplementation despite tetradesmus obliquus dominated the culture broth during stage i chlorella sp represented the most abundant photosynthetic species

12917,polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hydrophobic membranes used in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd processes were prone to fouling and wetting by oil and surfactants which hampered their broad industrial application in this work a new janus composite membrane was developed by modifying uio 66 nh2 with polyvinyl alcohol pva as a cross linking agent and immobilizing the modified uio 66 nh2 on the ptfe membrane by vacuum filtration by tuning the ratio of pva to mof an optimally proportioned janus membrane was obtained and its performance was tested in dcmd experiments through the use of a sodium chloride feed solution containing hexadecane and sodium dodecyl sulfate the top layer of this janus membrane exhibited underwater oleophobicity 130 1 0 96 and hydrophilicity in the air 54 0 0 92 while the bottom layer is hydrophobic 132 3 0 97 compared to the pristine ptfe membrane the modified janus membrane demonstrated promising resistance to both membrane fouling and wetting of oils and surfactants the desalination rate of 99 99 was still achieved within 24 h with the conductivity remaining lower than 10 μs cm and the flux maintained at 21 3 l m2 h as a result the janus composite membrane developed in this study was shown to be a prospective alternative for treating wastewater containing oily substances and surfactants in a resourceful manner graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane distillation janus membrane uio 66 nh2 wetting fouling resistance 1 introduction increased global scarcity of freshwater places high requirements on wastewater treatment a special type of distillation process membrane distillation md uses a microporous hydrophobic membrane to separate the feed solution from the permeate 1 only water vapor or volatile gas molecules are allowed to pass through the membrane from the feed side to the permeate side and condense using the difference in vapor pressure between the two sides of the membrane as the driving force to achieve desalination or concentration 2 furthermore md offers significant advantages over other pressure driven membrane processes such as high desalination rates theoretical 100 the ability to operate below the boiling point of the solution and near atmospheric pressure and the capability to use low grade thermal energy such as geothermal energy and industrial waste heat 3 with the application of the md process in the industry it is worth noting that oil substances and surfactants are the most common contaminants in such cosmetics pharmaceutical food and oil and gas industries wastewater 4 6 the presence of oil substances and surfactants would cause membrane pores blockage and reduce the liquid entry pressure lep leading to membrane fouling even wetting thus decreasing salt rejection and permeate flux which limits the wild application of md to slow down membrane fouling and wetting the most common method is to modify the membrane 7 wang et al 8 sprayed the mixture of perfluorooctanoate and chitosan onto a pvdf membrane to form a composite membrane with a hydrophilic top surface and a hydrophobic substrate which had robustly resistant to oil fouling but was affected by pore wetting with the presence of triton x 100 qing et al 9 induced coarsening on electrospun pvdf nanofibers to create multiscale layered nanofiber structures and reduced the surface energy of the nanofiber membranes by dopamine anchored surface fluorination with stable salt retention and water flux at 0 4 mm sds or 480 mg l mineral oil within 8 h liao et al 10 developed a robust and superhydrophobic membrane to enhance membrane anti wetting properties which had excellent resistance to both cationic and anionic surfactants within 12 h although the omniphobic and superhydrophobic membranes had excellent resistance to fouling and wetting the membrane cannot be run for long periods which observed a tendency of membrane wetting thus continued efforts are still required to develop a membrane that can potentially reduce membrane fouling simultaneously resisting wetting and maintaining sufficient flux and salt rejection metal organic framework materials mofs are emerging organic inorganic hybrid porous materials consisting of metal ions as nodes and organic linkages to form crystalline structures which can be widely used for the preparation of coatings 11 during recent years various superior mof membranes have been successfully prepared and widely used in catalysis separation sensing optics and other fields 12 15 prominently the mofs commonly used for md so far are usually aluminum and iron based mofs 16 cheng et al 17 fabricated a new hydrophobic hybrid pvdf hollow fiber membrane doped with aluminum fumarate metal organic framework alfu mof at 1 wt mof loading the effective porosity of the membrane increased by 52 4 and the stable salt rejection for 3 5 wt nacl solution was 99 9 in 50 h huang et al 18 proposed a dual layer membrane with tunable transport properties using alfu mof doped polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposites as hydrophilic layer the dual layer membranes were capable of avoiding sds induced membrane wetting phenomenon when treating 3 5 nacl solution in dcmd mode it exhibited almost complete salt rejection of 99 9 and the flux increased from 43 5 kg m2 h for ptfe membrane to 45 1 kg m2 h for ptfe psa 1 with the addition of alfu mof uio 66 nh2 has excellent water stability high thermal stability and water treatment adsorption capacity therefore it is a candidate material for the preparation and modification of water treatment membranes 19 furthermore an additional transport channel for water molecules was provided by the sub nano voids in uio 66 nh2 to facilitate water permeation 20 and materials with uniform nanoscale channels are considered to be next generation candidates for filtration membrane applications 21 gong et al prepared the pa uio 66 nh2 membrane exhibited excellent desalination performance in seawater desalination with a 97 6 cut off of na2so4 and the flux was 53 higher than that of the thin membrane nanocomposite nanofiltration membrane 22 zhu et al modified uio 66 nh2 with chitosan as a cross linking agent and prepared new membranes that could effectively separate various oil water emulsions compared with the mixed cellulose membrane the filtration flux of the composite membrane was greatly improved and the retention rate reached 99 23 because of the many advantages of uio 66 nh2 especially the excellent thermal stability and water stability which are perfectly suited to the operation of md the uio 66 nh2 material was tried for md experiments to treat high salt wastewater containing oil and surfactants in this study a novel janus composite membrane was synthesized by a simple vacuum filtration method which used the cross linking agent pva to form a dense uio 66 nh2 layer on a hydrophobic ptfe membrane substrate various characterization methods including fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd analysis scanning electron microscopy sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and contact angle ca measurements were used to analyze the structure morphology and surface properties of the achieved membranes finally we performed md experiments with a high salt feed solution containing hexadecane and sodium dodecyl sulfate to prove that the dense uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane exhibited simultaneously fouling and wetting resistance with the consideration of the properties of uio 66 nh2 it could be assumed that the uio 66 nh2 pva composite membrane exhibited a promising potential for development and application in membrane distillation to treat the wastewater containing oil and surfactants 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and materials zirconium chloride zrcl4 98 2 aminoterephthalic acid h2bdc nh2 98 hexadecane c16h34 98 glutaraldehyde ga 25 were bought from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd polyvinyl alcohol

reagent co ltd deionized di water was used for all processes and all raw materials were used without further purification 2 2 preparation of uio 66 nh2 and pva uio 66 nh2 was synthesized by the solvothermal reaction method with a slight modification 24 in brief a mixed solution of zrcl4 h2bdc nh2 hac with a molar ratio of 1 1 100 was first configured wherein zrcl4 233 0 mg 1 mm and h2bdc nh2 181 2 mg 1 mm were dissolved in dmf 50 ml and then 6 0 g of hac 100 mm was added to the solution with the aid of ultrasonic treatment the mixed solution was uniformly dispersed for 30 min and then kept stirred for 2 h at room temperature subsequently the clear well mixed solution without solid residue was transferred to a 100 ml ptfe lined reaction kettle and reacted at 120 c for 24 h after the reaction was finished the reaction kettle was allowed for cooling to room temperature and then removed the solid liquid was separated by centrifugation and washed with dmf and anhydrous ethanol three times respectively in order to entirely remove the incompletely reacted substances from the solid finally the uio 66 nh2 samples obtained after washing were dried in a vacuum drying oven at 70 c for 24 h to produce the final product the uio 66 nh2 synthesis is shown schematically in fig 1a incorporated 2 g of pva into 98 ml of di water and stirred vigorously at 95 c for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous pva solution 10 g l 2 3 fabrication of a uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane the janus composite membrane was obtained according to the steps shown in fig 1b firstly the previously obtained uio 66 nh2 solid powder 5 10 15 mg and 0 5 ml 10 g l pva solution were added into 100 ml of anhydrous ethanol stirred for 5 min and then ultrasound for 1 h to completely disperse the uio 66 nh2 solid powder in anhydrous ethanol to form a uio 66 nh2 pva suspension then added 2 ml hcl to adjust ph to 1 after adjusting the ph 1 ml of ga was added to the mixed solution as a cross linking agent and stirred at room temperature for 15 min finally the ptfe membrane was fixed in a vacuum filter and the membrane was first wetted with a small amount of anhydrous ethanol and then poured into the mixed suspension the composite membrane 4 cm in diameter and 0 22 μm average pore size fixed on ptfe base membrane was obtained under a pressure of about 0 09 mpa soaked in di water for 24 h to remove unreacted material such as excess ga and hcl it was then dried at room temperature for 12 h depending on the ratios of uio 66 nh2 and pva which were 0 5 5 5 10 5 and 15 5 respectively marked as m0 m1 m2 and m3 it was commonly known as uio 66 nh2 pva composite membrane 2 4 experiment setup the lab scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd device used in this study is shown schematically in fig s1 the system was composed of a dcmd module a water bath a feed tank a permeate tank two peristaltic pumps a chiller a balance and a conductivity meter the flat membrane module which was made of acrylic for an effective membrane area of roughly 4 cm2 2 2 cm due to the actual application of different areas the practical amount of uio 66 nh2 used for m0 m3 was 0 1 6 3 2 and 4 8 mg respectively the feed and the permeate solution of the membrane module were circulated simultaneously at a rate of 50 mm s the temperature of the feed side was maintained at 60 c and the permeate at 10 c under each experiment the feed solution was prepared by the addition of 35 g nacl 1 g hexadecane and 0 1 mm sds to 1 l di water the mixture was then stirred with an ultrasonic machine for 2 h and mixed well to produce a milky white emulsion solution all emulsions were kept stable for several hours at room temperature without significant phase separation permeate conductivity and flux were recorded every 10 min during the experiment initially 100 ml of deionized water was added to the beaker on the permeate side 300 ml and the conductivity of the solution therein was measured with a conductivity meter to monitor the wetting of the membrane pores while the beaker was placed on a digital balance connected to a computer to record the change in flow rate of the permeate 2 5 characterization of the composite membrane the surface and cut morphology of the composite membranes were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy sem fei nova nano sem450 america and combined with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds oxford x max n50 british to further analyze the composition elements of the composite membrane the crystal structure of the mof material and the loading of the material on the composite membranes were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku smartlab9 japan with cu kα radiation the scanning speed was 4 min and the scanning angle range was 5 to 70 the chemical structures of mof materials and composite membranes were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo fisher nicolet is5 america and scanned in the infrared spectral band of 4000 400 cm 1 the chemical composition of the composite membranes was characterized by x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi america it was then to further analyze the chemical state and structure of the elements in the composite membrane four elements carbon c oxygen o nitrogen n and zirconium zr were scanned separately in narrow regions to obtain more accurate peak positions and better peak shapes the water contact angle wca in air and underwater oil contact angle oca of composite membranes were conducted by a contact angle goniometer model 250 rame hart america to ascertain the hydrophobicity hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the membranes 2 6 assessment of membrane performance the pure water flux jw l m2 h of the membrane can be calculated according to the eq 1 1 j w v a t here v is the volume of permeate water l a is the effective area of the membrane m2 and t is the permeation time of water h for each experiment water recovery wr is obtained by eq 2 2 w r 1 v t v 0 100 where v0 l is the initial feed volume and vt l is the volume of feed at time t h the salt rejection can be determined by eq 3 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are denoted as the salt concentration in the feed and permeate solutions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composite materials and membranes fig 2a shows the ftir spectra of ptfe uio 66 nh2 and m0 m3 the characteristic peak at about 1429 cm 1 in the spectra of the ptfe layer can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the c f c group 25 regarding m0 except for the characteristic peak of ptfe a broad peak due to hydroxyl group oh stretching vibration characteristic of pva polymers was present in the region 3500 3000 cm 1 26 the peak at 1385 cm 1 indicated the deposition and cross linking of pva with ga resulting in the presence of alkyl and aldehyde groups and the peak appearing in the 1087 cm 1 band represented the ether bond coc which in this case belonged to the dioxane ring formed by the cross linked pva 27 additionally by comparing m0 the characteristic peaks of uio 66 nh2 appeared in m1 m3 as the uio 66 nh2 content increased the peak transmittance of uio 66 nh2 was relatively increasing specifically the peaks at 3462 and 3351 cm 1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of nh2 respectively 28 since the ligand of uio 66 nh2 was 2 aminoterephthalic acid with an aromatic carboxylic acid the peak at 1573 cm 1 was correlated with symmetric and asymmetric co stretching bonds which was formed by aromatic and carboxyl groups 29 the weak absorption peaks detected at the wavenumbers 1659 and 1496 cm 1 were attributed to the ch symmetric stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group and the typical vibration of the cc stretching in the benzene ring in the bdc ligand respectively 30 in addition the binding between aromatic carbon and nitrogen cn can be noticed at 1385 cm 1 the main bands at 769 664 572 and 483 cm 1 were attributed to the oh and ch bending vibration modes mixed with low frequency zro modes 31 the above findings indicated the successful combination of uio 66 nh2 and pva on ptfe membranes fig 2b shows the xrd spectra of uio 66 nh2 ptfe and m0 m3 membranes it can be seen that there were three diffraction peaks of uio 66 nh2 at 2θ 7 32 8 46 and 25 7 corresponding to 111 200 and 600 crystal planes respectively in agreement with the results reported in the literature 32 indicating that the synthesis of uio 66 nh2 was successful the characteristic diffraction peak of ptfe appeared near the position of 2θ 18 37 refer to the standard mapping pdf 54 1595 the characteristic peak of pva was at 2θ 18 1 33 which represented the typical crystalline phase of pva chains and almost coincided with the characteristic peak of ptfe diffraction peaks in the range of 2θ 21 74 27 40 were related to the support layer of the ptfe membrane with the cellulose liner layer with the comparison of the five membranes the characteristic peaks of uio 66 nh2 were found to appear in m1 m3 and the characteristic peaks increased relatively with the addition of uio 66 nh2 content the xrd spectra further showed that uio 66 nh2 and pva adhered to the ptfe membrane successfully fig 3a clearly shows the sem image of uio 66 nh2 wherein a regular octahedral structure was observed with a well controlled crystal size between 100 and 150 nm fig 3b f exhibits the surface micromorphology of different composite membranes from a visual perspective the surface of the ptfe primary membrane was fibrous with a web like nodular structure of fibers which was produced during the co stretching manufacturing process pore sizes in the micron range were observed on the surface of the original ptfe membrane but cannot be found in the smooth and dense hydrogel layer surface after the addition of pva the addition of uio 66 nh2 further modified the structure of the membrane surface which was due to the urethane uio 66 nh2 with a larger diameter exhibiting the octahedral crystal structure and tended to agglomerate with each other thus reducing its surface tension different degrees of aggregation of uio 66 nh2 were observed on the m1 m3 surface uio 66 nh2 with 5 mg addition in the m1 sample was not uniformly dispersed on the membrane surface and did not completely cover the surface forming larger membrane pores on the surface and reducing the barrier effect on oil and surfactant which may lead to a lower retention rate m2 with 10 mg uio 66 nh2 dosage exhibited a relatively uniform distribution and suitable pores in the sem image the overloading of uio 66 nh2 on m3 seemed to block most of the membrane pores and agglomerated on the membrane inversely affecting the membrane flux the comparison results revealed that uio 66 nh2 was uniformly distributed on the surface of m2 which might facilitate oil water separation hence a potential choice for the removal of high concentration salt solutions containing oil and surfactants was considered for m2 fig 3g i shows the corresponding elements and distribution of the m2 membrane surface and membrane cross section as shown in the sem cross section of m2 uio 66 nh2 pva was uniformly loaded on the ptfe membrane further analysis of the distribution of zr and f elements in the cross section by eds mapping technique it revealed that most of the zr element was above the f element suggesting that the uio 66 nh2 pva material loaded on the surface of the ptfe membrane did not penetrate into the interior of the ptfe layer no destruction on the structure of the hydrophobic membrane was observed during the membrane modification but rather an asymmetric janus structure with the ptfe membrane composed of a hydrophilic upper layer and a hydrophobic lower layer the eds analysis on the surface of the m2 membrane is shown in fig s2 wherein zr was related to uio 66 nh2 and c n and o belonged to uio 66 nh2 pva and ptfe combined with fig 3i it was found that the distribution of c n o and zr elements on the ptfe membrane was quite uniform indicating that the hydrophilic layer formed was homogeneous and beneficial to the oil water emulsion separation fig 4a represents the full xps spectrum of the m2 sample for the preliminary determination of the chemical components of the membrane surface since each membrane had the same elemental composition we took out the optimal m2 for analysis and the xps spectra of the rest of the membranes are shown in fig s4 as can be seen the elements c n o and zr were confirmed to be present in the m2 membrane sample with absorption peaks of 285 15 399 07 532 06 and 188 22 ev for c1s n1s o1s and zr3d respectively 34 fig 4b shows that peaks at 398 97 and 403 51 ev belong to nh2 and nh3 of the n element respectively indicating that a positive charge was displayed by the amino bound proton on uio 66 nh2 and loaded onto the ptfe membrane successfully the peaks centered at 530 04 and 531 84 ev binding energy corresponded to zro and co on the membrane surface were illustrated in fig 4c as shown in the peak results in fig 4d the c1s spectral part of the full spectrum could be decomposed into four types of chemical bond components the four peaks were designated as co co cn and cc bonds in the m2 sample fitted at binding energies of 284 26 285 60 285 85 and 288 01 ev respectively where the co peak at 285 60 ev was attributed to uio 66 nh2 nanoparticles and the co peak at 284 26 ev was attributed to cross linking of pva substrates fig 4e represents the high resolution zr3d peaks including two different peaks observed at the binding energies of 182 27 and 184 62 ev which referred to the two 3d splitting energy levels of the zr element that was zr3d5 2 and zr3d3 2 respectively 35 therefore xps analysis results showed that the preparation of the composite membrane was prepared successfully 3 2 membrane performance evaluation 3 2 1 surface wettability of the membranes the surface wettability was also reflected in the hydrophilicity of the membrane the water contact angle was quantified by measuring the image of water droplets on the membrane in which a wca less than 90 represented its hydrophilic characteristics fig s3 systematically compared the membrane wettability of ptfe and m0 m3 and the surface wettability of the composite membrane was significantly different from that of the control it can be seen that the wca of the ptfe membrane was 132 3 showed hydrophobicity while the wac of m0 m3 with the addition of uio 66 nh2 and pva was 68 8 56 6 54 0 and 50 4 respectively with excellent hydrophilicity hydrophilic membrane surfaces in aqueous environments could form a layer of water on the surface preventing most organic contaminants such as oil from coming into contact and accumulating on the membrane surface thus improving its fouling resistance furthermore there were more hydrophilic groups on the surface with the increase of uio 66 nh2 and thus the wca decreased resulting in a more hydrophilic surface considering a strong correlation between oca and membrane contamination we also measured underwater oca to further investigate the availability of the composite membrane for oil water separation the ptfe membrane in fig s3 shows an underwater oca of 48 4 due to its underwater lipophilicity which can be attributed to the strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between the low surface energy membrane material and the oil droplets in contrast m0 m3 were highly oleophobic underwater with oca of 118 8 123 7 130 1 and 130 4 respectively exhibiting excellent underwater oleophobicity which was expected to achieve oil water separation this underwater oleophobicity can be explained by the strong repulsive hydration forces experienced with the oil droplets 36 trying to wet the hydrophilic uio 66 nh2 pva coated surface 3 2 2 simultaneous fouling and wetting resistance of the uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane a 35 g l nacl feed solution containing 1000 mg l hexadecane oil and 0 1 mm sds surfactant was tested on pristine ptfe membranes and dense uio 66 nh2 pva janus membranes to evaluate their fouling and wetting resistance the variations of permeate conductivity and flux as shown in fig 5a b during the first hour of operation the five membranes were treated with a solution containing only 35 g l nacl feed and the conductivity was basically around 4 μs cm indicating that all membranes had an excellent desalination effect with the addition of 1 g l hexadecane and 0 1 mm sds to the feed solution the pristine ptfe membrane was immediately fouled and wetted reflected by a rapid decline in vapor flux and salt rejection specifically the flux decreased rapidly from 23 3 to 2 3 l m2 h within 1 h and almost no flux thereafter and the conductivity even increased to 525 μs cm indicating that the performance of the ptfe membrane was deteriorated due to the presence of surfactants and oil substances the addition of sds significantly reduced the surface tension of the feed solution which also decreased the lep of the membrane pores making the membrane pores no longer sieve and the salt molecules easily pass through the membrane pores thus increasing the conductivity also due to the interaction between oil and hydrophobic membrane hexadecane droplets adhered to the membrane pore surface hence blocking the membrane pore and causing a rapid decrease in flux the wetted membrane pores allowed the feed solution to pass as a liquid resulting in lower salt rejection and higher conductivity on the permeate side compared to the ptfe membrane m0 m3 membranes showed relatively better fouling and wetting resistance during the initial 12 h of dcmd operation as evidenced by stable vapor flux and high salt retention rates m0 as the control group with pva modification only was able to have good resistance to fouling and wetting in the early stage of the operation 15 h and compared to the ptfe membrane the flux even slightly increased to 24 1 l m2 h although pva was also a hydrophilic substance in this experiment it only played the role of a cross linking agent and the swelling phenomenon occurred in water for a long time running despite the chemical modification of pva with glutaraldehyde the swelling in water would still reach a minimum of 14 37 after 15 h of experimental operation due to the problem of swelling of pva the sds passed through the gaps between the pva layers and came into contact with the ptfe membrane thus causing the conductivity to rise reaching 90 5 μs cm after 24 h as the membrane pores became wetted it was found that oil droplets would also adhere to the membrane pores causing membrane contamination and a decrease in flux to 4 9 l m2 h with the addition of uio 66 nh2 the hydrophilic functional groups on the membrane surface kept increasing and uio 66 nh2 nanoparticles could act as a solid crosslinking agent to inhibit the movement of pva chains which made the binding of uio 66 nh2 to pva stronger it was worth noting that the uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane was also swollen by water molecules due to hydrogen bonding however the increase in the loading level of uio 66 nh2 nanoparticles could effectively improve the anti swelling property of pva hybrid membranes 38 m1 still suffered from a small amount of pva swelling due to the addition of only 1 6 mg of uio 66 nh2 which did not bind firmly enough with pva and had a less uniform distribution on the membrane surface also due to the size of uio 66 nh2 of 100 150 nm the presence of uio 66 nh2 led to the reduction and shrinkage of membrane pores it can be seen that the flux of m1 decreased slightly to 22 4 l m2 h due to the presence of an additional layer of hydrophilic material on the surface in the presence of uio 66 nh2 only after 19 h did signs of membrane fouling and wetting appear with a final conductivity of 43 7 μs cm and flux of 10 9 l m2 h after 24 h m2 and m3 bound more strongly to pva and can retard the problem of pva swelling but the problem with m3 was the presence of an aggregation effect due to excess uio 66 nh2 adsorbed on the membrane which clogged the membrane pores and thus significantly reduced the flux while the conductivity had been kept below 10 μs cm the flux was only 14 7 l m2 h which was 63 of the flux of the pristine ptfe membrane treating salt solution and failed to meet the ideal requirements by comparison as inferred earlier m2 was the best for treating high salinity wastewater containing surfactants and oil substances the conductivity remained below 10 μs cm during 24 h of operation which indicated a good anti wetting effect the initial flux slightly decreased due to the slight agglomeration of uio 66 nh2 with a running flux of 21 3 l m2 h which was 91 4 of the running flux of ptfe membrane treating only salt solution after 24 h of operation the vapor flux slightly decreased to 18 2 l m2 h by the accumulation of oil on the membrane surface due to emulsification 39 but still reached 86 of the initial performance it was worth sacrificing a little flux to be able to achieve both fouling and wetting resistance 3 3 fouling and wetting resistance mechanism of the uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane the sds shown in fig 6a consisted of a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail it was well known that the presence of surfactants such as sds would reduce the surface tension of the solution hence causing the membrane wetting phenomena 40 when sds encountered a ptfe membrane the hydrophobic tail came into contact with the hydrophobic membrane surface due to the hydrophobic effect resulting in the hydrophilic head facing the solution the affinity of sds ptfe reduced the surface tension at the orifice thereby increasing the likelihood of exceeding the lep which was defined as the critical pressure required for the liquid before it could enter the non wetting membrane as soon as the water pressure imposed during the dcmd procedure exceeded the lep the raw material solution containing sds began to invade the membrane pores resulting in membrane wetting in addition to membrane wetting the presence of oil substances also affected membrane performance wherein the interaction between oil droplets and the hydrophobic membrane surface determined the fouling tendency considering the highly hydrophobic characteristics for both oil droplets and the ptfe membrane when oil droplets approached the membrane surface the ptfe membrane had a strong adhesion to the oil droplets which penetrated and thus blocked the membrane pore with almost no permeation flux as the co existence of surfactant and oil substances sds reduced the interfacial tension between oil and water making part of oil droplets hydrophilic these droplets would combine with the membrane pores that were wetted under the action of hydrophilic groups which likewise led to the serious blockage of the membrane pores as the wetting progressed salt molecules were also continuously transported with permeate flow leading to a rapid increase in conductivity the uio 66 nh2 layer covered by pva as a cross linking agent modified the surface of the ptfe membrane and formed a hydrophilic layer on its surface considering pva itself as a hydrophilic substance and uio 66 nh2 with a hydrophilic group nh2 the hydrophilicity of the uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane could be further improved the hydrophilic head of sds as shown in fig 6b was in contact with the hydrophilic surface of the janus membrane which would inhibit sds to pass through the hydrophilic layer directly and reach the ptfe membrane in such conditions the lep of the membrane pores was maintained to ensure that the ptfe membrane substrate remained unwetted moreover the hydrophilic layer exhibited repulsive force to oil droplets which was not conducive to the adhesion and diffusion of oil droplets thus providing efficient resistance to membrane fouling membrane pore size was another key factor that also had an impact on mitigating membrane fouling and wetting reducing surface pore size and porosity could increase lep and thus retarded the wetting process 41 which also explained the slight decrease in membrane flux with loading of the mof material the distribution of m2 membrane pore size is shown in fig s5 4 conclusion in summary the janus composite membranes were prepared by vacuum filtration self assembly on microporous ptfe membranes using pva and uio 66 nh2 as modified materials the prepared uio 66 nh2 pva base layer enabled the bilayer membrane to a hydrophobic heterogeneous structure which had a positive effect on the membrane s resistance to fouling and wetting in the dcmd process operation when treating 3 5 nacl solution the salt rejection rate was almost 99 9 for all dual layer membranes especially m2 stood out for its excellent chemical stability and high retention rate when treated the feed solution containing surfactants and oils with the conductivity of 9 21 μs cm over 24 h and the flux was stable at 21 3 l m2 h a hydrophilic layer formed by pva and uio 66 nh2 prevented sds and hexadecane from membrane fouling and wetting due to hydrophobic effects overall a new feasible dual layer membrane design was proposed that promised to enable high performance dcmd applications and we believed that the new method of achieving both fouling and wetting resistance would offer a way to design highly operable dcmd membranes declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no

12917,polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hydrophobic membranes used in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd processes were prone to fouling and wetting by oil and surfactants which hampered their broad industrial application in this work a new janus composite membrane was developed by modifying uio 66 nh2 with polyvinyl alcohol pva as a cross linking agent and immobilizing the modified uio 66 nh2 on the ptfe membrane by vacuum filtration by tuning the ratio of pva to mof an optimally proportioned janus membrane was obtained and its performance was tested in dcmd experiments through the use of a sodium chloride feed solution containing hexadecane and sodium dodecyl sulfate the top layer of this janus membrane exhibited underwater oleophobicity 130 1 0 96 and hydrophilicity in the air 54 0 0 92 while the bottom layer is hydrophobic 132 3 0 97 compared to the pristine ptfe membrane the modified janus membrane demonstrated promising resistance to both membrane fouling and wetting of oils and surfactants the desalination rate of 99 99 was still achieved within 24 h with the conductivity remaining lower than 10 μs cm and the flux maintained at 21 3 l m2 h as a result the janus composite membrane developed in this study was shown to be a prospective alternative for treating wastewater containing oily substances and surfactants in a resourceful manner graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane distillation janus membrane uio 66 nh2 wetting fouling resistance 1 introduction increased global scarcity of freshwater places high requirements on wastewater treatment a special type of distillation process membrane distillation md uses a microporous hydrophobic membrane to separate the feed solution from the permeate 1 only water vapor or volatile gas molecules are allowed to pass through the membrane from the feed side to the permeate side and condense using the difference in vapor pressure between the two sides of the membrane as the driving force to achieve desalination or concentration 2 furthermore md offers significant advantages over other pressure driven membrane processes such as high desalination rates theoretical 100 the ability to operate below the boiling point of the solution and near atmospheric pressure and the capability to use low grade thermal energy such as geothermal energy and industrial waste heat 3 with the application of the md process in the industry it is worth noting that oil substances and surfactants are the most common contaminants in such cosmetics pharmaceutical food and oil and gas industries wastewater 4 6 the presence of oil substances and surfactants would cause membrane pores blockage and reduce the liquid entry pressure lep leading to membrane fouling even wetting thus decreasing salt rejection and permeate flux which limits the wild application of md to slow down membrane fouling and wetting the most common method is to modify the membrane 7 wang et al 8 sprayed the mixture of perfluorooctanoate and chitosan onto a pvdf membrane to form a composite membrane with a hydrophilic top surface and a hydrophobic substrate which had robustly resistant to oil fouling but was affected by pore wetting with the presence of triton x 100 qing et al 9 induced coarsening on electrospun pvdf nanofibers to create multiscale layered nanofiber structures and reduced the surface energy of the nanofiber membranes by dopamine anchored surface fluorination with stable salt retention and water flux at 0 4 mm sds or 480 mg l mineral oil within 8 h liao et al 10 developed a robust and superhydrophobic membrane to enhance membrane anti wetting properties which had excellent resistance to both cationic and anionic surfactants within 12 h although the omniphobic and superhydrophobic membranes had excellent resistance to fouling and wetting the membrane cannot be run for long periods which observed a tendency of membrane wetting thus continued efforts are still required to develop a membrane that can potentially reduce membrane fouling simultaneously resisting wetting and maintaining sufficient flux and salt rejection metal organic framework materials mofs are emerging organic inorganic hybrid porous materials consisting of metal ions as nodes and organic linkages to form crystalline structures which can be widely used for the preparation of coatings 11 during recent years various superior mof membranes have been successfully prepared and widely used in catalysis separation sensing optics and other fields 12 15 prominently the mofs commonly used for md so far are usually aluminum and iron based mofs 16 cheng et al 17 fabricated a new hydrophobic hybrid pvdf hollow fiber membrane doped with aluminum fumarate metal organic framework alfu mof at 1 wt mof loading the effective porosity of the membrane increased by 52 4 and the stable salt rejection for 3 5 wt nacl solution was 99 9 in 50 h huang et al 18 proposed a dual layer membrane with tunable transport properties using alfu mof doped polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposites as hydrophilic layer the dual layer membranes were capable of avoiding sds induced membrane wetting phenomenon when treating 3 5 nacl solution in dcmd mode it exhibited almost complete salt rejection of 99 9 and the flux increased from 43 5 kg m2 h for ptfe membrane to 45 1 kg m2 h for ptfe psa 1 with the addition of alfu mof uio 66 nh2 has excellent water stability high thermal stability and water treatment adsorption capacity therefore it is a candidate material for the preparation and modification of water treatment membranes 19 furthermore an additional transport channel for water molecules was provided by the sub nano voids in uio 66 nh2 to facilitate water permeation 20 and materials with uniform nanoscale channels are considered to be next generation candidates for filtration membrane applications 21 gong et al prepared the pa uio 66 nh2 membrane exhibited excellent desalination performance in seawater desalination with a 97 6 cut off of na2so4 and the flux was 53 higher than that of the thin membrane nanocomposite nanofiltration membrane 22 zhu et al modified uio 66 nh2 with chitosan as a cross linking agent and prepared new membranes that could effectively separate various oil water emulsions compared with the mixed cellulose membrane the filtration flux of the composite membrane was greatly improved and the retention rate reached 99 23 because of the many advantages of uio 66 nh2 especially the excellent thermal stability and water stability which are perfectly suited to the operation of md the uio 66 nh2 material was tried for md experiments to treat high salt wastewater containing oil and surfactants in this study a novel janus composite membrane was synthesized by a simple vacuum filtration method which used the cross linking agent pva to form a dense uio 66 nh2 layer on a hydrophobic ptfe membrane substrate various characterization methods including fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd analysis scanning electron microscopy sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and contact angle ca measurements were used to analyze the structure morphology and surface properties of the achieved membranes finally we performed md experiments with a high salt feed solution containing hexadecane and sodium dodecyl sulfate to prove that the dense uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane exhibited simultaneously fouling and wetting resistance with the consideration of the properties of uio 66 nh2 it could be assumed that the uio 66 nh2 pva composite membrane exhibited a promising potential for development and application in membrane distillation to treat the wastewater containing oil and surfactants 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and materials zirconium chloride zrcl4 98 2 aminoterephthalic acid h2bdc nh2 98 hexadecane c16h34 98 glutaraldehyde ga 25 were bought from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd polyvinyl alcohol

reagent co ltd deionized di water was used for all processes and all raw materials were used without further purification 2 2 preparation of uio 66 nh2 and pva uio 66 nh2 was synthesized by the solvothermal reaction method with a slight modification 24 in brief a mixed solution of zrcl4 h2bdc nh2 hac with a molar ratio of 1 1 100 was first configured wherein zrcl4 233 0 mg 1 mm and h2bdc nh2 181 2 mg 1 mm were dissolved in dmf 50 ml and then 6 0 g of hac 100 mm was added to the solution with the aid of ultrasonic treatment the mixed solution was uniformly dispersed for 30 min and then kept stirred for 2 h at room temperature subsequently the clear well mixed solution without solid residue was transferred to a 100 ml ptfe lined reaction kettle and reacted at 120 c for 24 h after the reaction was finished the reaction kettle was allowed for cooling to room temperature and then removed the solid liquid was separated by centrifugation and washed with dmf and anhydrous ethanol three times respectively in order to entirely remove the incompletely reacted substances from the solid finally the uio 66 nh2 samples obtained after washing were dried in a vacuum drying oven at 70 c for 24 h to produce the final product the uio 66 nh2 synthesis is shown schematically in fig 1a incorporated 2 g of pva into 98 ml of di water and stirred vigorously at 95 c for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous pva solution 10 g l 2 3 fabrication of a uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane the janus composite membrane was obtained according to the steps shown in fig 1b firstly the previously obtained uio 66 nh2 solid powder 5 10 15 mg and 0 5 ml 10 g l pva solution were added into 100 ml of anhydrous ethanol stirred for 5 min and then ultrasound for 1 h to completely disperse the uio 66 nh2 solid powder in anhydrous ethanol to form a uio 66 nh2 pva suspension then added 2 ml hcl to adjust ph to 1 after adjusting the ph 1 ml of ga was added to the mixed solution as a cross linking agent and stirred at room temperature for 15 min finally the ptfe membrane was fixed in a vacuum filter and the membrane was first wetted with a small amount of anhydrous ethanol and then poured into the mixed suspension the composite membrane 4 cm in diameter and 0 22 μm average pore size fixed on ptfe base membrane was obtained under a pressure of about 0 09 mpa soaked in di water for 24 h to remove unreacted material such as excess ga and hcl it was then dried at room temperature for 12 h depending on the ratios of uio 66 nh2 and pva which were 0 5 5 5 10 5 and 15 5 respectively marked as m0 m1 m2 and m3 it was commonly known as uio 66 nh2 pva composite membrane 2 4 experiment setup the lab scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd device used in this study is shown schematically in fig s1 the system was composed of a dcmd module a water bath a feed tank a permeate tank two peristaltic pumps a chiller a balance and a conductivity meter the flat membrane module which was made of acrylic for an effective membrane area of roughly 4 cm2 2 2 cm due to the actual application of different areas the practical amount of uio 66 nh2 used for m0 m3 was 0 1 6 3 2 and 4 8 mg respectively the feed and the permeate solution of the membrane module were circulated simultaneously at a rate of 50 mm s the temperature of the feed side was maintained at 60 c and the permeate at 10 c under each experiment the feed solution was prepared by the addition of 35 g nacl 1 g hexadecane and 0 1 mm sds to 1 l di water the mixture was then stirred with an ultrasonic machine for 2 h and mixed well to produce a milky white emulsion solution all emulsions were kept stable for several hours at room temperature without significant phase separation permeate conductivity and flux were recorded every 10 min during the experiment initially 100 ml of deionized water was added to the beaker on the permeate side 300 ml and the conductivity of the solution therein was measured with a conductivity meter to monitor the wetting of the membrane pores while the beaker was placed on a digital balance connected to a computer to record the change in flow rate of the permeate 2 5 characterization of the composite membrane the surface and cut morphology of the composite membranes were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy sem fei nova nano sem450 america and combined with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds oxford x max n50 british to further analyze the composition elements of the composite membrane the crystal structure of the mof material and the loading of the material on the composite membranes were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku smartlab9 japan with cu kα radiation the scanning speed was 4 min and the scanning angle range was 5 to 70 the chemical structures of mof materials and composite membranes were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo fisher nicolet is5 america and scanned in the infrared spectral band of 4000 400 cm 1 the chemical composition of the composite membranes was characterized by x ray photoelectron spectrometry xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi america it was then to further analyze the chemical state and structure of the elements in the composite membrane four elements carbon c oxygen o nitrogen n and zirconium zr were scanned separately in narrow regions to obtain more accurate peak positions and better peak shapes the water contact angle wca in air and underwater oil contact angle oca of composite membranes were conducted by a contact angle goniometer model 250 rame hart america to ascertain the hydrophobicity hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the membranes 2 6 assessment of membrane performance the pure water flux jw l m2 h of the membrane can be calculated according to the eq 1 1 j w v a t here v is the volume of permeate water l a is the effective area of the membrane m2 and t is the permeation time of water h for each experiment water recovery wr is obtained by eq 2 2 w r 1 v t v 0 100 where v0 l is the initial feed volume and vt l is the volume of feed at time t h the salt rejection can be determined by eq 3 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are denoted as the salt concentration in the feed and permeate solutions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composite materials and membranes fig 2a shows the ftir spectra of ptfe uio 66 nh2 and m0 m3 the characteristic peak at about 1429 cm 1 in the spectra of the ptfe layer can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the c f c group 25 regarding m0 except for the characteristic peak of ptfe a broad peak due to hydroxyl group oh stretching vibration characteristic of pva polymers was present in the region 3500 3000 cm 1 26 the peak at 1385 cm 1 indicated the deposition and cross linking of pva with ga resulting in the presence of alkyl and aldehyde groups and the peak appearing in the 1087 cm 1 band represented the ether bond coc which in this case belonged to the dioxane ring formed by the cross linked pva 27 additionally by comparing m0 the characteristic peaks of uio 66 nh2 appeared in m1 m3 as the uio 66 nh2 content increased the peak transmittance of uio 66 nh2 was relatively increasing specifically the peaks at 3462 and 3351 cm 1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of nh2 respectively 28 since the ligand of uio 66 nh2 was 2 aminoterephthalic acid with an aromatic carboxylic acid the peak at 1573 cm 1 was correlated with symmetric and asymmetric co stretching bonds which was formed by aromatic and carboxyl groups 29 the weak absorption peaks detected at the wavenumbers 1659 and 1496 cm 1 were attributed to the ch symmetric stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group and the typical vibration of the cc stretching in the benzene ring in the bdc ligand respectively 30 in addition the binding between aromatic carbon and nitrogen cn can be noticed at 1385 cm 1 the main bands at 769 664 572 and 483 cm 1 were attributed to the oh and ch bending vibration modes mixed with low frequency zro modes 31 the above findings indicated the successful combination of uio 66 nh2 and pva on ptfe membranes fig 2b shows the xrd spectra of uio 66 nh2 ptfe and m0 m3 membranes it can be seen that there were three diffraction peaks of uio 66 nh2 at 2θ 7 32 8 46 and 25 7 corresponding to 111 200 and 600 crystal planes respectively in agreement with the results reported in the literature 32 indicating that the synthesis of uio 66 nh2 was successful the characteristic diffraction peak of ptfe appeared near the position of 2θ 18 37 refer to the standard mapping pdf 54 1595 the characteristic peak of pva was at 2θ 18 1 33 which represented the typical crystalline phase of pva chains and almost coincided with the characteristic peak of ptfe diffraction peaks in the range of 2θ 21 74 27 40 were related to the support layer of the ptfe membrane with the cellulose liner layer with the comparison of the five membranes the characteristic peaks of uio 66 nh2 were found to appear in m1 m3 and the characteristic peaks increased relatively with the addition of uio 66 nh2 content the xrd spectra further showed that uio 66 nh2 and pva adhered to the ptfe membrane successfully fig 3a clearly shows the sem image of uio 66 nh2 wherein a regular octahedral structure was observed with a well controlled crystal size between 100 and 150 nm fig 3b f exhibits the surface micromorphology of different composite membranes from a visual perspective the surface of the ptfe primary membrane was fibrous with a web like nodular structure of fibers which was produced during the co stretching manufacturing process pore sizes in the micron range were observed on the surface of the original ptfe membrane but cannot be found in the smooth and dense hydrogel layer surface after the addition of pva the addition of uio 66 nh2 further modified the structure of the membrane surface which was due to the urethane uio 66 nh2 with a larger diameter exhibiting the octahedral crystal structure and tended to agglomerate with each other thus reducing its surface tension different degrees of aggregation of uio 66 nh2 were observed on the m1 m3 surface uio 66 nh2 with 5 mg addition in the m1 sample was not uniformly dispersed on the membrane surface and did not completely cover the surface forming larger membrane pores on the surface and reducing the barrier effect on oil and surfactant which may lead to a lower retention rate m2 with 10 mg uio 66 nh2 dosage exhibited a relatively uniform distribution and suitable pores in the sem image the overloading of uio 66 nh2 on m3 seemed to block most of the membrane pores and agglomerated on the membrane inversely affecting the membrane flux the comparison results revealed that uio 66 nh2 was uniformly distributed on the surface of m2 which might facilitate oil water separation hence a potential choice for the removal of high concentration salt solutions containing oil and surfactants was considered for m2 fig 3g i shows the corresponding elements and distribution of the m2 membrane surface and membrane cross section as shown in the sem cross section of m2 uio 66 nh2 pva was uniformly loaded on the ptfe membrane further analysis of the distribution of zr and f elements in the cross section by eds mapping technique it revealed that most of the zr element was above the f element suggesting that the uio 66 nh2 pva material loaded on the surface of the ptfe membrane did not penetrate into the interior of the ptfe layer no destruction on the structure of the hydrophobic membrane was observed during the membrane modification but rather an asymmetric janus structure with the ptfe membrane composed of a hydrophilic upper layer and a hydrophobic lower layer the eds analysis on the surface of the m2 membrane is shown in fig s2 wherein zr was related to uio 66 nh2 and c n and o belonged to uio 66 nh2 pva and ptfe combined with fig 3i it was found that the distribution of c n o and zr elements on the ptfe membrane was quite uniform indicating that the hydrophilic layer formed was homogeneous and beneficial to the oil water emulsion separation fig 4a represents the full xps spectrum of the m2 sample for the preliminary determination of the chemical components of the membrane surface since each membrane had the same elemental composition we took out the optimal m2 for analysis and the xps spectra of the rest of the membranes are shown in fig s4 as can be seen the elements c n o and zr were confirmed to be present in the m2 membrane sample with absorption peaks of 285 15 399 07 532 06 and 188 22 ev for c1s n1s o1s and zr3d respectively 34 fig 4b shows that peaks at 398 97 and 403 51 ev belong to nh2 and nh3 of the n element respectively indicating that a positive charge was displayed by the amino bound proton on uio 66 nh2 and loaded onto the ptfe membrane successfully the peaks centered at 530 04 and 531 84 ev binding energy corresponded to zro and co on the membrane surface were illustrated in fig 4c as shown in the peak results in fig 4d the c1s spectral part of the full spectrum could be decomposed into four types of chemical bond components the four peaks were designated as co co cn and cc bonds in the m2 sample fitted at binding energies of 284 26 285 60 285 85 and 288 01 ev respectively where the co peak at 285 60 ev was attributed to uio 66 nh2 nanoparticles and the co peak at 284 26 ev was attributed to cross linking of pva substrates fig 4e represents the high resolution zr3d peaks including two different peaks observed at the binding energies of 182 27 and 184 62 ev which referred to the two 3d splitting energy levels of the zr element that was zr3d5 2 and zr3d3 2 respectively 35 therefore xps analysis results showed that the preparation of the composite membrane was prepared successfully 3 2 membrane performance evaluation 3 2 1 surface wettability of the membranes the surface wettability was also reflected in the hydrophilicity of the membrane the water contact angle was quantified by measuring the image of water droplets on the membrane in which a wca less than 90 represented its hydrophilic characteristics fig s3 systematically compared the membrane wettability of ptfe and m0 m3 and the surface wettability of the composite membrane was significantly different from that of the control it can be seen that the wca of the ptfe membrane was 132 3 showed hydrophobicity while the wac of m0 m3 with the addition of uio 66 nh2 and pva was 68 8 56 6 54 0 and 50 4 respectively with excellent hydrophilicity hydrophilic membrane surfaces in aqueous environments could form a layer of water on the surface preventing most organic contaminants such as oil from coming into contact and accumulating on the membrane surface thus improving its fouling resistance furthermore there were more hydrophilic groups on the surface with the increase of uio 66 nh2 and thus the wca decreased resulting in a more hydrophilic surface considering a strong correlation between oca and membrane contamination we also measured underwater oca to further investigate the availability of the composite membrane for oil water separation the ptfe membrane in fig s3 shows an underwater oca of 48 4 due to its underwater lipophilicity which can be attributed to the strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between the low surface energy membrane material and the oil droplets in contrast m0 m3 were highly oleophobic underwater with oca of 118 8 123 7 130 1 and 130 4 respectively exhibiting excellent underwater oleophobicity which was expected to achieve oil water separation this underwater oleophobicity can be explained by the strong repulsive hydration forces experienced with the oil droplets 36 trying to wet the hydrophilic uio 66 nh2 pva coated surface 3 2 2 simultaneous fouling and wetting resistance of the uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane a 35 g l nacl feed solution containing 1000 mg l hexadecane oil and 0 1 mm sds surfactant was tested on pristine ptfe membranes and dense uio 66 nh2 pva janus membranes to evaluate their fouling and wetting resistance the variations of permeate conductivity and flux as shown in fig 5a b during the first hour of operation the five membranes were treated with a solution containing only 35 g l nacl feed and the conductivity was basically around 4 μs cm indicating that all membranes had an excellent desalination effect with the addition of 1 g l hexadecane and 0 1 mm sds to the feed solution the pristine ptfe membrane was immediately fouled and wetted reflected by a rapid decline in vapor flux and salt rejection specifically the flux decreased rapidly from 23 3 to 2 3 l m2 h within 1 h and almost no flux thereafter and the conductivity even increased to 525 μs cm indicating that the performance of the ptfe membrane was deteriorated due to the presence of surfactants and oil substances the addition of sds significantly reduced the surface tension of the feed solution which also decreased the lep of the membrane pores making the membrane pores no longer sieve and the salt molecules easily pass through the membrane pores thus increasing the conductivity also due to the interaction between oil and hydrophobic membrane hexadecane droplets adhered to the membrane pore surface hence blocking the membrane pore and causing a rapid decrease in flux the wetted membrane pores allowed the feed solution to pass as a liquid resulting in lower salt rejection and higher conductivity on the permeate side compared to the ptfe membrane m0 m3 membranes showed relatively better fouling and wetting resistance during the initial 12 h of dcmd operation as evidenced by stable vapor flux and high salt retention rates m0 as the control group with pva modification only was able to have good resistance to fouling and wetting in the early stage of the operation 15 h and compared to the ptfe membrane the flux even slightly increased to 24 1 l m2 h although pva was also a hydrophilic substance in this experiment it only played the role of a cross linking agent and the swelling phenomenon occurred in water for a long time running despite the chemical modification of pva with glutaraldehyde the swelling in water would still reach a minimum of 14 37 after 15 h of experimental operation due to the problem of swelling of pva the sds passed through the gaps between the pva layers and came into contact with the ptfe membrane thus causing the conductivity to rise reaching 90 5 μs cm after 24 h as the membrane pores became wetted it was found that oil droplets would also adhere to the membrane pores causing membrane contamination and a decrease in flux to 4 9 l m2 h with the addition of uio 66 nh2 the hydrophilic functional groups on the membrane surface kept increasing and uio 66 nh2 nanoparticles could act as a solid crosslinking agent to inhibit the movement of pva chains which made the binding of uio 66 nh2 to pva stronger it was worth noting that the uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane was also swollen by water molecules due to hydrogen bonding however the increase in the loading level of uio 66 nh2 nanoparticles could effectively improve the anti swelling property of pva hybrid membranes 38 m1 still suffered from a small amount of pva swelling due to the addition of only 1 6 mg of uio 66 nh2 which did not bind firmly enough with pva and had a less uniform distribution on the membrane surface also due to the size of uio 66 nh2 of 100 150 nm the presence of uio 66 nh2 led to the reduction and shrinkage of membrane pores it can be seen that the flux of m1 decreased slightly to 22 4 l m2 h due to the presence of an additional layer of hydrophilic material on the surface in the presence of uio 66 nh2 only after 19 h did signs of membrane fouling and wetting appear with a final conductivity of 43 7 μs cm and flux of 10 9 l m2 h after 24 h m2 and m3 bound more strongly to pva and can retard the problem of pva swelling but the problem with m3 was the presence of an aggregation effect due to excess uio 66 nh2 adsorbed on the membrane which clogged the membrane pores and thus significantly reduced the flux while the conductivity had been kept below 10 μs cm the flux was only 14 7 l m2 h which was 63 of the flux of the pristine ptfe membrane treating salt solution and failed to meet the ideal requirements by comparison as inferred earlier m2 was the best for treating high salinity wastewater containing surfactants and oil substances the conductivity remained below 10 μs cm during 24 h of operation which indicated a good anti wetting effect the initial flux slightly decreased due to the slight agglomeration of uio 66 nh2 with a running flux of 21 3 l m2 h which was 91 4 of the running flux of ptfe membrane treating only salt solution after 24 h of operation the vapor flux slightly decreased to 18 2 l m2 h by the accumulation of oil on the membrane surface due to emulsification 39 but still reached 86 of the initial performance it was worth sacrificing a little flux to be able to achieve both fouling and wetting resistance 3 3 fouling and wetting resistance mechanism of the uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane the sds shown in fig 6a consisted of a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail it was well known that the presence of surfactants such as sds would reduce the surface tension of the solution hence causing the membrane wetting phenomena 40 when sds encountered a ptfe membrane the hydrophobic tail came into contact with the hydrophobic membrane surface due to the hydrophobic effect resulting in the hydrophilic head facing the solution the affinity of sds ptfe reduced the surface tension at the orifice thereby increasing the likelihood of exceeding the lep which was defined as the critical pressure required for the liquid before it could enter the non wetting membrane as soon as the water pressure imposed during the dcmd procedure exceeded the lep the raw material solution containing sds began to invade the membrane pores resulting in membrane wetting in addition to membrane wetting the presence of oil substances also affected membrane performance wherein the interaction between oil droplets and the hydrophobic membrane surface determined the fouling tendency considering the highly hydrophobic characteristics for both oil droplets and the ptfe membrane when oil droplets approached the membrane surface the ptfe membrane had a strong adhesion to the oil droplets which penetrated and thus blocked the membrane pore with almost no permeation flux as the co existence of surfactant and oil substances sds reduced the interfacial tension between oil and water making part of oil droplets hydrophilic these droplets would combine with the membrane pores that were wetted under the action of hydrophilic groups which likewise led to the serious blockage of the membrane pores as the wetting progressed salt molecules were also continuously transported with permeate flow leading to a rapid increase in conductivity the uio 66 nh2 layer covered by pva as a cross linking agent modified the surface of the ptfe membrane and formed a hydrophilic layer on its surface considering pva itself as a hydrophilic substance and uio 66 nh2 with a hydrophilic group nh2 the hydrophilicity of the uio 66 nh2 pva janus membrane could be further improved the hydrophilic head of sds as shown in fig 6b was in contact with the hydrophilic surface of the janus membrane which would inhibit sds to pass through the hydrophilic layer directly and reach the ptfe membrane in such conditions the lep of the membrane pores was maintained to ensure that the ptfe membrane substrate remained unwetted moreover the hydrophilic layer exhibited repulsive force to oil droplets which was not conducive to the adhesion and diffusion of oil droplets thus providing efficient resistance to membrane fouling membrane pore size was another key factor that also had an impact on mitigating membrane fouling and wetting reducing surface pore size and porosity could increase lep and thus retarded the wetting process 41 which also explained the slight decrease in membrane flux with loading of the mof material the distribution of m2 membrane pore size is shown in fig s5 4 conclusion in summary the janus composite membranes were prepared by vacuum filtration self assembly on microporous ptfe membranes using pva and uio 66 nh2 as modified materials the prepared uio 66 nh2 pva base layer enabled the bilayer membrane to a hydrophobic heterogeneous structure which had a positive effect on the membrane s resistance to fouling and wetting in the dcmd process operation when treating 3 5 nacl solution the salt rejection rate was almost 99 9 for all dual layer membranes especially m2 stood out for its excellent chemical stability and high retention rate when treated the feed solution containing surfactants and oils with the conductivity of 9 21 μs cm over 24 h and the flux was stable at 21 3 l m2 h a hydrophilic layer formed by pva and uio 66 nh2 prevented sds and hexadecane from membrane fouling and wetting due to hydrophobic effects overall a new feasible dual layer membrane design was proposed that promised to enable high performance dcmd applications and we believed that the new method of achieving both fouling and wetting resistance would offer a way to design highly operable dcmd membranes declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no

12918,water depth consisting of supernatant height and granule bed height is a key parameter for the non aerated microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs since it is closely related to food to microorganism f m ratio and light intensity this study evaluated the effect of water depth on pollutants removal by mbgs using kinetic analysis the results showed that the reduction of pollutants followed first order reaction kinetic under f m ratios of 0 177 0 273 g cod g vss d but being poor at a lower f m ratio of 0 084 g cod g vss d moreover it was found that the light intensity of the granule bed surface could strongly affect the rate of pollutant degradation and granule bed surface light intensities from 115 to 250 μ mol m2 s were within the tolerable range of mbgs furthermore water depth was eclucidated under outdoor light conditions indicating that the desirable water depth might be 9 50 cm with the granule bed height of no more than 5 cm for mbgs this study adds insights into the water depth for the non aerated mbgs process which is expected to be an important guideline for the further application of mbgs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords supernatant height granule bed height light attenuation f m ratio kinetic 1 introduction microalgae based high rate algal ponds hraps have been applied for energy saving wastewater treatment 1 and resource recovery 2 however the hydraulic retention time at the biomass collection was around 1 2 days 3 therefore microalgal bacterial flocs were developed to implement the functions and collection of microalgae 4 to further improve the microalgal bacterial process the non aerated microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs process has recently been developed paying increasing attention to its energy efficiency

microplastics 15 responded to the non aerated mbgs in addition comprehensive reviews of mbgs have been presented which also clarify the obstacles to be overcome and further research efforts 5 6 16 17 19 while the main operating conditions for mbgs process have not been fully understood till now water depth is critical to the practical application of non aerated mbgs on the one hand water depth affects light intensity further affecting pollutant removal performance lipid production and microbial diversity 8 20 21 it has been reported that the non aerated mbgs can achieve remarkable performance at a surface light intensity of 210 μ mol m2 s 8 however excessive light intensity can also lead to photoinhibition which is detrimental to algae growth 22 on the other hand water depth also affects the reactor s food to microorganism f m ratio which has significant impact on the granulation settleability removal performance and microbial diversity of granular sludge 23 24 for hraps the optimal depth range under various operating conditions is identified to be 15 100 cm 25 26 however there is little knowledge on how water depth affects the emerging mbgs process kinetic models are generally utilized to discuss biodegradation optimization and prediction with rate constants commonly used to estimate the rate of pollutant degradation 27 in the past decades biodegradation kinetics of activated sludge have been established and widely applied 28 29 followed by aerobic granular sludge in terms of microbial growth pollutant removal kinetic parameters granulation oxygen transfer and multiscale modeling have driven the optimization and development of this process 30 32 however for the mbgs process the above kinetic modeling studies are limited 33 which hinder its further application as described above water depth is a critical parameter to determine the light intensity and f m ratio which can play a key role in the operation of mbgs process therefore this study aimed to investigate the impacts of water depth on mbgs process by kinetic analysis of pollutants degradation while investigating light attenuations in supernatant and granule bed furthermore the water depth including granule bed height of mbgs was predicted under the outdoor light conditions which is an essential guide for promoting the future application of mbgs 2 materials and methods 2 1 medium

setup the mbgs used in this experiment is from our previous study 34 with an average diameter of about 1 1 mm the detailed granular characteristics including 5 min sludge volume index svi5 and volatile suspended solids vss were shown in table s1 the open cylindrical glass reactor was 11 6 cm high and 3 6 cm in diameter with a total volume of about 118 ml the reactors were constantly exposed to full spectrum light emitting diode led light to test the light attenuation the light intensities at different heights of synthetic wastewater 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 cm and granule 0 0 8 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 2 3 7 4 4 5 0 cm were measured respectively the initial dissolved oxygen do concentration was about 4 mg l and the ph of the influent was about 7 the reaction time was set at 12 h while the reactor effluent was collected every 2 h and then passed through a 0 45 μm filter for further analysis this study was conducted at a constant room temperature of around 22 c 2 3 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p vss and svi5 concentrations were tested using standard methods 35 the ph values and do concentrations were monitored with a ph meter starter3100 ohaus usa and a jpb 607a do meter shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china respectively the granules size distribution analysis was carried out using a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 usa the light intensity was measured with a light quantum meter tes 1339p china the specific pollutant removal rate sprr was calculated as described 36 2 4 kinetic analysis 2 4 1 basic kinetic models basic kinetic models mainly included zero and first order reactions the general matrix degradation rate differential equation 27 was given by eq 1 1 dc dt k c n that can be integrated the integration limits of integration were taken as c c 0 and c at t 0 and t t respectively as eq 2 2 dc c n k dt for zero order kinetic the differential and integrated form of zero order degradation kinetics were given by eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 dc dt k 4 c 0 c t kt for first order kinetic the differential and integrated form of kinetics were given by eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 dc dt kc 6 in c 0 c t kt where c t mg l is the pollutant concentration at time t h c 0 mg l is the pollutant concentration at the beginning and k is the rate constant h 1 values of r2 were generally used to assess the reasonableness of the kinetic fit 37 r2 0 5 indicated a weak relationship between the data and the model while 0 5 r2 0 8 indicated insufficient data model fit and r2 0 8 a good fit between the data and the model represented 2 4 2 light attenuation model the light intensity was used as a model variable to model the degree of light attenuation by relating supernatant height and granule bed height according to the lambert beer s law eq 7 38 7 i i 0 e kx where i is the light intensity μ mol m2 s at the supernatant height or granule bed height cm i 0 is the incident light intensity μ mol m2 s at the supernatant or granule bed surface k is the light attenuation coefficient cm 1 and x is the supernatant height or granule bed height cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 light attenuation the light attenuation models in this study included both in supernatant and granule bed attenuation since significant stratification of granule and supernatant fig s1 that differed from the light attenuation mode of the suspended algal bacterial consortia 39 figs 1d and 4d indicated that the light intensity decreased exponentially rapidly with increasing supernatant and granule bed height based on the fitting results of lambert beer s law model it can be found that the light attenuation coefficient was much higher in granule bed kg 0 50 cm 1 than in supernatant ks 0 056 cm 1 indicating that the light intensity was attenuated faster in granule bed compared to supernatant previous study indicated that the light attenuation coefficients kd of hrap treating high and moderate nutrient load wastewater were respective 40 6 m 1 and 31 5 m 1 40 which were between the light attenuation coefficients of supernatant and granule bed in this study moreover the light intensity at 3 6 and 9 cm underwater was about 84 5 71 5 and 60 4 of the water surface light intensity respectively meanwhile the light intensity at 1 2 and 3 cm granule bed height was about 60 8 36 8 and 22 4 of the granule bed surface light intensity respectively apparently light intensity was strongly negatively correlated with supernatant and granule bed height in addition light transmission could also be affected by substrate color 41 granule size 18 and biomass concentration 42 etc 3 2 impact of supernatant height on mbgs for wastewater treatment and kinetic analysis 3 2 1 f m ratio supernatant height affected the f m ratios which were 0 084 0 177 and 0 273 g cod g vss d for supernatant heights of 3 6 and 9 cm respectively nutrient removal performance was evaluated at various f m ratios to monitor mbgs load tolerance and further determine desired supernatant height range as observed from the variations of pollutants concentrations fig s2 the f m ratios from 0 084 to 0 273 g cod g vss d were within the tolerable loading of mbgs however it was worth noting that the sprrs of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p were related to the f m ratio as shown in fig 1a c the sprrs at f m ratios of 0 177 and 0 273 g cod g vss d were comparable and both significantly higher than at a f m ratio of 0 084 g cod g vss d consequently it was reasonable to assume that supernatant heights of 6 and 9 cm would be preferable to 3 cm for mbgs in this study when the granule bed height was consistent to further analyze the pattern of mbgs degraded pollutants at different f m ratios the variation of pollutant concentrations over time was fitted to the first order kinetics according to eqs 5 and 6 fig 2 shows the kinetic fits and their goodness of fit for cod nh4 n and po4 3 p at different f m ratios overall first order kinetics can fit well the degradation of pollutants by mbgs as shown in fig 2d the reduction of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations exhibited a good kinetic fit r2 0 9 for the first order reaction at f m ratios of 0 177 and 0 273 g cod g vss d however for a f m ratio of 0 084 g cod g vss d insufficient fitting of first order reaction kinetics 0 5 r2 0 8 for the reduction of nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations was found it can be concluded that the degradation of pollutants by mbgs followed first order reaction kinetics at higher f m ratios and poorly at lower f m ratios in other words the goodness of fit of the first order kinetics of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p degradation by mbgs at supernatant heights of 6 cm and 9 cm was higher than at 3 cm furthermore studies had found that the degradation of several pollutants followed first order pseudo kinetics 43 44 therefore in order to satisfy the first order kinetics of the reaction as much as possible the supernatant height range should be controlled within 6 9 cm in this study based on the above discussion on the one hand regarding the pollutant removal volume analysis more effluent was removed efficiently simultaneously at the f m ratios of 6 cm and 9 cm on the other hand taking into account the goodness of fit of kinetic degradation of pollutants with f m ratios at 6 cm and 9 cm corresponded more to the first order kinetics in summary at a granule bed surface light intensity of 250 μ mol m2 s the supernatant height range of 6 9 cm was superior to that of 3 cm 3 2 2 light intensity supernatant height also affected light intensity with granule bed surface light intensities at 3 6 and 9 cm supernatant heights being 125 120 and 115 μ mol m2 s respectively as can be seen from table 1 excellent pollutant removals cod 85 nh4 n 92 po4 3 p 90 were achieved at granule bed surface light intensities of 115 120 and 125 μ mol m2 s indicating that all three light intensities for mbgs were feasible in addition the near linearity of the pollutant concentration versus time data at different light intensities fig s3 indicated that the rate of pollutant degradation was governed by zero order kinetics eqs 3 and 4 as expected for all cases the degradations of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p by mbgs were found to fit well with zero order kinetics fig 3a c as the requirement of r2 coefficient values not less than 0 8 was satisfied r2 0 904 in this study 45 as shown in fig 3d the rate constants increased from 13 11 to 42 74 for cod from 1 61 to 4 73 for nh4 n and from 0 18 to 0 66 for po4 3 p when the light intensity of the granule bed surface increased from 115 to 125 μ mol m2 s then it can be deduced that the rate constants of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p increased with increasing light intensity of the granule bed surface since a higher rate constant value means a faster reaction rate 46 this meant that the higher the light intensity of the granule bed surface the faster the pollutant degradation however after reaction the effluent concentrations of all reactors were essentially the same while nh4 n and po4 3 p were almost completely degraded fig s3 further proving that pollutant degradation was facilitated by the corresponding increase in light intensity 8 interestingly it can be found that even a slight increase of granule bed surface light intensity remarkably promoted the degradation rate of pollutants which differed from the effect of the apparent light intensity 8 20 21 thus it appeared that the light intensity of the granule bed surface could significantly affect the rate of pollutant degradation 3 3 effect of granule bed height on mbgs for wastewater treatment granule bed height affected light intensity and f m ratio table 1 both of which decreased with increasing height as can be observed from fig 4a c the sprrs of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p decreased with increasing granule bed height notably the sprrs of pollutants were higher at 1 2 and 3 cm granule bed heights than at 5 and 7 cm however it was evident from fig 4a c and table 1 that both of the sprrs and removals of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p were almost identical when the granule bed heights were 5 and 7 cm implying that these two heights of mbgs exhibited comparable removal performance this implied that with a granule bed height of up to 5 cm a further increase in the granule bed height for mbgs in pollutant degradation no longer made sense in addition it was found from table 1 that the removals of cod for granule bed height of 1 2 and 3 cm were remarkably lower than those for 5 and 7 cm but the removals of nh4 n and po4 3 p were slightly better than those for 5 and 7 cm moreover when the light intensity of the granule bed surface was 250 μ mol m2 s the maximum penetrable granule bed height was around 4 4 cm fig 4d therefore the granule bed height for mbgs should not exceed 5 cm at a granule bed surface light intensity of 250 μ mol m2 s 3 4 prediction of water depth for mbgs at outdoor light intensity fig 5 responded to the prediction of water depth including supernatant height and granule bed height for mbgs treated wastewater under different outdoor light intensities as mentioned before the granule bed surface light intensity from 115 to 250 μ mol m2 s were feasible for mbgs in this study according to statistics the seasonal daily average light intensity in southwestern france was about 419 spring and 430 summer μ mol m2 s 47 apparently the water surface light intensities in spring and summer in this area was similar to that in the present study with the supernatant height set at about 23 cm when the granule bed surface light intensity of 115 μ mol m2 s was attenuated for light intensities of 301 1411 μ mol m2 s from january to december in spain 48 the supernatant height range of 17 45 cm could possibly be determined when the light intensity attenuating to the granule bed surface was 115 μ mol m2 s for natural light intensity of 140 600 μ mol m2 s in autumn and winter in wuhan 9 the height range of supernatant may potentially be set approximately 4 29 cm to reach the granule bed surface light intensity of 115 μ mol m2 s based on the seasonal outdoor light intensity distribution in the above areas the desirable supernatant height range for mbgs in practical applications might actually be determined to be 4 45 cm while the granule bed height range for mbgs wastewater treatment was no more than 5 cm therefore the water depth range for mbgs under outdoor light intensity conditions might be determined to be in the range of 9 50 cm which could cover the optimal water depth of 20 cm for hraps 49 eventually the light intensity supernatant height granule bed height plot shown in fig 5 can be conveniently applied to regulate the water depth and granule bed height of mbgs in practice it should be noted that stirring would further increase the range of water depth in practice stirring can promote the formation of light dark cycle flashing light effect in the reactor which allowed the granules to absorb nearby light to further improve the light to biomass conversion efficiency 50 52 furthermore stirring can accelerate sufficient contact and mixing of substrate and granules increasing the rate of exchange of nutrients and metabolites in the boundary layer of granules 53 this suggested that the f m ratio could be further raised by stirring it should also be noted that the water quality might affect the attenuation of light intensity for real wastewater due to turbidity and chromaticity 41 54 in addition granule bed surface light intensities less than 115 μ mol m2 s would also probably be feasible for mbgs which needs further investigation given the results of this study future work on mbgs should be dedicated to outdoor practical applications for real wastewater treatment with stirring 4 conclusions this study revealed that f m ratios from 0 084 to 0 273 g cod g vss d and granule bed surface light intensities from 115 to 250 μ mol m2 s were within the tolerable range of mbgs however it was found that the first order kinetic fits of pollutants were better at higher f m ratios than the lower one besides it also appeared that the pollutant degradation rate was strongly positively correlated with the granule bed surface light intensity more importantly the desirable water depth range of 9 50 cm and granule bed height that should not exceed 5 cm have been established for mbgs in practical applications lastly further work should be devoted to the study of the practical application

the incident light intensity μ mol m2 s at the supernatant or granule bed surface k is the light attenuation coefficient cm 1 and x is the supernatant height or granule bed height cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 light attenuation the light attenuation models in this study included both in supernatant and granule bed attenuation since significant stratification of granule and supernatant fig s1 that differed from the light attenuation mode of the suspended algal bacterial consortia 39 figs 1d and 4d indicated that the light intensity decreased exponentially rapidly with increasing supernatant and granule bed height based on the fitting results of lambert beer s law model it can be found that the light attenuation coefficient was much higher in granule bed kg 0 50 cm 1 than in supernatant ks 0 056 cm 1 indicating that the light intensity was attenuated faster in granule bed compared to supernatant previous study indicated that the light attenuation coefficients kd of hrap treating high and moderate nutrient load wastewater were respective 40 6 m 1 and 31 5 m 1 40 which were between the light attenuation coefficients of supernatant and granule bed in this study moreover the light intensity at 3 6 and 9 cm underwater was about 84 5 71 5 and 60 4 of the water surface light intensity respectively meanwhile the light intensity at 1 2 and 3 cm granule bed height was about 60 8 36 8 and 22 4 of the granule bed surface light intensity respectively apparently light intensity was strongly negatively correlated with supernatant and granule bed height in addition light transmission could also be affected by substrate color 41 granule size 18 and biomass concentration 42 etc 3 2 impact of supernatant height on mbgs for wastewater treatment and kinetic analysis 3 2 1 f m ratio supernatant height affected the f m ratios which were 0 084 0 177 and 0 273 g cod g vss d for supernatant heights of 3 6 and 9 cm respectively nutrient removal performance was evaluated at various f m ratios to monitor mbgs load tolerance and further determine desired supernatant height range as observed from the variations of pollutants concentrations fig s2 the f m ratios from 0 084 to 0 273 g cod g vss d were within the tolerable loading of mbgs however it was worth noting that the sprrs of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p were related to the f m ratio as shown in fig 1a c the sprrs at f m ratios of 0 177 and 0 273 g cod g vss d were comparable and both significantly higher than at a f m ratio of 0 084 g cod g vss d consequently it was reasonable to assume that supernatant heights of 6 and 9 cm would be preferable to 3 cm for mbgs in this study when the granule bed height was consistent to further analyze the pattern of mbgs degraded pollutants at different f m ratios the variation of pollutant concentrations over time was fitted to the first order kinetics according to eqs 5 and 6 fig 2 shows the kinetic fits and their goodness of fit for cod nh4 n and po4 3 p at different f m ratios overall first order kinetics can fit well the degradation of pollutants by mbgs as shown in fig 2d the reduction of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations exhibited a good kinetic fit r2 0 9 for the first order reaction at f m ratios of 0 177 and 0 273 g cod g vss d however for a f m ratio of 0 084 g cod g vss d insufficient fitting of first order reaction kinetics 0 5 r2 0 8 for the reduction of nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations was found it can be concluded that the degradation of pollutants by mbgs followed first order reaction kinetics at higher f m ratios and poorly at lower f m ratios in other words the goodness of fit of the first order kinetics of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p degradation by mbgs at supernatant heights of 6 cm and 9 cm was higher than at 3 cm furthermore studies had found that the degradation of several pollutants followed first order pseudo kinetics 43 44 therefore in order to satisfy the first order kinetics of the reaction as much as possible the supernatant height range should be controlled within 6 9 cm in this study based on the above discussion on the one hand regarding the pollutant removal volume analysis more effluent was removed efficiently simultaneously at the f m ratios of 6 cm and 9 cm on the other hand taking into account the goodness of fit of kinetic degradation of pollutants with f m ratios at 6 cm and 9 cm corresponded more to the first order kinetics in summary at a granule bed surface light intensity of 250 μ mol m2 s the supernatant height range of 6 9 cm was superior to that of 3 cm 3 2 2 light intensity supernatant height also affected light intensity with granule bed surface light intensities at 3 6 and 9 cm supernatant heights being 125 120 and 115 μ mol m2 s respectively as can be seen from table 1 excellent pollutant removals cod 85 nh4 n 92 po4 3 p 90 were achieved at granule bed surface light intensities of 115 120 and 125 μ mol m2 s indicating that all three light intensities for mbgs were feasible in addition the near linearity of the pollutant concentration versus time data at different light intensities fig s3 indicated that the rate of pollutant degradation was governed by zero order kinetics eqs 3 and 4 as expected for all cases the degradations of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p by mbgs were found to fit well with zero order kinetics fig 3a c as the requirement of r2 coefficient values not less than 0 8 was satisfied r2 0 904 in this study 45 as shown in fig 3d the rate constants increased from 13 11 to 42 74 for cod from 1 61 to 4 73 for nh4 n and from 0 18 to 0 66 for po4 3 p when the light intensity of the granule bed surface increased from 115 to 125 μ mol m2 s then it can be deduced that the rate constants of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p increased with increasing light intensity of the granule bed surface since a higher rate constant value means a faster reaction rate 46 this meant that the higher the light intensity of the granule bed surface the faster the pollutant degradation however after reaction the effluent concentrations of all reactors were essentially the same while nh4 n and po4 3 p were almost completely degraded fig s3 further proving that pollutant degradation was facilitated by the corresponding increase in light intensity 8 interestingly it can be found that even a slight increase of granule bed surface light intensity remarkably promoted the degradation rate of pollutants which differed from the effect of the apparent light intensity 8 20 21 thus it appeared that the light intensity of the granule bed surface could significantly affect the rate of pollutant degradation 3 3 effect of granule bed height on mbgs for wastewater treatment granule bed height affected light intensity and f m ratio table 1 both of which decreased with increasing height as can be observed from fig 4a c the sprrs of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p decreased with increasing granule bed height notably the sprrs of pollutants were higher at 1 2 and 3 cm granule bed heights than at 5 and 7 cm however it was evident from fig 4a c and table 1 that both of the sprrs and removals of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p were almost identical when the granule bed heights were 5 and 7 cm implying that these two heights of mbgs exhibited comparable removal performance this implied that with a granule bed height of up to 5 cm a further increase in the granule bed height for mbgs in pollutant degradation no longer made sense in addition it was found from table 1 that the removals of cod for granule bed height of 1 2 and 3 cm were remarkably lower than those for 5 and 7 cm but the removals of nh4 n and po4 3 p were slightly better than those for 5 and 7 cm moreover when the light intensity of the granule bed surface was 250 μ mol m2 s the maximum penetrable granule bed height was around 4 4 cm fig 4d therefore the granule bed height for mbgs should not exceed 5 cm at a granule bed surface light intensity of 250 μ mol m2 s 3 4 prediction of water depth for mbgs at outdoor light intensity fig 5 responded to the prediction of water depth including supernatant height and granule bed height for mbgs treated wastewater under different outdoor light intensities as mentioned before the granule bed surface light intensity from 115 to 250 μ mol m2 s were feasible for mbgs in this study according to statistics the seasonal daily average light intensity in southwestern france was about 419 spring and 430 summer μ mol m2 s 47 apparently the water surface light intensities in spring and summer in this area was similar to that in the present study with the supernatant height set at about 23 cm when the granule bed surface light intensity of 115 μ mol m2 s was attenuated for light intensities of 301 1411 μ mol m2 s from january to december in spain 48 the supernatant height range of 17 45 cm could possibly be determined when the light intensity attenuating to the granule bed surface was 115 μ mol m2 s for natural light intensity of 140 600 μ mol m2 s in autumn and winter in wuhan 9 the height range of supernatant may potentially be set approximately 4 29 cm to reach the granule bed surface light intensity of 115 μ mol m2 s based on the seasonal outdoor light intensity distribution in the above areas the desirable supernatant height range for mbgs in practical applications might actually be determined to be 4 45 cm while the granule bed height range for mbgs wastewater treatment was no more than 5 cm therefore the water depth range for mbgs under outdoor light intensity conditions might be determined to be in the range of 9 50 cm which could cover the optimal water depth of 20 cm for hraps 49 eventually the light intensity supernatant height granule bed height plot shown in fig 5 can be conveniently applied to regulate the water depth and granule bed height of mbgs in practice it should be noted that stirring would further increase the range of water depth in practice stirring can promote the formation of light dark cycle flashing light effect in the reactor which allowed the granules to absorb nearby light to further improve the light to biomass conversion efficiency 50 52 furthermore stirring can accelerate sufficient contact and mixing of substrate and granules increasing the rate of exchange of nutrients and metabolites in the boundary layer of granules 53 this suggested that the f m ratio could be further raised by stirring it should also be noted that the water quality might affect the attenuation of light intensity for real wastewater due to turbidity and chromaticity 41 54 in addition granule bed surface light intensities less than 115 μ mol m2 s would also probably be feasible for mbgs which needs further investigation given the results of this study future work on mbgs should be dedicated to outdoor practical applications for real wastewater treatment with stirring 4 conclusions this study revealed that f m ratios from 0 084 to 0 273 g cod g vss d and granule bed surface light intensities from 115 to 250 μ mol m2 s were within the tolerable range of mbgs however it was found that the first order kinetic fits of pollutants were better at higher f m ratios than the lower one besides it also appeared that the pollutant degradation rate was strongly positively correlated with the granule bed surface light intensity more importantly the desirable water depth range of 9 50 cm and granule bed height that should not exceed 5 cm have been established for mbgs in practical applications lastly further work should be devoted to the study of the practical application of mbgs under outdoor natural light conditions credit authorship contribution statement yao shen writing original draft validation software investigation data curation formal analysis murat yılmaz

12919,the serious environmental issue caused by the rising levels of microplastics mps pollution has aroused much more attention globally therefore an effective strategy needs to be established to eliminate mps from the water herein we first report the preparation of membranes based on holey reduced graphene oxide h rgo nanosheets for efficient removal of mps in wastewater compared with those untreated rgo the h rgo nanosheets show a porous structure with an average size of 27 3 nm which is a benefit for construction membrane for separation of mps with better water flux 37 19 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 employing the fluorescent polystyrene fp microspheres and ps beads as model mps the as resulted h rgo membranes exhibit extremely high mps removal efficiency of 99 9 in the case of treatment of the industrial mps containing wastewater almost all mps could be captured by the h rgo membranes which were confirmed by stereomicroscope taking advantage of their physicochemical stability and exceptional mps removal efficiency the h rgo membranes may have great potentials for the removal of mps in wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics mps holey reduced graphene oxide h rgo membrane removal efficiency 1 introduction with the rapid improvement of industrialization and urbanization plastics are widely used in various fields as a vital polymer material as there is no proper way to deal with waste plastic in daily life it causes serious white pollution initially the public only focused on the larger plastic fragments in 1972 carpenter et al reported the emergence of small plastic particles in the ocean for the first time which attracted global attention 1 2 until 2004 thompson and others published papers on plastic fragments in ocean waters and sediments and proposed microplastics 3 as proposed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the term mps refers to very small omnipresent plastic particles 5 mm in diameter 4 6 mps represent a highly diverse category of pollutants with different shapes such as spheres fragments and fibers and complex components including polymer materials and chemical mixtures because of its small size mps are easily mistaken for food by many animals if ingested mps will cause physical damage to the digestive system of organisms and eventually die 7 8 mps have a high specific surface area which can adsorb hydrophobic organic pollutants in the environment and form a mobile pollution source 9 mps mainly come from two aspects one is directly introduced through sewage the other is large scale plastic weathering through chemical physical and biological processes 10 because plastic materials are difficult to degrade in the process of aging and weathering they accumulate in the aquatic environment and persist for several years to decades 11 become an important issue of plastic pollution at present though the multi stage treatment of water has been adopted in wastewater treatment plants a large amount of mps will still be discharged into the water system previous studies have shown that 45 of mps can be removed by the primary treatment of wwtps 12 secondary treatment can remove 50 of mps in wastewater 13 approximately 2 of mps can still be detected after the tertiary treatment with a particle size range of less than 20 μm 14 this part of the mps needs to be removed by membrane technology from a practical view of point such complicated multi stage treatment of water heavily restricts its large scale application to address this issue various technologies or materials have been exploited so far for instance various technologies such as coagulation 15 16 extraction 17 and biological degradation 18 19 have been used for mps treatment in addition recently juliane simmchen et al used a photocatalytic tio2 based micromotor for microplastic removal 20 yifa chen et al reported a unique acetone assisted method for the preparation of various zr mof based foam materials and successfully apply them in simulated microplastic removal 21 though great progress have been achieved by these mentioned approach towards efficient mps removal big challenge still remains as these methods have their respective limitations such as inability to handle mps in small sizes or non usable for large mps difficulty in large scale processing high energy consumption or only being capable of operation in specific environment consequently the exploration of innovative strategies for efficient removal of mps in a feasible manner that could be applicable in harsh environmental conditions is highly demanded nanofiltration membrane technology has been widely used for desalination and purification of water bodies 22 24 membrane filtration can effectively prevent the escape of microplastics on basis of the mps size as well as the membrane type and pore structure which is an exceptionally effective way to solve the problem of mps in wastewater luogo et al report two ceramic membranes made by sic and by zro2 and the removal of microplastics from washing wastewater was 99 2 and 98 55 respectively 25 fryczkowska et al report a composite membranes made of polyacrylonitrile with the addition of reduced graphene oxide rgo pan has high rejection efficiency for microplastic removal from industrial wastewater 26 graphene in which carbon atoms are connected by sp2 hybridization has a single layer two dimensional honeycomb lattice structure 27 29 recently graphene has aroused extensive interest due to its unique properties such as large theoretical specific surface areas 30 exceptional mechanical strength 31 tremendous electronic transport properties and superior chemical stability 28 as a kind of excellent 2d nanomaterial graphene have been proven to be significantly valuable for membrane manufacture for separation of dye and heavy metal ions 32 33 oil water emulsion 34 and gas 35 36 which also shows great potential in water treatment 37 39 compare with traditional membrane graphene based membrane have great advantages for their high chemical stability strong hydrophilicity and excellent antifouling properties 40 43 furthermore graphene based membrane is easy to manufacture mechanically robust and amenable to industrial scale production with low cost 40 44 to our knowledge however no investigation involving graphene based membrane for mps removal has been reported to date in viewing of these merits mentioned above the creation of functional graphene based membrane for mps removal should be of special interest in this work we report the preparation of a kind of membranes based on holey reduced graphene oxide h rgo which was obtained by etching the co3o4 nanoparticles embedded on reduced graphene oxide rgo nanosheets followed by a simple vacuum filtration using a polymeric membrane as support for efficient removal of mps in wastewater fig 1 our design lies in the following aspects 1 the unique nanoporous morphology of go nanosheets could not only screen and capture the mps from nano scale to micro scale but also endows the h rgo membrane fast mass transportation with better water reflux by comparison with that of graphene or go based membranes 2 the robust physicochemical stability of graphene makes the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets insensitive to external environments during mps removal which could therefore enlarge their application especially operation in those harsh conditions as a proof of concept study h rgo nanosheets have a porous structure with an average pore diameter of 27 3 nm which is conducive to the construction of mps with better water flux 37 19 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 in this care fp microspheres and ps beads with different diameter sizes were used as the mps model the h rgo membrane shows extremely high mps removal efficiency up to 99 9 under our conditions making it a promising candidate as the functional membrane for practical applications for removal of mps in water by in combination with their simple and scalable fabrication method 2 results and discussion 2 1 fabrication and characterizations the schematic preparation of membranes based on h rgo nanosheets is shown in fig 1a after uniformly mixing go dispersion liquid and co3o4 nanoparticles the aerogel which contains co3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized by the hydrothermal method the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets were finally fabricated by further vacuum infiltration after removal of co via annealing and acid treatment sem and tem characterization can provide the microstructure information of single or multi layer stacked go slices as shown in fig 2a and b a large number of irregularly shaped go plates are stacked against each other to form folds and curls from the sem image of h rgo fig 2d a macroscopic porous structure composed of a network of randomly oriented sheet structures connected to each other can be clearly observed particularly tem fig 2e shows that there are densely distributed pores in the local micro area of the h rgo network in contrast the go surface has no pores characteristic raman spectra are more descriptive for showing the feature of graphene fig 2c the g peak appears near 1580 cm 1 which corresponds to the first order scattering g band of the e2g phonon of sp2 c atoms it is the main characteristic peak of graphene but it is very susceptible to stress and the peak around 1350 cm 1 was derived from the breathing mode of the aromatic rings the d band the d peak is caused by the lattice vibration leaving the center of the brillouin zone it is used to characterize the structural defects or edges in the graphene sample it is usually regarded as the disordered vibration peak of graphene 45 46 the d g intensity ratios of the co rgo and h rgo were higher than that of go 1 67 for co rgo 1 86 for h rgo and 0 99 for go which is consistent with the typical raman spectra of go as shown by the co rgo and h rgo spectra the stronger d band indicates that the co rgo and h rgo samples have more lattice defects than the graphene layer without porosity 47 compared with co rgo the d g intensity ratio of h rgo is higher indicating more defects in the sample which may be due to larger pores after co removal fig 2f shows the xrd patterns of rgo co rgo and h rgo go has obvious diffraction peaks at 10 9 48 and the d spacing is 0 99 nm this interlayer spacing indicates that the graphite is absolutely converted into go this d spacing increase is due to the intercalation of oh and other functional groups in between the graphene layers the strongest peak after go reduction is located at 21 9 and the d spacing is 0 41 nm this decrease in d spacing is due to the elimination of a large number of oxygen containing groups by the reduction reaction 49 50 the strongest diffraction peak at 44 24 and 51 52 was attributed to the formation of metal co particles 51 it indicates that co particles are embedded into the rgo sheet layer after co rgo calcination the above peak disappeared in h rgo indicating that co particles were removed after acid treatment the pore structure of the sample is further confirmed by nitrogen adsorption and desorption technique based on barrett joyner halenda model the analysis of the result of the go co rgo and h rgo were shown in fig s1 the nitrogen adsorption and desorption of go fig s1a show a type iv isotherm and retain h1 hysteresis with a mesoporous structure the obvious hysteresis loop at p p0 in the range of 0 4 1 0 also indicates that the material has a mesoporous structure the pore size distribution of go is mainly concentrated between 1 8 nm 5 nm and is provided as an insert the nitrogen adsorption desorption of co rgo fig s1b and h rgo fig s1c also type iv isotherms compared with go which has a narrower hysteresis loop the pore size distribution is mainly concentrated in 1 8 nm 5 nm and 25 50 nm there are also some large holes it shows that co rgo and h rgo may retain the nanopores in go and can also produce mesoporous and macroporous structures the specific surface areas of go co rgo and h rgo are 107 3 m2 g 98 4 m2 g and 72 4 m2 g and the average pore sizes are 3 9 nm 9 1 nm and 27 3 nm after the co particles were removed the average particle size increases significantly the chemical composition of the go co rgo and h rgo were confirmed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy the xps spectrum full peak of go fig s1d co rgo fig s1e and h rgo fig s1f the chemical bonds of graphene oxide fig s1g mainly include carbon carbon double bonds and carbon carbon single bonds c c c c carbon oxygen single bond c oh carbon oxygen double bond c o and carboxyl groups cooh the characteristic peaks of the binding energy of these four chemical bonds are located at 284 5 286 4 287 8 and 289 0 ev 48 52 53 generally the degree of oxidation of graphite and the degree of reduction of graphite oxide is reflected by the ratio of oxygen to carbon content o c the oxygen to carbon content ratio of go is 0 35 after loading co nanoparticles and reducing the c1s spectrum of co rgo fig s1e has c c c c bonds and a small amount of co bonds in functional groups the presence of bimodal bands at 778 9 ev and 794 5 ev is attributed to co the oxygen carbon content ratio is reduced to 0 11 it shows that during the reduction and calcination of graphite oxide the oxygen containing groups are removed and the signal peak intensity of the carbon oxygen bond is weakened in addition the relative peak intensity difference between the carbon peak and the carbon oxygen peak is significantly increased after removing the co nanoparticles the main functional group of h rgo is the same as that of co rgo 2 2 characterization of membrane performance the membrane was cut into rectangles of 3 mm in length and 1 mm in width the thickness was measured by a thickness gauge fig 3a and the tensile strength and elongation at break were measured using a universal testing machine for membrane the mechanical property of the membranes was measured by a universal testing machine and the stress strain curves as show in fig 3b the tensile stress strain curve shows that the support film can be stretched to 10 strain and fracture at a tensile stress of 1 61 mpa after deposition of h rgo on the support film it can be stretched to 16 33 strain and fracture at 2 13 mpa tensile stress it can be seen that there is an increase in stress and strain in the membrane after deposition of h rgo we used the fp microsphere suspension as a mps model and used membranes based on h rgo nanosheets for filtration to calculate the fp microsphere removal efficiency the structural characterization of 80 nm 100 nm 200 nm 500 nm and1000nm fp microspheres is shown in fig s2 the sem images show that there is a portion of 80 nm fp microspheres with particle size less than 80 nm fig s2a compared with 80 nm fp microspheres the particle size of 100 nm and 200 nm is more homogeneous fig s2b c fp microspheres of 500 nm and 1000 nm are uniform in size fig s2d e according to the fluorescence microscopic imaging before and after filtration of 0 5 mg ml fp microspheres suspension 100 nm fig 4a c the number of fp microspheres in the field of vision after filtration is far less than that before filtration the state of the solution before and after filtration under the uv lamp fig 4b can also be seen that the reduced fluorescence of the solution after filtration is almost invisible in addition the size shape and particle size range of fp microspheres in the prefiltered and filtered samples were obtained by sem and nta analysis fig 4d e and it can be found that 86 of the particles in the prefiltered samples have particle sizes greater than 50 nm and some small fragments indicating that there are certain deviations in the particle sizes of nanoscale fp microspheres the sem image of the filtered sample shows that almost all the spherical particles are removed leaving only some smaller fragments and the nta analysis also proves this result fig 4e combined with the above analysis it can be shown that the h rgo membrane has excellent ability to capture 100 nm fp microspheres to further verify the filtration efficiency of membranes based on h rgo nanosheets for mps tested the filtration effect of fp microspheres 0 1 mg ml at 80 nm 100 nm 200 nm 500 nm and 1000 nm with different membrane thicknesses and the samples before and after filtration were tested for fluorescence and the standard curve fig s3a b was used to calculate the fp microspheres removal efficiency by standard curve the fluorescence intensity curves of fp microspheres dispersions of different particle sizes filtered by h rgo 1 are shown in fig 3f and it can be seen that the fluorescence intensity before and after filtration is obviously different the fluorescence intensity curves before and after filtration of fp microspheres dispersions of different particle sizes when using h rgo 1 and h rgo 3 as membranes see fig s3c d and also compared the fluorescence curves of fp microspheres in the suspension after filtration by the support membrane with those before filtration indicating that the support membrane cannot capture fp the removal efficiency of fp microspheres dispersions with different particle sizes filtered by different membranes was calculated according to the standard curves fig 4g the h rgo 1 filtration efficiency increased with the increase of particle size and the average filtration efficiency for 80 nm was only 77 04 when the particle size increased to 200 nm the average filtration efficiency increased to 94 35 and the average filtration efficiency for 1000 nm is up to 98 the average filtration efficiency of the h rgo 2 increased more significantly for fp microspheres of 80 nm 100 nm and 200 nm with a small increase in the average filtration efficiency for 500 nm and 1000 nm the average filtration efficiency of h rgo 3 membranes for the five particle sizes is very close except for 80 nm where the filtration efficiency is 97 and the removal efficiency of all particle sizes is over 99 5 seo et al used 500 nm ps as a model for microplastics and enhanced the electrostatic gravitational force between fe3 and microplastics using plant derived tannic acid to remove microplastics with up to 90 efficiency 54 baresel et al reported that the mps removal was as high as 100 when ultrafiltration membrane with nominal size of 0 2 μm 55 the fluorescence curves of fp microspheres in the suspension after filtration by the support membrane were basically the same as those before filtration indicating that the support membrane could not capture fp microspheres the fluorescence intensity curves fig 4h and removal efficiency fig 4i of fp microspheres with different concentrations before and after filtration of 200 nm can prove that the concentration of microplastics has little influence on the filtration efficiency of membranes based on h rgo nanosheets this shows that the h rgo membrane has perfect filtration efficiency for fp microspheres larger than 80 nm additionally we proved the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets filtration of five different sized ps beads as a model of mps sem image of the purchased ps beads are showed in fig s4 the 12 500 mesh ps beads are different sizes of spheres the largest up to 2 μm and the smallest down to 50 nm fig s4a the sem of the 4500 mesh ps beads is shown in fig s4b the size of the 4500 mesh ps beads is relatively homogeneous about 4 5 μm the size range of the ps beads of 2500 mesh is from 500 nm to 10 μm with about 6 μm accounting for the larger portion fig s4c as shown in fig s4d and e the 1000 mesh and 500 mesh ps beads were in the shape of a block and the size exceeded 10 μm the particle size distribution of ps microbeads with different mesh sizes is shown in fig s5 the 12 500 mesh ps beads are mainly in the size range of 0 3 3 μm with 1 μm accounting for the largest percentage the particle size of 1000 mesh is mainly concentrated in the range of 10 40 μm the maximum percentage of 4500 mesh and 2500 mesh are 4 μm and 6 μm the maximum percentage of 500 mesh particle size is 50 μm the uv v transmittance spectra and optical photos of the 4500 mesh ps dispersion before and after filtration are shown in fig 5a it can be found that h rgo 2 has the excellent capturing ability for 4500 items ps beads according to formula 2 the removal efficiency of the h rgo 2 membrane for ps beads of five sizes was calculated fig 5b the h rgo membrane can remove more than 99 9 of ps beads with particle size greater than 12 500 mesh therefore it can be proved that the porous structure of the h rgo membrane can achieve high water flux and high efficiency for the removal of microplastics the urban wastewater from the yanerwan wastewater treatment plant in lanzhou was used as the research object and the actual filtration performance of h rgo membrane was investigated a large number of microplastics were found in municipal wastewater identified by microinfrared detection fig 6a b c fig 6d shows the ir spectra of the substance at the red dots under three microscope lenses 1480 1430 cm 1 ch bending aromatic ring stretching 1790 1700 cm 1 co stretching and 2980 2780 cm 1 ch stretching 56 57 in addition the peaks at 1360 1380 cm 1 968 997 cm 1 and 800 840 cm 1 are ch bending vibrations c ch3 stretching vibrations and ch stretching vibrations in polypropylene respectively 3000 3050 cm 1 1400 1600 cm 1 and 550 700 cm 1 are ch stretching vibrations ch2 cc stretching vibrations benzene ring and deformation vibrations between the carbon atom and its attached hydrogen in polystyrene respectively 58 the microplastics contained in the municipal wastewater used in the description experiments are polystyrene polymers polyethylene polymers and polypropylene polymers these polymers are from disposable packaging and containers injection moulded and film products as well as small appliances and toys respectively further use of the h rgo 2 was evaluated for the successful removal of mps from wastewater the transmittance of wastewater before and after filtration is significantly different the average transmittance of the solution before filtration is 45 and the transmittance of the solution after filtration is stable and maintained at 90 fig 7d removal of mps from wastewater was illustrated by comparing microscope images before and after filtration fig 7b c e f it can be found that there are round blocky and other microplastic particles of different sizes in the field of vision before filtration the filtered wastewater showed no obvious microplastic particles under the microscope the above results indicate that membranes based on h rgo nanosheets have an obvious effect on the filtration of mps in wastewater characterization of the h rgo membrane after filtered ps via sem as can be seen from fig 8a and b ps spheres of different diameters were intercepted on the surface of the h rgo membrane the smallest being around 80 nm in diameter apart from this the surface of the h rgo membrane did not change significantly after filtering the microplastics further the infrared spectrum shows that the peaks at 3000 3050 cm 1 1400 1600 cm 1 and 550 700 cm 1 are ch stretching vibrations ch2 cc stretching vibrations benzene ring and deformation vibrations between the carbon atom and its attached hydrogen in polystyrene respectively drops of methylene blue stained deionized water were placed on the h rgo membrane before filtration fig 8d e f and it was found that the h rgo membrane was hydrophobic drops of methylene blue stained deionized water were placed on the ps filtered h rgo membrane retaining its original hydrophobicity fig 8g h i this shows that filtering ps has no effect on the hydrophobicity of the h rgo membrane 3 conclusion to summarize we have demonstrated the fabrication of a novel membrane based on h rgo nanosheets for efficient capture and removal of mps in wastewater benefiting from the abundant holes of rgo nanosheets which endows the membrane desired porous structure the as prepared membranes based on h rgo nanosheets show superior mps removal performance with extremely high efficiency of up to 99 9 achieved by using fp microspheres and ps beads with different diameters as model mps under our conditions in the case of treatment of the industrial mps containing wastewater almost all mps could be captured by the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets which was confirmed by stereomicroscope taking advantage of their physicochemical stability and exceptional mps removal efficiency with large water reflux the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets may have great potentials for practical applications for the removal of mps in water in combination with their simple and scalable fabrication method 4 experimental section methods 4 1 materials graphite

12919,the serious environmental issue caused by the rising levels of microplastics mps pollution has aroused much more attention globally therefore an effective strategy needs to be established to eliminate mps from the water herein we first report the preparation of membranes based on holey reduced graphene oxide h rgo nanosheets for efficient removal of mps in wastewater compared with those untreated rgo the h rgo nanosheets show a porous structure with an average size of 27 3 nm which is a benefit for construction membrane for separation of mps with better water flux 37 19 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 employing the fluorescent polystyrene fp microspheres and ps beads as model mps the as resulted h rgo membranes exhibit extremely high mps removal efficiency of 99 9 in the case of treatment of the industrial mps containing wastewater almost all mps could be captured by the h rgo membranes which were confirmed by stereomicroscope taking advantage of their physicochemical stability and exceptional mps removal efficiency the h rgo membranes may have great potentials for the removal of mps in wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics mps holey reduced graphene oxide h rgo membrane removal efficiency 1 introduction with the rapid improvement of industrialization and urbanization plastics are widely used in various fields as a vital polymer material as there is no proper way to deal with waste plastic in daily life it causes serious white pollution initially the public only focused on the larger plastic fragments in 1972 carpenter et al reported the emergence of small plastic particles in the ocean for the first time which attracted global attention 1 2 until 2004 thompson and others published papers on plastic fragments in ocean waters and sediments and proposed microplastics 3 as proposed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the term mps refers to very small omnipresent plastic particles 5 mm in diameter 4 6 mps represent a highly diverse category of pollutants with different shapes such as spheres fragments and fibers and complex components including polymer materials and chemical mixtures because of its small size mps are easily mistaken for food by many animals if ingested mps will cause physical damage to the digestive system of organisms and eventually die 7 8 mps have a high specific surface area which can adsorb hydrophobic organic pollutants in the environment and form a mobile pollution source 9 mps mainly come from two aspects one is directly introduced through sewage the other is large scale plastic weathering through chemical physical and biological processes 10 because plastic materials are difficult to degrade in the process of aging and weathering they accumulate in the aquatic environment and persist for several years to decades 11 become an important issue of plastic pollution at present though the multi stage treatment of water has been adopted in wastewater treatment plants a large amount of mps will still be discharged into the water system previous studies have shown that 45 of mps can be removed by the primary treatment of wwtps 12 secondary treatment can remove 50 of mps in wastewater 13 approximately 2 of mps can still be detected after the tertiary treatment with a particle size range of less than 20 μm 14 this part of the mps needs to be removed by membrane technology from a practical view of point such complicated multi stage treatment of water heavily restricts its large scale application to address this issue various technologies or materials have been exploited so far for instance various technologies such as coagulation 15 16 extraction 17 and biological degradation 18 19 have been used for mps treatment in addition recently juliane simmchen et al used a photocatalytic tio2 based micromotor for microplastic removal 20 yifa chen et al reported a unique acetone assisted method for the preparation of various zr mof based foam materials and successfully apply them in simulated microplastic removal 21 though great progress have been achieved by these mentioned approach towards efficient mps removal big challenge still remains as these methods have their respective limitations such as inability to handle mps in small sizes or non usable for large mps difficulty in large scale processing high energy consumption or only being capable of operation in specific environment consequently the exploration of innovative strategies for efficient removal of mps in a feasible manner that could be applicable in harsh environmental conditions is highly demanded nanofiltration membrane technology has been widely used for desalination and purification of water bodies 22 24 membrane filtration can effectively prevent the escape of microplastics on basis of the mps size as well as the membrane type and pore structure which is an exceptionally effective way to solve the problem of mps in wastewater luogo et al report two ceramic membranes made by sic and by zro2 and the removal of microplastics from washing wastewater was 99 2 and 98 55 respectively 25 fryczkowska et al report a composite membranes made of polyacrylonitrile with the addition of reduced graphene oxide rgo pan has high rejection efficiency for microplastic removal from industrial wastewater 26 graphene in which carbon atoms are connected by sp2 hybridization has a single layer two dimensional honeycomb lattice structure 27 29 recently graphene has aroused extensive interest due to its unique properties such as large theoretical specific surface areas 30 exceptional mechanical strength 31 tremendous electronic transport properties and superior chemical stability 28 as a kind of excellent 2d nanomaterial graphene have been proven to be significantly valuable for membrane manufacture for separation of dye and heavy metal ions 32 33 oil water emulsion 34 and gas 35 36 which also shows great potential in water treatment 37 39 compare with traditional membrane graphene based membrane have great advantages for their high chemical stability strong hydrophilicity and excellent antifouling properties 40 43 furthermore graphene based membrane is easy to manufacture mechanically robust and amenable to industrial scale production with low cost 40 44 to our knowledge however no investigation involving graphene based membrane for mps removal has been reported to date in viewing of these merits mentioned above the creation of functional graphene based membrane for mps removal should be of special interest in this work we report the preparation of a kind of membranes based on holey reduced graphene oxide h rgo which was obtained by etching the co3o4 nanoparticles embedded on reduced graphene oxide rgo nanosheets followed by a simple vacuum filtration using a polymeric membrane as support for efficient removal of mps in wastewater fig 1 our design lies in the following aspects 1 the unique nanoporous morphology of go nanosheets could not only screen and capture the mps from nano scale to micro scale but also endows the h rgo membrane fast mass transportation with better water reflux by comparison with that of graphene or go based membranes 2 the robust physicochemical stability of graphene makes the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets insensitive to external environments during mps removal which could therefore enlarge their application especially operation in those harsh conditions as a proof of concept study h rgo nanosheets have a porous structure with an average pore diameter of 27 3 nm which is conducive to the construction of mps with better water flux 37 19 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 in this care fp microspheres and ps beads with different diameter sizes were used as the mps model the h rgo membrane shows extremely high mps removal efficiency up to 99 9 under our conditions making it a promising candidate as the functional membrane for practical applications for removal of mps in water by in combination with their simple and scalable fabrication method 2 results and discussion 2 1 fabrication and characterizations the schematic preparation of membranes based on h rgo nanosheets is shown in fig 1a after uniformly mixing go dispersion liquid and co3o4 nanoparticles the aerogel which contains co3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized by the hydrothermal method the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets were finally fabricated by further vacuum infiltration after removal of co via annealing and acid treatment sem and tem characterization can provide the microstructure information of single or multi layer stacked go slices as shown in fig 2a and b a large number of irregularly shaped go plates are stacked against each other to form folds and curls from the sem image of h rgo fig 2d a macroscopic porous structure composed of a network of randomly oriented sheet structures connected to each other can be clearly observed particularly tem fig 2e shows that there are densely distributed pores in the local micro area of the h rgo network in contrast the go surface has no pores characteristic raman spectra are more descriptive for showing the feature of graphene fig 2c the g peak appears near 1580 cm 1 which corresponds to the first order scattering g band of the e2g phonon of sp2 c atoms it is the main characteristic peak of graphene but it is very susceptible to stress and the peak around 1350 cm 1 was derived from the breathing mode of the aromatic rings the d band the d peak is caused by the lattice vibration leaving the center of the brillouin zone it is used to characterize the structural defects or edges in the graphene sample it is usually regarded as the disordered vibration peak of graphene 45 46 the d g intensity ratios of the co rgo and h rgo were higher than that of go 1 67 for co rgo 1 86 for h rgo and 0 99 for go which is consistent with the typical raman spectra of go as shown by the co rgo and h rgo spectra the stronger d band indicates that the co rgo and h rgo samples have more lattice defects than the graphene layer without porosity 47 compared with co rgo the d g intensity ratio of h rgo is higher indicating more defects in the sample which may be due to larger pores after co removal fig 2f shows the xrd patterns of rgo co rgo and h rgo go has obvious diffraction peaks at 10 9 48 and the d spacing is 0 99 nm this interlayer spacing indicates that the graphite is absolutely converted into go this d spacing increase is due to the intercalation of oh and other functional groups in between the graphene layers the strongest peak after go reduction is located at 21 9 and the d spacing is 0 41 nm this decrease in d spacing is due to the elimination of a large number of oxygen containing groups by the reduction reaction 49 50 the strongest diffraction peak at 44 24 and 51 52 was attributed to the formation of metal co particles 51 it indicates that co particles are embedded into the rgo sheet layer after co rgo calcination the above peak disappeared in h rgo indicating that co particles were removed after acid treatment the pore structure of the sample is further confirmed by nitrogen adsorption and desorption technique based on barrett joyner halenda model the analysis of the result of the go co rgo and h rgo were shown in fig s1 the nitrogen adsorption and desorption of go fig s1a show a type iv isotherm and retain h1 hysteresis with a mesoporous structure the obvious hysteresis loop at p p0 in the range of 0 4 1 0 also indicates that the material has a mesoporous structure the pore size distribution of go is mainly concentrated between 1 8 nm 5 nm and is provided as an insert the nitrogen adsorption desorption of co rgo fig s1b and h rgo fig s1c also type iv isotherms compared with go which has a narrower hysteresis loop the pore size distribution is mainly concentrated in 1 8 nm 5 nm and 25 50 nm there are also some large holes it shows that co rgo and h rgo may retain the nanopores in go and can also produce mesoporous and macroporous structures the specific surface areas of go co rgo and h rgo are 107 3 m2 g 98 4 m2 g and 72 4 m2 g and the average pore sizes are 3 9 nm 9 1 nm and 27 3 nm after the co particles were removed the average particle size increases significantly the chemical composition of the go co rgo and h rgo were confirmed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy the xps spectrum full peak of go fig s1d co rgo fig s1e and h rgo fig s1f the chemical bonds of graphene oxide fig s1g mainly include carbon carbon double bonds and carbon carbon single bonds c c c c carbon oxygen single bond c oh carbon oxygen double bond c o and carboxyl groups cooh the characteristic peaks of the binding energy of these four chemical bonds are located at 284 5 286 4 287 8 and 289 0 ev 48 52 53 generally the degree of oxidation of graphite and the degree of reduction of graphite oxide is reflected by the ratio of oxygen to carbon content o c the oxygen to carbon content ratio of go is 0 35 after loading co nanoparticles and reducing the c1s spectrum of co rgo fig s1e has c c c c bonds and a small amount of co bonds in functional groups the presence of bimodal bands at 778 9 ev and 794 5 ev is attributed to co the oxygen carbon content ratio is reduced to 0 11 it shows that during the reduction and calcination of graphite oxide the oxygen containing groups are removed and the signal peak intensity of the carbon oxygen bond is weakened in addition the relative peak intensity difference between the carbon peak and the carbon oxygen peak is significantly increased after removing the co nanoparticles the main functional group of h rgo is the same as that of co rgo 2 2 characterization of membrane performance the membrane was cut into rectangles of 3 mm in length and 1 mm in width the thickness was measured by a thickness gauge fig 3a and the tensile strength and elongation at break were measured using a universal testing machine for membrane the mechanical property of the membranes was measured by a universal testing machine and the stress strain curves as show in fig 3b the tensile stress strain curve shows that the support film can be stretched to 10 strain and fracture at a tensile stress of 1 61 mpa after deposition of h rgo on the support film it can be stretched to 16 33 strain and fracture at 2 13 mpa tensile stress it can be seen that there is an increase in stress and strain in the membrane after deposition of h rgo we used the fp microsphere suspension as a mps model and used membranes based on h rgo nanosheets for filtration to calculate the fp microsphere removal efficiency the structural characterization of 80 nm 100 nm 200 nm 500 nm and1000nm fp microspheres is shown in fig s2 the sem images show that there is a portion of 80 nm fp microspheres with particle size less than 80 nm fig s2a compared with 80 nm fp microspheres the particle size of 100 nm and 200 nm is more homogeneous fig s2b c fp microspheres of 500 nm and 1000 nm are uniform in size fig s2d e according to the fluorescence microscopic imaging before and after filtration of 0 5 mg ml fp microspheres suspension 100 nm fig 4a c the number of fp microspheres in the field of vision after filtration is far less than that before filtration the state of the solution before and after filtration under the uv lamp fig 4b can also be seen that the reduced fluorescence of the solution after filtration is almost invisible in addition the size shape and particle size range of fp microspheres in the prefiltered and filtered samples were obtained by sem and nta analysis fig 4d e and it can be found that 86 of the particles in the prefiltered samples have particle sizes greater than 50 nm and some small fragments indicating that there are certain deviations in the particle sizes of nanoscale fp microspheres the sem image of the filtered sample shows that almost all the spherical particles are removed leaving only some smaller fragments and the nta analysis also proves this result fig 4e combined with the above analysis it can be shown that the h rgo membrane has excellent ability to capture 100 nm fp microspheres to further verify the filtration efficiency of membranes based on h rgo nanosheets for mps tested the filtration effect of fp microspheres 0 1 mg ml at 80 nm 100 nm 200 nm 500 nm and 1000 nm with different membrane thicknesses and the samples before and after filtration were tested for fluorescence and the standard curve fig s3a b was used to calculate the fp microspheres removal efficiency by standard curve the fluorescence intensity curves of fp microspheres dispersions of different particle sizes filtered by h rgo 1 are shown in fig 3f and it can be seen that the fluorescence intensity before and after filtration is obviously different the fluorescence intensity curves before and after filtration of fp microspheres dispersions of different particle sizes when using h rgo 1 and h rgo 3 as membranes see fig s3c d and also compared the fluorescence curves of fp microspheres in the suspension after filtration by the support membrane with those before filtration indicating that the support membrane cannot capture fp the removal efficiency of fp microspheres dispersions with different particle sizes filtered by different membranes was calculated according to the standard curves fig 4g the h rgo 1 filtration efficiency increased with the increase of particle size and the average filtration efficiency for 80 nm was only 77 04 when the particle size increased to 200 nm the average filtration efficiency increased to 94 35 and the average filtration efficiency for 1000 nm is up to 98 the average filtration efficiency of the h rgo 2 increased more significantly for fp microspheres of 80 nm 100 nm and 200 nm with a small increase in the average filtration efficiency for 500 nm and 1000 nm the average filtration efficiency of h rgo 3 membranes for the five particle sizes is very close except for 80 nm where the filtration efficiency is 97 and the removal efficiency of all particle sizes is over 99 5 seo et al used 500 nm ps as a model for microplastics and enhanced the electrostatic gravitational force between fe3 and microplastics using plant derived tannic acid to remove microplastics with up to 90 efficiency 54 baresel et al reported that the mps removal was as high as 100 when ultrafiltration membrane with nominal size of 0 2 μm 55 the fluorescence curves of fp microspheres in the suspension after filtration by the support membrane were basically the same as those before filtration indicating that the support membrane could not capture fp microspheres the fluorescence intensity curves fig 4h and removal efficiency fig 4i of fp microspheres with different concentrations before and after filtration of 200 nm can prove that the concentration of microplastics has little influence on the filtration efficiency of membranes based on h rgo nanosheets this shows that the h rgo membrane has perfect filtration efficiency for fp microspheres larger than 80 nm additionally we proved the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets filtration of five different sized ps beads as a model of mps sem image of the purchased ps beads are showed in fig s4 the 12 500 mesh ps beads are different sizes of spheres the largest up to 2 μm and the smallest down to 50 nm fig s4a the sem of the 4500 mesh ps beads is shown in fig s4b the size of the 4500 mesh ps beads is relatively homogeneous about 4 5 μm the size range of the ps beads of 2500 mesh is from 500 nm to 10 μm with about 6 μm accounting for the larger portion fig s4c as shown in fig s4d and e the 1000 mesh and 500 mesh ps beads were in the shape of a block and the size exceeded 10 μm the particle size distribution of ps microbeads with different mesh sizes is shown in fig s5 the 12 500 mesh ps beads are mainly in the size range of 0 3 3 μm with 1 μm accounting for the largest percentage the particle size of 1000 mesh is mainly concentrated in the range of 10 40 μm the maximum percentage of 4500 mesh and 2500 mesh are 4 μm and 6 μm the maximum percentage of 500 mesh particle size is 50 μm the uv v transmittance spectra and optical photos of the 4500 mesh ps dispersion before and after filtration are shown in fig 5a it can be found that h rgo 2 has the excellent capturing ability for 4500 items ps beads according to formula 2 the removal efficiency of the h rgo 2 membrane for ps beads of five sizes was calculated fig 5b the h rgo membrane can remove more than 99 9 of ps beads with particle size greater than 12 500 mesh therefore it can be proved that the porous structure of the h rgo membrane can achieve high water flux and high efficiency for the removal of microplastics the urban wastewater from the yanerwan wastewater treatment plant in lanzhou was used as the research object and the actual filtration performance of h rgo membrane was investigated a large number of microplastics were found in municipal wastewater identified by microinfrared detection fig 6a b c fig 6d shows the ir spectra of the substance at the red dots under three microscope lenses 1480 1430 cm 1 ch bending aromatic ring stretching 1790 1700 cm 1 co stretching and 2980 2780 cm 1 ch stretching 56 57 in addition the peaks at 1360 1380 cm 1 968 997 cm 1 and 800 840 cm 1 are ch bending vibrations c ch3 stretching vibrations and ch stretching vibrations in polypropylene respectively 3000 3050 cm 1 1400 1600 cm 1 and 550 700 cm 1 are ch stretching vibrations ch2 cc stretching vibrations benzene ring and deformation vibrations between the carbon atom and its attached hydrogen in polystyrene respectively 58 the microplastics contained in the municipal wastewater used in the description experiments are polystyrene polymers polyethylene polymers and polypropylene polymers these polymers are from disposable packaging and containers injection moulded and film products as well as small appliances and toys respectively further use of the h rgo 2 was evaluated for the successful removal of mps from wastewater the transmittance of wastewater before and after filtration is significantly different the average transmittance of the solution before filtration is 45 and the transmittance of the solution after filtration is stable and maintained at 90 fig 7d removal of mps from wastewater was illustrated by comparing microscope images before and after filtration fig 7b c e f it can be found that there are round blocky and other microplastic particles of different sizes in the field of vision before filtration the filtered wastewater showed no obvious microplastic particles under the microscope the above results indicate that membranes based on h rgo nanosheets have an obvious effect on the filtration of mps in wastewater characterization of the h rgo membrane after filtered ps via sem as can be seen from fig 8a and b ps spheres of different diameters were intercepted on the surface of the h rgo membrane the smallest being around 80 nm in diameter apart from this the surface of the h rgo membrane did not change significantly after filtering the microplastics further the infrared spectrum shows that the peaks at 3000 3050 cm 1 1400 1600 cm 1 and 550 700 cm 1 are ch stretching vibrations ch2 cc stretching vibrations benzene ring and deformation vibrations between the carbon atom and its attached hydrogen in polystyrene respectively drops of methylene blue stained deionized water were placed on the h rgo membrane before filtration fig 8d e f and it was found that the h rgo membrane was hydrophobic drops of methylene blue stained deionized water were placed on the ps filtered h rgo membrane retaining its original hydrophobicity fig 8g h i this shows that filtering ps has no effect on the hydrophobicity of the h rgo membrane 3 conclusion to summarize we have demonstrated the fabrication of a novel membrane based on h rgo nanosheets for efficient capture and removal of mps in wastewater benefiting from the abundant holes of rgo nanosheets which endows the membrane desired porous structure the as prepared membranes based on h rgo nanosheets show superior mps removal performance with extremely high efficiency of up to 99 9 achieved by using fp microspheres and ps beads with different diameters as model mps under our conditions in the case of treatment of the industrial mps containing wastewater almost all mps could be captured by the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets which was confirmed by stereomicroscope taking advantage of their physicochemical stability and exceptional mps removal efficiency with large water reflux the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets may have great potentials for practical applications for the removal of mps in water in combination with their simple and scalable fabrication method 4 experimental section methods 4 1 materials graphite

cold concentrated h2so4 69 ml 0 c kmno4 9 g was added into above slowly with stirring and the temperature of the mixture was not allowed to exceed 5 c deionized water 138 ml was gradually added into the mixture after stirring for 2 h at 35 c then the system was heated to 98 c and stirred for 15 min the reaction was terminated by the addition of a large amount of deionized water 420 ml and 30 h2o2 solution 7 5 ml after which the color of the mixture changed to bright yellow the mixture was filtered and washed with hcl 3 solution in order to remove metal ions the final product was obtained by centrifugation and freeze drying 4 3 synthesis of h rgo nanosheets and membranes based on h rgo nanosheets the graphene oxide dispersion 3 0 mg ml 30 ml was obtained by ultrasonic treatment of go in deionized water for approximately 1 h at room temperature subsequently co nps 0 12 g were added into graphene oxide dispersion and stirred for 2 h the mixed solution was transferred to a 50 ml teflon sealed autoclave and heated at 180 c for 12 h finally after cooling to room temperature the co rgo was obtained the free standing co rgo was then removed and freeze dried for 12 h to yield the co rgo next the co rgo samples were annealed at 900 c 5 c min under a protective atmosphere for 2 h the co coo were removed by hydrochloric acid 10 then washed with deionized water to neutrality and dried under the cold motion to obtain h rgo in this work membranes based on h rgo nanosheets are prepared by the negative pressure filtration method and h rgo nanosheets are evenly deposited on a support membrane before filtration a support membrane is packed in a filter device then 10 ml 0 25 mg ml 0 5 mg ml 0 75 mg ml of h rgo nanosheets dispersion was added to the filter cups respectively after filtering and drying at room temperature for 12 h membranes based on h rgo nanosheets of different thicknesses were obtained and named h rgo 1 h rgo 2 h rgo 3 the support membrane is a porous film with a pore diameter of 1 2 μm in order to exclude the influence of microporous supported membranes on the pure water flux of membranes based on h rgo nanosheets and on the filtration performance of mps we tested the pure water flux and the retention rate of fluorescent polychromatic microspheres of the blank microporous membrane the pure water flux of the support membrane was 584 35l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 which was much higher than that of the prepared h rgo membranes was 37 19l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 the pure water flux of membranes based on h rgo nanosheets was much higher than go membranes 2 20l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 the retention performance of microporous membrane for fluorescent polystyrene microspheres is reflected in the subsequent filtration performance characterization 4 4 simulated microplastics filtration experiment prepared different concentrations fp microspheres with the different diameter as the source solution passed through the membranes based on h rgo nanosheets under applied pressure and after collected the filtered solution the particle sizes of fp microspheres were 80 nm 100 nm 200 nm 500 nm and 1000 nm and the concentration were 0 1 mg ml 0 2 mg ml 0 3 mg ml 0 4 mg ml and 0 5 mg ml the different concentrations were obtained by diluting the standard dispersion at 10 mg ml the concentration of fp microspheres in the filter solution and source solution is further detected the removal efficiency of fluorescent polystyrene microspheres is calculated by the following formula 1 r 1 c f c p c f 100 r1 is the removal efficiency expressed in the concentration of the samples cf and cp are the concentrations of the source solution and the filtered solution five different particle size ranges of ps beads with a concentration of 0 001 mg ml were prepared to simulate microplastic suspensions 0 1 mg of 12 500 mesh ps beads was added to 100 ml of water ethanol mixture as the source solution for the simulated microplastics the mixture solution of h2o and ethanol volume ratio 3 1 the 4500 mesh 2500 mesh 1000 mesh and 500 mesh source solutions were prepared as above the concentration of simulated microplastic suspension is calculated as 2 r 2 c 3 c 2 c 1 100 r2 is the removal efficiency expressed in the quality of the samples c1 is the mass of ps beads in the solution before filtration c2 is the mass of the membrane before filtration and c3 is the mass of the membrane and ps beads after filtration in order to further verify the retention performance of membranes based on h rgo nanosheets for mps the wastewater in the real environment was taken as the test object the wastewater in the real environment contains not only mps but also other organic matters and microorganisms which need to be pretreated before testing 4 5 experimental filtration of practical waste water the actual filtration performance of the h rgo membrane was tested using urban domestic wastewater from the yaner tan wastewater treatment plant in lanzhou city the sample before and after filtration the digestion transfer of the suspension to another beaker and the addition of 30 h2o2 to remove the organic matter shaking at 100 rmp min for 10 min on a shaker and standing for 48 h to allow the hydrogen peroxide to fully react with the organic matter it is then filtered through a vacuum filter with 0 22 μm glass fiber membranes the membranes were rinsed with milli q water
