13830,membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr system is excellent in developing slow growing microorganisms and treating micropollutants prior to entering the aquatic environment in this work a mathematical biofilm model was developed to assess melamine biodegradation under different conditions and to predict the profiles of melamine nitrogen species and microbial biomass in the mabr system comtabolism linked to growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob or heterotrophic bacteria hb and their respective metabolism were involved in the model to contribute to melamine biodegradation results demonstrated the good predictive performance of the developed model in describing dynamic profiles of melamine cod and nitrogen species in the mabr system the relative contribution by aob induced cometabolism and metabolism by aob and hb varied depending on the stratification of the biofilm system with aob prevalent in the inner layer of the biofilm metabolism by aob and hb played more important roles than aob induced cometabolism in melamine removal controlling optimal biofilm thickness in the suitable range e g more than 750 μm might realize better simultaneous removal of melamine and nitrogen this work might provide further insight on efficient removal of melamine from wastewater keywords melamine membrane aerated biofilm reactor ammonia oxidizing bacteria biofilm thickness cometabolism 1 introduction melamine is a hydrophilic nitrogen rich 66 6 w w heterocyclic organic compound mainly used as a starting material in the manufacture of synthetic resins or found in fertilizer mixtures 1 2 melamine was detected in the wastewater at the concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 3 exposure to melamine could cause kidney malfunction 4 melamine could be removed via wastewater treatment process before entering the environment therefore it is significant to understand the fate and removal of melamine during wastewater treatment processes and the impact of melamine on the microbial communities membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr showed several advantages such as lower energy and space requirement and better effluent quality 5 6 longer solid retention time srt allows for the development and enrichment of slow growing microbial communities and higher biomass concentrations in mabr leading to better pollutant removal efficiencies 7 9 the biodegradation of melamine is limited in conventional activated sludge even after a long term sludge adaptation 2 whereas acclimated mabr sludge improved melamine removal efficiencies in the batch studies cometabolism and metabolism induced by the specific microorganisms such as ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and heterotrophic bacteria hb were reported to play important roles in micropollutant biodegradation 10 cometabolism indicated the micropollutant degradation in the obligatory presence of growth substrate whereas microorganisms could also degrade the micropollutant as carbon source through metabolism aob induced cometabolism was reported to be responsible for higher removal efficiencies of a broad range of substrates including aliphatic and aromatic compounds 11 12 however the relative contribution from these underlying mechanisms to biodegradation of melamine in mabr system has not been elucidated clearly so far micropollutant biodegradation during wastewater treatment processes might be influenced by the operating parameters involving microorganisms and their respective mediated metabolisms which could be captured in mathematical models 13 14 isolation of these responsible metabolisms and prediction on scenarios which are not experimentally tested would be achieved through model development calibration and simulation previous modeling work has been conducted on the removal of a few micropollutants in mabrs focusing on the contribution from biodegradation and sorption 15 17 however little work is done on modeling the removal of melamine in the mabr system and assessing the underlying biodegradation mechanisms herein we developed a mathematical biofilm model and evaluated melamine biodegradation in the mabr system microbial mediated processes including cometabolism and metabolism induced by aob and hb which could contribute to melamine biodegradation would be considered in model development parameter estimation was conducted with the measured melamine concentrations during melamine biodegradation under different conditions as previously reported 18 the biofilm model in this work is expected to facilitate understanding the underlying mechanisms of melamine biodegradation in mabr system 2 materials and methods 2 1 mabr system and batch experiment setup the bench scale mabr studied in this work was adopted from the previous literature 18 briefly a 7 2 l submerged mabr had gas permeable membranes for oxygen supply consisting of an anoxic chamber 2 4 l and an aerobic chamber 4 8 l the biofilm had a total effective surface area of 0 047 m2 resulting in a surface to volume ratio of 0 98 m2 m 3 the air flow rate was controlled constant at 8 64 m3 d 1 a synthetic wastewater influent containing cod nonfat dry milk powder and nh4 n of 500 mg l 1 and 30 mg l 1 respectively was supplied to the mabr at a flow rate of 6 9 l d 1 starting from day 85 melamine was fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 0 172 l d 1 reaching a final influent concentration of 3 mg l 1 batch experiments were carried out in a 250 ml flask to study melamine biodegradation at an initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 under different conditions for 7 days the acetate was supplied in all experiments as a readily biodegradable substrate at concentration of 400 mg l 1 detailed information on batch experiments were shown in table s1 in supporting information si specifically exp 1 was conducted in the unacclimated sludge 1 7 g tss l 1 directly taken from a columbia municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in exp 2 1 7 g tss l 1 acclimated sludge was taken from the mabr after continuous melamine feeding for 100 d and applied as the inoculum to investigate melamine biodegradation ammonium was not added in both exp 1 and exp 2 exp 3 provided same conditions as exp 2 except the addition of 20 mg l 1 nh4 n at the beginning of the experiment a nil contribution form sorption to melamine removal was confirmed by control experiments in the previous literature 18 2 2 melamine biodegradation biofilm model a multi species and multi substrate one dimension biofilm model was developed with aquasim 2 1d to capture all the microorganisms mediated processes related to melamine biodegradation cod consumption and complete nitrification in the mabr system the contributions by aob hb and nob were considered in the processes in terms of the mabr system it was modelled as combination of a completely mixed gas compartment and a biofilm compartment consisting of the biofilm and bulk liquid a diffusive link was implemented to connect the biofilm and the gas compartment a conceptual continuum was supposed to constitute the biofilm structures where there was no diffusive mass transport of biomass 19 particulate components detached from the biofilm surface at a global detachment velocity ude μm d 1 after achieving the steady state biofilm thickness could be obtained by controlling the detachment velocity in model simulation the detached particulates were assumed to be washed out tighter with the effluent and would not re attach to the biofilm 20 21 the water fraction of the biofilm compartment is kept constant at 0 75 with the biomass density of 50 000 g cod m 3 more details on model governing equations the boundary conditions and spatial discretization are described in si most of model parameters such as mass transfer coefficients for nh4 n no2 n no3 n n2 and o2 and the mass transfer coefficient for melamine and slow biodegradation substrate derived from biomass decay have been well established in previous literatures 22 24 therefore theses reported values are adopted directly in the developed biofilm model in this work substrates kinetics stoichiometry and parameters of the proposed model are summarized in table s2 s3 s4 and s5 respectively in the developed model the relationships among seven soluble substrates ammonium s nh 4 nitrite s no 2 nitrate s no 3 readily biodegradable substrates

growth and decay processes were considered for each microbial species microbial mediated biological process contributing to melamine biodegradation include 1 cometabolic biodegradation linked to aob growth or hb growth 2 metabolic biodegradation by aob or hb which are modelled by the following kinetics 1 d s mel dt t mel aob μ max aob k mel aob x aob t mel hb μ max hb k mel hb x hb s mel where t mel aob is cometabolic melamine transformation coefficient linked to aob growth m3 g cod 1 μ max aob is maximum growth rate for aob h 1 k mel aob is biomass normalized melamine biodegradation rate coefficient for aob m3 g cod 1 h 1 t mel hb is cometabolic melamine transformation coefficient linked to hb growth m3 g cod 1 μ max hb is maximum growth rate for hb h 1 k mel hb is biomass normalized melamine biodegradation rate coefficient for hb m3 g cod 1 h 1 growth linked processes are described using the monod equations while the metabolic biodegradation is expressed by pseudo first order kinetic expressions as suggested in our previous work 25 nob was reported to be irrelevant to pharmaceutical biodegradation 26 which was also considered as nil contribution to melamine biodegradation in this study 2 3 model calibration and validation in the proposed biofilm model most parameter values which have been well established in previous reports were adopted directly without any modification as shown in table s5 the sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the relative significance among other parameters related to specific microbial processes i e maximum specific growth rate of aob μ max aob and maximum specific growth rate of hb μ max hb and melamine biotransformation coefficients i e microbial growth linked transformation coefficients t mel aob and t mel hb and microbial endogenous transformation coefficients k mel aob and k mel hb then μ max aob μ max hb k mel aob k mel hb and t mel aob were selected as the key parameters except for t mel hb which was shown to be insensitive to effluent melamine concentrations as shown in figure s1 their respective values were estimated through model calibration using experimental concentrations of cod nh4 n and melamine under different conditions the best fit parameter values were obtained through minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the measured and modelled values specifically measured effluent concentrations of ammonium and cod in mabr in the long term run were first used for model calibration by fitting with modelled values to estimate μ max aob and μ max hb respectively batch experimental data from melamine biodegradation of exp 1 2 were then applied to estimate k mel hb and k mel aob respectively melamine concentrations from exp 3 were fitted in the proposed model to estimate the parameter t mel aob with obtained values of μ max aob μ max hb k mel aob k mel hb and t mel hb in previous experiments furthermore model validation was carried out with the calibrated parameter values by the independent set of the monitoring effluent concentrations of melamine in the sbr in the long term run a modified version of aquasim 2 1d was employed during model calibration and validation the sensitivity analysis parameter estimation and parameter uncertainty evaluation were conducted with a 95 confidence level for significance testing and parameter uncertainty analysis 27 the standard errors and 95 confidence intervals of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivity of the model to the parameters residual sum of squares rss between the objective data and model was used as the objective function 2 4 model simulation model simulation was carried out to predict the changes of substrates melamine cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and the distribution of the microbial communities under different operational conditions which is useful for understanding on the biodegradation of melamine in the mabr system the specific parameter values related to melamine biodegradation together with the previously well established parameters for microbial processes were adopted into the developed biofilm model the influence of biofilm thickness on melamine biodegradation and nitrogen conversion as well as the microbial structure at steady state in the mabr system was investigated based on model simulations the initial biofilm thickness was assumed to be 20 μm the thickness of the boundary layer between the liquid phase and biofilm is set as 100 μm 28 which is irrespective of biofilm thickness the initial concentrations of all soluble components were assumed to be zero in the biofilm and in the bulk liquid model simulations were run for certain days to reach the steady state when constant biofilm thickness biomass distribution and effluent concentrations of substrates were observed removal efficiencies of total nitrogen tn and melamine at the steady state were calculated using the following equations to assess the effect of biofilm thickness on mabr performance 2 t n r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y s nh 4 in s nh 4 eff s no 2 eff s no 3 eff s nh 4 in 100 3 m e l a m i n e r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y s mel in s mel eff s mel in 100 where s nh 4 in and s mel in are influent concentrations of nh4 n and melamine mg l 1 respectively s nh 4 eff s no 2 eff s no 3 eff and s mel eff are effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and melamine mg l 1 respectively 3 results 3 1 model calibration as described in the developed model microbial processes linked to aob and hb growth contributed to melamine biodegradation therefore the model was first calibrated with monitored effluent concentrations of nh4 n and cod in the mabr the specific aob growth related parameter μ max aob and hb growth related parameter μ max hb were estimated with their best fit values of 0 077 0 002 h 1 and 0 285 0 001 h 1 respectively which were in the same magnitude order as the reference values 29 30 the predicted ammonium and cod concentration profiles using the established model as well as the corresponding measured levels are depicted in fig 1 a and b the modelled average removal efficiencies for nh4 n and cod were 99 6 and 96 2 which was comparable to the measured values of 99 5 and 96 4 respectively suggesting a good prediction performance of the developed model it was assumed that melamine biodegradation started with hydrolysis producing the intermediate products of ammeline ammelide and cyanuric acid prior to final mineralization 31 however the formation of biotransformation products was not modelled in this work as their concentrations were not measured in the reported work 18 model calibration was carried out to describe melamine biodegradation by unacclimated sludge in exp 1 microbial endogenous transformation coefficient k mel hb was estimated with its best fit value of 0 0018 m3 g cod 1 h 1 the modelled and measured concentrations of melamine during the entire experimental period were shown in fig 1c melamine concentrations maintained nearly constant in the unacclimated sludge without any removal which was also predicted well in the developed model exp 2 data were used as next step of model calibration to estimate another key parameter k mel aob as 0 0028 m3 g cod 1 h 1 as shown in fig 1c the removal efficiency of melamine could reach 33 after 7 d of incubation no ammonium was provided resulting in that metabolism by hb and aob contributed to the total removal of melamine modelled melamine concentration profile matched well again with the measured values in exp 2 in exp 3 20 mg l 1 ammonium was provided at the beginning to test the effect of ammonium on melamine biodegradation although 35 of melamine was removed under this condition it showed no substantial difference compared with the situation without ammonium this is contradictory to the common notion that aob induced cometabolism could enhance removal of most micropollutants during nitrification probably due to the non specific enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo with a broad substrate range 32 34 the relative low contribution by aob induced cometabolism was also reported for some recalcitrant compounds such as carbamazepine probably due to their complex chemical structure and high resistance to biotransformation 10 35 36 the modelled melamine concentration profiles fitted well with the measured values in the acclimated sludge in the presence of ammonium fig 1c indicating the validity of the developed model aob growth linked parameter t mel aob was estimated at its best fit value of 0 07 m3 g cod 1 which was in the same order of magnitude with the values for atenolol 26 aob and hb in the mabr might play an important role in melamine biodegradation as observed in the previous report 18 the model calibration in this study was therefore mainly focused on estimating the key parameter values for melamine biodegradation by aob and hb leading to a good agreement between modelled and measured data of ammonium cod and melamine profiles either in the batch experiments or in mabr system as shown from fig 1 the proposed biofilm model could properly capture the relationships among ammonium utilization cod consumption and melamine biodegradation the key parameters obtained from model calibration seem realistic maximum specific growth rate μ max aob and μ max hb for aob and hb which were estimated in this work had the same order of magnitude with reported values for these microorganisms of 2 05 4 92 d 1 for μ max aob and 6 6 24 d 1 for μ max hb respectively 19 37 with regard to the specific parameter linked to aob growth i e aob induced cometabolic melamine biodegradation coefficient t mel aob and microbial endogenous transformation coefficient k mel aob and k mel hb the best fit parameter values confirmed in this study were difficult to compare with literature data as these parameters were firstly reported herein however compared to other compounds such as atenolol acyclovir and a general model for pharmaceuticals it was obvious that the estimated values of k mel aob and k mel hb 0 0028 0 0005 and 0 0018 0 0005 m3 g cod 1 h 1 in this work were much lower than the literature reported values for atenolol 0 00014 0 00067 and 0 00018 0 00093 m3 g cod 1 h 1 and acyclovir 0 00005 and 0 00035 m3 g cod 1 h 1 19 25 26 although different microbial communities structures or operating conditions were adopted in this work and in previous literature it indicated a weaker degradation ability of aob and hb on melamine than atenolol or acyclovir however the parameter value of 0 07 m3 g cod 1 for t mel aob was in the range of 0 012 0 0715 m3 g cod 1 suggesting a comparable ability of cometabolism by aob on melamine in the mabr system and on atenolol or acyclovir in the enriched nitrifying cultures 19 25 26 3 2 model validation the developed biofilm model was further applied to describe the melamine biodegradation and nitrogen species no2 n no3 n profiles in the mabr system after continuous melamine dosing for model validation a total of 180 days was set as the entire mabr running time including first 55 days for reactor start up 56 84 days for reactor stabilization and 85 180 days for continuous melamine feeding in order to confirm the validity and reliability of the proposed biofilm model these independent data from mabr were used to compare with model simulations compared with measured effluent levels of melamine the modelled concentrations showed a satisfactory prediction trend over the entire running period as shown in fig 2 a although it showed a slight decrease in effluent concentration from day 85 2 82 mg l 1 until day 180 2 56 mg l 1 the removal efficiencies of melamine showed a variation among 1 4 and 39 9 leading to an average of 20 11 18 from the perspective of modelling results a slight increase in melamine removal was found probably due to sludge acclimation this is consistent with the previous studies on the effect of sludge acclimation or adaptation where enhanced removal of triclosan fluorouracile sulfamethoxazole and codeine were found with acclimated sludge in mabr or sbr 38 40 sludge acclimation might lead to the selection and enrichment of the specific microbial community which would be responsible for biodegradation of some recalcitrant compounds 38 model validation results for effluent concentration profiles of different nitrogen species were also shown in fig 2b and c capturing their dynamics it demonstrated that mabr performance was not affected after continuous melamine feeding as indicated in the previous report 18 long term sludge acclimation to melamine in the conventional activated sludge cas system resulted in lower removal efficiencies of cod and nh4 n due to melamine inhibition the initial micropollutant concentration might have an effect on acclimated sludge performance increasing from 100 ng l 1 to 500 ng l 1 the presence of triclosan showed no influence on cod removal for both acclimated and non acclimated cases whereas more than 1 mg l 1 of triclosan would affect cod removal efficiency adversely 40 this might be attributed to the substrate competition during cometabolism of pharmaceuticals in the presence of the growth substrate e g substrate competition for amo active sites between ibuprofen or atenolol and ammonium 25 41 therefore the concentration ratios between growth and non growth substrates should be maintained within a certain range in order to ensure maximum biodegradation rates of both pollutants which requires further investigation the developed biofilm model captured dynamics of melamine and different nitrogen species well suggesting the validity of model for the long term operating mabr system and the suitability of the selected parameters which were estimated through model calibration good prediction results before and after continuous melamine feeding into the mabr system also indicated the tolerance of the model to sludge acclimation and appropriate selection of the relevant processes 4 discussion an integrated mathematical biofilm model is developed in our study to describe the consumption of substrates including ammonium and cod and biodegradation of melamine in the mabr system in order to assess the relative contribution of aob induced cometabolism and metabolism and het induced cometabolism and metabolism the key parameters including μ max aob μ max hb k mel aob k mel hb and t mel aob were confirmed through sensitivity analysis considering the significance to model output and were therefore estimated by model calibration using experimental data of ammonium cod and melamine from batch experiments and mabr effluents the least squared analysis was conducted to evaluate standard errors and 95 confidence intervals of the key parameters indicating the uniqueness and justification for the fitted parameters in addition concentrations of melamine no2 n and no3 n from mabr effluents were adopted as independent experimental data for model validation these data covered all kinetics including a two step nitrification and melamine degradation in the mabr system compared to previous modelling studies on mabr microbial processes or micropollutant cometabolism 14 19 21 42 44 the proposed model in this work considered the melamine cometabolism and mabr microbial processes into the framework in a recent work biodegradation and sorption of 51 micropollutants in the full scale mabrs were studied through an integrated model from a macroscopic perspective 43 however the underlying metabolism and cometabolism by the corresponding microorganisms have not been investigated in mabr based on modelling studies therefore this biofilm model could probably enhance our understanding on the fate of micropollutants in mabr system the specific parameters identified herein will provide a rough idea of improving the removal efficiency of micropollutants without affecting nutrient removal through mathematical modelling which is hard to realize through realistic operation the developed model with well identified parameter values is able to predict the distribution of microbes substrates and melamine degradation rates along biofilm thickness fig 3 the steady state population of aob nob and hb are shown in fig 3a the majority of active biomass are aob and nob in the biofilm system the biomass fraction of nob decreases with the biofilm thickness increasing from 0 to 750 μm while aob increases to the peak firstly from 0 to 146 μm of the biofilm thickness and decreases rapidly towards the surface of the biofilm hb constitutes a small fraction in the biofilm system fig 3b demonstrates the profiles of dissolved oxygen do nh4 n no2 n and no3 n within the biofilm do decreases promptly from 2 38 to 0 mg l 1 from 0 to 500 μm due to oxygen utilization by aob which also confirm the dominant of aob in the membrane surface with sufficient oxygen and ammonium as shown in fig 3a an increasing trend was found for melamine concentration from the base to the surface of the biofilm fig 3c probably indicating that the biodegradation of melamine occurs in the inner layer of the biofilm where aob are dominant in terms of microbial processes contributing to melamine biodegradation aob growth linked cometabolism and metabolism by aob are dominant in the inner layer of the biofilm system whereas metabolism by hb might take an important role from the middle layer to outer layer fig 3c the variation of the relative contribution among different metabolisms was consistent with the changes of biomass distribution as shown in fig 3a confirming the involvement of specific microorganisms mediated processes the impact of biofilm thickness on microbial structure effluent concentrations of melamine nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and relative contribution from cometabolism and metabolism by aob and hb were studied through model simulation it was obvious that aob abundance was increasing with the increase of biofilm thickness from 550 μm to 950 μm as shown in fig 4 a thicker biofilm favored aob growth whereas hb were dominant at the biofilm thickness of 650 μm a slight increasing trend was observed for melamine concentration in the mabr effluent whilst no3 n concentration decreased with the increasing biofilm thickness as indicated in fig 4b the effluent nh4 n and no2 n maintained at relatively low concentrations with aob predominant in the biomass as demonstrated in fig 4c the predicted melamine removal efficiencies were less than the reported value 53 during real wastewater treatment processes 45 as higher melamine concentration in this work might lead to lower removal efficiency due to its toxicity to certain bacteria 46 47 aob induced cometabolism constituted 50 0 among all involved processes contributing to melamine biodegradation at biomass thickness of 550 μm this portion was increased to 98 at biomass thickness of 950 μm while the contribution of metabolism by hb and aob decreased from 48 9 to 2 0 and 1 1 to 0 2 respectively increase in biofilm thickness elevated the removal of tn but had an insignificant influence on melamine removal as observed in fig 4c the removal efficiency of melamine decreased slightly together with the changing of contributions from all microbial processes indicating the importance of metabolism by hb and aob over aob induced cometabolism this is consistent with the observations from batch experiments in fig 1c where aob induced cometabolism did not enhance melamine removal however the predominance of aob at thicker biomass increased removal of ammonium thus leading to opposite trends for tn removal and melamine removal mabr favors the enrichment of slow growing autotrophic microbial communities e g aob together with the thicken biofilm 35 on the hand biofilm thickness has a significant effect on mabr performance 48 maintaining a suitable range of biofilm thickness was therefore important to achieve higher removal efficiencies for both melamine and tn as either insufficient or excessive biofilm accumulation will result in low removal fluxes ascribed to limitation in biomass or mass transfer 49 furthermore obtaining thicker biomass requires longer time to reach the steady state controlling an optimal biofilm thickness e g more than 750 μm in this study might be feasible in terms of better simultaneous removal of nutrients and melamine which still needs to be verified in future practice 5 conclusions melamine biodegradation in the mabr system was assessed based on mathematical modelling framework in this study microbial processes mediated by aob nob and hb were considered and removal of cod and nitrogen species were also investigated the proposed model well predicted the experimental data with reliable parameter values estimated a suitable concentration ratio between growth and non growth substrates could ensure better removal for both substrates model simulation results indicated that relative contributions by aob induced cometabolism metabolism by aob and metabolism by hb varied from inner to outer of the biofilm it was suggested that appropriate range of biofilm thickness should be controlled in order to reach better simultaneous removal of nutrients and micropollutants during future wastewater

kinetic expressions as suggested in our previous work 25 nob was reported to be irrelevant to pharmaceutical biodegradation 26 which was also considered as nil contribution to melamine biodegradation in this study 2 3 model calibration and validation in the proposed biofilm model most parameter values which have been well established in previous reports were adopted directly without any modification as shown in table s5 the sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the relative significance among other parameters related to specific microbial processes i e maximum specific growth rate of aob μ max aob and maximum specific growth rate of hb μ max hb and melamine biotransformation coefficients i e microbial growth linked transformation coefficients t mel aob and t mel hb and microbial endogenous transformation coefficients k mel aob and k mel hb then μ max aob μ max hb k mel aob k mel hb and t mel aob were selected as the key parameters except for t mel hb which was shown to be insensitive to effluent melamine concentrations as shown in figure s1 their respective values were estimated through model calibration using experimental concentrations of cod nh4 n and melamine under different conditions the best fit parameter values were obtained through minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the measured and modelled values specifically measured effluent concentrations of ammonium and cod in mabr in the long term run were first used for model calibration by fitting with modelled values to estimate μ max aob and μ max hb respectively batch experimental data from melamine biodegradation of exp 1 2 were then applied to estimate k mel hb and k mel aob respectively melamine concentrations from exp 3 were fitted in the proposed model to estimate the parameter t mel aob with obtained values of μ max aob μ max hb k mel aob k mel hb and t mel hb in previous experiments furthermore model validation was carried out with the calibrated parameter values by the independent set of the monitoring effluent concentrations of melamine in the sbr in the long term run a modified version of aquasim 2 1d was employed during model calibration and validation the sensitivity analysis parameter estimation and parameter uncertainty evaluation were conducted with a 95 confidence level for significance testing and parameter uncertainty analysis 27 the standard errors and 95 confidence intervals of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivity of the model to the parameters residual sum of squares rss between the objective data and model was used as the objective function 2 4 model simulation model simulation was carried out to predict the changes of substrates melamine cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and the distribution of the microbial communities under different operational conditions which is useful for understanding on the biodegradation of melamine in the mabr system the specific parameter values related to melamine biodegradation together with the previously well established parameters for microbial processes were adopted into the developed biofilm model the influence of biofilm thickness on melamine biodegradation and nitrogen conversion as well as the microbial structure at steady state in the mabr system was investigated based on model simulations the initial biofilm thickness was assumed to be 20 μm the thickness of the boundary layer between the liquid phase and biofilm is set as 100 μm 28 which is irrespective of biofilm thickness the initial concentrations of all soluble components were assumed to be zero in the biofilm and in the bulk liquid model simulations were run for certain days to reach the steady state when constant biofilm thickness biomass distribution and effluent concentrations of substrates were observed removal efficiencies of total nitrogen tn and melamine at the steady state were calculated using the following equations to assess the effect of biofilm thickness on mabr performance 2 t n r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y s nh 4 in s nh 4 eff s no 2 eff s no 3 eff s nh 4 in 100 3 m e l a m i n e r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y s mel in s mel eff s mel in 100 where s nh 4 in and s mel in are influent concentrations of nh4 n and melamine mg l 1 respectively s nh 4 eff s no 2 eff s no 3 eff and s mel eff are effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and melamine mg l 1 respectively 3 results 3 1 model calibration as described in the developed model microbial processes linked to aob and hb growth contributed to melamine biodegradation therefore the model was first calibrated with monitored effluent concentrations of nh4 n and cod in the mabr the specific aob growth related parameter μ max aob and hb growth related parameter μ max hb were estimated with their best fit values of 0 077 0 002 h 1 and 0 285 0 001 h 1 respectively which were in the same magnitude order as the reference values 29 30 the predicted ammonium and cod concentration profiles using the established model as well as the corresponding measured levels are depicted in fig 1 a and b the modelled average removal efficiencies for nh4 n and cod were 99 6 and 96 2 which was comparable to the measured values of 99 5 and 96 4 respectively suggesting a good prediction performance of the developed model it was assumed that melamine biodegradation started with hydrolysis producing the intermediate products of ammeline ammelide and cyanuric acid prior to final mineralization 31 however the formation of biotransformation products was not modelled in this work as their concentrations were not measured in the reported work 18 model calibration was carried out to describe melamine biodegradation by unacclimated sludge in exp 1 microbial endogenous transformation coefficient k mel hb was estimated with its best fit value of 0 0018 m3 g cod 1 h 1 the modelled and measured concentrations of melamine during the entire experimental period were shown in fig 1c melamine concentrations maintained nearly constant in the unacclimated sludge without any removal which was also predicted well in the developed model exp 2 data were used as next step of model calibration to estimate another key parameter k mel aob as 0 0028 m3 g cod 1 h 1 as shown in fig 1c the removal efficiency of melamine could reach 33 after 7 d of incubation no ammonium was provided resulting in that metabolism by hb and aob contributed to the total removal of melamine modelled melamine concentration profile matched well again with the measured values in exp 2 in exp 3 20 mg l 1 ammonium was provided at the beginning to test the effect of ammonium on melamine biodegradation although 35 of melamine was removed under this condition it showed no substantial difference compared with the situation without ammonium this is contradictory to the common notion that aob induced cometabolism could enhance removal of most micropollutants during nitrification probably due to the non specific enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo with a broad substrate range 32 34 the relative low contribution by aob induced cometabolism was also reported for some recalcitrant compounds such as carbamazepine probably due to their complex chemical structure and high resistance to biotransformation 10 35 36 the modelled melamine concentration profiles fitted well with the measured values in the acclimated sludge in the presence of ammonium fig 1c indicating the validity of the developed model aob growth linked parameter t mel aob was estimated at its best fit value of 0 07 m3 g cod 1 which was in the same order of magnitude with the values for atenolol 26 aob and hb in the mabr might play an important role in melamine biodegradation as observed in the previous report 18 the model calibration in this study was therefore mainly focused on estimating the key parameter values for melamine biodegradation by aob and hb leading to a good agreement between modelled and measured data of ammonium cod and melamine profiles either in the batch experiments or in mabr system as shown from fig 1 the proposed biofilm model could properly capture the relationships among ammonium utilization cod consumption and melamine biodegradation the key parameters obtained from model calibration seem realistic maximum specific growth rate μ max aob and μ max hb for aob and hb which were estimated in this work had the same order of magnitude with reported values for these microorganisms of 2 05 4 92 d 1 for μ max aob and 6 6 24 d 1 for μ max hb respectively 19 37 with regard to the specific parameter linked to aob growth i e aob induced cometabolic melamine biodegradation coefficient t mel aob and microbial endogenous transformation coefficient k mel aob and k mel hb the best fit parameter values confirmed in this study were difficult to compare with literature data as these parameters were firstly reported herein however compared to other compounds such as atenolol acyclovir and a general model for pharmaceuticals it was obvious that the estimated values of k mel aob and k mel hb 0 0028 0 0005 and 0 0018 0 0005 m3 g cod 1 h 1 in this work were much lower than the literature reported values for atenolol 0 00014 0 00067 and 0 00018 0 00093 m3 g cod 1 h 1 and acyclovir 0 00005 and 0 00035 m3 g cod 1 h 1 19 25 26 although different microbial communities structures or operating conditions were adopted in this work and in previous literature it indicated a weaker degradation ability of aob and hb on melamine than atenolol or acyclovir however the parameter value of 0 07 m3 g cod 1 for t mel aob was in the range of 0 012 0 0715 m3 g cod 1 suggesting a comparable ability of cometabolism by aob on melamine in the mabr system and on atenolol or acyclovir in the enriched nitrifying cultures 19 25 26 3 2 model validation the developed biofilm model was further applied to describe the melamine biodegradation and nitrogen species no2 n no3 n profiles in the mabr system after continuous melamine dosing for model validation a total of 180 days was set as the entire mabr running time including first 55 days for reactor start up 56 84 days for reactor stabilization and 85 180 days for continuous melamine feeding in order to confirm the validity and reliability of the proposed biofilm model these independent data from mabr were used to compare with model simulations compared with measured effluent levels of melamine the modelled concentrations showed a satisfactory prediction trend over the entire running period as shown in fig 2 a although it showed a slight decrease in effluent concentration from day 85 2 82 mg l 1 until day 180 2 56 mg l 1 the removal efficiencies of melamine showed a variation among 1 4 and 39 9 leading to an average of 20 11 18 from the perspective of modelling results a slight increase in melamine removal was found probably due to sludge acclimation this is consistent with the previous studies on the effect of sludge acclimation or adaptation where enhanced removal of triclosan fluorouracile sulfamethoxazole and codeine were found with acclimated sludge in mabr or sbr 38 40 sludge acclimation might lead to the selection and enrichment of the specific microbial community which would be responsible for biodegradation of some recalcitrant compounds 38 model validation results for effluent concentration profiles of different nitrogen species were also shown in fig 2b and c capturing their dynamics it demonstrated that mabr performance was not affected after continuous melamine feeding as indicated in the previous report 18 long term sludge acclimation to melamine in the conventional activated sludge cas system resulted in lower removal efficiencies of cod and nh4 n due to melamine inhibition the initial micropollutant concentration might have an effect on acclimated sludge performance increasing from 100 ng l 1 to 500 ng l 1 the presence of triclosan showed no influence on cod removal for both acclimated and non acclimated cases whereas more than 1 mg l 1 of triclosan would affect cod removal efficiency adversely 40 this might be attributed to the substrate competition during cometabolism of pharmaceuticals in the presence of the growth substrate e g substrate competition for amo active sites between ibuprofen or atenolol and ammonium 25 41 therefore the concentration ratios between growth and non growth substrates should be maintained within a certain range in order to ensure maximum biodegradation rates of both pollutants which requires further investigation the developed biofilm model captured dynamics of melamine and different nitrogen species well suggesting the validity of model for the long term operating mabr system and the suitability of the selected parameters which were estimated through model calibration good prediction results before and after continuous melamine feeding into the mabr system also indicated the tolerance of the model to sludge acclimation and appropriate selection of the relevant processes 4 discussion an integrated mathematical biofilm model is developed in our study to describe the consumption of substrates including ammonium and cod and biodegradation of melamine in the mabr system in order to assess the relative contribution of aob induced cometabolism and metabolism and het induced cometabolism and metabolism the key parameters including μ max aob μ max hb k mel aob k mel hb and t mel aob were confirmed through sensitivity analysis considering the significance to model output and were therefore estimated by model calibration using experimental data of ammonium cod and melamine from batch experiments and mabr effluents the least squared analysis was conducted to evaluate standard errors and 95 confidence intervals of the key parameters indicating the uniqueness and justification for the fitted parameters in addition concentrations of melamine no2 n and no3 n from mabr effluents were adopted as independent experimental data for model validation these data covered all kinetics including a two step nitrification and melamine degradation in the mabr system compared to previous modelling studies on mabr microbial processes or micropollutant cometabolism 14 19 21 42 44 the proposed model in this work considered the melamine cometabolism and mabr microbial processes into the framework in a recent work biodegradation and sorption of 51 micropollutants in the full scale mabrs were studied through an integrated model from a macroscopic perspective 43 however the underlying metabolism and cometabolism by the corresponding microorganisms have not been investigated in mabr based on modelling studies therefore this biofilm model could probably enhance our understanding on the fate of micropollutants in mabr system the specific parameters identified herein will provide a rough idea of improving the removal efficiency of micropollutants without affecting nutrient removal through mathematical modelling which is hard to realize through realistic operation the developed model with well identified parameter values is able to predict the distribution of microbes substrates and melamine degradation rates along biofilm thickness fig 3 the steady state population of aob nob and hb are shown in fig 3a the majority of active biomass are aob and nob in the biofilm system the biomass fraction of nob decreases with the biofilm thickness increasing from 0 to 750 μm while aob increases to the peak firstly from 0 to 146 μm of the biofilm thickness and decreases rapidly towards the surface of the biofilm hb constitutes a small fraction in the biofilm system fig 3b demonstrates the profiles of dissolved oxygen do nh4 n no2 n and no3 n within the biofilm do decreases promptly from 2 38 to 0 mg l 1 from 0 to 500 μm due to oxygen utilization by aob which also confirm the dominant of aob in the membrane surface with sufficient oxygen and ammonium as shown in fig 3a an increasing trend was found for melamine concentration from the base to the surface of the biofilm fig 3c probably indicating that the biodegradation of melamine occurs in the inner layer of the biofilm where aob are dominant in terms of microbial processes contributing to melamine biodegradation aob growth linked cometabolism and metabolism by aob are dominant in the inner layer of the biofilm system whereas metabolism by hb might take an important role from the middle layer to outer layer fig 3c the variation of the relative contribution among different metabolisms was consistent with the changes of biomass distribution as shown in fig 3a confirming the involvement of specific microorganisms mediated processes the impact of biofilm thickness on microbial structure effluent concentrations of melamine nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and relative contribution from cometabolism and metabolism by aob and hb were studied through model simulation it was obvious that aob abundance was increasing with the increase of biofilm thickness from 550 μm to 950 μm as shown in fig 4 a thicker biofilm favored aob growth whereas hb were dominant at the biofilm thickness of 650 μm a slight increasing trend was observed for melamine concentration in the mabr effluent whilst no3 n concentration decreased with the increasing biofilm thickness as indicated in fig 4b the effluent nh4 n and no2 n maintained at relatively low concentrations with aob predominant in the biomass as demonstrated in fig 4c the predicted melamine removal efficiencies were less than the reported value 53 during real wastewater treatment processes 45 as higher melamine concentration in this work might lead to lower removal efficiency due to its toxicity to certain bacteria 46 47 aob induced cometabolism constituted 50 0 among all involved processes contributing to melamine biodegradation at biomass thickness of 550 μm this portion was increased to 98 at biomass thickness of 950 μm while the contribution of metabolism by hb and aob decreased from 48 9 to 2 0 and 1 1 to 0 2 respectively increase in biofilm thickness elevated the removal of tn but had an insignificant influence on melamine removal as observed in fig 4c the removal efficiency of melamine decreased slightly together with the changing of contributions from all microbial processes indicating the importance of metabolism by hb and aob over aob induced cometabolism this is consistent with the observations from batch experiments in fig 1c where aob induced cometabolism did not enhance melamine removal however the predominance of aob at thicker biomass increased removal of ammonium thus leading to opposite trends for tn removal and melamine removal mabr favors the enrichment of slow growing autotrophic microbial communities e g aob together with the thicken biofilm 35 on the hand biofilm thickness has a significant effect on mabr performance 48 maintaining a suitable range of biofilm thickness was therefore important to achieve higher removal efficiencies for both melamine and tn as either insufficient or excessive biofilm accumulation will result in low removal fluxes ascribed to limitation in biomass or mass transfer 49 furthermore obtaining thicker biomass requires longer time to reach the steady state controlling an optimal biofilm thickness e g more than 750 μm in this study might be feasible in terms of better simultaneous removal of nutrients and melamine which still needs to be verified in future practice 5 conclusions melamine biodegradation in the mabr system was assessed based on mathematical modelling framework in this study microbial processes mediated by aob nob and hb were considered and removal of cod and nitrogen species were also investigated the proposed model well predicted the experimental data with reliable parameter values estimated a suitable concentration ratio between growth and non growth substrates could ensure better removal for both substrates model simulation results indicated that relative contributions by aob induced cometabolism metabolism by aob and metabolism by hb varied from inner to outer of the biofilm it was suggested that appropriate range of biofilm thickness should be controlled in order to reach better simultaneous removal of nutrients and micropollutants during future wastewater

13831,ultrafiltration uf membrane is an attractive pretreatment technology used in desalination water system however the unavoidable membrane fouling over time is the key problem in the development of this technology fouling evaluation in the initial stage may provide relevant information about the fouling tendencies in this work the extent of fouling was investigated through a new method allows evaluating the fouling in cross flow uf in the initial filtration stage an empirical adjustment of flux decline data based on a bi exponential equation with 4 coefficients is proposed for determining the r cfi and rv cf parameters the first parameter r cfi is defined as the initial cross flow resistance the second parameter rv cf is defined as increasing resistance per specific volume of permeate in cross flow the measurement of the fouling parameters is evaluated in a laboratory facility with the following established conditions 1 operation in cross flow mode and 2 a flow measurement period limited to roughly 1 h the procedure is intended to detect two different flow decline zones with different fouling processes at the initial stage of cross flow filtration the method applicability was tested with two cellulosic membranes of 10 kda and 20 kda and solutions of 4 kda and 35 kda polyethylene glycol peg and alginate at different concentrations in the case of the r cfi parameter the results show measurable values with high colloidal concentration of peg the rv cf results shows a sensitive increase with foulant concentration in different degree depending on the type of solution

α specific cake resistance m kg 1 μ dynamic viscosity pa s 1 introduction a frequent problem in using membranes for water treatment is fouling 1 2 both in porous membranes for microfiltration mf 3 and ultrafiltration uf 4 6 as in non porous membranes for reverse osmosis ro 7 conventional indexes such as the silt density index sdi the modified fouling index mfi 8 variants of the mfi index 9 10 and other characterization indexes that have been proposed are intended to give meaningful information regarding fouling that occurs in a membrane most indexes proposed in the literature are based on measuring the permeate flux resistance during dead end operation 11 in this form of filtration the contribution to fouling of the different types of material present such as suspended solids colloids and dissolved organic matter is not distinguished similarly measurement procedures often require a rather high testing time for determining the fouling index these problems related to fouling indexes have been mentioned in various works 12 in the case of porous membranes the difference in their types makes it difficult to predict the type and extent of fouling based on an index that does not specifically consider the type of porous membrane used in the treatment on the other hand the fouling phenomenon in the initial transition stage in cross flow filtration has been the subject of fewer studies than the post initial or stationary flows 13 15 the fouling evaluation in the initial stage from one of the previous measurement parameters for the initial decline may provide relevant information about the fouling tendencies however in the initial stage of porous membrane filtration it is difficult to figure out a priori fouling mechanism and the corresponding flow equation for determining the derivative and the parameter value in some projects this difficulty of determining the main mechanism 16 has been verified due to the possibility of presenting a combination of different mechanisms within the initial stage the aim of this paper was to study and characterize the fouling in the initial filtration stage through a new method for evaluating the fouling in cross flow uf this method shall not require knowledge of the fouling mechanism and must be analyzed through a simple conceptual term like the increase of fouling resistance under certain conditions 2 theoretical background 2 1 fouling index i in their work for deducing mfi 8 schippers and verdouw used the cake deposition model they also speculate that when there was no cake compacting the cake resistance value r c may be expressed according to 1 r c i v a where v is the volume of permeate and a is the membrane surface the term fouling index i is understood as a measure of the potential of water fouling on the other side i can be determined according to the eq 2 17 18 2 i α c b where α is the specific cake resistance produced by particles that are deposited on the membrane surface and c b is the concentration of these particles in the supply water deduced in the same way from the mfi 8 i is related to mfi by 3 mfi μ i 2 δ p a 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and δp the transmembrane pressure both i and mfi are related with α and c b characteristics of the fouling particles present in the water supply according to eqs 2 and 3 to analyze i as a parameter of fouling from resistance eq 4 was used 4 i r c v a according to the eq 4 i can be interpreted as the cake deposit resistance r c formed by the specific volume of filtered permeate v a taking into consideration the dimension l 1 of r c and the dimension l of v a i has the dimension l 2 from its own deduction it is understood that i refers to the rate of increasing resistance per specific volume of permeate from cake formation and not from any other type of fouling mechanism in the same way as eq 4 i also must be considered as a parameter of fouling from resistance as mentioned following analysis of the α and c b magnitudes from the eq 2 2 2 the parameter fouling potential k and its relationship with i another parameter that may be considered for measuring fouling from resistance is the one defined by song et al 17 as fouling potential k according to the expression 5 r t r 0 k 0 t j dt where r 0 and r t are the hydraulic resistances of the membrane at the initial time and at the instant of time t and j the permeate flux at each time the hydraulic resistance r pa sm 1 is equivalent to μr being μ the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and r the intrinsic resistance m 1 in eq 5 the integral term 0 t j dt represents the specific volume of permeate from the start until the instant of time t of the filtration v t multiplied by the parameter k meaning the increase of the resistance produced by the volume of permeate in eq 5 the parameter k may be constant or variable with time derivation of eq 5 results in 6 d r t d t k j from eq 6 and considering the definition of j as derivative of the specific volume of permeate with respect to time therefore 7 k d r t j d t d r t d v the parameter k may be physically analyzed as the increase of resistance produced by the specific volume of permeate in a period of time if it is considered that k is constant in a determined period of time 8 k δ 0 t r δ 0 t v r t r 0 v t v 0 though originally defined differently its similarity to the parameter k can be seen as expressed in eq 8 with the fouling index i expressed in eq 4 both k and i express increasing resistance per specific unit of permeate i by definition is a parameter that is considered constant because its deduction according to the mfi is based on the mechanism of cake deposition for which the cake resistance r c increases constantly with respect to the volume of permeate the parameter k on the other hand may be considered constant or variable with respect to the volume of permeate according to the original definition in the case of the mechanism of fouling from cake formation the parameter k is constant and presents conceptual similarity with the fouling index i for other mechanisms of fouling the parameter k may be variable and its analytic determination may come given from the variation of resistance with respect to the specific volume of permeate according to eq 7 2 3 cross flow resistance r cfi and rv cf two parameters are considered as parameters of water membrane fouling and they are called initial cross flow resistance r cfi and cross flow resistance per permeate specific volume rv cf in the initial phase fig 1 fouling was measure through the parameter r cfi this parameter is based on the simple measure of the increasing resistance that is produced in the initial phase of filtration due to the presence of colloidal matter where a faster flux decline is produced than in the post initial phase an arbitrary time of 10 min from the start of the filtration is set in the measurement procedure of r cfi called the r cfi t10 the determination of r cfi by extrapolating the initial time t 0 from a term of the empirical permeate flux equation shall also be considered and is called r cfi t0 the rv cf parameter was used to characterize the fouling in the second phase or the post initial phase of decline of flow that begins after the stabilization of the deposition of particles in the initial phase due to the effect of the cross flow this parameter is measured in a discrete interval of time in the post initial phase to determine the rv cf value it is assumed that the value is constant in the measurement period in accordance with the expression 9 rv cf t 1 t 2 r t 2 r t 1 v t 2 v t 1 where the sub indexes t1 and t2 indicate the initial and final instants of time in the filtration used to determine the values of resistance r t and the specific volume of permeate v t the methodology proposed in this research work allows calculating r cfi and rv cf for different time values as it is summarized in the appendix however values do not change significantly 3 material and methods 3 1 model foulants fouling experiments were performed using two commercial polyethylene glycol peg with a molecular weight of 4 kda merck ref 8 07490 and 35 kda merck ref 8 18892 the concentrations used in the experiments were 0 5 g l 1 1 g l 1 and 2 g l 1 for both peg also commercial sodium alginate extracted from brown algae sigma aldrich with of molecular weight of 12 80 kda was used as model of organic fouling the concentrations used for this foulant were 5 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 40 mg l 1 3 2 membranes two cellulosic flat sheet membranes were used called c20k and c10k with a molecular weight cut off mwco according to the manufacturer of 20 kda ca600pp dow and 10 kda rc70pp dow respectively the clean membrane resistance r m of the c20k and c10k were 11 0 1012 m 1 and 17 5 1012 m 1 respectively based on the average value of different measurements of permeability with clean deionized water millipore elix 3 3 3 experimental set up the experiments were carried out in a laboratory cross flow uf unit this plant was equipped with a variable speed vane pump g 07116 11 cole parmer ee uu three tanks feed permeate and brine two manometers placed at both sides of the membrane a cross flow filtration module for flat sheet membranes of 42 cm2 of active surface of filtration cf042 sterlitech ee uu and a thermometer fig 2 shows a complete schematic diagram of the laboratory cross flow uf unit the incoming temperature is measured with a thermometer in the incoming line increments of 0 1 c crossflow velocity was controlled with a variable speed volumetric pump the outgoing flow rate from the retentate line is measured through a rotameter with a 0 300 l h 1 range increments of 5 l h 1 in all cases tested the flow rate of permeate was less than 1 of the incoming flow rate and so the value of the cross flow rate was considered the same as the measurement from the rotameter in the retentate line the pressure was measured with two 0 6 bar manometers increments of 0 1 bar located in the incoming line and the retentate line and measures the transmembrane pressure by taking the average pressure reading from the pressure gauges the permeate weight was measured using an electronic balance xt 220 cobos 0 220 g range 0 1 mg accuracy connected to a data acquisition system 3 4 experimental procedures before fouling tests the membranes were kept soaking for approximately 1 h in order to wash them the uf membranes were cleaned with osmotic water during 24 h after each test in order to verify the effectiveness of the cleaning wash procedure the permeability was measure until it reach 90 later they were placed in the filtration module and the same operation conditions were adjusted for all fouling test performed the transmembrane pressure set was 200 kpa the flow rate coming into the module was maintained at 2 78 10 5 m3 s 1 100 l h 1 with an average cross flow velocity of 0 32 m s 1 the permeate flux measurements were taken at different room temperatures in a normal range between 18 and 24 c the flow measurements were standardized to the reference temperature of 20 c using a correction factor from the viscosity the initial measurement of permeability with clean water has been carried out through various measurements of weight of permeate collected in time intervals of 5 min and it was verified that the measurements were maintained stable at least for 1 h before the start of the fouling tests according to the same procedure mentioned above about the initial measurement of permeability the maximum error estimated in the measurement of flow rate is approximately 5 however given repeated measurements in stable flow conditions with clean water it was considered that the error of permeate flow rate measurement with this procedure was less and in practice was estimated to be 2 the initial measurement of permeability with clean water is considered to be stable when the flow rate of permeate values were maintained within this margin of error and did not show an increasing or decreasing trend during a minimum interval of 1 h the flow rate measurements in the initial phase may present a greater flow rate decline than in the post initial phase and have been measured through values of permeate weight transmitted by the electronic balance to the computer with a frequency of 5 s the permeate flow rate was determined from the difference in weight registered during an interval of 20 s flow rate measurements were taken with this procedure every 1 min between the first 10 min of the filtration the estimated measurement error is approximately 5 based on the criteria of relative weight of the drops with respect to the weight of the permeate the time for measuring was 1 h in the tests with 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg and 2 h in tests with alginate when finishing the test clean water was passed again through the membrane normally the membranes are re used in later tests as long as the reduction of flux was not less than 10 with respect to the measurement of permeability in its first use 3 5 fouling parameters determination fitting procedure 3 5 1 bi exponential flow equation when operating in cross flow mode it is predicted that the solutions containing colloidal material and other dissolved organic substances may present two different areas or phases of decline of flow within the initial filtration stage ruiz garcía and nuez 19 already proposed a bi exponential model for estimating the decline of water permeability coefficient in brackish water ro desalination plants the decline was differentiated in two stages the first stage represented a more pronounced decline due to initial compaction and irreversible fouling the second stage on the other hand described a more stable period with less slope for that reason a bi exponential model based on four terms eq 10 was used to fit the permeate flux data in two areas with different decline within the initial filtration period 10 j b e b t d e d t b and d coefficients are expressed in units of flux dimension lt 1 in the usual unit of m s 1 and the sum of both corresponds with the permeate flux value at the initial instant the b and d coefficients are expressed in units of reverse time t 1 dimension in the usual unit of s 1 the use empirical eq 10 simplifies the calculation of the fouling parameters and allows standardizing their determination for the same periods of selected time the parameters identification of the mentioned models was calculated using the nelder mead simplex method 20 implemented in matlab software a criteria was established to maintain the initial point of flux from the adjusted curve with a difference lower than 4 with respect to the initial experimental point of flux 3 5 2 equations of resistance and specific volume of permeate the total resistance r t may be determined at each instant by substituting the empirical equation of j in the darcy equation in this way the expression for r t was obtained 11 r t δ p μ j δ p μ b e b t d e d t the value of the specific volume of permeate v t 0 t j dt at each instant can be calculated from eq 10 12 v t b b 1 e b t d d 1 e d t parametrically the value of r t in relation to v t can be determined from eqs 11 and 12 for different instants of time 13 r t f v t t 3 5 3 determining the r cfi parameter two different procedures have been used to determine its value in the first procedure its value was determined from the difference between the total resistance r t taken from eq 11 in a reference time of t 10 min r t10 and the value of resistance from the clean membrane r m 14 r cfi t 10 r t 10 r m δ p μ j t 10 r m where j t10 is the value of flux determined by eq 10 in t 10 min the reference time taken at 10 min is arbitrary and was used in this project to measure the r cfi in all tests and was indicated as the r cfi t10 parameter the second procedure to determine r cfi t10 used an extrapolation at the initial instant t 0 from the second exponential term corresponding to the post initial phase of the empirical flux equation called j p2 and is shown in eq 15 r p2 is the theoretical resistance that is taken at any instant discounting resistance due to the first phase of decline determined by the first exponential term of the empirical flux equation the value of r p2 comes from the eq 16 15 j p 2 d e d t 16 r p 2 δ p μ j p 2 from eq 16 a theoretical resistance of initial decline may be determined at the initial instant t 0 called r cfi t0 which is the difference between r p2 in t 0 and the initial resistance corresponding to the clean membrane r m 17 r cfi t 0 r p 2 t 10 r m δ p μ d r m according to eq 17 r cfi t0 may be obtained simply from the d coefficient of the empirical flux equation and the known resistance of the membrane r m the type of post initial decline characterized by the term j p2 determines the degree of difference that there may be between the values of r cfi t10 and r cfi t0 to determine r cfi 3 5 4 determining the rv cf parameter the rv cf parameter was intended to determine the membrane fouling tendencies in the post initial phase after the decline by initial colloidal fouling an arbitrary period of time of 10 60 min has been selected to perform the rv cf measurement during the filtration period and its value was determined from the values of total resistance r t and the total volume of permeate v t at these instants 18 rv cf t 10 60 r t 60 r t 10 v t 60 v t 10 the values of r t and v t at each instant of time indicated by the sub indexes t10 and t60 were determined according to eqs 11 and 12 4 results and discussion 4 1 fouling tests with 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg as an example of the type of fouling tests performed fig 3 shows the flux data and the bi exponential adjusted curve based on eq 10 obtained in the test corresponding to the solution of 2 g l 1 of 35 kda peg with the c20k membrane fig 4 shows the curve of total resistance r t with respect to the total specific volume of permeate v t determined according to eq 13 for the same test the coefficients from the bi exponential adjusted equation from the test are shown in table 1 test n 5 in fig 4 the slope of the straight line between the points corresponding to t 10 min and t 60 min indicated by the vertical lines represents the value of rv cf t10 60 in this test like in all tests performed with 35 kda peg and 4 kda peg the value of rv cf t10 60 obtained from eq 18 cannot be considered as significant for fouling because it was below the minimum significant value of rv cf t10 60 to determine the minimum significant value of fouling rv cf t10 60 an estimation was made that takes the error of the measurement of flux into consideration as mentioned in the following the test shown in fig 3 indicates the post initial decline of the flux was very low and the value of the slope that was determined from the numeric procedure was not significant in terms of decline in flux and real post initial fouling due to error in measuring flux for considering that the calculated value of rv cf t10 60 represents a significant value of fouling an estimate was made from a minimum significant value of the coefficient of decline d from the eq 10 that determines the flux decline for the post initial area in the post initial phase the zone of determining rv cf the value of the first exponential term of the flux equation was practically negligible and the flux may be considered equal to the second exponential term j p2 according to eq 15 the period of time between the first and the last measurement of flux in this post initial phase was commonly 40 min first measurement at t1 20 min and the last measurement at t2 60 min creating this interval of 40 min 2400 s the values of flux at these instants of time based on the adjusted equation would be 19 j t 1 d e d t 1 20 j t 2 d e d t 2 d e d t 1 2400 taking into account that the estimated error of the flux measurements taken in this post initial period was 2 the coefficient d shall have a clearly significant value in the mono exponential adjusted curve if the difference between the values of j t1 and j t2 is at least 4 between both in this way considering a value of j t2 0 96 j t1 and substituting and simplifying in eq 20 it is understood that the minimum significant value of d for an interval of time between measurements of 40 min is d 17 0 10 6 s 1 this estimate is simply based on two measurements of permeate flux one at the initial instant t1 and another at the end of the interval t2 with a greater interval of time between j t1 and j t2 the significant value of d would be less for the same estimated error as 2 in the measurements of flux in order to determine significant values of the coefficient of decline d in the later tests with alginate the time for measuring was increased up to approximately 2 h with an interval of time between the initial and final measurement of the post initial phase of 100 min t1 20 min and t2 100 min with the same criteria the minimum significant value of the coefficient d decreases for this interval of time from 100 min and is d 6 8 10 6 s 1 the value obtained for d was less than the minimum value estimated for d 17 0 10 6 s 1 for all the fouling tests with 35 kda peg and 4 kda peg with which the values of rv cf t10 60 that were calculated in these tests and which are shown in section 4 5 cannot be considered as clearly significant in fouling due to the hydrophilic character of peg and the cellulosic membranes it is logical to think that fouling may not really be produced in the post initial phase or if is produced it is less than the fouling detectable in the time for measuring these tests of approximately 1 h table 1 shows the values of the coefficients of the bi exponential adjusted equation for the tests of 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg with the c20k membrane test 1 5 and c10k membrane test 6 10 the bi exponential adjusted curves of flux decline from these tests are shown in fig 5 for this peg tests with c20k membrane the results from the r cfi parameter are shown in table 2 and the results from the rv cf t10 60 parameter are shown in table 2 table 2 shows the values of the fouling parameter r cfi at t 10 min r cfi t10 based on eq 14 and at t 0 r cfi t0 based on eq 17 from the fouling tests performed on c20k and c10k membranes with solutions of 4 kda peg 35 kda peg and alginate table 2 shows the values of the fouling parameter rv cf t10 60 obtained from eq 18 from the fouling tests performed on c20k and c10k membranes with solutions of 4 kda peg 35 kda peg and alginate the values marked with an asterisk do not confirm fouling according to the estimation based on the measurement conditions of the test the flux curves in fig 5 show the effect of molecular weight of 4 kda and 35 kda peg and of the concentration in the fouling tendencies of the c20k membrane in this membrane the 4 kda peg in its three concentrations produces a much lower initial decline than the initial decline of the 35 kda peg which is also seen from the values of r cfi obtained in table 2 this difference may be explained by taking into account the mwco of 20 kda from the c20k membrane which is clearly greater than the molecular weight of the 4 kda peg the r cfi of the 4 kda peg increases though not linearly when increasing the concentration and that is considered to be due to the increase of the concentration polarization phenomena this result is consistent with other research works where an increasing of degree fouling with foulant concentration was attributed to an increasing resistance due to adsorption and concentration polarization with time 21 as mentioned after section 4 4 in the fouling tests performed with peg the differences between the values of r cfi t10 and r cfi t0 table 2 were very small considering that both procedures for determining r cfi are valid for measuring the initial decline with peg the greater retention of the 35 kda peg produces a greater initial decline as shown in fig 5 and in the values of r cfi in table 2 likewise as mentioned later in section 4 5 in the post initial phase both with the 4 kda peg and the 35 kda peg barely any flux decline was observed see fig 5 where values of the rv cf t10 60 parameter lower than the minimum significant value of fouling are obtained according to the criteria mentioned above see table 2 table 1 shows the values of the coefficients of the bi exponential adjusted equation for the peg tests of 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg with the c10k membrane the bi exponential adjusted curves of the decline in flux from these tests are shown in fig 6 as observed in fig 6 with the c10k membrane and in the same way as the c20k membrane the molecular weight of peg and the concentration influence in the initial decline of flux likewise with this membrane no measurable decline of flux was observed in the post initial phase the results from the r cfi parameter corresponding to the initial decline are shown in table 2 and are mentioned in section 4 4 the results from the rv cf t10 60 parameter corresponding to the post initial decline are shown in table 2 4 2 fouling tests with alginate in the tests performed with 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg the concentrations used were relatively high and some measurable values of initial cross flow decline measured by r cfi were observed however no measurable values of post initial decline as denoted by rv cf t10 60 were obtained either because no fouling was produced in the post initial phase or by not being detectable due to the method in the interval of measurement of roughly 1 h to verify the possibility of taking measurable values of post initial fouling with the rv cf t10 60 parameter fouling tests with sodium alginate sigma aldrich were performed which is a species of organic polysaccharide foulant the alginate is a common product present as natural organic material nom in water and is identified as an agent that causes fouling in the membranes contrary to the high concentration of peg the used concentrations of alginate were 5 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 40 mg l 1 and have been tested with the c20k membrane in these tests the time for measuring was increased from 1 h to approximately 2 h when increasing the interval of time between the first and last measurement of permeate flux in the post initial phase the exponential adjusted coefficient d from this phase is less sensitive to measurement error from the experimental flux data as mentioned in section 4 1 with an interval of measurement of 100 min in the post initial phase the minimum significant value in the adjustment of the coefficient d was 6 8 10 6 s 1 in practice when performing various permeate flux measurements in the post initial phase the value of the coefficient d obtained from the empirical adjustment is significant although it is less than the estimate of d 6 8 10 6 s 1 if a clear decreasing trend is observed for the measurements of flux in the post initial phase in the case of tests performed with alginate all with a testing time of roughly 2 h all the adjusted coefficients d have been considered significant in the same way as the values from the corresponding rv cf t10 60 parameter that are obtained from the calculation procedure table 3 shows the values of the coefficients of the bi exponential adjusted equation for alginate tests with the c20k membrane the bi exponential adjusted curves of permeate flux from these tests are shown in fig 7 based on the observations in fig 7 the tested solutions of alginate with the c20k membrane have a low initial decline of flux though it is appreciated that it increases with the concentration also and contrary to tested solutions of peg with the solutions of alginate in the c20k membrane an appreciable flux decline was observed in the post initial phase and measurable values of the rv cf t10 60 were determined the results from the r cfi parameter corresponding to the initial decline from the alginate solutions with the c20k membrane are shown in table 2 the results from the rv cf t10 60 parameter corresponding to the post initial decline of these tests are shown in table 2 and are mentioned in section 4 5 4 3 fouling tests with alginate and 35 kda peg the tests performed with peg show an appreciable initial flux decline as seen in the r cfi values table 2 and in the curves of flux decline figs 5 and 6 however no measurable values of decline of post initial flux were observed based on the rv cf t10 60 parameter on the other hand in the tests performed with alginate measurable values of post initial decline were observed from the rv cf t10 60 parameter though the initial decline from the r cfi parameter is low especially in comparison with the values of initial decline in the 35 kda peg solutions with the objective of checking measurable values within a test for both the initial decline through the r cfi parameter and the post initial decline through the rv cf t10 60 parameter a fouling test has been performed with a mixed solution containing 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate table 4 shows the values of the coefficients of the bi exponential adjusted equation of the mix of 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate with the c20k membrane along with the values of the coefficients determined in the previous tests with the solutions of 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg test n 4 and the solution of 40 mg l 1 of alginate test n 14 with the same c20k membrane fig 8 represents the curves of the bi exponential equations of the flux decline of the mixed solution of peg and alginate and of the 40 mg l 1 solution of alginate the mixed solution of 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate produced both a measurable initial and post initial decline as seen in fig 8 and from the values of the r cfi and rv cf t10 60 in table 2 in fig 8 the 40 mg l 1 solution of alginate shows a post initial flux decline that is slightly greater than the mixed solution of peg and alginate as is also observed by the coefficients d from the exponential adjustment to each one of the solutions in table 4 however in terms of the rv cf t10 60 parameter indicated in table 2 the degree of post initial fouling of the mixed solution of peg and alginate is greater than that of the solution that contains only 40 mg l 1 of alginate as seen in fig 9 this apparently contradictory result is mentioned in section 4 5 which discusses the results from the rv cf t10 60 parameter 4 4 results from the r cfi fouling parameter r cfi t10 and r cfi t0 to determine the value of r cfi by r cfi t10 with eq 14 and also by r cfi t0 with eq 17 the value of the initial resistance or resistance of the clean membrane r m was used the value of r m has been determined based on the measurement of permeability with clean water before the start of the fouling test and the value for each one of the tests performed is shown in table 6 the values used for r m are those indicated in table 6 though an initial value of flux at t 0 can also be used taken from the bi exponential adjusted equation eq 10 which corresponds to the sum of the coefficients b and d and then determine r m through the darcy equation the difference between both values of r m depends on the difference between the experimental value of initial flux determined by measuring permeability and the value of flux obtained from the empirical adjustment to the bi exponential curve at t 0 table 2 shows the values of r cfi determined as r cfi t10 based on eq 14 and as r cfi t0 based on eq 17 in each one of the fouling tests performed with the c20k and c10k membranes in all tests the parameters are determined with the value of transmembrane pressure δp 200 kpa and the value of dynamic viscosity μ of the water at 20 c as shown in table 2 the tests in general showed little difference between the values of r cfi determined at t 10 min r cfi t10 and by extrapolation at t 0 r cfi t0 if the stabilization of flux is produced before the period considered t 10 min and the flux decline of the post initial phase is low as occurred in the tests that we performed little difference is found between the values of r cfi t0 and r cfi t10 in those tests where the period of initial flux decline is longer than 10 min or in tests with greater post initial decline the difference between both values of r cfi may be greater in the case of the 4 kda peg the values of r cfi determined with the c20k membrane and with the c10k membrane are significantly different this may be explained by the difference in the retention in each membrane of the 4 kda peg the molecular weight of the colloid is less than the mwco of both membranes though it is expected that the 4 kda peg retention in the c10k membrane is greater than in the c20k membrane producing a greater resistance as based on the results from the r cfi measurements in both cases the r cfi increased with the concentration though the increase was more significant in the c10k membrane with a lower mwco similar values of r cfi were taken with the 35 kda peg in both membranes in this case the molecular weight of the colloid was greater than the mwco of the two membranes and it can be considered that the retention of the colloid and the initial resistance that was produced in both was similar with the same increasing r cfi with the concentration the tests with alginate were made only with the c20k membrane in general the r cfi values with alginate were low though a certain increase of the r cfi can be observed with the concentration it should be pointed out that the concentrations of the alginate solutions were notably lower than the peg solutions as a case of the effect on the value of r cfi when mixing different solutions the mixed solution with 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate shows a value of r cfi slightly higher than the value obtained in the solution with only 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg as seen in table 2 as seen in the results obtained the r cfi parameter can evaluate a determined degree of initial fouling of a solution in cross flow operation although the r cfi parameter shows the effect of the increase of the concentration the r cfi is not a linear parameter with the concentration the r cfi parameter increases with the concentration but does not show a linear relationship to the same in addition the r cfi is affected by other factors different than the concentration such as the hydrodynamic cross flow conditions the forces of colloid membrane interaction and also the interaction between the colloids the r cfi parameter may give information about the degree of initial fouling that a type of water produces under specific conditions and determined by the characteristics of the porous membrane and by the hydrodynamic cross flow conditions the extent of initial deposition of colloidal substances depends on the balance of convective forces between the cross flow and the permeate flow in more porous membranes than the uf such as the microfiltration mf membranes the flow of permeate is greater and the colloidal particles that tend to get deposited on the membrane are bigger as observed in the experiments performed by mccarthy et al 22 the increase of the transmembrane pressure has a similar effect due to the increase of the permeate flow the model of initial flux decline performed by hong et al 13 also predicts that the initial permeate flux decline rate k 0 increases directly with the value of the transmembrane pressure δp and reduces when increasing the resistance of the membrane r m on the other hand the increase of the cross flow velocity has an effect of selective deposition of smaller particles that generally produce a greater resistance specific to the cake particles 22 4 5 results from the rv cf t10 60 fouling parameter table 2 shows the results of the characterization parameter of post initial fouling rv cf t10 60 obtained from eq 18 from the different tests performed in table 2 the rv cf t10 60 results indicated with an asterisk do not confirm fouling because they were calculated in the procedure with values of the exponential adjusted coefficient d that were less than the significant value according to the criteria of estimating error of measurements of flux and of the interval of measuring time of the post initial phase the interval for measuring time was 1 h in the tests performed with 4 kda and 35 kda peg with a measurement interval of 40 min in the post initial phase and 2 h in the tests performed with alginate with a measurement interval of 100 min in the post initial phase in the case of the tests performed with peg the reason for not determining measurable values of fouling from rv cf t10 60 is mentioned in section 4 1 which discusses the results of the flux measurements with 4 kda and 35 kda as seen in table 2 the values of rv cf t10 60 show fouling in the post initial phase with the four solutions of alginate and with the mixed solution of 35 kda peg and alginate as was previously mentioned in corresponding sections 4 2 and 4 3 of flux measurements the rv cf t10 60 results from the four alginate solutions show a growing value with the concentration although not linear and the effect of the rv cf t10 60 increasing from the concentration of 10 mg l 1 is lower the rv cf t10 60 parameter is a standardized fouling parameter with respect to the specific volume of permeate and not with respect to time on the other hand the exponential adjusted coefficient d from the eq 10 corresponding to the post initial phase does represent a rate of decline of the flux with respect to time the difference between the rv cf t10 60 parameter and the exponential coefficient d to express the fouling potential in the post initial phase can be seen when comparing their values from the tests of the 40 mg l 1 solution of alginate and the mixed solution of 1 g l 1 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate table 4 shows that the 40 mg l 1 alginate solution had a coefficient of decline d greater than of the mixed solution of peg and alginate this is also shown in fig 8 where the slope of decline from the 40 mg l 1 alginate solution was somewhat higher than that of the mixed solution of peg and alginate however table 2 shows that the mixed solution presents a value of rv cf t10 60 9 05 1012 m 2 greater than that of the 40 mg l 1 solution of alginate with rv cf t10 60 5 95 1012 m 2 to illustrate best the meaning of the rv cf t10 60 fig 9 graphically shows the total resistance r t with respect to the specific volume of permeate v t based on the eq 13 of the two solutions in fig 9 the value of rv cf t10 60 of each test was represented graphically by the slope of the straight line that joins the points between time t 10 min and t 60 min fig 9 also shows that between the instants t 10 min and t 60 min the increase of resistance produced by the mixed solution of peg and alginate was slightly greater than that of the solution with only alginate including with a smaller volume of permeate in the same interval of time as was mentioned above and also observed in the tests performed the measurement of the fouling potential through the rv cf t10 60 parameter is based on the increase of resistance with respect to the volume of permeate and provides information about fouling different than of parameters that evaluate the decrease of flux with respect to time as is the case of the coefficient d used in the empirical adjusted equation in the procedure used it was considered that the value of rv cf t10 60 is constant in the period of time estimated in the post initial phase and the degree of approximation may be observed through the graphic representation of r t vs v t as is the case in fig 9 the rv cf t10 60 parameter is not based on a specific fouling mechanism at the theoretical level the fouling mechanism that determines a constant value of the increase of resistance with respect to the specific volume of permeate which here is referred to generically as rv is the cake formation mechanism on the membrane that is the model from which the fouling index i is determined from the mfi as was mentioned in section 2 2 the rv cf t10 60 and the fouling index i are expressed in the same magnitude and type of unit which allows us to compare the fouling potential though they correspond to different fouling processes fouling index i is particularly associated with the characteristics of the fouling particles retained in the filtration without considering the membrane characteristics at a theoretical level it is a fouling parameter specifically for the incoming water whereas rv cf t10 60 is intended to evaluate in a short period of time the fouling tendencies of a membrane due to processes influenced both by the characteristics of the substances present in the water and by the characteristics of the membrane used in the filtration 5 conclusions in this paper a new method for characterize fouling in the initial stage of cross flow ultrafiltration was proposed two fouling parameters have been measured one in the initial phase of filtration called r cfi and another in the post initial phase of filtration called rv cf t10 60 in order to measure the parameters a numeric method has been developed based on the empirical adjustment of the data from permeate flux to a bi exponential equation that shows a good approximation of two phases of different flux decline within the initial stage the results obtained with the tested solutions of peg and alginate show that in relation to the type of solution molecular weight of the peg and concentrations of peg and alginate measurable values of the r cfi and rv cf t10 60 are obtained the values obtained from the parameters do not show a direct linear relationship with the concentration but are sensitive to the increase of this concentration to a different degree according to the type of solution and the type of membrane used the measurement of the fouling parameter through rv cf t10 60 that was observed presents different and complimentary information to the decline of flux with respect to time based on what can be seen when comparing the results of rv cf t10 60 from a mixed solution of 35 kda peg and alginate with a solution with the same concentration of only alginate the sensitivity and capacity to determine significant measurements of the rv cf t10 60 parameter were also evaluated an estimate of the error of measurement was made for this and the procedure was tested with different degrees of concentration of alginate increasing the time for measuring in the procedure from 1 to 2 h resulted in obtaining significant values with solutions of alginate in concentrations of 5 40 mg l 1 the numeric procedure used in determining the parameters is relatively simple and knowledge of the exact model of the fouling process is not required nor necessarily requires applying software to calculate it numerically the method may also be apt to initially evaluate the fouling in solutions composed by a mix of different water sources or with additives appendix a a 1 r cfi and rv cf after 5 10 and 15 min table 5 a

13831,ultrafiltration uf membrane is an attractive pretreatment technology used in desalination water system however the unavoidable membrane fouling over time is the key problem in the development of this technology fouling evaluation in the initial stage may provide relevant information about the fouling tendencies in this work the extent of fouling was investigated through a new method allows evaluating the fouling in cross flow uf in the initial filtration stage an empirical adjustment of flux decline data based on a bi exponential equation with 4 coefficients is proposed for determining the r cfi and rv cf parameters the first parameter r cfi is defined as the initial cross flow resistance the second parameter rv cf is defined as increasing resistance per specific volume of permeate in cross flow the measurement of the fouling parameters is evaluated in a laboratory facility with the following established conditions 1 operation in cross flow mode and 2 a flow measurement period limited to roughly 1 h the procedure is intended to detect two different flow decline zones with different fouling processes at the initial stage of cross flow filtration the method applicability was tested with two cellulosic membranes of 10 kda and 20 kda and solutions of 4 kda and 35 kda polyethylene glycol peg and alginate at different concentrations in the case of the r cfi parameter the results show measurable values with high colloidal concentration of peg the rv cf results shows a sensitive increase with foulant concentration in different degree depending on the type of solution

α specific cake resistance m kg 1 μ dynamic viscosity pa s 1 introduction a frequent problem in using membranes for water treatment is fouling 1 2 both in porous membranes for microfiltration mf 3 and ultrafiltration uf 4 6 as in non porous membranes for reverse osmosis ro 7 conventional indexes such as the silt density index sdi the modified fouling index mfi 8 variants of the mfi index 9 10 and other characterization indexes that have been proposed are intended to give meaningful information regarding fouling that occurs in a membrane most indexes proposed in the literature are based on measuring the permeate flux resistance during dead end operation 11 in this form of filtration the contribution to fouling of the different types of material present such as suspended solids colloids and dissolved organic matter is not distinguished similarly measurement procedures often require a rather high testing time for determining the fouling index these problems related to fouling indexes have been mentioned in various works 12 in the case of porous membranes the difference in their types makes it difficult to predict the type and extent of fouling based on an index that does not specifically consider the type of porous membrane used in the treatment on the other hand the fouling phenomenon in the initial transition stage in cross flow filtration has been the subject of fewer studies than the post initial or stationary flows 13 15 the fouling evaluation in the initial stage from one of the previous measurement parameters for the initial decline may provide relevant information about the fouling tendencies however in the initial stage of porous membrane filtration it is difficult to figure out a priori fouling mechanism and the corresponding flow equation for determining the derivative and the parameter value in some projects this difficulty of determining the main mechanism 16 has been verified due to the possibility of presenting a combination of different mechanisms within the initial stage the aim of this paper was to study and characterize the fouling in the initial filtration stage through a new method for evaluating the fouling in cross flow uf this method shall not require knowledge of the fouling mechanism and must be analyzed through a simple conceptual term like the increase of fouling resistance under certain conditions 2 theoretical background 2 1 fouling index i in their work for deducing mfi 8 schippers and verdouw used the cake deposition model they also speculate that when there was no cake compacting the cake resistance value r c may be expressed according to 1 r c i v a where v is the volume of permeate and a is the membrane surface the term fouling index i is understood as a measure of the potential of water fouling on the other side i can be determined according to the eq 2 17 18 2 i α c b where α is the specific cake resistance produced by particles that are deposited on the membrane surface and c b is the concentration of these particles in the supply water deduced in the same way from the mfi 8 i is related to mfi by 3 mfi μ i 2 δ p a 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and δp the transmembrane pressure both i and mfi are related with α and c b characteristics of the fouling particles present in the water supply according to eqs 2 and 3 to analyze i as a parameter of fouling from resistance eq 4 was used 4 i r c v a according to the eq 4 i can be interpreted as the cake deposit resistance r c formed by the specific volume of filtered permeate v a taking into consideration the dimension l 1 of r c and the dimension l of v a i has the dimension l 2 from its own deduction it is understood that i refers to the rate of increasing resistance per specific volume of permeate from cake formation and not from any other type of fouling mechanism in the same way as eq 4 i also must be considered as a parameter of fouling from resistance as mentioned following analysis of the α and c b magnitudes from the eq 2 2 2 the parameter fouling potential k and its relationship with i another parameter that may be considered for measuring fouling from resistance is the one defined by song et al 17 as fouling potential k according to the expression 5 r t r 0 k 0 t j dt where r 0 and r t are the hydraulic resistances of the membrane at the initial time and at the instant of time t and j the permeate flux at each time the hydraulic resistance r pa sm 1 is equivalent to μr being μ the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and r the intrinsic resistance m 1 in eq 5 the integral term 0 t j dt represents the specific volume of permeate from the start until the instant of time t of the filtration v t multiplied by the parameter k meaning the increase of the resistance produced by the volume of permeate in eq 5 the parameter k may be constant or variable with time derivation of eq 5 results in 6 d r t d t k j from eq 6 and considering the definition of j as derivative of the specific volume of permeate with respect to time therefore 7 k d r t j d t d r t d v the parameter k may be physically analyzed as the increase of resistance produced by the specific volume of permeate in a period of time if it is considered that k is constant in a determined period of time 8 k δ 0 t r δ 0 t v r t r 0 v t v 0 though originally defined differently its similarity to the parameter k can be seen as expressed in eq 8 with the fouling index i expressed in eq 4 both k and i express increasing resistance per specific unit of permeate i by definition is a parameter that is considered constant because its deduction according to the mfi is based on the mechanism of cake deposition for which the cake resistance r c increases constantly with respect to the volume of permeate the parameter k on the other hand may be considered constant or variable with respect to the volume of permeate according to the original definition in the case of the mechanism of fouling from cake formation the parameter k is constant and presents conceptual similarity with the fouling index i for other mechanisms of fouling the parameter k may be variable and its analytic determination may come given from the variation of resistance with respect to the specific volume of permeate according to eq 7 2 3 cross flow resistance r cfi and rv cf two parameters are considered as parameters of water membrane fouling and they are called initial cross flow resistance r cfi and cross flow resistance per permeate specific volume rv cf in the initial phase fig 1 fouling was measure through the parameter r cfi this parameter is based on the simple measure of the increasing resistance that is produced in the initial phase of filtration due to the presence of colloidal matter where a faster flux decline is produced than in the post initial phase an arbitrary time of 10 min from the start of the filtration is set in the measurement procedure of r cfi called the r cfi t10 the determination of r cfi by extrapolating the initial time t 0 from a term of the empirical permeate flux equation shall also be considered and is called r cfi t0 the rv cf parameter was used to characterize the fouling in the second phase or the post initial phase of decline of flow that begins after the stabilization of the deposition of particles in the initial phase due to the effect of the cross flow this parameter is measured in a discrete interval of time in the post initial phase to determine the rv cf value it is assumed that the value is constant in the measurement period in accordance with the expression 9 rv cf t 1 t 2 r t 2 r t 1 v t 2 v t 1 where the sub indexes t1 and t2 indicate the initial and final instants of time in the filtration used to determine the values of resistance r t and the specific volume of permeate v t the methodology proposed in this research work allows calculating r cfi and rv cf for different time values as it is summarized in the appendix however values do not change significantly 3 material and methods 3 1 model foulants fouling experiments were performed using two commercial polyethylene glycol peg with a molecular weight of 4 kda merck ref 8 07490 and 35 kda merck ref 8 18892 the concentrations used in the experiments were 0 5 g l 1 1 g l 1 and 2 g l 1 for both peg also commercial sodium alginate extracted from brown algae sigma aldrich with of molecular weight of 12 80 kda was used as model of organic fouling the concentrations used for this foulant were 5 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 40 mg l 1 3 2 membranes two cellulosic flat sheet membranes were used called c20k and c10k with a molecular weight cut off mwco according to the manufacturer of 20 kda ca600pp dow and 10 kda rc70pp dow respectively the clean membrane resistance r m of the c20k and c10k were 11 0 1012 m 1 and 17 5 1012 m 1 respectively based on the average value of different measurements of permeability with clean deionized water millipore elix 3 3 3 experimental set up the experiments were carried out in a laboratory cross flow uf unit this plant was equipped with a variable speed vane pump g 07116 11 cole parmer ee uu three tanks feed permeate and brine two manometers placed at both sides of the membrane a cross flow filtration module for flat sheet membranes of 42 cm2 of active surface of filtration cf042 sterlitech ee uu and a thermometer fig 2 shows a complete schematic diagram of the laboratory cross flow uf unit the incoming temperature is measured with a thermometer in the incoming line increments of 0 1 c crossflow velocity was controlled with a variable speed volumetric pump the outgoing flow rate from the retentate line is measured through a rotameter with a 0 300 l h 1 range increments of 5 l h 1 in all cases tested the flow rate of permeate was less than 1 of the incoming flow rate and so the value of the cross flow rate was considered the same as the measurement from the rotameter in the retentate line the pressure was measured with two 0 6 bar manometers increments of 0 1 bar located in the incoming line and the retentate line and measures the transmembrane pressure by taking the average pressure reading from the pressure gauges the permeate weight was measured using an electronic balance xt 220 cobos 0 220 g range 0 1 mg accuracy connected to a data acquisition system 3 4 experimental procedures before fouling tests the membranes were kept soaking for approximately 1 h in order to wash them the uf membranes were cleaned with osmotic water during 24 h after each test in order to verify the effectiveness of the cleaning wash procedure the permeability was measure until it reach 90 later they were placed in the filtration module and the same operation conditions were adjusted for all fouling test performed the transmembrane pressure set was 200 kpa the flow rate coming into the module was maintained at 2 78 10 5 m3 s 1 100 l h 1 with an average cross flow velocity of 0 32 m s 1 the permeate flux measurements were taken at different room temperatures in a normal range between 18 and 24 c the flow measurements were standardized to the reference temperature of 20 c using a correction factor from the viscosity the initial measurement of permeability with clean water has been carried out through various measurements of weight of permeate collected in time intervals of 5 min and it was verified that the measurements were maintained stable at least for 1 h before the start of the fouling tests according to the same procedure mentioned above about the initial measurement of permeability the maximum error estimated in the measurement of flow rate is approximately 5 however given repeated measurements in stable flow conditions with clean water it was considered that the error of permeate flow rate measurement with this procedure was less and in practice was estimated to be 2 the initial measurement of permeability with clean water is considered to be stable when the flow rate of permeate values were maintained within this margin of error and did not show an increasing or decreasing trend during a minimum interval of 1 h the flow rate measurements in the initial phase may present a greater flow rate decline than in the post initial phase and have been measured through values of permeate weight transmitted by the electronic balance to the computer with a frequency of 5 s the permeate flow rate was determined from the difference in weight registered during an interval of 20 s flow rate measurements were taken with this procedure every 1 min between the first 10 min of the filtration the estimated measurement error is approximately 5 based on the criteria of relative weight of the drops with respect to the weight of the permeate the time for measuring was 1 h in the tests with 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg and 2 h in tests with alginate when finishing the test clean water was passed again through the membrane normally the membranes are re used in later tests as long as the reduction of flux was not less than 10 with respect to the measurement of permeability in its first use 3 5 fouling parameters determination fitting procedure 3 5 1 bi exponential flow equation when operating in cross flow mode it is predicted that the solutions containing colloidal material and other dissolved organic substances may present two different areas or phases of decline of flow within the initial filtration stage ruiz garcía and nuez 19 already proposed a bi exponential model for estimating the decline of water permeability coefficient in brackish water ro desalination plants the decline was differentiated in two stages the first stage represented a more pronounced decline due to initial compaction and irreversible fouling the second stage on the other hand described a more stable period with less slope for that reason a bi exponential model based on four terms eq 10 was used to fit the permeate flux data in two areas with different decline within the initial filtration period 10 j b e b t d e d t b and d coefficients are expressed in units of flux dimension lt 1 in the usual unit of m s 1 and the sum of both corresponds with the permeate flux value at the initial instant the b and d coefficients are expressed in units of reverse time t 1 dimension in the usual unit of s 1 the use empirical eq 10 simplifies the calculation of the fouling parameters and allows standardizing their determination for the same periods of selected time the parameters identification of the mentioned models was calculated using the nelder mead simplex method 20 implemented in matlab software a criteria was established to maintain the initial point of flux from the adjusted curve with a difference lower than 4 with respect to the initial experimental point of flux 3 5 2 equations of resistance and specific volume of permeate the total resistance r t may be determined at each instant by substituting the empirical equation of j in the darcy equation in this way the expression for r t was obtained 11 r t δ p μ j δ p μ b e b t d e d t the value of the specific volume of permeate v t 0 t j dt at each instant can be calculated from eq 10 12 v t b b 1 e b t d d 1 e d t parametrically the value of r t in relation to v t can be determined from eqs 11 and 12 for different instants of time 13 r t f v t t 3 5 3 determining the r cfi parameter two different procedures have been used to determine its value in the first procedure its value was determined from the difference between the total resistance r t taken from eq 11 in a reference time of t 10 min r t10 and the value of resistance from the clean membrane r m 14 r cfi t 10 r t 10 r m δ p μ j t 10 r m where j t10 is the value of flux determined by eq 10 in t 10 min the reference time taken at 10 min is arbitrary and was used in this project to measure the r cfi in all tests and was indicated as the r cfi t10 parameter the second procedure to determine r cfi t10 used an extrapolation at the initial instant t 0 from the second exponential term corresponding to the post initial phase of the empirical flux equation called j p2 and is shown in eq 15 r p2 is the theoretical resistance that is taken at any instant discounting resistance due to the first phase of decline determined by the first exponential term of the empirical flux equation the value of r p2 comes from the eq 16 15 j p 2 d e d t 16 r p 2 δ p μ j p 2 from eq 16 a theoretical resistance of initial decline may be determined at the initial instant t 0 called r cfi t0 which is the difference between r p2 in t 0 and the initial resistance corresponding to the clean membrane r m 17 r cfi t 0 r p 2 t 10 r m δ p μ d r m according to eq 17 r cfi t0 may be obtained simply from the d coefficient of the empirical flux equation and the known resistance of the membrane r m the type of post initial decline characterized by the term j p2 determines the degree of difference that there may be between the values of r cfi t10 and r cfi t0 to determine r cfi 3 5 4 determining the rv cf parameter the rv cf parameter was intended to determine the membrane fouling tendencies in the post initial phase after the decline by initial colloidal fouling an arbitrary period of time of 10 60 min has been selected to perform the rv cf measurement during the filtration period and its value was determined from the values of total resistance r t and the total volume of permeate v t at these instants 18 rv cf t 10 60 r t 60 r t 10 v t 60 v t 10 the values of r t and v t at each instant of time indicated by the sub indexes t10 and t60 were determined according to eqs 11 and 12 4 results and discussion 4 1 fouling tests with 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg as an example of the type of fouling tests performed fig 3 shows the flux data and the bi exponential adjusted curve based on eq 10 obtained in the test corresponding to the solution of 2 g l 1 of 35 kda peg with the c20k membrane fig 4 shows the curve of total resistance r t with respect to the total specific volume of permeate v t determined according to eq 13 for the same test the coefficients from the bi exponential adjusted equation from the test are shown in table 1 test n 5 in fig 4 the slope of the straight line between the points corresponding to t 10 min and t 60 min indicated by the vertical lines represents the value of rv cf t10 60 in this test like in all tests performed with 35 kda peg and 4 kda peg the value of rv cf t10 60 obtained from eq 18 cannot be considered as significant for fouling because it was below the minimum significant value of rv cf t10 60 to determine the minimum significant value of fouling rv cf t10 60 an estimation was made that takes the error of the measurement of flux into consideration as mentioned in the following the test shown in fig 3 indicates the post initial decline of the flux was very low and the value of the slope that was determined from the numeric procedure was not significant in terms of decline in flux and real post initial fouling due to error in measuring flux for considering that the calculated value of rv cf t10 60 represents a significant value of fouling an estimate was made from a minimum significant value of the coefficient of decline d from the eq 10 that determines the flux decline for the post initial area in the post initial phase the zone of determining rv cf the value of the first exponential term of the flux equation was practically negligible and the flux may be considered equal to the second exponential term j p2 according to eq 15 the period of time between the first and the last measurement of flux in this post initial phase was commonly 40 min first measurement at t1 20 min and the last measurement at t2 60 min creating this interval of 40 min 2400 s the values of flux at these instants of time based on the adjusted equation would be 19 j t 1 d e d t 1 20 j t 2 d e d t 2 d e d t 1 2400 taking into account that the estimated error of the flux measurements taken in this post initial period was 2 the coefficient d shall have a clearly significant value in the mono exponential adjusted curve if the difference between the values of j t1 and j t2 is at least 4 between both in this way considering a value of j t2 0 96 j t1 and substituting and simplifying in eq 20 it is understood that the minimum significant value of d for an interval of time between measurements of 40 min is d 17 0 10 6 s 1 this estimate is simply based on two measurements of permeate flux one at the initial instant t1 and another at the end of the interval t2 with a greater interval of time between j t1 and j t2 the significant value of d would be less for the same estimated error as 2 in the measurements of flux in order to determine significant values of the coefficient of decline d in the later tests with alginate the time for measuring was increased up to approximately 2 h with an interval of time between the initial and final measurement of the post initial phase of 100 min t1 20 min and t2 100 min with the same criteria the minimum significant value of the coefficient d decreases for this interval of time from 100 min and is d 6 8 10 6 s 1 the value obtained for d was less than the minimum value estimated for d 17 0 10 6 s 1 for all the fouling tests with 35 kda peg and 4 kda peg with which the values of rv cf t10 60 that were calculated in these tests and which are shown in section 4 5 cannot be considered as clearly significant in fouling due to the hydrophilic character of peg and the cellulosic membranes it is logical to think that fouling may not really be produced in the post initial phase or if is produced it is less than the fouling detectable in the time for measuring these tests of approximately 1 h table 1 shows the values of the coefficients of the bi exponential adjusted equation for the tests of 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg with the c20k membrane test 1 5 and c10k membrane test 6 10 the bi exponential adjusted curves of flux decline from these tests are shown in fig 5 for this peg tests with c20k membrane the results from the r cfi parameter are shown in table 2 and the results from the rv cf t10 60 parameter are shown in table 2 table 2 shows the values of the fouling parameter r cfi at t 10 min r cfi t10 based on eq 14 and at t 0 r cfi t0 based on eq 17 from the fouling tests performed on c20k and c10k membranes with solutions of 4 kda peg 35 kda peg and alginate table 2 shows the values of the fouling parameter rv cf t10 60 obtained from eq 18 from the fouling tests performed on c20k and c10k membranes with solutions of 4 kda peg 35 kda peg and alginate the values marked with an asterisk do not confirm fouling according to the estimation based on the measurement conditions of the test the flux curves in fig 5 show the effect of molecular weight of 4 kda and 35 kda peg and of the concentration in the fouling tendencies of the c20k membrane in this membrane the 4 kda peg in its three concentrations produces a much lower initial decline than the initial decline of the 35 kda peg which is also seen from the values of r cfi obtained in table 2 this difference may be explained by taking into account the mwco of 20 kda from the c20k membrane which is clearly greater than the molecular weight of the 4 kda peg the r cfi of the 4 kda peg increases though not linearly when increasing the concentration and that is considered to be due to the increase of the concentration polarization phenomena this result is consistent with other research works where an increasing of degree fouling with foulant concentration was attributed to an increasing resistance due to adsorption and concentration polarization with time 21 as mentioned after section 4 4 in the fouling tests performed with peg the differences between the values of r cfi t10 and r cfi t0 table 2 were very small considering that both procedures for determining r cfi are valid for measuring the initial decline with peg the greater retention of the 35 kda peg produces a greater initial decline as shown in fig 5 and in the values of r cfi in table 2 likewise as mentioned later in section 4 5 in the post initial phase both with the 4 kda peg and the 35 kda peg barely any flux decline was observed see fig 5 where values of the rv cf t10 60 parameter lower than the minimum significant value of fouling are obtained according to the criteria mentioned above see table 2 table 1 shows the values of the coefficients of the bi exponential adjusted equation for the peg tests of 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg with the c10k membrane the bi exponential adjusted curves of the decline in flux from these tests are shown in fig 6 as observed in fig 6 with the c10k membrane and in the same way as the c20k membrane the molecular weight of peg and the concentration influence in the initial decline of flux likewise with this membrane no measurable decline of flux was observed in the post initial phase the results from the r cfi parameter corresponding to the initial decline are shown in table 2 and are mentioned in section 4 4 the results from the rv cf t10 60 parameter corresponding to the post initial decline are shown in table 2 4 2 fouling tests with alginate in the tests performed with 4 kda peg and 35 kda peg the concentrations used were relatively high and some measurable values of initial cross flow decline measured by r cfi were observed however no measurable values of post initial decline as denoted by rv cf t10 60 were obtained either because no fouling was produced in the post initial phase or by not being detectable due to the method in the interval of measurement of roughly 1 h to verify the possibility of taking measurable values of post initial fouling with the rv cf t10 60 parameter fouling tests with sodium alginate sigma aldrich were performed which is a species of organic polysaccharide foulant the alginate is a common product present as natural organic material nom in water and is identified as an agent that causes fouling in the membranes contrary to the high concentration of peg the used concentrations of alginate were 5 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 40 mg l 1 and have been tested with the c20k membrane in these tests the time for measuring was increased from 1 h to approximately 2 h when increasing the interval of time between the first and last measurement of permeate flux in the post initial phase the exponential adjusted coefficient d from this phase is less sensitive to measurement error from the experimental flux data as mentioned in section 4 1 with an interval of measurement of 100 min in the post initial phase the minimum significant value in the adjustment of the coefficient d was 6 8 10 6 s 1 in practice when performing various permeate flux measurements in the post initial phase the value of the coefficient d obtained from the empirical adjustment is significant although it is less than the estimate of d 6 8 10 6 s 1 if a clear decreasing trend is observed for the measurements of flux in the post initial phase in the case of tests performed with alginate all with a testing time of roughly 2 h all the adjusted coefficients d have been considered significant in the same way as the values from the corresponding rv cf t10 60 parameter that are obtained from the calculation procedure table 3 shows the values of the coefficients of the bi exponential adjusted equation for alginate tests with the c20k membrane the bi exponential adjusted curves of permeate flux from these tests are shown in fig 7 based on the observations in fig 7 the tested solutions of alginate with the c20k membrane have a low initial decline of flux though it is appreciated that it increases with the concentration also and contrary to tested solutions of peg with the solutions of alginate in the c20k membrane an appreciable flux decline was observed in the post initial phase and measurable values of the rv cf t10 60 were determined the results from the r cfi parameter corresponding to the initial decline from the alginate solutions with the c20k membrane are shown in table 2 the results from the rv cf t10 60 parameter corresponding to the post initial decline of these tests are shown in table 2 and are mentioned in section 4 5 4 3 fouling tests with alginate and 35 kda peg the tests performed with peg show an appreciable initial flux decline as seen in the r cfi values table 2 and in the curves of flux decline figs 5 and 6 however no measurable values of decline of post initial flux were observed based on the rv cf t10 60 parameter on the other hand in the tests performed with alginate measurable values of post initial decline were observed from the rv cf t10 60 parameter though the initial decline from the r cfi parameter is low especially in comparison with the values of initial decline in the 35 kda peg solutions with the objective of checking measurable values within a test for both the initial decline through the r cfi parameter and the post initial decline through the rv cf t10 60 parameter a fouling test has been performed with a mixed solution containing 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate table 4 shows the values of the coefficients of the bi exponential adjusted equation of the mix of 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate with the c20k membrane along with the values of the coefficients determined in the previous tests with the solutions of 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg test n 4 and the solution of 40 mg l 1 of alginate test n 14 with the same c20k membrane fig 8 represents the curves of the bi exponential equations of the flux decline of the mixed solution of peg and alginate and of the 40 mg l 1 solution of alginate the mixed solution of 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate produced both a measurable initial and post initial decline as seen in fig 8 and from the values of the r cfi and rv cf t10 60 in table 2 in fig 8 the 40 mg l 1 solution of alginate shows a post initial flux decline that is slightly greater than the mixed solution of peg and alginate as is also observed by the coefficients d from the exponential adjustment to each one of the solutions in table 4 however in terms of the rv cf t10 60 parameter indicated in table 2 the degree of post initial fouling of the mixed solution of peg and alginate is greater than that of the solution that contains only 40 mg l 1 of alginate as seen in fig 9 this apparently contradictory result is mentioned in section 4 5 which discusses the results from the rv cf t10 60 parameter 4 4 results from the r cfi fouling parameter r cfi t10 and r cfi t0 to determine the value of r cfi by r cfi t10 with eq 14 and also by r cfi t0 with eq 17 the value of the initial resistance or resistance of the clean membrane r m was used the value of r m has been determined based on the measurement of permeability with clean water before the start of the fouling test and the value for each one of the tests performed is shown in table 6 the values used for r m are those indicated in table 6 though an initial value of flux at t 0 can also be used taken from the bi exponential adjusted equation eq 10 which corresponds to the sum of the coefficients b and d and then determine r m through the darcy equation the difference between both values of r m depends on the difference between the experimental value of initial flux determined by measuring permeability and the value of flux obtained from the empirical adjustment to the bi exponential curve at t 0 table 2 shows the values of r cfi determined as r cfi t10 based on eq 14 and as r cfi t0 based on eq 17 in each one of the fouling tests performed with the c20k and c10k membranes in all tests the parameters are determined with the value of transmembrane pressure δp 200 kpa and the value of dynamic viscosity μ of the water at 20 c as shown in table 2 the tests in general showed little difference between the values of r cfi determined at t 10 min r cfi t10 and by extrapolation at t 0 r cfi t0 if the stabilization of flux is produced before the period considered t 10 min and the flux decline of the post initial phase is low as occurred in the tests that we performed little difference is found between the values of r cfi t0 and r cfi t10 in those tests where the period of initial flux decline is longer than 10 min or in tests with greater post initial decline the difference between both values of r cfi may be greater in the case of the 4 kda peg the values of r cfi determined with the c20k membrane and with the c10k membrane are significantly different this may be explained by the difference in the retention in each membrane of the 4 kda peg the molecular weight of the colloid is less than the mwco of both membranes though it is expected that the 4 kda peg retention in the c10k membrane is greater than in the c20k membrane producing a greater resistance as based on the results from the r cfi measurements in both cases the r cfi increased with the concentration though the increase was more significant in the c10k membrane with a lower mwco similar values of r cfi were taken with the 35 kda peg in both membranes in this case the molecular weight of the colloid was greater than the mwco of the two membranes and it can be considered that the retention of the colloid and the initial resistance that was produced in both was similar with the same increasing r cfi with the concentration the tests with alginate were made only with the c20k membrane in general the r cfi values with alginate were low though a certain increase of the r cfi can be observed with the concentration it should be pointed out that the concentrations of the alginate solutions were notably lower than the peg solutions as a case of the effect on the value of r cfi when mixing different solutions the mixed solution with 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate shows a value of r cfi slightly higher than the value obtained in the solution with only 1 g l 1 of 35 kda peg as seen in table 2 as seen in the results obtained the r cfi parameter can evaluate a determined degree of initial fouling of a solution in cross flow operation although the r cfi parameter shows the effect of the increase of the concentration the r cfi is not a linear parameter with the concentration the r cfi parameter increases with the concentration but does not show a linear relationship to the same in addition the r cfi is affected by other factors different than the concentration such as the hydrodynamic cross flow conditions the forces of colloid membrane interaction and also the interaction between the colloids the r cfi parameter may give information about the degree of initial fouling that a type of water produces under specific conditions and determined by the characteristics of the porous membrane and by the hydrodynamic cross flow conditions the extent of initial deposition of colloidal substances depends on the balance of convective forces between the cross flow and the permeate flow in more porous membranes than the uf such as the microfiltration mf membranes the flow of permeate is greater and the colloidal particles that tend to get deposited on the membrane are bigger as observed in the experiments performed by mccarthy et al 22 the increase of the transmembrane pressure has a similar effect due to the increase of the permeate flow the model of initial flux decline performed by hong et al 13 also predicts that the initial permeate flux decline rate k 0 increases directly with the value of the transmembrane pressure δp and reduces when increasing the resistance of the membrane r m on the other hand the increase of the cross flow velocity has an effect of selective deposition of smaller particles that generally produce a greater resistance specific to the cake particles 22 4 5 results from the rv cf t10 60 fouling parameter table 2 shows the results of the characterization parameter of post initial fouling rv cf t10 60 obtained from eq 18 from the different tests performed in table 2 the rv cf t10 60 results indicated with an asterisk do not confirm fouling because they were calculated in the procedure with values of the exponential adjusted coefficient d that were less than the significant value according to the criteria of estimating error of measurements of flux and of the interval of measuring time of the post initial phase the interval for measuring time was 1 h in the tests performed with 4 kda and 35 kda peg with a measurement interval of 40 min in the post initial phase and 2 h in the tests performed with alginate with a measurement interval of 100 min in the post initial phase in the case of the tests performed with peg the reason for not determining measurable values of fouling from rv cf t10 60 is mentioned in section 4 1 which discusses the results of the flux measurements with 4 kda and 35 kda as seen in table 2 the values of rv cf t10 60 show fouling in the post initial phase with the four solutions of alginate and with the mixed solution of 35 kda peg and alginate as was previously mentioned in corresponding sections 4 2 and 4 3 of flux measurements the rv cf t10 60 results from the four alginate solutions show a growing value with the concentration although not linear and the effect of the rv cf t10 60 increasing from the concentration of 10 mg l 1 is lower the rv cf t10 60 parameter is a standardized fouling parameter with respect to the specific volume of permeate and not with respect to time on the other hand the exponential adjusted coefficient d from the eq 10 corresponding to the post initial phase does represent a rate of decline of the flux with respect to time the difference between the rv cf t10 60 parameter and the exponential coefficient d to express the fouling potential in the post initial phase can be seen when comparing their values from the tests of the 40 mg l 1 solution of alginate and the mixed solution of 1 g l 1 35 kda peg and 40 mg l 1 of alginate table 4 shows that the 40 mg l 1 alginate solution had a coefficient of decline d greater than of the mixed solution of peg and alginate this is also shown in fig 8 where the slope of decline from the 40 mg l 1 alginate solution was somewhat higher than that of the mixed solution of peg and alginate however table 2 shows that the mixed solution presents a value of rv cf t10 60 9 05 1012 m 2 greater than that of the 40 mg l 1 solution of alginate with rv cf t10 60 5 95 1012 m 2 to illustrate best the meaning of the rv cf t10 60 fig 9 graphically shows the total resistance r t with respect to the specific volume of permeate v t based on the eq 13 of the two solutions in fig 9 the value of rv cf t10 60 of each test was represented graphically by the slope of the straight line that joins the points between time t 10 min and t 60 min fig 9 also shows that between the instants t 10 min and t 60 min the increase of resistance produced by the mixed solution of peg and alginate was slightly greater than that of the solution with only alginate including with a smaller volume of permeate in the same interval of time as was mentioned above and also observed in the tests performed the measurement of the fouling potential through the rv cf t10 60 parameter is based on the increase of resistance with respect to the volume of permeate and provides information about fouling different than of parameters that evaluate the decrease of flux with respect to time as is the case of the coefficient d used in the empirical adjusted equation in the procedure used it was considered that the value of rv cf t10 60 is constant in the period of time estimated in the post initial phase and the degree of approximation may be observed through the graphic representation of r t vs v t as is the case in fig 9 the rv cf t10 60 parameter is not based on a specific fouling mechanism at the theoretical level the fouling mechanism that determines a constant value of the increase of resistance with respect to the specific volume of permeate which here is referred to generically as rv is the cake formation mechanism on the membrane that is the model from which the fouling index i is determined from the mfi as was mentioned in section 2 2 the rv cf t10 60 and the fouling index i are expressed in the same magnitude and type of unit which allows us to compare the fouling potential though they correspond to different fouling processes fouling index i is particularly associated with the characteristics of the fouling particles retained in the filtration without considering the membrane characteristics at a theoretical level it is a fouling parameter specifically for the incoming water whereas rv cf t10 60 is intended to evaluate in a short period of time the fouling tendencies of a membrane due to processes influenced both by the characteristics of the substances present in the water and by the characteristics of the membrane used in the filtration 5 conclusions in this paper a new method for characterize fouling in the initial stage of cross flow ultrafiltration was proposed two fouling parameters have been measured one in the initial phase of filtration called r cfi and another in the post initial phase of filtration called rv cf t10 60 in order to measure the parameters a numeric method has been developed based on the empirical adjustment of the data from permeate flux to a bi exponential equation that shows a good approximation of two phases of different flux decline within the initial stage the results obtained with the tested solutions of peg and alginate show that in relation to the type of solution molecular weight of the peg and concentrations of peg and alginate measurable values of the r cfi and rv cf t10 60 are obtained the values obtained from the parameters do not show a direct linear relationship with the concentration but are sensitive to the increase of this concentration to a different degree according to the type of solution and the type of membrane used the measurement of the fouling parameter through rv cf t10 60 that was observed presents different and complimentary information to the decline of flux with respect to time based on what can be seen when comparing the results of rv cf t10 60 from a mixed solution of 35 kda peg and alginate with a solution with the same concentration of only alginate the sensitivity and capacity to determine significant measurements of the rv cf t10 60 parameter were also evaluated an estimate of the error of measurement was made for this and the procedure was tested with different degrees of concentration of alginate increasing the time for measuring in the procedure from 1 to 2 h resulted in obtaining significant values with solutions of alginate in concentrations of 5 40 mg l 1 the numeric procedure used in determining the parameters is relatively simple and knowledge of the exact model of the fouling process is not required nor necessarily requires applying software to calculate it numerically the method may also be apt to initially evaluate the fouling in solutions composed by a mix of different water sources or with additives appendix a a 1 r cfi and rv cf after 5 10 and 15 min table 5 a

13832,biofouling caused by microorganism is a serious problem that inhibits the application of membrane technology in wastewater treatment to overcome this drawback a novel silver nanowire carbon nanotube coal based carbon agnw cnt cc composite membrane was prepared with fascinating antimicrobial ability and electrochemically enhanced biofouling resistance the addition of agnws could significantly enhance its antibacterial activity of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane by releasing the silver ions or direct contact and accelerated bacterial detachment from membrane surface the final flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane 70 5 of its initial value was 1 57 times higher than that for the cnt cc membrane 45 of its initial value without an external voltage importantly incorporating agnws was beneficial for electrochemical assistance which exhibited a prominent synergistic antibiofouling performance the flux of the cathodic agnw cnt cc composite membrane was stable with acceptable flux loss 95 7 of its initial value under a low voltage of 3 5 v demonstrating the bacteria migration to the membrane surface can be inhibited by electrostatic repulsive and micro bubbles generated via water electrolysis thus promoting the inactivated bacteria to leave the membrane surface and avoid the formation of a biofilm while the steady state flux declined to 82 5 of its initial value for electrochemically assisted cnt cc membrane moreover the regeneration of the fouled membrane can be achieved by applying an intermittent external voltage to promote the inactivated bacteria away from the membrane surface these results suggested that the integration of electrochemistry with antimicrobial modification offers a new insight for biofouling mitigation during membrane separation keywords silver nanowire electrochemical assistance antibiofouling antibacterial modification carbon membrane 1 introduction with the increasing process of industrialization and rapid growth of population the demands on water resources in industry agriculture and people s daily life increase dramatically and hence water shortage and water pollution have been the major challenges to human beings 1 2 due to the significant advantages of low energy consumption low cost and no chemical additives membrane separation has been widely applied in water and wastewater treatment to produce clean and potable water 3 7 however the current membranes usually suffer from the major problem of membrane fouling that can cause severe flux decline shorten membrane lifetime frequent flux recovery and even membrane replacement 8 10 thus designing efficient antifouling strategies is crucial for membrane application in water treatment process typically membrane fouling can be divided into four categories inorganic fouling organic fouling colloidal fouling and biofouling among which biofouling is considered as the most complicated one 11 since bacteria adhere on the membrane surface via physical interactions the regrowth of bacteria as well as propagation would lead to the biofilm formation on the membrane surface 12 15 thus inhibiting bacterial adhesion on membrane surface is very important to biofouling mitigation so far many strategies have been adopted to alleviate biofouling for example a series of surface functionalization strategies are used to prevent bacterial adhesion mainly by adjusting surface hydrophilicity and roughness however these strategies can only effectively inhibit biofouling at the initial stage but not completely inactivate the bacteria in a long term operation the development of biofouling is inevitable as only a few bacterial cells attached to the membrane surface can lead to formation of a biofilm thus other more effective approaches are needed including antimicrobial modifications with bactericidal capabilities to the membrane surface 16 19 antibacterial modification is an efficient approach to improve resistance to biofouling 20 21 for contact type antibiofouling modification the bacterial cells would be inactivated after bacterial attachment onto membrane surface due to the excellent antibacterial activity of the antibacterial modifier such as nano silver 22 24 the reason is that the reaction of silver ions with sh groups in bacteria cells inhibited the activity of protein and dna replication to inactivate bacteria 13 unfortunately if the inactivated cells do not leave from the membrane surface timely the subsequent adhesion of dissociative bacteria would cause biofilm formation in addition the inactivation behavior mainly occurs when bacteria contacting the membrane surface but does not actually suppress initial bacterial adhesion 20 25 it is generally considered that limiting the initial adhesion of bacteria is one of the important measures to prevent biofilm formation however the initial attachment of bacteria to the membrane surface is considered a reversible process by which bacterial cells can be separated from the membrane surface if sufficient counterforce is applied 26 28 to date introducing electrochemical assistance is considered as a nondestructive approach to suppress bacterial migration toward to membrane surface through electrostatic interaction and micro bubbles generated by water electrolysis 29 32 most bacteria were negatively charged because of the proteins and carbohydrate of cell surface the hydraulic force that typically drives bacteria to membrane would be weakened by the electrostatic repulsion between the same charged cathodic membrane and bacteria cells 33 35 in addition the process of water electrolysis also can generate some micro bubbles to separate the bacteria from the membrane surface 36 37 although electrostatic interaction and micro bubbles represents excellent resistance to biofouling some living bacteria can still adhere firmly to the cathode membrane and subsequently develop into biofilms 31 moreover the electrolytic reduction of oxygen would produce a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide which lacks sufficient disinfection capacity for the active cells adsorbed on the cathode membrane 38 therefore the combination of electrochemistry and antibacterial modification may offer a new idea to overcome the above difficulties in this work the integration of antibacterial modification with electrochemical assistance was designed to further improve the resistance to biofouling over a long period of operation time the contact type antibacterial modification would inactive the adhered bacteria and weaken the bonding force between the cells and membrane surface under the assistance of electrostatic repulsion and micro bubbles generated via water electrolysis the inactivated cells might leave from the membrane timely meanwhile the electrostatic repulsion would suppress the bacteria migration toward to same charged membrane surface thus decreasing the initial adhesion of waterborne pathogens to confirm this hypothesis an antibacterial silver nanowire carbon nanotube coal based carbon agnw cnt cc electroconductive composite membrane was prepared by the deposition of agnw cnt on a coal based carbon membrane surface via vacuum filtration method the silver nanowire acted as the antibacterial modifier due to their excellent antibacterial ability the coal based carbon membrane and cnts were chosen to prepare cathode membrane because of their good electroconductivity the anti biofouling performance was systematically studied and compared with bare membrane antibacterial membrane without electrochemistry and electrochemical membrane without antibacterial ability 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials multi walled cnts 9 10 wt and silver nanowires agnws suspension 20 mg ml diameter 40 nm length 20 60 μm were purchased from xfnano nanjing china phosphate buffered saline pbs was obtained from aladdin shanghai china escherichia coli e coli was obtained from transgen biotech beijing china the luria bertani lb medium used for e coli incubation were purchased from hangzhou baisi biotechnology co ltd all chemicals were analytical grade without further purification 2 2 preparation of agnw cnt cc membrane a tubular coal based carbon cc membrane with average pore size of 0 382 μm and was fabricated by our previous work 39 which was employed as the support for the agnw cnt composite separation layer firstly different blending ratios of cnts and agnws were uniformly dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonic bath agnw cnt 0 0 01 1 0 05 1 0 1 1 0 15 1 0 2 1 then the mixture of cnts and agnws was coated on the outer surface of cc membrane by vacuum filtration finally the membrane was annealed at 300 c in a nitrogen environment for 90 min to obtain the final agnw cnt cc composite membrane by contrast pure cc membrane and cnt cc membrane were also prepared but without agnw cnt and agnws 2 3 membranes characterization the crystal structure of the prepared membrane was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd d max 2400 japan the surface and cross section morphology of the fabricated membrane was observed by using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 the pore size was determined by capillary flow porometry porolux 1000 2 4 antibacterial activity the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes was evaluated through halo zone test 40 all glassware and materials were sterilized in autoclave prior in the experiment e coli the model gram negative bacteria was chosen as model bacteria because it can widely reproduce in water 25 the e coli was cultured in a sterilized lb broth firstly luria bertani lb nutrient broth 1000 ml containing 10 g tryptone 5 g yeast extract and 10 sodium chloride at ph 7 4 was sterilized in an autoclave by high temperature sterilization at 121 c for 15 min after that the e coli was inoculated into lb liquid medium under sterile environment and placed in a shaking incubator 130 rpm at 36 c for 24 h after three centrifugations and washes with pbs e coil were then resuspended in a sterile pbs solution to reach a concentration of about 104 cfu ml 100 μl of the e coli suspension was taken to smear evenly on the sterilized lb solid medium the membrane was subsequently placed on the lb solid medium and cultivation for 24 h at room temperature the inhibition zone formed around the membrane after 24 h which can work as an indicator to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the membrane and its area change was recorded by photos 2 5 performance evaluation of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane the permeability and selectivity bacterial rejection of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane was evaluated by a lab scale dead end membrane filtration system fig 1 presents the filtration system used in this study the agnw cnt cc composite membrane was served as cathode with an effect surface area of 15 cm2 and a ti plate worked as anode which were both connected to the dc power the distance between the two electrodes was 5 cm a peristaltic pump was used to conveyed feed solution to the membrane module the velocity of feed solution stood at 2 ml min through adjusting the peristaltic pump the permeate flux was measured according to the following equation 1 j v t a δ p where j is the flux l m2 h bar v is the permeate volume l a is the effective membrane surface area m2 t is the permeation time h and δp is the transmembrane pressure bar the filtration performance of the composite membrane was evaluated by intermittent and continuous power supply bacteria rejection efficiency as another examination index of membrane performance was determined by the concentration of bacteria suspension before and after filtration the bacteria rejection was calculated according to the following equation 2 r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the concentration of bacteria in the feed and permeation solution measured with plating count the bacterial adhesion and colonization on the membrane surface and the status of bacteria cells attached on the membrane were investigated after filtration phase the anti adhesion performance of the prepared membrane was evaluated by sem images firstly the membrane was washed with deionized water for several times to remove the loosely attached bacteria then the pristine membrane and modified membrane were immobilized with 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c for 6 h and dehydration with 30 50 70 90 and 100 v v ethanol 10 min each and then dried in room temperature finally samples were sprayed with au for sem observation 38 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization xrd spectra was used to analyze the crystal structure of the prepared agnw cnt sample firstly as presented in fig 2 the broad peak at 26 5 was the typical plane 002 of graphite crystal which came from cnts 42 the red line in fig 2 is the xrd spectrum of agnw cnt according to the jcpds cards no 04 0783 43 the remaining diffraction peaks at 2θ 38 22 43 52 65 34 78 38 and 71 13 which were correlated the 111 200 220 311 and 222 crystallographic planes of the face centered cubic phased silver indicating the presence of agnws in the prepared composite sample these results clearly certify that we have successfully prepared the agnw cnt composite material the structure and morphological features of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane was characterized through sem fig 3 the blending ratio of the agnw cnt is 0 1 fig 3a displayed the cross section morphology of the prepared membrane after agnw cnt deposition it can be found that a uniform agnw cnt layer was formed on the surface of the porous cc substrate with particle aggregation and its thickness was about 10 μm meanwhile the agnw cnt layer presented a cross linked net structure on the membrane surface without visible drawbacks of pin hole and cracks fig 3b the entangled structure was mainly attributed to the cnts while agnws was difficult to observe because the concentration is only 0 2 importantly the structure had the advantages of high porosity and large specific surface area with low resistance for water transport which was an ideal state for membrane preparation thus the results from sem analysis illustrated the successful preparation of agnw cnt cc composite membrane 3 2 antibacterial activity prior to investigate the resistance to biofouling during separation the antibacterial capability of agnw cnt cc composite membrane agnw cnt 0 1 1 was firstly studied against e coli by halo zone test and was compared with that of cnt cc membrane as presented in fig 4 a the area around cnt cc membrane was completely covered by e coli colonies suggesting its unsatisfied antibacterial ability in contrast the agnw cnt cc composite membrane exhibited a clear inhibition zone with an area of 96 5 mm2 fig 4b indicating that the presence of agnws endowed the final composite membrane with disinfection capability the excellent antibacterial ability was due to the released silver ions from agnws which spread to nearby areas to prevent the growth of bacterial colonies the silver ions could adhere to the microbial surface to change the membrane properties or penetrate inside the microbial cell furthermore the reaction of silver ions with sh groups in e coli proteins inhibited the activity of protein and dna replication 44 also several researchers verified that the bactericidal ability of the nanocomposite membranes mainly depends on its capability to release silver ions into the medium around 45 46 the above results indicated that the addition of agnws could significantly enhance its antibacterial activity of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane 3 3 filtration performance membrane filtration performance is closely related to water permeability solvent permeability and solute rejection selectivity 32 we first investigated the relationship between agnws dosage and membrane permeability since agnws played a dominant role in antibacterial activity therefore the filtration performance of agnw cnt cc composite membrane with different agnws dosage was evaluated and compared with the control membrane without agnws fig 5 for the cnt cc membrane without agnws the intercepted e coli accumulated on the membrane surface and caused a huge loss of flux within 1 h the permeate flux declined to 45 of its initial value indicating that the antibiofouling performance of cnt cc membrane was unsatisfactory for the agnw cnt cc composite membrane the flux loss was inhibited the membrane flux increased with increasing the agnws dosage in the membrane filtration processes when the ratio of agnws to cnts was 0 1 the membrane exhibited excellent antibiofouling capability with the steady permeate flux of 70 5 of its initial value when the ratio of agnws to cnts was higher than 0 1 agnws cnts 0 15 agnws cnts 0 2 the agnw cnt cc composite membrane presented similar steady state fluxes 71 4 of its initial value therefore considering the cost of agnws the selection agnw cnt ratio of this study is 0 1 the results showed that the antifouling performance of agnw cnt cc composite membrane was better than the cnt cc membrane such result was mainly attributed to the reactive oxygen species ros was generated during the ag generation which formed oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation to inactivate bacteria 47 48 besides agnws also released silver ions or direct contact to inactivate bacteria nevertheless it was also found that the flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane decreased slowly over time that was because some inactivated cells could not leave the membrane surface timely and the subsequent adhesion of dissociative bacteria would still lead to biofilm formation therefore we need a more effective method to reduce the biofouling to resist the decrease of agnw cnt cc composite membrane permeability in addition the pure water permeability was also shown in table 1 the permeability of the pure cc membrane was 640 892 l m2 h bar was similar with that of cnt cc membrane 637 455 l m2 h bar and the agnw cnt cc composite membrane 631 232 l m2 h bar indicating the surface coated cnts and agnw cnt has no resistance to membrane filtration this is because the nano diameter and one dimensional morphology of cnts allow the formation of an open network structure on the membrane surface which can reduce the impact on water flux 25 meanwhile the selectivity bacterial rejection of the pure cc membrane the cnt cc membrane and the agnw cnt cc composite membrane were studied in fig 6 for microfiltration membranes the membrane selectivity was primarily dictated by the pore size 49 the mean pore size of pure cc memebrane was 0 382 μm and the diameter of e coil was 0 5 3 0 μm thus in the pure cc membrane filtration system without the electrochemical assistance most bacteria were removed by sieving and the removal efficiency of e coli was 97 5 interestingly the removal efficiency of the pure cc membrane with the voltage to e coli also reached 100 suggesting that the electrochemical assistance could improve the bactericidal ability the reason is that the electroreduction of oxygen in electrochemical assistance can produce hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which can inactivate some biological cells 50 in addition under the same operate conditions there were no e coli in the permeate solution of the cnt cc membrane and agnw cnt cc composite membrane agnw cnt 0 1 1 on one hand as shown in table 1 the cnt cc membrane and agnw cnt cc composite membrane have similar mean pore sizes of 0 291 μm and 0 274 μm which was far smaller than the size of bacteria 0 5 3 0 μm therefore all the e coli could be rejected completely via the pore sieving mechanism on the other hand agnws were able to make the bacterial inactivation which adhered on the agnw cnt cc composite membrane meanwhile the cnt cc membrane and the agnw cnt cc composite membrane with the voltage still showed excellent removal efficiency 100 to e coli it is reported that the antibiofouling performance of membrane can be improved with electrochemical assistance 51 as the voltage was an important parameter for electrochemistry the antibiofouling performance of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane was systematically investigated under different voltages of 2 0 v 2 5 v 3 0 v and 3 5 v fig 7 a it could be found that the flux increased with increasing applied voltage during the experiment when the external voltage reached to 3 5 v the flux of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane maintained a steady value 100 during membrane filtration in addition micro bubbles could be macroscopically observed in the experiments at voltages of 3 0 v and 3 5 v which were caused by water splitting 2h2o 2h2 o2 actually micro bubbles from water splitting have been discussed in some reported works to prevent fouling formation and even achieve membrane regeneration 32 52 thus to better understand the anti biofouling mechanism in this work the open circuit potential was measured under the different voltages fig 7b combined with the flux changes under different voltages fig 7a it can be found that the cathodic potential on membrane was merely 0 37 v vs ag agcl and 0 60 v vs ag agcl at the applied voltage of 2 0 v and 2 5 v respectively the two values are lower than the hydrogen evolution potential her for water electrolysis e 0 61 v vs ag agcl ph 7 53 suggesting the improved antifouling ability was not attributed to the micro bubbles as the e coli is negatively charged ζ potential 9 66 0 58 mv bacteria migration can be suppressed toward to the cathodic membrane surface by electrostatic repulsion thereby mitigating both fouling formation and flux decline notably when the voltage reached to 3 0 v and 3 5 v the corresponding cathodic potentials on the membrane were 0 86 v vs ag agcl and 1 15 v vs ag agcl respectively both of which exceeded the value of e her vs ag agcl 0 61 v these results suggest that water electrolysis did occur at voltages of 3 0 v and 3 5 v consistent with the observed micro bubbles during the antifouling experiments considering that the flux significantly increased to 84 5 and 95 7 of its initial value at 3 0 v and 3 5 v external voltage respectively fig 7a the remarkable improvement in the antibiofouling performance not only was attributed to electrostatic repulsion but also arisen from the micro bubbles from water electrolysis in addition we also studied the antibiofouling performance of different membranes under a 3 5 v external voltage application fig 8 in order to confirm the electrochemical effect on biofouling resistance the flux loss was also studied on electrically aided cnt cc membrane handling e coli it also had a steady flux of 82 5 of its initial value with a 3 5 v external voltage while the permeate flux declined to 45 of its initial value without voltage the result presented that the resistance of biofouling also enhanced significantly with the electrochemical assistance which was consistent with previous research works 54 because the most bacteria were usually negatively charged table s1 electrostatic repulsion weakened the migration of the bacteria to the same charged membrane thereby avoiding bacterial adhering to the membrane surface in addition micro sized hydrogen bubbles produced by water electrolysis also could drive away foulants deposited on the membrane surface meanwhile the final flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane 70 5 of its initial value without an external voltage application was lower than that for the agnw cnt cc composite membrane 95 7 of its initial value under a 3 5 v external voltage demonstrating a remarkable improvement in the antibiofouling performance the results also showed that agnws had good anti fouling properties which by releasing the silver ions or direct contact to inactivate the bacteria on the membrane surface therefore it reduced the adhesion ability of bacteria and resulted in bacterial detachment from membrane surface especially under the electrostatic repulsion to further confirm the role of electrochemical assistance an intermittent external voltage application was adopted on the fouled membrane as shown in fig 9 the permeate flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane decreased sharply to 70 5 of its initial value after 1 h without an external voltage application however after applied an electric field of 3 5 v for 5 min to the fouled membrane the flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane was almost recovered to original value from 70 5 to 98 8 this result indicated electrochemical assistance could promote bacteria detachment from membrane surface more importantly such behavior repeated in three investigation cycle the possible reason was that the strong electrostatic repulsive force and micro sized hydrogen bubbles weakened the bacterial adhesion on the membrane surface making the biofouling layer fall away and achieve flux recovery 31 55 in addition ros might be produced in the electrochemical oxygen reduction process which could accelerate the separation of bacteria from the membrane surface in comparison the flux recovery of the cnt cc membrane failed to achieve under an external voltage application suggesting only electrochemical assistance could not completely promote bacterial detachment from membrane surface some alive bacteria cells adhered onto the cathodic membrane surface strongly that led to severe flux decline however the existence of agnws could release silver ions or direct contact to inactivate bacteria and promoted bacteria to separate from the membrane surface therefore the addition of agnws was benefit for electrochemical assistance furthermore sem was also carried out to observe the surface of the fouled membrane it is worth noting that the pure cc membrane after fouling was completely covered by e coli fig 10 a which was also the reason of serious flux loss of cc membrane for the fouled agnw cnt cc composite membrane the amount of adhered bacteria decreased obviously due to its superior antibacterial activity and these bacteria showed a distorted morphology which were easy to inhibit the adhesion of bacteria to the membrane fig 10b in addition it can be seen from fig 10c that bacterial adhesion was further inhibited to the fouled agnw cnt cc composite membrane surface under electrochemical assistance thereby the results confirmed that the membrane was combined with antibacterial modification and electrochemical assistance could greatly enhance its antibiofouling performance based on the aforementioned information the antibiofouling mechanism of electrochemically assisted agnw cnt cc composite membrane was represented in fig 11 during treating e coli feed water electrostatic repulsion inhibited the bacteria with negative charge migration to the cathode membrane in addition micro bubbles are generated by water electrolysis to separate foulants from the membrane surface although some alive bacteria adhered onto the membrane strongly due to the presence of hydraulic force they could be inactivated by releasing silver ions from agnws such disinfection behavior reduced the adhesion force of the inactivated bacteria and the surface of the membrane and then these inactivated bacteria left the membrane surface timely under the electrochemical assistance consequently the electrochemically assisted agnw cnt cc composite membrane had excellent antimicrobial ability and antibiofouling performance 4 conclusion in this work an electrochemically assisted agnw cnt cc composite membrane with excellent antimicrobial ability and antibiofouling performance was successfully fabricated the results showed that the addition of agnws could effectively inhibit biofilm formation via inactivating adsorbed bacteria compared to the cnt cc membrane the permeate flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane increased by 1 57 times meanwhile the agnw cnt cc composite membrane showed more excellent antibiofouling performance with electrochemical assistance demonstrating the electrostatic repulsive force could prevent dissociated bacteria adhesion onto membrane surface and promote detachment of inactivated bacteria in addition some micro bubbles are generated by water electrolysis also help separate bacteria from the membrane surface the results presented that the flux of the cathodic agnw cnt cc membrane was stable with acceptable flux loss under a low voltage of 3 5 v additionally the fouled agnw cnt cc composite membrane also had excellent regeneration by applying intermittent external voltages thus such integration of the antibacterial modification and electrochemical assistance provides a new idea for the development of the membrane with excellent antibacterial ability and antibiofouling performance in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

contact type antibiofouling modification the bacterial cells would be inactivated after bacterial attachment onto membrane surface due to the excellent antibacterial activity of the antibacterial modifier such as nano silver 22 24 the reason is that the reaction of silver ions with sh groups in bacteria cells inhibited the activity of protein and dna replication to inactivate bacteria 13 unfortunately if the inactivated cells do not leave from the membrane surface timely the subsequent adhesion of dissociative bacteria would cause biofilm formation in addition the inactivation behavior mainly occurs when bacteria contacting the membrane surface but does not actually suppress initial bacterial adhesion 20 25 it is generally considered that limiting the initial adhesion of bacteria is one of the important measures to prevent biofilm formation however the initial attachment of bacteria to the membrane surface is considered a reversible process by which bacterial cells can be separated from the membrane surface if sufficient counterforce is applied 26 28 to date introducing electrochemical assistance is considered as a nondestructive approach to suppress bacterial migration toward to membrane surface through electrostatic interaction and micro bubbles generated by water electrolysis 29 32 most bacteria were negatively charged because of the proteins and carbohydrate of cell surface the hydraulic force that typically drives bacteria to membrane would be weakened by the electrostatic repulsion between the same charged cathodic membrane and bacteria cells 33 35 in addition the process of water electrolysis also can generate some micro bubbles to separate the bacteria from the membrane surface 36 37 although electrostatic interaction and micro bubbles represents excellent resistance to biofouling some living bacteria can still adhere firmly to the cathode membrane and subsequently develop into biofilms 31 moreover the electrolytic reduction of oxygen would produce a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide which lacks sufficient disinfection capacity for the active cells adsorbed on the cathode membrane 38 therefore the combination of electrochemistry and antibacterial modification may offer a new idea to overcome the above difficulties in this work the integration of antibacterial modification with electrochemical assistance was designed to further improve the resistance to biofouling over a long period of operation time the contact type antibacterial modification would inactive the adhered bacteria and weaken the bonding force between the cells and membrane surface under the assistance of electrostatic repulsion and micro bubbles generated via water electrolysis the inactivated cells might leave from the membrane timely meanwhile the electrostatic repulsion would suppress the bacteria migration toward to same charged membrane surface thus decreasing the initial adhesion of waterborne pathogens to confirm this hypothesis an antibacterial silver nanowire carbon nanotube coal based carbon agnw cnt cc electroconductive composite membrane was prepared by the deposition of agnw cnt on a coal based carbon membrane surface via vacuum filtration method the silver nanowire acted as the antibacterial modifier due to their excellent antibacterial ability the coal based carbon membrane and cnts were chosen to prepare cathode membrane because of their good electroconductivity the anti biofouling performance was systematically studied and compared with bare membrane antibacterial membrane without electrochemistry and electrochemical membrane without antibacterial ability 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials multi walled cnts 9 10 wt and silver nanowires agnws suspension 20 mg ml diameter 40 nm length 20 60 μm were purchased from xfnano nanjing china phosphate buffered saline pbs was obtained from aladdin shanghai china escherichia coli e coli was obtained from transgen biotech beijing china the luria bertani lb medium used for e coli incubation were purchased from hangzhou baisi biotechnology co ltd all chemicals were analytical grade without further purification 2 2 preparation of agnw cnt cc membrane a tubular coal based carbon cc membrane with average pore size of 0 382 μm and was fabricated by our previous work 39 which was employed as the support for the agnw cnt composite separation layer firstly different blending ratios of cnts and agnws were uniformly dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonic bath agnw cnt 0 0 01 1 0 05 1 0 1 1 0 15 1 0 2 1 then the mixture of cnts and agnws was coated on the outer surface of cc membrane by vacuum filtration finally the membrane was annealed at 300 c in a nitrogen environment for 90 min to obtain the final agnw cnt cc composite membrane by contrast pure cc membrane and cnt cc membrane were also prepared but without agnw cnt and agnws 2 3 membranes characterization the crystal structure of the prepared membrane was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd d max 2400 japan the surface and cross section morphology of the fabricated membrane was observed by using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 the pore size was determined by capillary flow porometry porolux 1000 2 4 antibacterial activity the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes was evaluated through halo zone test 40 all glassware and materials were sterilized in autoclave prior in the experiment e coli the model gram negative bacteria was chosen as model bacteria because it can widely reproduce in water 25 the e coli was cultured in a sterilized lb broth firstly luria bertani lb nutrient broth 1000 ml containing 10 g tryptone 5 g yeast extract and 10 sodium chloride at ph 7 4 was sterilized in an autoclave by high temperature sterilization at 121 c for 15 min after that the e coli was inoculated into lb liquid medium under sterile environment and placed in a shaking incubator 130 rpm at 36 c for 24 h after three centrifugations and washes with pbs e coil were then resuspended in a sterile pbs solution to reach a concentration of about 104 cfu ml 100 μl of the e coli suspension was taken to smear evenly on the sterilized lb solid medium the membrane was subsequently placed on the lb solid medium and cultivation for 24 h at room temperature the inhibition zone formed around the membrane after 24 h which can work as an indicator to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the membrane and its area change was recorded by photos 2 5 performance evaluation of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane the permeability and selectivity bacterial rejection of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane was evaluated by a lab scale dead end membrane filtration system fig 1 presents the filtration system used in this study the agnw cnt cc composite membrane was served as cathode with an effect surface area of 15 cm2 and a ti plate worked as anode which were both connected to the dc power the distance between the two electrodes was 5 cm a peristaltic pump was used to conveyed feed solution to the membrane module the velocity of feed solution stood at 2 ml min through adjusting the peristaltic pump the permeate flux was measured according to the following equation 1 j v t a δ p where j is the flux l m2 h bar v is the permeate volume l a is the effective membrane surface area m2 t is the permeation time h and δp is the transmembrane pressure bar the filtration performance of the composite membrane was evaluated by intermittent and continuous power supply bacteria rejection efficiency as another examination index of membrane performance was determined by the concentration of bacteria suspension before and after filtration the bacteria rejection was calculated according to the following equation 2 r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the concentration of bacteria in the feed and permeation solution measured with plating count the bacterial adhesion and colonization on the membrane surface and the status of bacteria cells attached on the membrane were investigated after filtration phase the anti adhesion performance of the prepared membrane was evaluated by sem images firstly the membrane was washed with deionized water for several times to remove the loosely attached bacteria then the pristine membrane and modified membrane were immobilized with 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c for 6 h and dehydration with 30 50 70 90 and 100 v v ethanol 10 min each and then dried in room temperature finally samples were sprayed with au for sem observation 38 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization xrd spectra was used to analyze the crystal structure of the prepared agnw cnt sample firstly as presented in fig 2 the broad peak at 26 5 was the typical plane 002 of graphite crystal which came from cnts 42 the red line in fig 2 is the xrd spectrum of agnw cnt according to the jcpds cards no 04 0783 43 the remaining diffraction peaks at 2θ 38 22 43 52 65 34 78 38 and 71 13 which were correlated the 111 200 220 311 and 222 crystallographic planes of the face centered cubic phased silver indicating the presence of agnws in the prepared composite sample these results clearly certify that we have successfully prepared the agnw cnt composite material the structure and morphological features of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane was characterized through sem fig 3 the blending ratio of the agnw cnt is 0 1 fig 3a displayed the cross section morphology of the prepared membrane after agnw cnt deposition it can be found that a uniform agnw cnt layer was formed on the surface of the porous cc substrate with particle aggregation and its thickness was about 10 μm meanwhile the agnw cnt layer presented a cross linked net structure on the membrane surface without visible drawbacks of pin hole and cracks fig 3b the entangled structure was mainly attributed to the cnts while agnws was difficult to observe because the concentration is only 0 2 importantly the structure had the advantages of high porosity and large specific surface area with low resistance for water transport which was an ideal state for membrane preparation thus the results from sem analysis illustrated the successful preparation of agnw cnt cc composite membrane 3 2 antibacterial activity prior to investigate the resistance to biofouling during separation the antibacterial capability of agnw cnt cc composite membrane agnw cnt 0 1 1 was firstly studied against e coli by halo zone test and was compared with that of cnt cc membrane as presented in fig 4 a the area around cnt cc membrane was completely covered by e coli colonies suggesting its unsatisfied antibacterial ability in contrast the agnw cnt cc composite membrane exhibited a clear inhibition zone with an area of 96 5 mm2 fig 4b indicating that the presence of agnws endowed the final composite membrane with disinfection capability the excellent antibacterial ability was due to the released silver ions from agnws which spread to nearby areas to prevent the growth of bacterial colonies the silver ions could adhere to the microbial surface to change the membrane properties or penetrate inside the microbial cell furthermore the reaction of silver ions with sh groups in e coli proteins inhibited the activity of protein and dna replication 44 also several researchers verified that the bactericidal ability of the nanocomposite membranes mainly depends on its capability to release silver ions into the medium around 45 46 the above results indicated that the addition of agnws could significantly enhance its antibacterial activity of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane 3 3 filtration performance membrane filtration performance is closely related to water permeability solvent permeability and solute rejection selectivity 32 we first investigated the relationship between agnws dosage and membrane permeability since agnws played a dominant role in antibacterial activity therefore the filtration performance of agnw cnt cc composite membrane with different agnws dosage was evaluated and compared with the control membrane without agnws fig 5 for the cnt cc membrane without agnws the intercepted e coli accumulated on the membrane surface and caused a huge loss of flux within 1 h the permeate flux declined to 45 of its initial value indicating that the antibiofouling performance of cnt cc membrane was unsatisfactory for the agnw cnt cc composite membrane the flux loss was inhibited the membrane flux increased with increasing the agnws dosage in the membrane filtration processes when the ratio of agnws to cnts was 0 1 the membrane exhibited excellent antibiofouling capability with the steady permeate flux of 70 5 of its initial value when the ratio of agnws to cnts was higher than 0 1 agnws cnts 0 15 agnws cnts 0 2 the agnw cnt cc composite membrane presented similar steady state fluxes 71 4 of its initial value therefore considering the cost of agnws the selection agnw cnt ratio of this study is 0 1 the results showed that the antifouling performance of agnw cnt cc composite membrane was better than the cnt cc membrane such result was mainly attributed to the reactive oxygen species ros was generated during the ag generation which formed oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation to inactivate bacteria 47 48 besides agnws also released silver ions or direct contact to inactivate bacteria nevertheless it was also found that the flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane decreased slowly over time that was because some inactivated cells could not leave the membrane surface timely and the subsequent adhesion of dissociative bacteria would still lead to biofilm formation therefore we need a more effective method to reduce the biofouling to resist the decrease of agnw cnt cc composite membrane permeability in addition the pure water permeability was also shown in table 1 the permeability of the pure cc membrane was 640 892 l m2 h bar was similar with that of cnt cc membrane 637 455 l m2 h bar and the agnw cnt cc composite membrane 631 232 l m2 h bar indicating the surface coated cnts and agnw cnt has no resistance to membrane filtration this is because the nano diameter and one dimensional morphology of cnts allow the formation of an open network structure on the membrane surface which can reduce the impact on water flux 25 meanwhile the selectivity bacterial rejection of the pure cc membrane the cnt cc membrane and the agnw cnt cc composite membrane were studied in fig 6 for microfiltration membranes the membrane selectivity was primarily dictated by the pore size 49 the mean pore size of pure cc memebrane was 0 382 μm and the diameter of e coil was 0 5 3 0 μm thus in the pure cc membrane filtration system without the electrochemical assistance most bacteria were removed by sieving and the removal efficiency of e coli was 97 5 interestingly the removal efficiency of the pure cc membrane with the voltage to e coli also reached 100 suggesting that the electrochemical assistance could improve the bactericidal ability the reason is that the electroreduction of oxygen in electrochemical assistance can produce hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which can inactivate some biological cells 50 in addition under the same operate conditions there were no e coli in the permeate solution of the cnt cc membrane and agnw cnt cc composite membrane agnw cnt 0 1 1 on one hand as shown in table 1 the cnt cc membrane and agnw cnt cc composite membrane have similar mean pore sizes of 0 291 μm and 0 274 μm which was far smaller than the size of bacteria 0 5 3 0 μm therefore all the e coli could be rejected completely via the pore sieving mechanism on the other hand agnws were able to make the bacterial inactivation which adhered on the agnw cnt cc composite membrane meanwhile the cnt cc membrane and the agnw cnt cc composite membrane with the voltage still showed excellent removal efficiency 100 to e coli it is reported that the antibiofouling performance of membrane can be improved with electrochemical assistance 51 as the voltage was an important parameter for electrochemistry the antibiofouling performance of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane was systematically investigated under different voltages of 2 0 v 2 5 v 3 0 v and 3 5 v fig 7 a it could be found that the flux increased with increasing applied voltage during the experiment when the external voltage reached to 3 5 v the flux of the agnw cnt cc composite membrane maintained a steady value 100 during membrane filtration in addition micro bubbles could be macroscopically observed in the experiments at voltages of 3 0 v and 3 5 v which were caused by water splitting 2h2o 2h2 o2 actually micro bubbles from water splitting have been discussed in some reported works to prevent fouling formation and even achieve membrane regeneration 32 52 thus to better understand the anti biofouling mechanism in this work the open circuit potential was measured under the different voltages fig 7b combined with the flux changes under different voltages fig 7a it can be found that the cathodic potential on membrane was merely 0 37 v vs ag agcl and 0 60 v vs ag agcl at the applied voltage of 2 0 v and 2 5 v respectively the two values are lower than the hydrogen evolution potential her for water electrolysis e 0 61 v vs ag agcl ph 7 53 suggesting the improved antifouling ability was not attributed to the micro bubbles as the e coli is negatively charged ζ potential 9 66 0 58 mv bacteria migration can be suppressed toward to the cathodic membrane surface by electrostatic repulsion thereby mitigating both fouling formation and flux decline notably when the voltage reached to 3 0 v and 3 5 v the corresponding cathodic potentials on the membrane were 0 86 v vs ag agcl and 1 15 v vs ag agcl respectively both of which exceeded the value of e her vs ag agcl 0 61 v these results suggest that water electrolysis did occur at voltages of 3 0 v and 3 5 v consistent with the observed micro bubbles during the antifouling experiments considering that the flux significantly increased to 84 5 and 95 7 of its initial value at 3 0 v and 3 5 v external voltage respectively fig 7a the remarkable improvement in the antibiofouling performance not only was attributed to electrostatic repulsion but also arisen from the micro bubbles from water electrolysis in addition we also studied the antibiofouling performance of different membranes under a 3 5 v external voltage application fig 8 in order to confirm the electrochemical effect on biofouling resistance the flux loss was also studied on electrically aided cnt cc membrane handling e coli it also had a steady flux of 82 5 of its initial value with a 3 5 v external voltage while the permeate flux declined to 45 of its initial value without voltage the result presented that the resistance of biofouling also enhanced significantly with the electrochemical assistance which was consistent with previous research works 54 because the most bacteria were usually negatively charged table s1 electrostatic repulsion weakened the migration of the bacteria to the same charged membrane thereby avoiding bacterial adhering to the membrane surface in addition micro sized hydrogen bubbles produced by water electrolysis also could drive away foulants deposited on the membrane surface meanwhile the final flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane 70 5 of its initial value without an external voltage application was lower than that for the agnw cnt cc composite membrane 95 7 of its initial value under a 3 5 v external voltage demonstrating a remarkable improvement in the antibiofouling performance the results also showed that agnws had good anti fouling properties which by releasing the silver ions or direct contact to inactivate the bacteria on the membrane surface therefore it reduced the adhesion ability of bacteria and resulted in bacterial detachment from membrane surface especially under the electrostatic repulsion to further confirm the role of electrochemical assistance an intermittent external voltage application was adopted on the fouled membrane as shown in fig 9 the permeate flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane decreased sharply to 70 5 of its initial value after 1 h without an external voltage application however after applied an electric field of 3 5 v for 5 min to the fouled membrane the flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane was almost recovered to original value from 70 5 to 98 8 this result indicated electrochemical assistance could promote bacteria detachment from membrane surface more importantly such behavior repeated in three investigation cycle the possible reason was that the strong electrostatic repulsive force and micro sized hydrogen bubbles weakened the bacterial adhesion on the membrane surface making the biofouling layer fall away and achieve flux recovery 31 55 in addition ros might be produced in the electrochemical oxygen reduction process which could accelerate the separation of bacteria from the membrane surface in comparison the flux recovery of the cnt cc membrane failed to achieve under an external voltage application suggesting only electrochemical assistance could not completely promote bacterial detachment from membrane surface some alive bacteria cells adhered onto the cathodic membrane surface strongly that led to severe flux decline however the existence of agnws could release silver ions or direct contact to inactivate bacteria and promoted bacteria to separate from the membrane surface therefore the addition of agnws was benefit for electrochemical assistance furthermore sem was also carried out to observe the surface of the fouled membrane it is worth noting that the pure cc membrane after fouling was completely covered by e coli fig 10 a which was also the reason of serious flux loss of cc membrane for the fouled agnw cnt cc composite membrane the amount of adhered bacteria decreased obviously due to its superior antibacterial activity and these bacteria showed a distorted morphology which were easy to inhibit the adhesion of bacteria to the membrane fig 10b in addition it can be seen from fig 10c that bacterial adhesion was further inhibited to the fouled agnw cnt cc composite membrane surface under electrochemical assistance thereby the results confirmed that the membrane was combined with antibacterial modification and electrochemical assistance could greatly enhance its antibiofouling performance based on the aforementioned information the antibiofouling mechanism of electrochemically assisted agnw cnt cc composite membrane was represented in fig 11 during treating e coli feed water electrostatic repulsion inhibited the bacteria with negative charge migration to the cathode membrane in addition micro bubbles are generated by water electrolysis to separate foulants from the membrane surface although some alive bacteria adhered onto the membrane strongly due to the presence of hydraulic force they could be inactivated by releasing silver ions from agnws such disinfection behavior reduced the adhesion force of the inactivated bacteria and the surface of the membrane and then these inactivated bacteria left the membrane surface timely under the electrochemical assistance consequently the electrochemically assisted agnw cnt cc composite membrane had excellent antimicrobial ability and antibiofouling performance 4 conclusion in this work an electrochemically assisted agnw cnt cc composite membrane with excellent antimicrobial ability and antibiofouling performance was successfully fabricated the results showed that the addition of agnws could effectively inhibit biofilm formation via inactivating adsorbed bacteria compared to the cnt cc membrane the permeate flux of agnw cnt cc composite membrane increased by 1 57 times meanwhile the agnw cnt cc composite membrane showed more excellent antibiofouling performance with electrochemical assistance demonstrating the electrostatic repulsive force could prevent dissociated bacteria adhesion onto membrane surface and promote detachment of inactivated bacteria in addition some micro bubbles are generated by water electrolysis also help separate bacteria from the membrane surface the results presented that the flux of the cathodic agnw cnt cc membrane was stable with acceptable flux loss under a low voltage of 3 5 v additionally the fouled agnw cnt cc composite membrane also had excellent regeneration by applying intermittent external voltages thus such integration of the antibacterial modification and electrochemical assistance provides a new idea for the development of the membrane with excellent antibacterial ability and antibiofouling performance in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13833,high concentration of iron and manganese is still one of the common problems in groundwater in this work an integrated aeration manganese sand filter ultrafiltration amu process was proposed to investigate the form of iron and manganese oxides and its autocatalytic effect in removing iron and manganese the pourbaix diagram was used to characterize the degree of iron and manganese oxidation the dependence of redox potential and atomic composition on manganese sand was then studied the results showed that the proposed amu process could not only remove 100 ferrous and 90 manganese ions due to the increased redox potential by 2 mv after manganese sand filter but also reduce the membrane fouling due to the retention effect of manganese sand coated films formed on the surface of manganese sand the upper layer of manganese sand coated film contained 21 86 wt fe whereas the lower layer contained 19 31 wt mn compared with that of 13 77 wt fe and 4 87 wt mn for the virgin one respectively the needle crystals fe2o3 and unshaped crystals mnox found on both the manganese sand coated films and membrane foulants indicated the anti fouling effect of ultrafiltration membrane through the complete oxidation of iron and manganese the proposed amu process allowed the simultaneous oxidation and the following membrane fouling mitigation of the whole process for iron and manganese removal from groundwater keywords iron and manganese removal manganese sand coated film redox potential membrane fouling 1 introduction groundwater is one of the important sources of drinking water globally and iron and manganese commonly existed in untreated groundwater 1 can cause aesthetic and operation problems bad taste and color as well as healthy damage in water supplies 2 to remove iron and manganese from groundwater in public water supply systems several treatment methods including physical chemical physicochemical and biological processes have been studied 3 6 since mn2 is harder to be oxidized than fe2 owing to the higher redox potential of manganese the efficient removal of fe and mn from groundwater is still a challenge in this field in the traditional process fe and mn in groundwater were initially oxidized using aeration and or chemical oxidant such as chlorine hypochlorite chlorine dioxide ozone or potassium permanganate and were then removed by filtration 7 in recent years by contrast the membrane processes combined with the preoxidation have been increasingly studied to comply with the more stringent water quality standards with the existing equipment for example uf in conjunction with pre chlorination 8 9 a ceramic and a polymeric uf membrane process with in line pre oxidation 10 11 a microfiltration mf combined with aeration and naocl oxidation 12 13 and even the ultra thin nanocomposite membrane 14 have been reported and the efficiency of membrane filtration is found higher than the traditional greensand the peroxidation has gained extensive attention because it can significantly alter compositions and properties of feed water through chemical reactions 15 among all those preoxidation methods the manganese sand filter has been the mostly adopted to effectively oxide mn2 through autocatalytic effect due to the generated manganese sand coated film on the surface of manganese sand 1 3 16 18 the removal of iron and manganese in conventional aeration filtration groundwater treatment plants resulted in the formation of an iron oxide activated coating and manganese oxide activated coating which is an essential prerequisite for efficient iron and manganese removal by physicochemical auto catalytic processes 1 12 19 20 the newly formed iron active coated film on the surface of the filter material has been characterized to be an amorphous structure composed of globular ferric hydroxide molecules and the chemical composition of this active coated film is feooh after dehydration and aging 21 however to our best knowledge the chemical auto catalytic oxidation mechanism involved in active manganese oxides film are not fully understood and still little direct evidence can be found on the existing of manganese sand coated film for this autocatalytic effect on the other hand the effect of oxidized iron and manganese on the membrane fouling has also been inconsistent for example the oxidized manganese was observed to cause serious membrane fouling during crossflow and dead end uf 8 and the manganese dioxide aggregate was prone to severely foul uf membranes under soft water condition while ferric hydroxide aggregate only caused minimal fouling resistance to the membrane 10 by contrast choo et al 8 also found that the existence of manganese sand coated film may reduce the probability of membrane pore blockage for its bigger particle size than iron and manganese oxides and the accumulation of metal oxide particles on the membrane surface may not bring about severe fouling but rather can improve permeability the fe and mn ions in water were successfully oxidized by chemical reagents to form metal oxides which initially accumulated on the membrane surface and finally induced only 10 pressure loss in the filtration process 12 to the best of our knowledge no work has been reported to fully characterize the oxidation of fe and mn during the process of iron and manganese removal from groundwater in this work the removal of iron and manganese from groundwater was carried out by a proposed process of aeration manganese sand filter uf amu this proposed process is used to combine the fully oxidation of iron and manganese by the traditional aeration and manganese sand filter with the complete turbidity removal by the following membrane filtration and thus the possible reduced membrane fouling the diagram of redox potential as a function of ph was used to show the stability zones of iron containing compounds and manganese containing compounds in aqueous solution the ph redox potential and the turbidity of effluents at different stages of the process were monitored continuously for 14 days the degree of oxidation the autocatalytic effect of manganese sand filter and the reduced membrane fouling as well as their atomic composition were then systematically characterized the oxidation effect and the fouling behavior of manganese oxides were finally discussed for the integrated process 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated water the simulated groundwater used in this study was prepared by dissolving the solid ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and manganese sulphate tetrahydrate mnso4 4h2o in deionized water the key water quality characteristics were given in table 1 and the natural organic matter was not considered in this work according to the water factory in jiangxi province china 2 2 uf membrane the ultrafiltration hollow fiber membrane module used in this study was a kind of polyvinyl chloride pvc alloy ultrafiltration membrane supplied from litree lh3 5ad shenzhen lisheng clean water technology co ltd each module contained 168 fibers with an effective surface area of 0 2 m2 a single fiber was 0 3 m long and 1 0 mm of the inner diameter and the average membrane pore size was 0 01 μm the dead end was used as the operation mode 2 3 experimental device fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of aeration manganese sand filter uf amu process used in this study the whole experimental device was consisted of four parts including an inlet tank synthetic raw water an air pump aeration process a manganese sand filter column and a uf membrane module the aeration volume rate of air pump was 1 l min the downflow filtration method was adopted in the manganese sand filter the parameters of manganese sand filter were shown in table 2 the hydraulic backwash of manganese sand filter and back flush of membrane module was performed every 12 h in order to avoid the possible agglomeration 2 4 analytical methods four kinds of water sample were taken at an interval of 12 h the synthetic water the effluent after aeration process point a in fig 1 the effluent after manganese sand filter process point b in fig 1 and the effluent after membrane module process point c in fig 1 all samples were kept at room temperature and all chemicals solvents and reagents used were analytical grade with high purity in order to investigate the removal efficiency of iron and manganese phenanthroline spectrophotometry and potassium periodate spectrophotometric were used to determinate the concentration of fe2 and mn2 of effluents after every stage by visible spectrophotometer hach dr3900 respectively to investigate the composition of oxides and further determine the influence of membrane fouling the e ph pourbaix diagram was obtained by portable orp meter hengxin az8651 taiwan and portable ph meter fg2 mettler toledo to characterize the role of ultrafiltration the turbidity of effluents were analyzed by portable turbidimeter hach 2100q all the water quality test had been repeated for three times and the average value was used for further analysis to investigate the oxidation and retention effects of manganese sand the virgin manganese sand the upper and lower layer of manganese sand at the end of the experiment were collected to observe the top surface and cross sectional morphology by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem su8010 hitachi japan and the instrument coupled with energy dispersive x radiation edx analysis system was used to identify their components in order to investigate the degree of membrane fouling the membrane foulants collected from backflush water and naturally air dried were further visualized with fesem the composition of manganese sand coated film and membrane foulants were further characterized by x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance diffractometer cu ka1 radiation 0 154059 nm and mdi jade the manganese sand was firstly collected to stack in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask sonicated for 15 s and then suspended for 15 s the pretreatment was repeated four times before the turbid liquid was obtained the sample was then dried in a constant temperature oven 60 c and was finally ground by the 100 mesh screen into a powdery manganese sand coated film as for membrane foulants the samples were dried at room temperature and pulverized into the size of 10 50 μm 3 results and discussion 3 1 iron and manganese removal efficiency to evaluate the iron and manganese removal efficiency of the proposed amu process a continuous operation test with synthetic water containing 3 0 mg l fe2 and 1 0 mg l mn2 were conducted as shown in fig 2 the removal efficiency of fe2 achieved 75 85 in aeration process while it achieved 100 after manganese sand filter fig 2a the manganese removal efficiency was however not as quickly as that for iron at aeration process only 30 in aeration process but about 90 after manganese sand filter fig 2b it shows the oxidation of iron mainly occurs over aeration process whereas the oxidation of manganese mainly occurs over manganese sand filter this result was found consistent with the work that the aeration and chlorine oxidation was used for iron removal and the particles accumulated on membrane enhanced removal of iron and manganese through autocatalytic activity in the accumulated layer on membrane 12 meanwhile in order to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of oxidation and retention of the amu process the turbidity of effluent at different stages was tested the turbidity of effluent after manganese sand filter suffered an intense fluctuation at its backwash of day 7 and was eventually reduced to below 5 ntu fig 2c notably the turbidity of effluent after hollow fiber membrane module was almost 0 ntu indicating the high separation efficiency of iron and manganese oxides by the membrane module it was found consistent with the work of cui that a sharp transmembrane pressure buildup occurred in uf system when no iron oxide pretreatment was applied regardless of the types of membranes tested 22 moreover the mn sand not only removed over 95 of mn2 but also decreased the membrane fouling and prolonged the operational life of the membrane 23 when the backwash was carried out a kind of brown turbid and easily precipitated solution was observed to flush out and the manganese sand in filter column became clean gradually and returned to its original color finally 3 2 redox potential of effluent for the aqueous solution the graph of ph against electrochemical potential as referred to the standard hydrogen electrode eh i e e ph pourbaix diagram has been commonly used to investigate the chemistry of inorganic substances it can provide an important graphical link between the thermodynamic calculations of potential ph equilibrium constant concentration and changes in gibbs energy and experimentally observed behavior of species in aqueous solutions 24 since fig 2 has shown the significant role of manganese sand filter for the oxidation of both iron and manganese the pourbaix diagram was then presented to know more about the composition of oxides and further the influence of membrane fouling as shown in fig 3 the ph of all water samples was ranged from 6 3 7 and there was an overall upward trend as time continued fig 3a the redox potential of the effluent increased a little at 0 24 v after the aeration process indicating that the oxidation of iron depended highly on ph and the increase of water ph together with the dissolved oxygen allowed the 70 oxidation of iron as shown in fig 2 a by contrast it increased significantly to 0 43 v after the manganese sand filter and membrane module indicating the water was remarkably oxidized at the stage of manganese sand filter fig 3b the e ph of four water samples on pourbaix diagram for iron and manganese was then shown in fig 4 it displayed the difference between water soluble fe2 compounds and generally water insoluble fe3 compounds and the difference between water soluble mn2 compounds and generally water insoluble mn3 and mn4 compounds under different conditions as shown in fig 4 the water effluents were remarkably oxidized after the manganese sand filter and the redox potential of effluents remained almost the same level with the slight increase of ph as shown in fig 5 the calculated average value of effluent after manganese sand filter and membrane module were similar in pourbaix diagram for iron and manganese as the increase of ph and redox potential the species of the soluble divalent ferrous ii and manganese ii ions were transformed into insoluble ferric iii and manganic iv ions the predominance region forms of which were fe2o3 h2o and mn2o3 respectively it indicated that ferrous ions and manganous ions can be completely oxidized into predominates in normal conditions and then be rejected by filter in this work the mn2 removal in this work was found consistent with the work that the presence of the ferric hydroxide which occurred by oxidation of fe2 helped to mitigate fouling and enhanced the rejection of mn2 by up to by 90 by developing a secondary filtration layer on membrane surface which had been considered as a challenge in drinking water treatment plants 25 3 3 characterization of manganese sand since the significant increase of redox potential was found at the manganese sand filter stage the upper part of manganese sand ums and lower part of manganese sand lms in manganese sand filter were extracted for comparison with the virgin manganese sand vms as shown in fig 6 it was clearly that a certain thickness of coatings were generated upon the surface of manganese sand which was called manganese sand coated film in this work compared to the relatively homogeneous and loose porous structure on vms surface fig 6a more needle crystals and heterogeneous pores were clearly seen on the surface of ums fig 6b and a more dense structure with large amount of unshaped particulates inclusion were found in the sheet on the surface of lms fig 6c in the cross section views vms showed uniform texture with smooth border fig 6d obviously there were certain thickness of coatings about 100 μm and 50 μm respectively generated on the surface of ums and lms therefore the manganese sand coatings were produced during the process of fe ii and mn ii removal when groundwater flowed through the manganese sand filter in order to study the variety of elements feature of ums coated film and lms coated film the edx analysis was further conducted to obtain the weight proportion corresponding to atomic proportion of c o si k fe mn as shown in fig 6 the fe and mn were 21 86 wt 0 23 wt for the upper part of manganese sand ums as shown in fig 6h and 13 97 wt 19 31 wt for the lower part of manganese sand lms as shown in fig 6i compared with that were 13 77 wt 4 87 wt for the virgin manganese sand as shown in fig 6g it demonstrated that ums was almost the iron coated film containing high percentage of fe whereas the lms was of significantly higher percentage of mn showing clearly that the manganese coated film was formed the existing of iron oxide activated coating and manganese oxide activated coating was observed directly in this work as shown in fig 6e and fig 6f respectively which was consistent with those deduced in literatures 1 12 19 20 to verify that the upper and lower layer of manganese sand coated thin films are different from their composition the edx for the cross section of ums and lms with face scan and line scan was then characterized as shown in fig 7 the edx analysis spots of ums and lms were selected from the red frame marked on fig 6e and fig 6f respectively it was clearly shown the great difference of content distribution of iron and manganese between manganese sand itself and manganese sand coatings over the two sides of the red dotted line shown in face scan fig 7a 1 a 2 a 3 for ums and fig 7b 1 b 2 b 3 for lms the line of which was drawn at fig 7a 1 and fig 7b 1 as schematic line alongside the boundaries between manganese sand itself and manganese sand coatings of ums and lms respectively it depicted that in the cross section of ums the iron content of coating part below the red dotted line was higher than manganese sand itself part above the red dotted line whereas the manganese content of coating was far less than manganese sand itself by contrast lms showed the significantly higher manganese content to get more accurate evaluation of the content variety of iron and manganese over the boundaries of manganese sand and their coatings the line scan was applied to obtain semi quantitative data of iron and manganese intensity signal which was drawn as a curve graph fig 7a 4 a 5 a 6 for ums and fig 7b 4 b 5 b 6 for lms the line scan was consistent with the face scan mentioned above in terms of iron and manganese content more importantly with the gradual growth of manganese sand coatings the traces of iron and manganese oxidation were found in the form of fluctuations in curve as for ums large amounts of iron containing substances were found at early period followed by a relatively smooth process fig 7a 5 it was inferred that ums had experienced a stage of rapid oxidation to remove iron followed by a stage of stable oxidation meanwhile ums did not indicate the stage of removing manganese according to fig 7a 6 as shown in lms it went through a transition from an iron oxidation dominant period to the manganese oxidation dominant period reflecting the trend of decrease first and then the increase in the manganese intensity signal curve fig 7b 6 and vice versa for the iron intensity signal curve fig 7b 5 the evolution of iron and manganese content across the thickness of coatings indicated directly again the formation of an iron oxide activated coating and manganese oxide activated coating and their auto catalytic effect of the manganese sand coated film 3 4 characterization of membrane foulants to explore the contamination of membrane during the removal of fe2 and mn2 in this work fesem images and xrd spectra were further obtained as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively clearly a thick and dense structure of cake layer fig 8a was scoured from the hollow fiber membrane module by hydraulic backwash the needle crystal and unshaped fine particles were found in the portion morphology of membrane foulants fig 8b indicating a large amount of ferric oxide and manganic oxide were rejected by the membrane module as shown in fig 9 the comparison of xrd spectrum of the membrane foulants the ums coated film the lms coated film and vms verified their same composition of the fe mn oxides the sharp peaks 26 6 2θ 20 9 2θ and 50 1 2θ for quartz sio2 33 2 2θ 54 1 2θ and 49 5 2θ for hematite fe2o3 and the additional weak peaks 56 2θ 37 2θ and 66 8 2θ for akhtenskite mno2 were all found for those samples the well crystalline fe2o3 and amorphous crystals of mnox were clearly found in both fig 6b and fig 8b indicating again that the adoption of ultrafiltration membrane can not only effectively reject the turbidity of the effluents fig 2c but also reduce the membrane fouling due to the retention of iron and manganese oxides during the process of iron and manganese removal from groundwater 4 conclusions in summary the process of aeration manganese sand filter ultrafiltration amu was proposed for removal of iron and manganese from groundwater and reduction of membrane fouling and the findings are listed as following 1 the amu process produced an effective ferrous ions and manganous ions removal from the groundwater the removal efficiency of fe2 and mg2 achieved 100 and 90 after manganese sand filter respectively the oxidation of iron mainly occurs over aeration process whereas the oxidation of manganese mainly occurs over manganese sand filter 2 a significant increase of redox potential about 2 mv had been observed for water samples after manganese sand filter showing a remarkable promotion of oxidizing capacity and species change of iron and manganese in manganese sand filter 3 the generation of manganese sand coated film and needle crystals were found on the manganese sand filter further showing their fully oxidation and the retention of those pre oxides 4 the well crystalline fe2o3 and amorphous crystals mnox were further found in both the membrane foulants and manganese coated film verified again the reduction of membrane fouling in the proposed amu process our study shows not only the effective removal of iron and manganese ions from the groundwater for the integrated process of amu but also the direct evidence for existence of manganese sand coated films that allow the increase of redox potential of water and the following reduction of membrane fouling due to the formation and retention of iron and manganese oxides thus to propel the engineering

13833,high concentration of iron and manganese is still one of the common problems in groundwater in this work an integrated aeration manganese sand filter ultrafiltration amu process was proposed to investigate the form of iron and manganese oxides and its autocatalytic effect in removing iron and manganese the pourbaix diagram was used to characterize the degree of iron and manganese oxidation the dependence of redox potential and atomic composition on manganese sand was then studied the results showed that the proposed amu process could not only remove 100 ferrous and 90 manganese ions due to the increased redox potential by 2 mv after manganese sand filter but also reduce the membrane fouling due to the retention effect of manganese sand coated films formed on the surface of manganese sand the upper layer of manganese sand coated film contained 21 86 wt fe whereas the lower layer contained 19 31 wt mn compared with that of 13 77 wt fe and 4 87 wt mn for the virgin one respectively the needle crystals fe2o3 and unshaped crystals mnox found on both the manganese sand coated films and membrane foulants indicated the anti fouling effect of ultrafiltration membrane through the complete oxidation of iron and manganese the proposed amu process allowed the simultaneous oxidation and the following membrane fouling mitigation of the whole process for iron and manganese removal from groundwater keywords iron and manganese removal manganese sand coated film redox potential membrane fouling 1 introduction groundwater is one of the important sources of drinking water globally and iron and manganese commonly existed in untreated groundwater 1 can cause aesthetic and operation problems bad taste and color as well as healthy damage in water supplies 2 to remove iron and manganese from groundwater in public water supply systems several treatment methods including physical chemical physicochemical and biological processes have been studied 3 6 since mn2 is harder to be oxidized than fe2 owing to the higher redox potential of manganese the efficient removal of fe and mn from groundwater is still a challenge in this field in the traditional process fe and mn in groundwater were initially oxidized using aeration and or chemical oxidant such as chlorine hypochlorite chlorine dioxide ozone or potassium permanganate and were then removed by filtration 7 in recent years by contrast the membrane processes combined with the preoxidation have been increasingly studied to comply with the more stringent water quality standards with the existing equipment for example uf in conjunction with pre chlorination 8 9 a ceramic and a polymeric uf membrane process with in line pre oxidation 10 11 a microfiltration mf combined with aeration and naocl oxidation 12 13 and even the ultra thin nanocomposite membrane 14 have been reported and the efficiency of membrane filtration is found higher than the traditional greensand the peroxidation has gained extensive attention because it can significantly alter compositions and properties of feed water through chemical reactions 15 among all those preoxidation methods the manganese sand filter has been the mostly adopted to effectively oxide mn2 through autocatalytic effect due to the generated manganese sand coated film on the surface of manganese sand 1 3 16 18 the removal of iron and manganese in conventional aeration filtration groundwater treatment plants resulted in the formation of an iron oxide activated coating and manganese oxide activated coating which is an essential prerequisite for efficient iron and manganese removal by physicochemical auto catalytic processes 1 12 19 20 the newly formed iron active coated film on the surface of the filter material has been characterized to be an amorphous structure composed of globular ferric hydroxide molecules and the chemical composition of this active coated film is feooh after dehydration and aging 21 however to our best knowledge the chemical auto catalytic oxidation mechanism involved in active manganese oxides film are not fully understood and still little direct evidence can be found on the existing of manganese sand coated film for this autocatalytic effect on the other hand the effect of oxidized iron and manganese on the membrane fouling has also been inconsistent for example the oxidized manganese was observed to cause serious membrane fouling during crossflow and dead end uf 8 and the manganese dioxide aggregate was prone to severely foul uf membranes under soft water condition while ferric hydroxide aggregate only caused minimal fouling resistance to the membrane 10 by contrast choo et al 8 also found that the existence of manganese sand coated film may reduce the probability of membrane pore blockage for its bigger particle size than iron and manganese oxides and the accumulation of metal oxide particles on the membrane surface may not bring about severe fouling but rather can improve permeability the fe and mn ions in water were successfully oxidized by chemical reagents to form metal oxides which initially accumulated on the membrane surface and finally induced only 10 pressure loss in the filtration process 12 to the best of our knowledge no work has been reported to fully characterize the oxidation of fe and mn during the process of iron and manganese removal from groundwater in this work the removal of iron and manganese from groundwater was carried out by a proposed process of aeration manganese sand filter uf amu this proposed process is used to combine the fully oxidation of iron and manganese by the traditional aeration and manganese sand filter with the complete turbidity removal by the following membrane filtration and thus the possible reduced membrane fouling the diagram of redox potential as a function of ph was used to show the stability zones of iron containing compounds and manganese containing compounds in aqueous solution the ph redox potential and the turbidity of effluents at different stages of the process were monitored continuously for 14 days the degree of oxidation the autocatalytic effect of manganese sand filter and the reduced membrane fouling as well as their atomic composition were then systematically characterized the oxidation effect and the fouling behavior of manganese oxides were finally discussed for the integrated process 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated water the simulated groundwater used in this study was prepared by dissolving the solid ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and manganese sulphate tetrahydrate mnso4 4h2o in deionized water the key water quality characteristics were given in table 1 and the natural organic matter was not considered in this work according to the water factory in jiangxi province china 2 2 uf membrane the ultrafiltration hollow fiber membrane module used in this study was a kind of polyvinyl chloride pvc alloy ultrafiltration membrane supplied from litree lh3 5ad shenzhen lisheng clean water technology co ltd each module contained 168 fibers with an effective surface area of 0 2 m2 a single fiber was 0 3 m long and 1 0 mm of the inner diameter and the average membrane pore size was 0 01 μm the dead end was used as the operation mode 2 3 experimental device fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of aeration manganese sand filter uf amu process used in this study the whole experimental device was consisted of four parts including an inlet tank synthetic raw water an air pump aeration process a manganese sand filter column and a uf membrane module the aeration volume rate of air pump was 1 l min the downflow filtration method was adopted in the manganese sand filter the parameters of manganese sand filter were shown in table 2 the hydraulic backwash of manganese sand filter and back flush of membrane module was performed every 12 h in order to avoid the possible agglomeration 2 4 analytical methods four kinds of water sample were taken at an interval of 12 h the synthetic water the effluent after aeration process point a in fig 1 the effluent after manganese sand filter process point b in fig 1 and the effluent after membrane module process point c in fig 1 all samples were kept at room temperature and all chemicals solvents and reagents used were analytical grade with high purity in order to investigate the removal efficiency of iron and manganese phenanthroline spectrophotometry and potassium periodate spectrophotometric were used to determinate the concentration of fe2 and mn2 of effluents after every stage by visible spectrophotometer hach dr3900 respectively to investigate the composition of oxides and further determine the influence of membrane fouling the e ph pourbaix diagram was obtained by portable orp meter hengxin az8651 taiwan and portable ph meter fg2 mettler toledo to characterize the role of ultrafiltration the turbidity of effluents were analyzed by portable turbidimeter hach 2100q all the water quality test had been repeated for three times and the average value was used for further analysis to investigate the oxidation and retention effects of manganese sand the virgin manganese sand the upper and lower layer of manganese sand at the end of the experiment were collected to observe the top surface and cross sectional morphology by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem su8010 hitachi japan and the instrument coupled with energy dispersive x radiation edx analysis system was used to identify their components in order to investigate the degree of membrane fouling the membrane foulants collected from backflush water and naturally air dried were further visualized with fesem the composition of manganese sand coated film and membrane foulants were further characterized by x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance diffractometer cu ka1 radiation 0 154059 nm and mdi jade the manganese sand was firstly collected to stack in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask sonicated for 15 s and then suspended for 15 s the pretreatment was repeated four times before the turbid liquid was obtained the sample was then dried in a constant temperature oven 60 c and was finally ground by the 100 mesh screen into a powdery manganese sand coated film as for membrane foulants the samples were dried at room temperature and pulverized into the size of 10 50 μm 3 results and discussion 3 1 iron and manganese removal efficiency to evaluate the iron and manganese removal efficiency of the proposed amu process a continuous operation test with synthetic water containing 3 0 mg l fe2 and 1 0 mg l mn2 were conducted as shown in fig 2 the removal efficiency of fe2 achieved 75 85 in aeration process while it achieved 100 after manganese sand filter fig 2a the manganese removal efficiency was however not as quickly as that for iron at aeration process only 30 in aeration process but about 90 after manganese sand filter fig 2b it shows the oxidation of iron mainly occurs over aeration process whereas the oxidation of manganese mainly occurs over manganese sand filter this result was found consistent with the work that the aeration and chlorine oxidation was used for iron removal and the particles accumulated on membrane enhanced removal of iron and manganese through autocatalytic activity in the accumulated layer on membrane 12 meanwhile in order to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of oxidation and retention of the amu process the turbidity of effluent at different stages was tested the turbidity of effluent after manganese sand filter suffered an intense fluctuation at its backwash of day 7 and was eventually reduced to below 5 ntu fig 2c notably the turbidity of effluent after hollow fiber membrane module was almost 0 ntu indicating the high separation efficiency of iron and manganese oxides by the membrane module it was found consistent with the work of cui that a sharp transmembrane pressure buildup occurred in uf system when no iron oxide pretreatment was applied regardless of the types of membranes tested 22 moreover the mn sand not only removed over 95 of mn2 but also decreased the membrane fouling and prolonged the operational life of the membrane 23 when the backwash was carried out a kind of brown turbid and easily precipitated solution was observed to flush out and the manganese sand in filter column became clean gradually and returned to its original color finally 3 2 redox potential of effluent for the aqueous solution the graph of ph against electrochemical potential as referred to the standard hydrogen electrode eh i e e ph pourbaix diagram has been commonly used to investigate the chemistry of inorganic substances it can provide an important graphical link between the thermodynamic calculations of potential ph equilibrium constant concentration and changes in gibbs energy and experimentally observed behavior of species in aqueous solutions 24 since fig 2 has shown the significant role of manganese sand filter for the oxidation of both iron and manganese the pourbaix diagram was then presented to know more about the composition of oxides and further the influence of membrane fouling as shown in fig 3 the ph of all water samples was ranged from 6 3 7 and there was an overall upward trend as time continued fig 3a the redox potential of the effluent increased a little at 0 24 v after the aeration process indicating that the oxidation of iron depended highly on ph and the increase of water ph together with the dissolved oxygen allowed the 70 oxidation of iron as shown in fig 2 a by contrast it increased significantly to 0 43 v after the manganese sand filter and membrane module indicating the water was remarkably oxidized at the stage of manganese sand filter fig 3b the e ph of four water samples on pourbaix diagram for iron and manganese was then shown in fig 4 it displayed the difference between water soluble fe2 compounds and generally water insoluble fe3 compounds and the difference between water soluble mn2 compounds and generally water insoluble mn3 and mn4 compounds under different conditions as shown in fig 4 the water effluents were remarkably oxidized after the manganese sand filter and the redox potential of effluents remained almost the same level with the slight increase of ph as shown in fig 5 the calculated average value of effluent after manganese sand filter and membrane module were similar in pourbaix diagram for iron and manganese as the increase of ph and redox potential the species of the soluble divalent ferrous ii and manganese ii ions were transformed into insoluble ferric iii and manganic iv ions the predominance region forms of which were fe2o3 h2o and mn2o3 respectively it indicated that ferrous ions and manganous ions can be completely oxidized into predominates in normal conditions and then be rejected by filter in this work the mn2 removal in this work was found consistent with the work that the presence of the ferric hydroxide which occurred by oxidation of fe2 helped to mitigate fouling and enhanced the rejection of mn2 by up to by 90 by developing a secondary filtration layer on membrane surface which had been considered as a challenge in drinking water treatment plants 25 3 3 characterization of manganese sand since the significant increase of redox potential was found at the manganese sand filter stage the upper part of manganese sand ums and lower part of manganese sand lms in manganese sand filter were extracted for comparison with the virgin manganese sand vms as shown in fig 6 it was clearly that a certain thickness of coatings were generated upon the surface of manganese sand which was called manganese sand coated film in this work compared to the relatively homogeneous and loose porous structure on vms surface fig 6a more needle crystals and heterogeneous pores were clearly seen on the surface of ums fig 6b and a more dense structure with large amount of unshaped particulates inclusion were found in the sheet on the surface of lms fig 6c in the cross section views vms showed uniform texture with smooth border fig 6d obviously there were certain thickness of coatings about 100 μm and 50 μm respectively generated on the surface of ums and lms therefore the manganese sand coatings were produced during the process of fe ii and mn ii removal when groundwater flowed through the manganese sand filter in order to study the variety of elements feature of ums coated film and lms coated film the edx analysis was further conducted to obtain the weight proportion corresponding to atomic proportion of c o si k fe mn as shown in fig 6 the fe and mn were 21 86 wt 0 23 wt for the upper part of manganese sand ums as shown in fig 6h and 13 97 wt 19 31 wt for the lower part of manganese sand lms as shown in fig 6i compared with that were 13 77 wt 4 87 wt for the virgin manganese sand as shown in fig 6g it demonstrated that ums was almost the iron coated film containing high percentage of fe whereas the lms was of significantly higher percentage of mn showing clearly that the manganese coated film was formed the existing of iron oxide activated coating and manganese oxide activated coating was observed directly in this work as shown in fig 6e and fig 6f respectively which was consistent with those deduced in literatures 1 12 19 20 to verify that the upper and lower layer of manganese sand coated thin films are different from their composition the edx for the cross section of ums and lms with face scan and line scan was then characterized as shown in fig 7 the edx analysis spots of ums and lms were selected from the red frame marked on fig 6e and fig 6f respectively it was clearly shown the great difference of content distribution of iron and manganese between manganese sand itself and manganese sand coatings over the two sides of the red dotted line shown in face scan fig 7a 1 a 2 a 3 for ums and fig 7b 1 b 2 b 3 for lms the line of which was drawn at fig 7a 1 and fig 7b 1 as schematic line alongside the boundaries between manganese sand itself and manganese sand coatings of ums and lms respectively it depicted that in the cross section of ums the iron content of coating part below the red dotted line was higher than manganese sand itself part above the red dotted line whereas the manganese content of coating was far less than manganese sand itself by contrast lms showed the significantly higher manganese content to get more accurate evaluation of the content variety of iron and manganese over the boundaries of manganese sand and their coatings the line scan was applied to obtain semi quantitative data of iron and manganese intensity signal which was drawn as a curve graph fig 7a 4 a 5 a 6 for ums and fig 7b 4 b 5 b 6 for lms the line scan was consistent with the face scan mentioned above in terms of iron and manganese content more importantly with the gradual growth of manganese sand coatings the traces of iron and manganese oxidation were found in the form of fluctuations in curve as for ums large amounts of iron containing substances were found at early period followed by a relatively smooth process fig 7a 5 it was inferred that ums had experienced a stage of rapid oxidation to remove iron followed by a stage of stable oxidation meanwhile ums did not indicate the stage of removing manganese according to fig 7a 6 as shown in lms it went through a transition from an iron oxidation dominant period to the manganese oxidation dominant period reflecting the trend of decrease first and then the increase in the manganese intensity signal curve fig 7b 6 and vice versa for the iron intensity signal curve fig 7b 5 the evolution of iron and manganese content across the thickness of coatings indicated directly again the formation of an iron oxide activated coating and manganese oxide activated coating and their auto catalytic effect of the manganese sand coated film 3 4 characterization of membrane foulants to explore the contamination of membrane during the removal of fe2 and mn2 in this work fesem images and xrd spectra were further obtained as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively clearly a thick and dense structure of cake layer fig 8a was scoured from the hollow fiber membrane module by hydraulic backwash the needle crystal and unshaped fine particles were found in the portion morphology of membrane foulants fig 8b indicating a large amount of ferric oxide and manganic oxide were rejected by the membrane module as shown in fig 9 the comparison of xrd spectrum of the membrane foulants the ums coated film the lms coated film and vms verified their same composition of the fe mn oxides the sharp peaks 26 6 2θ 20 9 2θ and 50 1 2θ for quartz sio2 33 2 2θ 54 1 2θ and 49 5 2θ for hematite fe2o3 and the additional weak peaks 56 2θ 37 2θ and 66 8 2θ for akhtenskite mno2 were all found for those samples the well crystalline fe2o3 and amorphous crystals of mnox were clearly found in both fig 6b and fig 8b indicating again that the adoption of ultrafiltration membrane can not only effectively reject the turbidity of the effluents fig 2c but also reduce the membrane fouling due to the retention of iron and manganese oxides during the process of iron and manganese removal from groundwater 4 conclusions in summary the process of aeration manganese sand filter ultrafiltration amu was proposed for removal of iron and manganese from groundwater and reduction of membrane fouling and the findings are listed as following 1 the amu process produced an effective ferrous ions and manganous ions removal from the groundwater the removal efficiency of fe2 and mg2 achieved 100 and 90 after manganese sand filter respectively the oxidation of iron mainly occurs over aeration process whereas the oxidation of manganese mainly occurs over manganese sand filter 2 a significant increase of redox potential about 2 mv had been observed for water samples after manganese sand filter showing a remarkable promotion of oxidizing capacity and species change of iron and manganese in manganese sand filter 3 the generation of manganese sand coated film and needle crystals were found on the manganese sand filter further showing their fully oxidation and the retention of those pre oxides 4 the well crystalline fe2o3 and amorphous crystals mnox were further found in both the membrane foulants and manganese coated film verified again the reduction of membrane fouling in the proposed amu process our study shows not only the effective removal of iron and manganese ions from the groundwater for the integrated process of amu but also the direct evidence for existence of manganese sand coated films that allow the increase of redox potential of water and the following reduction of membrane fouling due to the formation and retention of iron and manganese oxides thus to propel the engineering

during the peak solar intensity on 5 4 2018 the daily average brackish water and basin temperatures rose by 7 and 15 in each instance for the aiss when compared to the piss which lacked the stc when using the stc water heater in aiss inlet brackish water was preheated and it augments the water temperature 3 2 hourly changes in ehtc and ss production capability for the piss and aiss the change in

countries there is an increased need for desalination and other purification processes in order to purify the existing brackish and impure water in the gulf and african nations desalination of sea water has been done extensively as they have very less fresh water sources for use the current model can also be used for effective desalination on a smaller scale to produce potable water which can fulfill the daily needs in countries closer to the equator like vietnam latitude 14 05 n similar results will be obtained like the current study chennai latitude 13 08 n due to similar amount of solar radiation obtained in the mena middle east and north africa countries latitude 29 2985 n due to its location on the tropic of cancer and the earth s inclination towards the sun this region receives greater sunlight since the solar intensity and the on shine hours are greater the results can be further enhanced the set up should be installed at an inclination angle equal to the latitude of the place this system can also be incorporated in a small household for fulfilling the water and electricity needs the maximum power obtained from a single system was calculated to be 150 w two of such systems are enough to run two fans and tube lights this can be used during emergency power outages and in places with irregular electricity supply in order to produce 1 kw of power from the current system a total of 7 units will be required a single unit of the piss and aiss costs 253 63 and 289 15 respectively for obtaining the 1 kw power the costs of piss and aiss will be 1 775 41 and 2 024 05 respectively increased use of renewable sources of energy has been emphasized in developing countries like india the government also provides various kinds of incentives and subsidies for individuals in order to make the use of renewable energy more widespread the incentives are provided depending on the type of model created and the amount of power generated a subsidy of about 267 23 per kwp will

and that on 3 4 2018 was noted to be 820 w m2 10 w m2 the maximum hourly solar intensity was observed to be 1000 and 990 w m2 10 w m2 on 1 4 2018 and 3 4 2018 in each instance the highest atmospheric temperature of 41 c 1 c and a daily average atmospheric temperature of 37 c 1 c were obtained on 1 4 2018 the glass basin and brackish water temperatures rose till 13 00 h after which it fell with a decrease in solar radiation the glass basin and brackish water temperature reached a maximum value of 49 68 and 67 c 1 c in each instance on 1 4 2018 the daily average solar intensity on 5 4 2018 was recorded to be 807 w m2 and that on 8 4 2018 was noted to be 799 w m2 10 w m2 the maximum hourly solar intensity was measured to be 1020 and 995 w m2 10 w m2 on 5 4 2018 and 8 4 2018 respectively the highest atmospheric temperature of 38 c 1 c and a daily average atmospheric temperature of 35 c 1 c were obtained on 5 4 2018 the glass basin and brackish water temperatures increase till 13 00 h and thereafter there is a decrease in solar radiation manokar et al 43 and sasikumar et al 44 the glass basin and brackish water temperature reached a maximum value of 46 80 and 72 c 1 c respectively during the peak solar intensity on 5 4 2018 the daily average brackish water and basin temperatures rose by 7 and 15 in each instance for the aiss when compared to the piss which lacked the stc when using the stc water heater in aiss inlet brackish water was preheated and it augments the water temperature 3 2 hourly changes in ehtc and ss production capability for the piss and aiss the change in ehtc and the drinkable water production capability of the aiss and piss are shown in fig 7 in common it is seen that the aiss shows greater ehtc values than the piss the highest ehtc value on 1 4 2018 for passive mode was calculated to be 65 wm 2 k 1 and that on 8 4 2018 for active mode was noted to be 73 wm 2 k 1 the aiss showed about 11 greater average ehtc values as compared to the piss which lacked the stc the incorporation of the stc in the aiss has also supported in augmenting the maximum yield per hour the maximum quantity of yield per hour at 12 p m on 1 4 2018 for passive mode was measured to be 0 8 kg 0 01 kg and that on 8 4 2018 for active mode was observed to be 1 3 kg 0 01 kg the maximum distilled water yield obtained per day from the piss was 4 33 kg 0 01 kg and that from the aiss was 8 3 0 01 kg the productivity of the aiss was found to be 47 06 greater as compared to the piss the temperature of the brackish water was enhanced up to 75 c by ss integrated with the stc the ehtc and drinkable water production capability of the aiss integrated with the stc were compared with the aiss integrated with the fpc 43 the highest ehtc value of the aiss integrated with the fpc was 59 2 wm 2 k 1 it is 13 8 wm 2 k 1 lesser as compared to the present study similarly maximum quantity of yield per day from the aiss integrated with the fpc was 7 5 kg it is 0 8 kg lesser as compared to the present study the aiss with the stc has a higher surface area for receiving the solar energy input hence it improves the inlet temperature of the water the evaporation rate of the aiss was greater due to which the aiss produced augmented yield as compared to the piss 3 3 relative study between the productivity of various pv t solar stills a relative study on the amount of distillate yield from various hybrid pv t ss was done and noted in table 4 it is seen that kumar and tiwari 30 work produced the maximum yield of 6 10 kg m2 and manokar et al 34 work piss produced the minimum yield of 4 4 kg m2 the passive models usually produce lower yield as it has to depend entirely on the natural heating process with no enhancements techniques 44 the yield obtained in such a model is also low 3 7 kg day the ss incorporated with the fpc produced the highest yield of 7 5 kg h 43 the fpc in that model helped in additional heating of the water when it flows through the absorber tube which in turn helps in higher evaporation rate and enhanced yield al nimr and khaled 45 performed the research on a ss coupled with a finned condensing chamber for distillation at appropriate conditions the yield produced by the model was about 8 73 kg day al nimr and khaled 46 investigated the system performance by introducing a mathematical model the highest yield for the model was predicted to be 9 5 kg day al nimr and ammari 47 researched a novel hybrid pv distillation system and results obtained were in agreement with experimental and theoretical values this present research work with the stc water heater aiss produced maximum yield of 8 3 kg m2 4 water quality analysis table 5 shows the water sample analysis for bd and ad total hardness total dissolved salts ph electrical conductivity were the parameters selected for water quality analysis ahsan et al 50 studied the lake water in which the ph before the test was 8 and after the test the ph was reduced to 5 72 which is slightly acidic while palpandi and prem 51 conducted their results using bore well water with a ph of 8 06 but managed to get a ph of 6 8 which is closer to the neutral level flendrig et al 52 used contaminated water which was more basic and was able to reduce the ph to 5 5 from 9 6 mashaly et al 53 performed their experiment using drainage water and sea water both of which were in slightly basic condition before the test and managed to reduce the ph making it more neutral in the present study brackish water with the ph of 8 7 was taken for the test after the desalination process the distilled water showed a neutral ph of 7 6 from the results it was identified that the fresh water extraction form the modified inclined ss is within the limit of epa standards ph 6 5 8 5 electrical conductivity 0 78 ds m and total hardness 500 ppm 36 5 practical applications of the current study pure water is the current requirement all over the world in most of the developing countries there is an increased need for desalination and other purification processes in order to purify the existing brackish and impure water in the gulf and african nations desalination of sea water has been done extensively as they have very less fresh water sources for use the current model can also be used for effective desalination on a smaller scale to produce potable water which can fulfill the daily needs in countries closer to the equator like vietnam latitude 14 05 n similar results will be obtained like the current study chennai latitude 13 08 n due to similar amount of solar radiation obtained in the mena middle east and north africa countries latitude 29 2985 n due to its location on the tropic of cancer and the earth s inclination towards the sun this region receives greater sunlight since the solar intensity and the on shine hours are greater the results can be further enhanced the set up should be installed at an inclination angle equal to the latitude of the place this system can also be incorporated in a small household for fulfilling the water and electricity needs the maximum power obtained from a single system was calculated to be 150 w two of such systems are enough to run two fans and tube lights this can be used during emergency power outages and in places with irregular electricity supply in order to produce 1 kw of power from the current system a total of 7 units will be required a single unit of the piss and aiss costs 253 63 and 289 15 respectively for obtaining the 1 kw power the costs of piss and aiss will be 1 775 41 and 2 024 05 respectively increased use of renewable sources of energy has been emphasized in developing countries like india the government also provides various kinds of incentives and subsidies for individuals in order to make the use of renewable energy more widespread the incentives are provided depending on the type of model created and the amount of power generated a subsidy of about 267 23 per kwp will be given to individuals for residential purposes the highest loan amount provided by the government to the individuals for such projects is about 13 361 57 54 6 conclusions this research is about the inclined solar still incorporated with the stc unit in order to achieve enhanced potable water yield during the summer climate of india the maximum brackish water temperature from the piss is 67 c and from the aiss is 72 c the integration of the stc with piss enhances the daily average brackish water temperature by 7 as compared to the piss the daily average ehtc of the piss is 45 78 wm 2 k 1 and for aiss is 58 98 wm 2 k 1 the integration of the stc with the piss augments the brackish water temperature ehtc and freshwater production the yield from the aiss is enhanced by 47 06 as compared to the piss the hardness of the brackish water before and after purification is 1395 and 110 ppm declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest
